Chinacondemned “unilateral bullying”practices and the EU said it was drawing up countermeasures.While Trump timed hisWednesday evening Rose Garden addressto avoid live tickers of crashing stock markets, that fate arrived when Asian exchanges opened hours later.Graph showing falls in global stock exchangesDrawing comparisons with the market crashes at the height of the coronavirus pandemic and the 2008 financial collapse, the sell-off swept the globe, sending exchanges plunging in Asia and Europe. The UK’sFTSE100 index of blue-chip companies closed the day down 133 points, or 1.5%, to 8,474 after suffering its worst day since August.All three main US stock markets were down at the end of trading in their worst day since June 2020, during the Covid pandemic. The tech-heavyNasdaqfell 5.97%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow dropped 4.8% and 3.9%, respectively. Apple and Nvidia, two of the US’s largest companies by market value, lost a combined $470bn in value by midday.Libby Cantrill, the head of US public policy at Pimco, one of the world’s largest bond fund managers, said investors were growing increasingly concerned as Trump appeared to be unwilling to soften his stance in the face of market turmoil, although hope remained that he would ultimately strike deals with US trading partners.“There is likely a limit to how much pain he and his administration are willing to endure in order to rebalance the economy, but when that is or what that looks like remains to be seen,” she said.“For now, we should assume that his pain tolerance is pretty high and that tariffs stick around for a while.”The US dollar hit a six-month low, falling 2.2% on Thursday morning, amid a growing loss of confidence in a currency previously considered the safest in the world for most of the past century.Graph showing how the dollar has fallenWarning clients to beware a “dollar confidence crisis”, George Saravelos, the head of foreign exchange research at Deutsche Bank, said: “The safe-haven properties of the dollar are being eroded.”The heaviest falls in share prices on Thursday were reserved for US companies with complex international supply chains stretching into the countries that Trump is targeting with billions of dollars in fresh border taxes.Apple, which makes most of its iPhones, tablets and other devices for the US market in China, was down 9.5% at close of trading, and there were steep declines for other large multinationals including Microsoft, Nvidia, Dell and HP.Commodities fell sharply, including a 7% plunge in oil prices, reflecting growing concerns over the global economic outlook.Chart showing fall in price of brent crudeSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump said: “I think it’s going very well. It was an operation like when a patient gets operated on and it’s a big thing. I said this would be exactly the way it is … We’ve never seen anything like it. The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom.”Trump later said: “Every country is calling us. That’s the beauty of what we do. If we would have asked these countries to do us a favour they would have said no. Now they will do anything for us.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vietnam faces 46% tariffs and Myanmar,reeling from a devastating earthquakeand years of civil war after a 2021 military coup, was hit with 44%.Analysts warned that garment and sports shoe makers, which rely heavily on production in south-east Asia, face rising costs, which will push up prices for consumers around the globe. The share prices of Nike, Adidas and Puma all fell steeply.Analysts said Trump’s measures would raise the average tariff, or border tax, charged by the US to the highest level since 1933, in a development that threatened to sink the US into recession while increasing living costs for consumers.List of all Trump’s tariffsTrump’s plans involve imposing a 10% tariff on all US trading partners from just after midnight on 5 April, before additional higher tariffs of up to 50% are imposed on countries including China, Vietnam and the EU.The non-partisan Tax Foundation thinktank said it estimated the plan would represent a “$1.8tn tax hike” for US consumers, which would cause imports to fall by more than a quarter, or $900bn, in 2025.While the measures will hit the US hard, researchers at the consultancy OxfordEconomicssaid they could sink global economic growth to the lowest annual rate since the 2008 financial crisis, barring the height of the Covid pandemic.Countries scrambled to assess the fallout and whether to retaliate. The UK, which was hit with the lowest level of 10% tariffs, suggestedit may retaliate even as it tries to strike a deal with Washington.It published a417-page listof US products on which it could impose tariffs, including meat, fish and dairy products, whiskey and rum, clothing, motorcycles and musical instruments.The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, told MPs that ministers were still pursuing an economic deal with the US as the priority but “we do reserve the right to take any action we deem necessary if a deal is not secured”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said Trump’s decision to impose tariffs of 20% on EU goods was“brutal and unfounded”, while Germany’s outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, called it “fundamentally wrong”.Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the “protectionist” tariffs ran “contrary to the interests of millions of citizens on this side of the Atlantic and in the US”.The EU is thought to be preparing retaliatory tariffs on US consumer and industrial goods – likely to include emblematic products such as orange juice, blue jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes – to be announced in mid-April,in response to steel and aluminium tariffspreviously announced by Trump.Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyTrump tariffsStock marketsEconomicsTrade policyUS politicsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 6%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow dropped 4.8% and 3.9%, respectively. Apple and Nvidia, two of the US’s largest companies by market value, had lost a combined $470bn in value by midday.GraphMeanwhile, the US dollar hit a six-month low, going down at least 2.2% on Thursday morning compared with other major currencies, and oil prices sank on fears of a global slowdown.Though the US stock market has been used to tumultuous mornings over the last few weeks, US stock futures – an indication of the market’s likely direction – had plummeted after the announcement. Hours later, Japan’s Nikkei index slumped to an eight-month low and was followed by falls in stock markets in London and across Europe.GraphThe White House drafted up a list of countries, including some of its largest trade partners and onesuninhabitedby humans, that will be receiving reciprocal tariffs. Many economies, including the EU, China, Japan and Taiwan, will see new tariffs above 20%.The 10% baseline tariff will go into effect on 5 April, while the reciprocal tariffs will begin on 9 April, according to theWhite House.“The markets are going to boom,” Trump told reporters at the White House as he left for Florida for the weekend. “I think it’s going very well.”Economists have for monthswarnedthat high tariffs are a major risk to the US economy, pushing prices up for consumers on everything from cars to wine along with destabilizing the US’s role in the global economy.But that didn’t stop Trump from taking a celebratory tone at the event he dubbed “liberation day”. Trump tried to paint the tariffs as the start of “the golden age of America”.“We are going to start being smart and we’re going to start being very wealthy again,” Trump said.On Thursday, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, defended the move. “The president is not going to back off what he announced yesterday. He is not going to back off,” he told CNN.Multiple major American business groups have spoken out against the tariffs, including the Business Roundtable, a consortium of leaders of major US companies including JP Morgan, Apple and IBM, which called on the White House to “swiftly reach agreements” and remove the tariffs.“Universal tariffs ranging from 10-50% run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters,” the Business Roundtable said in a statement. “Damage to theUS economywill increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Apollreleased on Wednesday before Trump’s announcement found that just 28% of Americans believe tariffs help the economy, while 58% believe the impacts will be damaging.But in his speech yesterday, Trump appeared ready to be defiant against any criticism.“In the coming days, there will be complaints from the globalists and the outsources and special interests and the fake news,” he said. “This will be an entirely different country in a short period of time. It’ll be something the whole world will be talking about.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsStock marketsUS economyDonald TrumpTrump administrationTariffsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

If Congress failed to give its consent within that timeframe, all new tariffs on imports would expire. The legislation would also allow Congress to terminate tariffs at any time through a resolution of disapproval.Grassley was not among the four Republican senators who voted to approve a Democratic-led resolution that would nullify the national emergency Trump used to justify 25% tariffs on Canadian imports, which passed shortly after the president’s so-called “liberation day” tariff announcement on Wednesday.Yet support from Grassley, third in line to the presidency as the president pro tempore of the Senate, is a sign of the deep unease manyRepublicanshave with the president’s efforts to remake global trade.“For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,” Grassley said in a statement, adding that the proposed measure was a way to “reassert Congress’ constitutional role and ensure Congress has a voice in trade policy”.The legislation is modeled after the War Powers Act, passed in 1973, that seeks to limit the president’s ability to engage US troops into “hostilities” without Congressional approval.“Trade wars can be as devastating, which is why the Founding Fathers gave Congress the clear constitutional authority over war and trade,” Cantwell said in a statement.“Arbitrary tariffs, particularly on our allies, damage US export opportunities and raise prices for American consumers and businesses. “As representatives of the American people, Congress has a duty to stop actions that will cause them harm.”In a Rose Garden ceremony on Wednesday, Trump announced that the US would impose a major round of new tariffs on many of its largest trade partners and onesuninhabitedby humans. The tariffs unleashed chaos across world financial markets, as economists warned that the levies would raise prices for consumers and businesses.Several countries threatened counter-measures as they digested Trump’s trade war escalation.Explore more on these topicsUS SenateRepublicansUS CongressUS politicsTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

While M&S is not considering withdrawing the sweets, tariffs could push up prices and make them less popular.The pink confectionery which sells more than 18m bags a year in the UK and is apparently enjoyed by celebrities includingAdeleand Olivia Rodrigo, went on sale in the US on 30 March both in Target stores across the US and on its website in what was described as Percy’s “biggest journey to date”.The US president on Wednesday announced sweeping tariffs on imports, including a10% tariff on those coming from the UK.2:27Trump announces sweeping new tariffs, upending decades of US trade policy – videoNorman added that M&S was also rethinking plans for its Christmas TV campaign as new rules on advertising foods high in fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) come in to force in the UK.Swizzels agrees to M&S demand to redesign its rival sweet to Percy PigRead moreThe government announced last year that junk food adverts would be banned before 9pm on TV from October 2025, as part of efforts to tackle obesity in children.“It probably means we can’t run our Christmas ad,” Norman told the conference in London “You won’t be able to run an ad that includes Christmas pudding, your mince pies or sausages.”The former Conservative MP said retailers faced a wave of new regulations this year including new rules on packaging and labour rights. “M&S will manage with everything as we are a growing business with no debt,” Norman said, adding that “for the little guy these things become really damaging” and it was “going to be tough for some people”.He said it was “pretty clear that we can’t run a traditional food ad during the day and we probably can’t run a YouTube ad during the day”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How it all plays out remains unclear.Prices in the UKView image in fullscreenFood prices in the UK could rise again.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAAs it stands, the UK has not announced any retaliatory tariffs, so no US imports will leap in price. But if the government does decide to respond in kind, the prices of goods we buy in from the US could go up. The tariffs will be paid by the importing company but could be passed on to consumers (this becomes more likely where there is not a big profit margin). Such a situation would lead to inflation.Importers could decide to source products from countries without tariffs instead, which might hold down inflation. If there is a surplus of that stock – perhaps, the country supplying the goods also attracts US tariffs and so stops selling exporting there – prices could even come down.Part of the US trade complaint concerns the VAT applied in the UK to imported goods. However, VAT is not a tariff – it is charged ongoods and servicesregardless of where they were produced – and is unlikely to be changed by the government as a result of Trump’s announcement. If it was, US goods would have an advantage over domestically produced items. (Tax Policy Associates has a good explanationof how it works in a supply chain.)Pensions and investmentsView image in fullscreenFalls in the stock market could have a big impact on your pension pot, especially if you need to cash them in.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PAThe falls in stock markets around the world could have a big impact on your finances. Even if you do not invest in funds or stocks directly, your pension is likely to hold some of these assets unless you are very close to retirement.Many UK investors hold money in US shares – either directly or via funds – and will already have seen a fall in the value of their US investments. Other stock markets have dropped as trading began on Thursday morning, including the UK’s.Further falls will reduce the value of any investments you hold, which will be bad news if you need to cash them in before the markets have a chance to recover.If you are paying into a regular investment plan that buys into a fund, the money you are putting into the market now will buy you more units in the fund while the market is down. If and when there is a recovery, your monthly investment will be worth more than when the market is riding high.Tom Stevenson, an investment director at the fund management company Fidelity International, said: “It may sound counterintuitive but staying invested throughout times of volatility is the best strategy. When markets hit rocky waters, jumping in and out should be avoided, otherwise you run the risk of missing out on unexpected opportunities that might arise from market corrections.”Stevenson said it was “incredibly difficult” to predict how the stock market was going to behave. “Taking a long-term approach and remaining invested in spite of highs or lows is more likely to get you the outcome you want.”MortgagesView image in fullscreenInflation could fuel rises in interest rates, which is bad news for homeowners and their mortgages.Photograph: Maureen McLean/Rex/ShutterstockLast month, when theBank of England announced it was holding interest rates at 4.5%it said it thought rates were “on a gradually declining path”, but that there was “a lot of economic uncertainty at the moment”. That uncertainty included the threat of tariffs.Previously, forecasters had anticipated four rate cuts this year. We have seen one so far.An economic slowdown could force the Bank to consider cutting rates more quickly than had been expected as a way to stimulate the UK economy. This morning, the money markets had moved to suggest a cut in May is priced in. Mortgage rates are likely to fall if the markets anticipate more cuts over the next couple of years.JobsView image in fullscreenIndustries that export a lot to the US, such as carmakers, could take a big hit, putting jobs at risk.Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAThe biggest threat from tariffs could be to jobs, with industries that export a lot to the US affected as American consumers turn to products produced domestically, where they can.Carmakers are likely to be hit the hardest as they face a higher tariff of 25%. The IPPR thinktank has suggestedmore than 25,000 direct jobs in the car manufacturing industry could be at riskas exports to the US fall, with employees at Jaguar Land Rover and the Cowley Mini factory considered most vulnerable.There are rules on redundancies that companies must follow. To qualify for statutory redundancy pay you need to have been with your employer for at least two years.Energy billsView image in fullscreenThe US supplied 17% of Britain’s gas imports last year, according to UK government figures.Photograph: Niklas Halle’n/AFP/Getty ImagesTrump’s tariffs could also mean higher energy bills for British households, according to analysts at Aurora Energy Research.Anise Ganbold, the head of global energy markets research at Aurora, said: “Tariffs mean the US produces more goods at home, demanding more energy, and leaving less oil and gas available to export to Europe.”The US became the UK’s largest supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2022, overtaking Qatar, and supplied 17% of Britain’s gas imports last year, according to UK government figures. A slowdown in exports could mean fewer cargoes for the UK, leading to higher gas market prices, which would feed through to household energy bills.Jacob Mandel, a researcher at Aurora, said: “UK energy prices will be heavily affected by what Starmer decides to do in response to Trump’s tariffs. If the UK imposes retaliatory tariffs without an exception for energy, that will have a direct impact on UK energy prices because of the UK’s heavy reliance on US LNG.”TableExplore more on these topicsTariffsInflationInterest ratesMortgagesInvestmentsEconomicsPropertyexplainersShareReuse this content"

Very simple. Can’t get simpler than that.”Perhaps a bit too simple. The method used to calculate the most important numbers in international trade, politics and economics has left some of the world’s leading experts shocked.For each country, the White House looked up its trade in goods deficit for 2024, then divided that by the total value of imports. Trump, to be “kind”, said he would, however, offer a discount, so halved that figure. The calculation was even distilled into a formula.For example, take thefigures for China:Goods trade deficit: $291.9bnTotal goods imports: $438.9bnThose figures divided = 0.67, or 67%And halved = 34%For countries without a large deficit, the White House applied a 10% baseline, ensuring tariffs would be applied regardless. This was the case for the UK, which theUS Census Bureaureckons had an almost-$12bn surplus in 2024.“[It is] quite an extraordinary calculation after months of work behind the scenes,” said Jim Reid, the global head of macro research at Deutsche Bank. “[It] didn’t add much confidence on there being an in-depth strategic implementation plan.”Tariff rates chartFor weeks, Washington had been talking about an in-depth policy exercise to establish figures based on a combination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, as it perceived them to be; including alleged “currency manipulation”, local laws, regulations, and taxes such as VAT.In itself that approach raised eyebrows with experts who said VAT was highly unusual to include; because it is a sales tax paid on domestically produced goods and foreign imports alike.However, the White House appears to have confirmed it took a simplistic approach to making this judgment:Reciprocal tariffs are calculated as the tariff rate necessary to balance bilateral trade deficits between the US and each of our trading partners. This calculation assumes that persistent trade deficits are due to a combination of tariff and non-tariff factors that prevent trade from balancing.There are multiple problems with this – not least that it vastly oversimplifies the drivers of trade deficits. Trade deficits occur when a country buys more than it sells abroad. The US has run a deficit persistently since the 1970s. Typically trade deficits balance over time, as they create downward pressure on a country’s currency (as the result of demand for foreign currency, to buy imported goods, outstrips demand for domestic currency).However, sitting atop the global reserve currency – used throughout the global financial system for payments and international trade – the US has managed to run larger trade deficits than other nations would be able to.Perilous and chaotic, Trump’s ‘liberation day’ endangers the world’s broken economy – and him | Martin KettleRead moreAnother part of the reason is US goods are too expensive for consumers in developing economies to buy – helping to explain some of the particularly large trade deficits – and new tariffs – for poorer countries.Adam Tooze, an economic historian at Columbia University in the US, said there were“grotesque” policies for south-east Asian countries, including a 49% Cambodian tariff, and rates of 48% for Laos and 46% for Vietnam.“This is not because they discriminate viciously against American exports, but because they are relatively poor. The US does not make a lot of goods that are relevant for them to import,” he said.Vietnam in particular has become part of the global supply chain for major manufacturers, including US tech and clothing companies such as Nike, Intel, and Apple.Lesotho, the tiny southern African country, one of the poorest in the world, is another odd example, facing a tariff of 50%. Among its main exports to the US are diamonds and clothes – demonstrating how links around the world for rare minerals are important for the US economy, but also how the US sought to boost development in African nations in recent years – with policies to encourage manufacturing by companies including Levi Strauss and Wrangler.However, Trump, with his “America First” strategy has upended decades of attempts by successive US administrations to exert global economic influence, in an earthquake for the global economy.“This is not serious trade policy or grand strategy,” said Tooze. “The boss hates trade deficits and his team of willing sycophants came up with a formula, however idiotic, that ticked the box.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEconomicsDonald TrumpTariffsInternational tradeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Here are some initial key pointsTrump tariff reaction – live updatesGraham RussellThu 3 Apr 2025 02.02 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 12.41 EDTShareCountries across the world are racing to absorb the new way of doing business with the US, afterDonald Trump unveiled tailored tariffsthat looks set to ignite a global trade war.Trump has made clear the goals he wants to accomplish through the tariffs: bring manufacturing back to the US; respond to unfair trade policies from other countries; increase tax revenue; and incentivise crackdowns on migration and drug trafficking.However, the EU and Chinahave promised countermeasures, while South Korea has vowed an “all-out” response. The damage done at a political level withallies such as the UKmay also carry its own cost, as billions are wiped off economic growth.Here are some early points to note in the wake of Wednesday’s wideranging announcement:1.Firms are bracing for what ‘liberation’ meansThe US president sold the idea of global tariffs with a celebratory air, making good on his campaign trail promise toliberate the nation from higher prices.The president has claimed “prices are way down” since his return to office but anyone who has visited a grocery store in that time might feel differently.And US firms are apprehensive about the wider effect of this move: higher costs, they warn, will be passed on to their customers. “What we have heard from business of all sizes, across all industries, from around the country is that these broad tariffs are a tax increase that will raise prices for American consumers and hurt the economy,” said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, the corporate lobby group.2.The China link?China has been hit particularly hard by the new tariffs, which take the total levy on Chinese imports to over 50%, as well as struggling nations in South-east Asia, including war-torn and earthquake-hit Myanmar.One theory being put forward is thatcountries linked to sizeable Chinese investments are being targeted. Dr Siwage Dharma Negara, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said: “The [Trump] administration thinks is that by targeting these countries they can target Chinese investment in countries like Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Indonesia. By targeting their products maybe it will affect Chinese exports and the economy,” he said.“The real target is China but the real impact on those countries will be quite significant because this investment creates jobs and export revenue.”The tariffs comes as many countries in South-east Asia are alreadygrappling with the fallout from the cuts to USAid, which provides humanitarian assistance to a region vulnerable to natural disasters and support for pro-democracy activists battling repressive regimes.3.Key trade partners Canada and Mexico are spared – but will still feel the painCanada and Mexico have been exempted from the latest round of tariffs, but, as prime minister Mark Carney and business leaders reminded everyone, 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, as well as on automobiles,came into effect hours after Wednesday’s announcement.Carney warned that while Trump had preserved key elements of the bilateral relationship, the global tariffs announced earlier in the day “fundamentally change the international trading system”.The two countries have been hit by previously declared 25% tariffs on many goods over border control and fentanyl trafficking issues, the White House said in a fact sheet.Mexico president Claudia Sheinbaum said on Wednesday that her country would not pursue a “tit-for-tat on tariffs” but would rather announce a “comprehensive program” on Thursday.4.This is a big gambleTrump himself appears prepared for the announcement to spark a lot of turbulence in markets across the world, saying recently: “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big.” The universal tariffs come into effect on 5 April, and the reciprocal ones on 9 April, so countries around the world now have a very short space of time in which to choose their path. Some may try to cut a deal with Trump, others may respond with retaliatory tariffs, but acontinuing theme will be uncertainty.5.Absolutely nowhere is immuneHeard Island and McDonald Islands are some of themost remote places on Earth, inhabited only by an array of wildlife, yet they are among the “external territories” of Australia listed separately for a 10% tariff.Norfolk Island, which lies just of Australia’s east coast, was slugged with a tariff of 29% – or 19 percentage points higher than the rest of Australia, prompting Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese to say on Thursday: “I’m not quite sure that Norfolk Island, with respect to it, is a trade competitor with the giant economy of the United States, but that just shows and exemplifies the fact that nowhere on earth is safe from this.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsInternational tradeGlobal economyTariffsexplainersShareReuse this content"

First, all imported goods will be subject to a 10% universal tariff starting 5 April. Then, on 9 April, certain countries will see higher tariff rates – what Trump has deemed “reciprocal tariffs” in retaliation for tariffs the countries have placed on American exports.Keep in mind that tariffs are paid by American companies that are importing goods such as wine from Europe or microchips from Taiwan.Map of the world, with different countries in varying shades of pinkSome of the highest tariffs will be put on imports from Asian countries, including China, India, South Korea and Japan. EU exports will also have a 20% tariff.Chart with x and y axis covered in red dotsHow did the White House calculate its reciprocal tariffs? The administrationsaidthat it looked at the trade deficit between the US and a specific country as a percentage, and then considered that to be a tariff. So, for example, the value of US goods that are exported to China are 67% of the value of the Chinese goods that are imported into the US.The White House calls this definition a “tariff” placed on American goods, though a deficit and a tariff are not the same thing.It then halved the “tariff” and used that percentage to represent the new levy that the US would place on goods from that country.A list of every country, delineated by “New US tariffs, %” and, in quotes, ‘Tariffs charged to the USA’Canada and Mexico are notably absent from the list, despite being targets of a proposed 25% tariff. The White House said that goods covered under an existing trade agreement between the two countries will continue to have no tariffs.Graph with blue dots arranged on lines that say Asia, Americas, Europe and OceaniaTargeting key trading partnersTrump and his economic advisers argue that the tariffs will strengthen US manufacturing while also lowering barriers other countries put on American goods. But the US has long been in a trade deficit, importing more goods than exporting.Graph with lines going above and below the x axisWhile increasing domestic manufacturing and relying less on foreign suppliers could strengthen the US economy in the long run, economists say that Trump’s tariffs are too aggressive and uncertain for them to actually encourage domestic investment. Instead, companies have said they will pass the cost of the tariffs on to consumers.Chart of countries on globe colored in shades of blueFear on Wall StreetMarkets immediately plummeted when exchanges started trading on Thursday morning, as Wall Street reacted to the new levies.Wall Street has been slumping for the last month as Trump introduced new tariffs and teased the ones he announced on Wednesday. All three exchanges went into correction territory in March, meaning that the indexes fell more than 10% from their recent peaks.Jagged line graphThe tariffs have also hit stock markets abroad. The UK’s FTSE 100 saw its worst day since August 2024, while markets in Japan, Hong Kong and Germany also tumbled.Leaders around the world expressed shock and frustration over the new tariffs. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the tariffs “a major blow to the world economy”.“The global economy will massively suffer,” she said Thursday. “Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences will be dire.”Jagged overlapping line graphThe new tariffs have also made the US dollar fall in value in relation to other major currencies.Jagged line graphThe strength of the US dollar is an important measure of how the US economy is seen by investors, relative to other economies. That the dollar has been falling shows that investors see instability in the US economy that is likely to last.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS foreign policyUS domestic policyDonald TrumpTariffsUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She said that in 2021, South Yorkshire police and West Midlands police, which was brought in after the disaster to investigate, agreed a settlement with families and survivors formisfeasance in a public office, based on a claim that the forces perpetrated a cover-up.“It feels like a cover-up of a cover-up,” Brookes said.In a letter notifying bereaved families of its findings, the IOPC did find Duckenfield and three other senior officers culpable of gross misconduct for failures at the semi-final. Duckenfield was also found to have committed gross misconduct for the lie he told at 3.15pm as people were dying, falsely telling his senior officer, the assistant chief constable Walter Jackson, and football officials thatLiverpoolsupporters had forced open an exit gate.In fact Duckenfield had himself ordered the gate to be opened, to relieve a crush outside the Leppings Lane end turnstiles. After an independent police investigation for the IOPC termed Operation Resolve, 11 separate elements of gross misconduct by Duckenfield were found, including for ordering the opening of the gate, and failing to safely direct the people who came through it.Duckenfield did not order the closure of a tunnel leading to crowded central “pens” on the terrace, and the lethal crush developed after people who came through the exit gate went into those pens, rather than to the sides.Jackson was found culpable of gross misconduct for failures of planning and his response to the disaster; the former superintendent Roger Marshall for crowd management outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles and for asking Duckenfield to open the exit gate; and gross misconduct was also found by the former superintendent Bernard Murray, Duckenfield’s second-in-command in the police control room.Duckenfield was prosecuted for gross negligence manslaughter after the inquest verdict;he was acquitted in 2019.The IOPC said in the letter it had found no case to answer against any senior South Yorkshire police officers who were investigated for whether they gave inaccurate, false or deliberately misleading evidence or “irrelevant criticism of fans’ behaviour” after the disaster.Senior officers were also cleared over the instruction given to officers not to write their accounts of the day in their official police notebooks, and a subsequent process of amending the accounts made by officers. One officer, the former detective chief inspector Alan Foster, was found culpable of gross misconduct, after an investigation into whether senior officers put “undue pressure” on some other officers who refused to make alterations to their original accounts.A complaint was upheld against one officer on duty in the control box, the former constable Trevor Bichard. He was found to have deleted from the evidence provided to the 1989 inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor a log entry which recorded that at 2.55pm an officer had requested the tunnel leading to the central pens be closed. Mervyn Jones, the then assistant chief constable ofWest Midlandspolice, was also found culpable of gross misconduct for instructing the deletion of “policy files”, and retaining policy books “in his personal possession” after he retired.No officers will face misconduct proceedings,the IOPC has previously said, because they have all retired. The findings against officers, which include dozens more individual complaints currently being notified to families, are opinions of the IOPC.The IOPC has explained of its findings: “Like the [2012] Hillsborough Independent Panel report and the inquests, we found no evidence to support police accounts to the media, the Taylor inquiry and both sets of inquests, which suggested that the behaviour of supporters caused or in any way contributed to the disaster.”However, in a letter to families last month, the watchdog said that while South Yorkshire police did seek to “deflect the blame from themselves”, with no duty of candour required the force “was entitled, within the law at the time, to present its ‘best case’ and be selective with the evidence it presented”.At Labour’s conference in Liverpool in September, Keir Starmer promised to introduce the Hillsborough law by this month’s 36th anniversary of the disaster, but the deadline will be missed, as families have argued that the proposals do not deliver the required duty of candour. Starmer cancelled a visit to Liverpool last week where he was due to announce the new law to families.Charlotte Hennessy, who was six when her father, Jimmy, 29, was unlawfully killed at Hillsborough, said she was “frustrated and very disappointed” after learning of the delay.“In my opinion, the prime minister has used the deaths of the 97, their anniversary and the Hillsborough law, to gain himself votes,” she said. “There just seems to be this continual pattern, where he says things and then he takes them back. And to do that on the back of a Hillsborough anniversary – I’m appalled by it.”Starmer’s spokesperson said: “We remain fully committed to bringing in a Hillsborough law, which will include a legal duty of candour for public servants and criminal sanctions for those who refuse to comply. We’re working on the bill at pace, and we’ll set out next steps shortly.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterLiverpoolIndependent Office for Police ConductSouth YorkshireWest MidlandsPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

His two Red Crescent colleagues sitting in the front were killed but he survived by throwing himself to the floor of the vehicle.The Gaza paramedic killings: a visual timelineRead more“The door opened, and there they were – Israeli special forces in military uniforms, armed with rifles, green lasers and night-vision goggles,” Abed told the Guardian. “They dragged me out of the ambulance, keeping me face down to avoid seeing what had happened to my colleagues.”He was beaten, detained with his hands tied and made to lie on the ground, from where he was able to see some of what happened as other friends and colleagues arrived on the scene in ambulances and fire trucks, each one running into a hail of gunfire. In all, eight Red Crescent ambulance crew members and paramedics, six civil defence rescue workers and a UN employee were killed. Their bodies were found alongside their crushed vehicles last weekend in a sandy pit that Abed watched the troops dig. Other witnesses have told the Guardian that some of the deadhad had their hands or feet tied.View image in fullscreenA bulldozer retrieving a crushed vehicle from the pit.Photograph: Ocha/Red CrescentA Red Crescent ambulance officer, Assad al-Nassara, remains unaccounted for, but Abed said he saw him alive and in Israeli detention in the vicinity of the killings. Nassara has not been seen since. So far, Abed is the only one to return alive and tell his story.He was volunteering on 23 March at the ambulance station at the British field hospital in al-Mawasi, a coastal camp for displaced people, when the call came in shortly after 4am from the emergency services dispatcher in Hashashin, an area of barren sandy dunes on the northern outskirts of Rafah. (The name means The Assassins). Abed jumped in the back of an ambulance that left immediately. His friend, Mostafa Khufaga, was driving, with another ambulance officer, Ezzedine Shaath, beside him.Under international pressure, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Thursday they were launching a formal investigation into the shootings. Until now, however, the IDF has denied any wrongdoing, claiming it had fired on vehicles “advancing suspiciously” without headlights or emergency signals. Abed said that account was blatantly false.“The ambulance’s lights were clearly on, and the Red Crescent logo was visible as we headed to the scene,” he said. The IDF has described the area as a war zone, but Abed said Hashashin was “a civilian area where daily life had been going on as usual, not a designated combat zone”.They had almost reached the site of the reported airstrike at 4.20am, when they came under fire.Map“From the moment the shooting began, I immediately took cover on the floor of the ambulance. I didn’t hear anything from my colleagues, except for the sounds of their last moments, hearing them take their last breath,” he said. “Suddenly, everything went quiet, the ambulance came to a stop, and the lights went out. The driver’s side door opened, and I heard voices speaking in Hebrew. Fear and panic overtook me, and I began reciting some quotes from the Qur’an.“I was completely stripped, left only in my underwear, and my hands were bound behind my back,” Abed recalled. “They threw me to the ground, and the interrogation began. I endured severe torture, including beatings, insults, threats of death, and suffocation when one soldier pressed a rifle against my neck. Another soldier held a dagger to my left shoulder. After a while, an officer arrived and ordered the soldiers to stop, calling them ‘crazy people’ who didn’t know how to communicate.”An elderly man and his son who had been going fishing before sunrise were also detained and bound and made to lie on the ground beside Abed.“During this time, I noticed a civil defence vehicle and another ambulance approaching. As they neared, both were met with intense gunfire from the Israeli forces that lasted for about five minutes. After the shooting stopped, I didn’t see anyone leave the vehicles,” he said.“About five minutes later, two ambulances arrived from the direction of Rafah on the road leading to the Red Crescent ambulance centre. I could only see the red lights of the ambulances and hear the sound of gunfire. Another five minutes passed and a third ambulance arrived from the direction of Khan Younis, the same direction we had come from. It stopped near our vehicle and was shot at as well, just like the others.“As the sun began to rise around 6am, the landscape around us became clearer,” Abed said. “Tanks, quadcopters and drones came. The area was completely surrounded, and a large Israeli bulldozer and excavator arrived. They began digging a massive hole and threw the ambulances and civil defence vehicle into it, burying them and covering the hole.“As for my colleagues, I don’t know their fate. I only saw Asaad, but I’m certain that the others were killed immediately after being shot,” he said.The bodies of Abed’s colleagues, Khufaga and Shaath, were dug up from the same pit last weekend, along with the remains of six other Red Crescent workers: Saleh Muamer, Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan – six Palestinian civil defence workers and an employee of the UN relief agency, Unrwa.Satellite image showing the convoy of vehicles and the area from where the bodies were exhumed.Satellite image showing the convoy of vehicles and the area from where the bodies were later exhumedThe IDF had claimed it had killed nine militants from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the incident, but no other bodies have been recovered from the mass grave, and Abed was adamant there were no militants travelling with the ambulances.Abed himself was held for several hours, sometimes in a hole dug in the ground, during which he was fully stripped, beaten again and interrogated about his past. He was later forced to help in the vetting and photographing of local people who were ordered to leave the area and go to al-Mawasi.“Some of the women were carrying their children who had been killed. One mother carried her child, who had been shot in the chest and killed. Another mother carried her daughter, who had also been shot in the chest. Another girl carried their sister, who had been shot in the foot, and many elderly people were among them. No one stopped the women and children,” he said.“Then I began directing the men, bringing five at a time to stand in front of the camera,” Abed said. “Some of them passed without incident, but others were taken, dressed in white, and placed in a large hole. I still don’t know what happened to them.”Abed was released in the evening. He was given back his watch and underwear, but not his identity card, paramedic uniform or shoes. He was told to walk towards al-Mawasi, and was eventually able to flag down a passing Red Crescent vehicle.He said he was still in pain from the beatings and described his state of mind as “shattered”.View image in fullscreenFunerals being held at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis for the killed Red Crescent workers.Photograph: APAImages/Rex/ShutterstockAbed has volunteered for the Red Crescent since he was 18 and worked in the ambulances since the start of the war.“We entered this field out of love, despite the dangers that surround it and the risk we face during missions,” he said. But the work was sliding rapidly from the dangerous to the lethal.“We no longer find it surprising when someone is killed. Anyone can be targeted as we are dealing with an occupying force that disregards international laws and treaties,” Abed said. “Every mission we go on feels like it might be the last.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

He questioned why Bafta had given him an award and speculated that it was a “box ticking exercise” because he was black and working class.Krishna Floyd added the question of Clarke’s contribution to cinema was “a separate thing”, adding that his alleged sexual misconduct was “above all of us”.Williams said the contents of the call, heard by Kale during the investigation, should have raised concerns that Krishna Floyd, a 2013 Bafta Breakthrough Brit, harboured “animosity” and “professional jealousy” towards the writer-producer of the Kidulthood trilogy.She replied: “I don’t think he [Krishna Floyd] expressed himself very well there. They are not comments I agree with.”She continued: “I don’t think James was professionally jealous of Mr Clarke. I think James had heard many concerns from women in the industry about Mr Clarke’s behaviour and so James did not like Mr Clarke very much … I think he felt Noel’s body of work did not merit the award he received.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsNoel ClarkeThe GuardianGuardian Media GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

Hegseth’s messages even included the phrase “clean on OPSEC” – operational security – implying he recognized the sensitivity of the information being shared.The former state department attorney Brian Finucane, who has extensive experience in counter-terrorism operations including strikes against Houthis,told the Guardianthe specificity of aircraft information suggested the information was classified, and that “in my experience, this kind of pre-operational detail would have been classified”.The inspector general’s evaluation will be conducted in Washington and at US Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida, with additional locations potentially coming as the investigation proceeds.Explore more on these topicsUS national securityPete HegsethTrump administrationUS militaryYemenUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Our ambition is to make rail the preferred mode of travel to Europe, and we know that high-speed rail can reduce carbon emissions by up to 96% compared with flying.”Sinclair said there was opportunity for growth on existing routes, as people were hoping to connect onwards in Paris or Brussels, adding that there was “significant generational demand” from younger people: “Growth will come our way more than aviation.”The scheme will cut up to 50% off certain charges paid by operators on the first year of new services – including any additional trains put on by the current sole operator,Eurostar– while overall track access charges could also be reduced if the high-speed line was used more fully, Sinclair said.The operator is charged about £7,600 on the track from London to Folkestone at present and there would be approximately a £2,000 reduction on a new route, with a smaller discount in the next two years.There could be an outlay of £40m-£60m from LSPH, although that sum would be a fraction of the revenues it could expect to earn from a growth in the number of services on the route.The rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, this week said Eurostar wasable to make room in its Temple Mills depotfor competitors hoping to start international rail services.Virgin Group said it meant “the last hurdle” had been cleared in itsambition to run trainsto France and beyond. Two other potential entrants are the Spanish firm Evolyn and British startup Gemini Trains.Getlink, the owner of Eurotunnel,is also pushing for new routesand competition to Eurostar.Sinclair said the combination of factors meant a “step-change” in the availability of trains to Europe was coming – including plans for redevelopment of parts of St Pancras and faster check-in and boarding, upping the capacity from about 2,000 passengers an hour to nearly 5,000.He said: “This is a system, and there are a lot of parties working to achieve this – and the government is very supportive. It wants economic growth, sustainable travel and better relationships with Europe, and we tick all of those boxes.”A spokesperson for Eurostar said: “Eurostar welcomes any incentives which enable more sustainable international travel and support our plans to run more services. Our ambitions are why we’re also investing in key international stations like St Pancras and the Temple Mills depot to create more space.”Explore more on these topicsTransportEurostarChannel TunnelnewsShareReuse this content"

Five world experts answerRead moreSome MPs have been pushing for further restrictions that go beyond harmful content – including onaccess to social media for those under 16, full bans on smartphones in schools or restrictions on social media algorithms that are able to train addictive content on young teenagers.In a paper Orben published this week withfour co-authors in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), they said bans and restrictions were unlikely to be effective – though they did advocate for children and teens to have phone-free spaces.“Bans and restrictions have been successfully used for public health issues such as smoking. But smoking is not comparable with smartphone and social media use because the harms from smoking are extensive, clear-cut and by far outweigh the benefits,” the paper said.“Prescribing abstinence from all technologies to protect against harms is unrealistic and potentially detrimental in a society where technology use is a practical necessity and confers various benefits, including information access and social support.”The paper said that there had been “increased public pressure to mitigate the potential harmful effects of smartphones and social media on health, wellbeing … academic performance, disruptive behaviours and bullying.”But it said the evidence suggested there were “no simple, one-size-fits-all answers” and that while most parents and policymakers were “primed to believe arguments that smartphones and social media are inherently harmful, the evidence about their overall effect on children is not clear-cut”.Bans on devices could “undermine children’s rights to technology design and education that will help them thrive as adults”, the academics warned.The paper acknowledged that for some more vulnerable children “access to certain digital content can result in grave harm” but said legislators should also acknowledge restricting access “can be harmful to other high risk populations”.The researchers did raise concern about “trending content” aimed at younger users to encourage recurrent use, saying those designs were “purposefully not supporting the development of healthy tech habits”.Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary,appointed Orben in January to lead further research into the effects of smartphones on children’s health and wellbeing. Orben, a leading academic in the field, said she did not herself advocate for specific policy positions. Her work has been cited by both opponents and proponents for bans, including by the Australian government, which hasbanned social media for under-16s.She told the Guardian: “Understanding the digital world’s impact on young people is complex and there are no simple solutions. The report my team is currently leading was commissioned by government to produce recommendations on the types of research which could help generate high-quality evidence, not to provide policy recommendations.”“As an independent researcher my role is to examine and communicate evidence clearly, not advocate specific policies. In the BMJ article, we highlighted the benefit of multiple approaches noting technology-free spaces are important but smartphone or social media bans are not a complete solution, as other areas such as digital literacy and platform safety are also important parts of the online safety picture.”Ministers have come under pressure in recent months to go further on smartphone use for teenagers, especially in the wake of the Netflix drama Adolescence which depicts a murder committed by a13-year-old in thrall to toxic “manosphere” content online.The Labour MP Josh MacAlister was forced to drop plans in a private member’s bill on restricting social media algorithms for teenagers when ministers opposed the plans.The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is reviewing her department’s guidelines on smartphone bans in schools, by looking at a small cohort of schools to see if the current rules are working effectively.The prime minister,Keir Starmer, convened a roundtable with campaigners and the makers of Adolescence in No 10 on Monday, where he suggested that it should be discussed more widely in schools. But he said there “isn’t one single policy lever to pull” when it came to addressing potential harms.The DSIT has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsSmartphonesChild protectionSocial mediaDigital mediaChildrenKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

They are closer to Myanmar than mainland India.New Delhi plans to invest at least $9bn (£6.7bn) to expand naval and airbases, troop accommodation, the port and the main city in the region.Dhaliwal said Polyakov kept blowing a whistle off the shore of North Sentinel Island for about an hour to attract the tribe’s attention before he went ashore.“He landed briefly for about five minutes, left the offerings on the shore, collected sand samples, and recorded a video before returning to his boat,” Dhaliwal said. “A review of his GoPro camera footage showed his entry and landing into the restricted North Sentinel Island.”Police said Polyakov was arrested late on Monday, about two days after he went ashore, and had visited the region twice in recent months.He first used an inflatable kayak in October 2024 but was stopped by hotel staff, police said on Thursday. Polyakov made another unsuccessful attempt during a visit in January 2025.This time Polyakov used another inflatable boat with a motor to travel the roughly 35 kilometres (22 miles) of open sea from the main archipelago.The Sentinelese, whose language and customs remain a mystery to outsiders, shun all contact and have a record of hostility to anyone who tries to get close.A photograph issued by the Indian coastguard and Survival International two decades ago showed a Sentinelese man aiming a bow and arrow at a passing helicopter.Indian authorities have prosecuted any locals who have aided attempts to enter the island and are trying to identify anyone who may have helped Polyakov.The Andamans are also home to the 400-strong Jarawa tribe, who activists say are also threatened by contact from outsiders. Tourists have previously bribed local officials in an attempt to spend time with the Jarawa.Explore more on these topicsIndiaIndigenous peoplesSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Some have been left bleeding and in at least one case requiring hospital treatment.Tall men in particular have reported being swooped at and clawed for more than a month, leading many to wear hats or even cycling helmets when outside. Villagers became more concerned when the birdattacked an 11-year-old boythis week, and someone reported it swooping at other children walking home from school.Steve Harris, 40, said he caught the hawk on Thursday after it followed him on his daily jog before landing in his garden.Determined to stop the attacks after weeks of being forced to wear a cycling helmet while out running, he had finally managed it, he said, by clambering on to his shed and throwing a cage over the bird. He had previously tried to lure it into a cage with some chicken, but without success.“I had just been out on a run. It was following me for a mile, hopping along all the telegraph poles,” he said. “It came into the garden, and I was holding the cage above my head. Eventually it sat in the shed, squawking at me.”View image in fullscreenSteve Harris with the cage he used to trap the bird.Photograph: Toby Shepheard/Story Picture AgencyHarris, a physiotherapist and father of two, said he hadn’t allowed his children to play in the garden for weeks because the bird would often perch in their tree. “We’re about to pick the kids up from school. They’re going to be delighted they can go into the garden.“It feels strange, a bit of a relief. We’ve all just wanted to get it caught. I think I’ll be able to keep my wallet in my pocket next time I go to the pub.”Paul Boyes, a gardener and handyman who was attacked twice by the bird, said: “I think the reaction for most people is that the guy that caught it should be given the freedom of the village.“Everybody’s over the moon that he hasn’t been shot,” he said, after the parish council, which had employed a falconer to try to capture it,said the bird might have to be euthanised.The village has been abuzz for weeks with discussion about the bird, which would sit brazenly on top of telegraph poles and rooftops, Boyes said, watching him as he worked in local gardens. He donned a fedora after the first attack, but a rumour that the bird had been caught several weeks ago led him to abandon it, after which he was attacked again.“It really did hurt when it hit you,” he said. “It comes up behind you, and its talons got me in the back of the head, and its other ones came round the front and got me on my forehead.” The frequency of attacks had increased to three a day or more recently, he said. “It was getting to the stage where, actually, this is getting really serious, so it’s fortunate he’s been caught.”Asked why villagers believed they had been targeted by the bird, he said: “Well, everybody’s a Google expert now, we’ve all Googled hawks and we all know everything about Harris hawks. There’s a theory that it has been building a nest and it’s fending off males, but we need to find out from the falconer whether it’s actually a male or female.”Jim Hewitt, 75, who was treated in hospital after being clawed as he walked to the village shop on Wednesday, said he was delighted it had been caught. “I had to be careful and cautious. The sensible thing was to drive to the shop, but I won’t get beaten by a poxy bird,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHertfordshireBirdsAnimalsEnglandWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

The head of Ocha, Tom Fletcher, says the dead were found buried by their wrecked and well-marked vehicles. “They were killed by Israeli forces while trying to save lives,” Fletcher says. “We demand answers and justice.”The IDF claimsits soldiers opened fireon the vehicles because they were “advancing suspiciously toward IDF troops without headlights or emergency signals” and alleges, without providing evidence, that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants were among those killed. None were reported to be in the mass grave.1 AprilTwo witnesses tell the Guardianthat some of the bodies recovered from the grave had had their hands or feet tied, suggesting they were shot after being detained. ARed Crescentofficial says Israeli soldiers could be heard – over a phone line that was open to one of the paramedics at the time of the convoy shooting – ordering restraints to detain apparent survivors from the convoy.2 AprilA forensics consultant who examined five of the bodies says there isevidence of execution-style killingin some cases based on the “specific and intentional” location of shots taken at close range. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, says Gaza has become the world’s most dangerous place for humanitarian workers and calls for those responsible for the killings to be held accountable.3 AprilThe Israeli military says it is investigating the killings. It maintains that “terrorists” were advancing in the ambulances.Abed, the survivor, tells the Guardian he was detained and beaten and had to watch as one ambulance and rescue vehicle after another approached the scene and came under intense gunfire. He says he witnessed the wreckage being buried by military bulldozers, and that he saw the missing Red Crescent worker, Assad al-Nassara, alive and in Israeli detention. After several hours of Israeli interrogation Abed was released and left to walk homewards.Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warAidfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her daughter’s husband was away working in Iran and the two women were alone with Nasrin’s seven children when Nasrin, heavily pregnant with her eighth child, began experiencing severe pains.Gul helped Nasrin into a rickshaw and they set off into the night. Holding her daughter’s hand as the rickshaw jolted over the dirt road, Gul says she prayed they would not encounter a Taliban checkpoint.“I kept thinking, if only Nasrin’s husband were here. If only I could ease my daughter’s pain,” she says. Her prayers were not answered. The rickshaw’s small lamp was spotted by Taliban fighters who signalled for them to stop and demanded to know where they were going.As a frightened Gul explained that her daughter was sick and needed urgent medical attention, they asked why the women weretravelling without a male escort, ormahram. Even though Gul explained that Nasrin’s husband was working abroad, the fighters refused to allow them to pass and continue their journey to the hospital.“I begged them, telling them my daughter was dying. I pleaded for their permission,” says Gul. “But they still refused. In desperation, I lied and said the rickshaw driver was my nephew and our guardian. Only then did they let us pass.”By the time they reached the hospital it was too late. Nasrin’s baby had already died in her womb, and her uterus had ruptured. The doctors said Nasrin needed to be transferred to another hospital and so Gul helped her daughter into another rickshaw and they set off again, towards a government hospital an hour away. On their way they were stopped at two more Taliban checkpoints, each time detained for long periods because they were travelling alone.They did finally reach the hospital, but Nasrin had not survived the journey. “The doctors told us that due to excessive bleeding and the ruptured uterus, both the baby and the mother had died,” says Gul. “We buried them side by side.”The Guardian andZan Times, an Afghan news agency, has interviewed dozens of women and healthcare professionals across multiple Afghan provinces. Their testimonies build a picture of a maternal and child healthcare system dangerously compromised and eroded by theTaliban’s draconian policies towards women.View image in fullscreenAn overcrowded maternity ward at the Zabul provincial hospital in the city of Qalat, in southern Afghanistan.Photograph: Kiana Hayeri/Kiana Hayeri for Carmignac FoundationTheir refusal to let women travel to hospitals unaccompanied, combined with increasing rates of early marriage, poor access to healthcare, unsafe roads and a cultural neglect of women’s health will inevitably contribute to increased maternal deaths inAfghanistan, according to UN agencies.Even before the Taliban took power, Afghanistan had a maternal mortality rate three times higher than the global average, according to the lastofficial World Bank figuresfrom 2020.Experts warn that maternal health is likely to deteriorate further, compounded by the Taliban’s decision in December 2024 to close all medical training to women, includingprospective midwives.According to areportby the World Health Organization (WHO), 24 mothers and 167 infants already die every day in Afghanistan from preventable causes. It is estimated that more than 20,000 villages across the country lack basic healthcare services, affecting 14 million people.A recent UN Women reportestimatedthat by 2026, a woman’s chance of dying in childbirth will have increased by 50%.View image in fullscreenThis 22-year-old midwife has helped deliver nine babies during her 13-hour shift at the Zabul provincial hospital in the city of Qalat, in southern Afghanistan.Photograph: Kiana Hayeri/Kiana Hayeri for Carmignac FoundationHospital staff in provinces across Afghanistan have reported that women have been persistently prevented from accessing maternal healthcare because they were not accompanied by a man.Most arrive in critical condition, and some die simply because they were brought in too lateA medical professional at Mirwais regional hospital in Kandahar says the hospital receives female patients from across Kandahar but also from neighbouring provinces.“Most arrive in critical condition and some die simply because they were brought in too late,” they say. “Some babies die in the womb, while others pass away within minutes of birth.” According to staff, the hospital recorded at least 800 maternal deaths and more than 1,000 newborn deaths last year.“A young woman arrived at the hospital after giving birth in a taxi,” says Samina, a midwife working in a government hospital in Kandahar. “Her baby had died on the way due to a lack of oxygen. When I asked her why she hadn’t come to the hospital sooner, she replied, ‘I had to wait for my husband to return from work. I had no other male guardian.’”Two women told the Guardian they had experienced miscarriage due to inability to access care. One interviewee reported the death of a family member during labour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She is one of eight midwives at the hospital, which also has two female doctors and one senior female doctor. They were trained before the recent Taliban ban on women attending nursing and midwifery courses.Photograph: Kiana Hayeri/Kiana Hayeri for Carmignac Foundation“One reason is because of financial hardships, but sometimes the reason is because the men of the families are careless and do not bring the woman to the doctor sooner. And since they can’t travel on their own, their condition worsens,” she says.Already, a growing shortage of qualified medical professionals and midwives is putting the lives of women and children at serious risk, particularly in rural areas where few trained doctors are available.Doctors interviewed by the Guardian estimated that “more than half” of their female colleagues had quit their jobs, particularly in smaller cities and villages.“Most of my colleagues have left Afghanistan and this has severely affected the healthcare sector in the country,” said Dr Sima*, who chose to stay along with her husband, also a doctor. “We are both specialists, and we realised we would not be able to do this work abroad so we stayed to serve the country.”A midwife from Takhar province says officials from the Taliban’s ministry for the propagation of virtue and prevention of vice constantly harass and humiliate female medical staff. “We try our best to do our jobs, but the pressure is unbearable. Many of us just want to quit. Sometimes, they insult us, claiming our clothing is ‘un-Islamic’.“One day, our emergency ward was overwhelmed with patients. That section is for women only, and men are not allowed. But Taliban enforcers barged in and took away three female nurses, claiming their uniforms were inappropriate. They made them sign a pledge to wear longer clothing before letting them go. Even in life and death emergencies, instead of letting us treat patients they are instead arresting us over our clothing.”Names have been changed to protect the identity of the interviewees and some of the writers.

The result is a raw, horrifying and invaluable watchJack SealeThu 3 Apr 2025 18.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 19.20 EDTShareIt is disturbingly easy to respond with little more than fatigue to reports of powerful men sexually exploiting women, because there have been so many. The part of us that should emit shock, disgust and righteous outrage becomes dulled through overuse. And so, whenMohamed Al Fayed, the billionaire former owner of Harrods, died in 2023 and was then credibly accused of being one of Britain’s worst sex offenders, the collective reaction felt like a shrug.The new Dispatches investigation, Delivered to a Predator: Al Fayed’s Fixer, however, ought to sharpen our revulsion and our resolve to fight for change. Building on the 2017 Dispatches documentary Behind Closed Doors and the 2024 BBC programmePredator at Harrods, it outlines the scale of the tycoon’s wrongdoing: last year, the Metropolitan police said it believed Al Fayed may have raped or abused at least 111 women and girls, but here a lawyer working for survivors estimates the number to be more like 300.Dispatches has spoken to 16 victims and witnesses, mainly formerHarrodsstaff, many of whom give their testimony in public for the first time. The rawness of the survivors’ interviews, blameless individuals trembling as they describe a trauma that has redefined their whole lives, is a reminder that one case would be one too many – but their stories match. They allege that Harrods’ working culture was one where young, usually blond employees were regularly manoeuvred into situations where they found themselves alone with the organisation’s chair, and either felt obliged to allow him to molest them, or were raped.A picture emerges of a workplace where the boss’s interest in young women was an open secret. Everyone could see women who fitted the same aesthetic profile being fast-tracked to particular roles, or sent on errands that involved visiting Al Fayed’s offices on Park Lane, but nobody quite knew what was happening next and, if they did have suspicions, they felt powerless to speak out. It is a profoundly upsetting story of money buying impunity, but Dispatches makes a further claim about the logistics that is even more startling. It involves a name that was unknown the day before broadcast, but that will be familiar to millions by the time you read this: Kelly Walker-Duncalf.View image in fullscreenCathy Newman investigating.Photograph: BritesparkWalker-Duncalf, it is alleged, was the woman who made it possible for Al Fayed to prey on women. She joined Harrods in 1997 at the age of 19 and, a few years later, was running a department called “store approvals”, which meant she vetted new staff. Every contributor here describes her as an untouchable Al Fayed acolyte who had influence far exceeding her job description: Walker-Duncalf was “the second-most important person in Harrods”, according to one interviewee. “She had a degree of power that nobody else in the store had.”The women who say they were abused by Al Fayed allege that they were brought to his attention by Walker-Duncalf: she either directly recruited them or identified them as employees who should be given an audience with the owner. One former Harrods worker says she had Polaroids of female employees pinned up on a board. But the contention that Walker-Duncalf abetted Al Fayed goes beyond the practicalities. The alleged victims say the presence of a woman, during the initial phase when they were being showered with gifts or given an inexplicable promotion, made them more likely to ignore the voice in their head that was telling them to run.It is further alleged that Walker-Duncalf would scout for young women not just on the Harrods shop floor but outside the organisation, and even beyond Al Fayed’s ownership of Harrods; and that on occasion she would literally deliver his victims to him. One interviewee, Francesca, says she met Walker-Duncalf through a mutual friend in London in 2013, three years after Al Fayed sold Harrods. She says Walker-Duncalf told her that Al Fayed was looking for a new PA, then took her to meet him, an encounter that began with Francesca apparently being given the job – the deal sealed with an envelope full of cash – and ended with her being raped.Reporting for Dispatches,Cathy Newmantracks Walker-Duncalf down to Jersey and reaches her by phone, apparently coming close to scoring an interview. Their meeting never happens, with Walker-Duncalf instead issuing a statement via her lawyer, denying that she enabled or facilitated any of Al Fayed’s crimes. It is not suggested that Walker-Duncalf was aware of his abuse. The inevitable new police investigation will have to provide a final answer to that; for now, this programme has made an invaluable contribution to the story of Mohamed Al Fayed, a horrifying tale that urgently needs to be told in full.Delivered to a Predator: Al Fayed’s Fixer is on Channel 4 nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewMohamed Al FayedHarrods#MeToo movementWomenCathy NewmanreviewsShareReuse this content"

We asked urologists one pressing question about itMadeleine AggelerThu 3 Apr 2025 14.41 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 16.48 EDTShareOn Monday evening, Cory Booker, a Democratic senator for New Jersey,took the floorto denounce the harm he believes Donald Trump and his administration have inflicted on the United States. “Our country is in crisis,” he said,decryingthe economic chaos, mass layoffs and tyrannical acts of the administration’s first 71 days. He stopped speaking 25 hours and five minutes later, making it the longest Senate speech in history.Many praised Booker forthe rousing political act. Some were alsoimpressedby aparticularphysical feat: namely, he seemingly didn’t pee once the whole time. (A rep for Booker confirmed toTMZthat he did not wear a diaper during his speech.)Afterwards, Booker toldreportersthat he prepared for the speech by fasting for days and intentionally dehydrating himself.It’s not a good thingDr Rena Malik“I think I stopped eating on Friday and then stopped drinking the night before I started on Monday,” Booker said, according totweetsfrom CNN’s chief congressional correspondent, Manu Raju. “It had its benefits and it really had its downsides.”Booker’s speech was a feat of stamina and determination. According to urologists, his no-pee marathon was also deeply unadvisable.“I think [Booker] needs to see a urologist,” says Dr Rena Malik,urologistand pelvic surgeon. “He probably has some real bladder dysfunction. That’s not normal. A normal person can’t do that.”Most people peeon averageabout seven to eight times a day. And healthy adults typically produce about 800 to 2,000ml – or 0.8 to 2 liters – of urine a day, says Dr Seth D Cohen, a urologist at the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Men’s Health.View image in fullscreenOn Monday, Cory Booker spoke for 25 hours and five minutes, making it the longest Senate speech in history.Photograph: Aaron Schwartz/EPAHolding one’s pee for too long can lead to urinary tract infections (UTIs) as well as bladder and kidney damage. “Eventually, the body will contract the bladder involuntarily to empty its contents,” says Cohen. “This is called incontinence.”When urine sits in the bladder for too long (say, about 25 hours and five minutes), it is basically “food for bacteria”, Malik says. Contrary topopular belief, urine is not sterile, and if not flushed out, it can cause UTIs.Experts also expressed concern over Booker’s decision to dehydrate himself.“Dehydration can have serious consequences, particularly for older adults,” says Dr Bashir Al Hussein Al Awamlh, a urologist at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York Presbyterian. He adds that risks include fatigue, muscle cramps and dizziness when standing up.Indeed, Bookersaidafter his speech that he occasionally took small sips of water “to stop my muscles from cramping”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While some people may limit their fluid intake when they will not have easy bathroom access, “it’s more effective to stay hydrated overall and avoid caffeine and alcohol, which act as diuretics and can increase the urge to urinate”.Besides, dehydrating yourself doesn’t prevent your body from producing urine. “You’re still processing bodily fluids,” says Malik. Additionally, when one is dehydrated, urine typically becomes more concentrated, and this highly concentrated urine can irritate the bladder lining, Malik says.Booker’s speech was not a filibuster – a procedure by which senators attempt to delay or block a vote by speaking indefinitely. During a filibuster, senators can’t sit down or go to the bathroom, as that would beyieldingthe floor. (“These rules are not medically safe and need to be evaluated by a medical doctor,” Malik says.)While not a filibuster, it was a piece of political theater, and Booker followed most filibuster rules,sayinghe rose with the “intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able”.Butt seriously: why you might be pooping wrong – and what to do about itRead moreAs he neared the end of his speech, Bookersaidhe would be leaving to “deal with some of the biological urgencies I’m feeling”.Democrats praised Booker for his speech. “Do you know how proud America is of you?” the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, asked Booker.Urologists were less delighted by the gesture.“While it’s possible to delay urination with careful planning, doing so repeatedly – or for symbolic reasons – can send the wrong message about listening to your body’s needs,” says Dr Jason Kim, associate professor of urology at Stony Brook Medicine.People should not aspire to go 25 hours without peeing, says Malik. “It’s not a good thing,” she said, reiterating: “Cory Booker needs a urologist.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealth & wellbeingCory BookerUS SenateHealthDemocratsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He might as well have been signposting the odds on a global recession.No country went untouched. The penguins, the sole inhabitants of Heard Island near Antarctica,are in for a hell of a shockthe next time they try to flog some frozen fish to the USA. Let’s hope they were watching on TV.“This is Liberation Day,” saidDonald Trump. “The single greatest day since …” Well, since The Donald’s last single greatest day. These single greatest days seem to creep up on us ever more frequently. But, hey, it was a great day for those currency traders who had bet on the value of the dollar falling. Who had bet that a trade war would bring higher prices across the world and that growth would slow down. Nice work if you can get it.US stock markets tumble as investors shaken by Trump tariffsRead moreNot that The Donald was that bothered. However much he protested otherwise, this wasn’t about Making America Wealthy Again. This was much more primal. Sticking it to all the people who had laughed at him over the years. His bankruptcies. His hair. His orangeness. His stupidity. Sticking it to all those who had taken him to court and won. Now he was the most powerful person in the world. He could do what he liked. He had the whole world watching as he messed it up. And he was doing it simply because he could. There was no one who could stop him. This was the best orgasm he had ever had.Meanwhile the world held its breath. Even though Trump had been elected on a promise to impose tariffs, even though he had sent out the invitations to his White House launch party days in advance, everyone was caught off guard. Almost as if no one had quite believed The Donald would go through with it. Surely there must have been someone in his team who could have persuaded him that this was an idiotic thing to do. For America as much as the rest of the world.Here in the UK, Keir Starmer and the business secretary,Jonathan Reynolds, tried to keep calm. Even though they felt anything but. Underneath what they hoped sounded like an immediate measured response – ‘We are taking a pragmatic approach. Cool heads. No kneejerk retaliation. Blah, blah, blah’ – you could smell the panic.HELP! THE MAN IS A LUNATIC. WE HAVE NO BLOODY IDEA HOW THIS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT. Sure, 10% was better than 20%, but it’s still terrible. Not to mention cars, steel and aluminium. Everything was up in the air. The Orange Manchild was just as likely to increase the tariffs in a few weeks’ time as he was to reduce them. Then there was the effect on the UK of tariffs to other countries. Not forgetting the impact of any retaliatory tariffs that may be imposed on the US by the rest of the world. Bang goes the fiscal headroom. Again. Everywhere you looked was one giant unknown. A fever dream. A trip back to the 1930s.Come Thursday morning, Starmer and Reynolds were hardly in much better shape. So much for things looking rosier after a night’s sleep. But hopefully large doses of Valium and beta-blockers would do the trick. Get them through the media round, sounding as if they vaguely knew what they were doing. That the government was in control of the situation. Cue endless further repeats of “Steady as she goes. Careful consideration. No immediate retaliatory reaction.” Trying to accentuate the positives. Unaware there weren’t any.By the time Reynolds stood up to make a statement to the Commons in the late morning, he almost sounded as if he believed he knew what he was doing. Almost. The UK has a strong trading relationship with the US, he began. So strong, the US had decided to put a bomb under it. He then started singing: “Always look on the bright side of life.”“No county has escaped a tariff,” he went on, “but thanks to our pragmatic approach we have been placed on the lowest tier.” Hooray. Hang out the flags. Sucking up to an abusive president and promising a second state visit had paid off.Or had it? There were loads of other countries – Kosovo and Congo among them – that had also been hit with a 10% rate and they had made no efforts to offer Trump anything. It could just be that what swung it for the UK was that our trade with the US had been more or less balanced. Though don’t tell Starmer or Reynolds that. They would be mentally destroyed to find out their humiliating efforts had meant nothing.Reynolds went on. Slowly, slowly. The government would consult business on retaliatory tariffs over the next month. Wait to see whether other countries blinked first. Hope that the amazing trade deal with the US would emerge from somewhere. Meanwhile there would be a helpline for businesses. An automated voice. Thank you for ringing. Your call is important to us. The government is currently unavailable. Please hold.Earlier in the day, Kemi Badenoch had been surprisingly supportive of the government. Saying tariffs were in no one’s interest and even offering to join the team negotiating with the US. Thanks but no thanks. That’s one way to get the tariffs doubled. Kemi can fall out with anyone. But the leader of the opposition’s collegiality hadn’t reached Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary. He was adamant the tariffs were all Labour’s fault. Next up China, India and Japan will be blaming Starmer too.Griffith insisted that Labour ought to have already negotiated a free trade deal with the US and not to have done so was negligence. Someone should have reminded him that the Tories had had eight years to come up with something and failed. I guess amnesia is a coping strategy for him. He also wanted to congratulate himself on the rare sighting of a Brexit bonus. Somehow a 10% tariff was a huge success and a complete disaster. Make up your mind, guys.The rest of the debate passed off in respectful bemusement as no one really knows what’s going on. Emily Thornberry got a laugh by asking if Boris Johnson had any ideas on a trade deal, but otherwise Reynolds stuck to his holding pattern. A deal was there to be made. The only drawback is it’s with Trump. So everything is in the air.

We are only treated to a snippet of it in this excellent documentary about the former Scottish National party politician – the youngest MP elected to parliament since 1832 – but I recommend finding the whole thing onYouTube. Black, then just 20 years old, has the Commons in the palm of her hand, simultaneously charming her fellow MPs with her dry wit and laying bare the deprivation in her Paisley and Renfrewshire South constituency (among the horrors: a man who starved himself in order to afford his bus fare to the jobcentre, only to collapse on the way there). The documentary does, however, retain some of her best one-liners from that address. Among them, the fact that her MP status and changes to housing benefit meant that she was “the only 20-year-old in the whole of the UK” that would be getting any government help with their housing.Black – if it wasn’t clear already – is a force of nature, and someone we surely need in politics. And yet, her exit from Westminster is what this one-off film is all about. We zip between archive clips from her younger years as an IndyRef campaigner; the last days of her career as an MP (Black announced her intention to stand down at the next election in 2023, following through on that promise in 2024); and her post-politics life. There’s also footage fromlast year’s Edinburgh fringe show, Politics Isn’t for Me, which saw her turn her tumultuous time in parliament into something approaching comedy, commanding the stage with what she calls her “Britney mic” jutting out in front of her mouth (the Guardian described it as “comedy therapy”). Being a young, gay woman in the Commons, we learn, took a profound toll on Black’s mental health. She tells us as much – describing it as having had “anxiety all the time” – but we can see it, too, the colour slowly draining from her faceas her 20s march on. When we cut back to the present, she is calmer, happier; there is talk of regaining independence and control.The message here is clear: Black may have been allowed to roam the corridors of power, but it was never somewhere she had any real chance of thriving. From the start, the tabloids were digging up old social media posts about her love of alcopops and why “maths is shite”. These were posted, unsurprisingly, when she was still at school.In any case, it was an “archaic” place where she didn’t fit in, and somewhere she felt isolated and even scared at points. She was left alone to deal with “visceral” hate – trolls calling her a “dyke”, a “dirty bitch”, and telling her that she was too ugly to get raped – and even death threats, including one which she says the police described as “imminent”. She drank too much, and lost weight from all the vomiting; her dad, Alan, says “her spark” was missing. Her wife, Katie, explains that people began to brand Black as lazy when she was signed off work for three months between 2017 and 2018. While the couple don’t go intotoo much detail about those critics here, it wasn’t just the media any more: Black has previously gone on the record to say that her fellow MPs also cast aspersions on her character.‘What am I going to do with my life?’ Mhairi Black on quitting the ‘depressing’ Commons at 29 – with no regretsRead moreAway from those tough times, we also see how determined, fierce and funny Black is, but not, ironically, during her onstage segments. It’s in her Commons performances that these qualities shine through. When she describes the government as having been largely “pished” during lockdown, then deputy speaker Dame Rosie Winterton asks her to mind her language. Without missing a beat, Black fires back a host of other options, complete with theatrical hand gestures: “Inebriated? Intoxicated? Paralytic?” There’s also a hilarious episode, where a tabloid claims that Black has called Rishi Sunak a “dickhead” during PMQs. Black lip-reads back her own mutterings before deciding that wasn’t what she said, but that itwouldn’t exactly have beenwrongif she had done. On top of this, we also see how she is managing her mental health and neurodiversity (she was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in 2018, and is being tested for autism). Allowing yourself to be filmed reflecting on your enviable political career is one thing. That Black also let the cameras roll during moments of struggle and mental exhaustion is far more impressive.I’m not entirely sure that her future lies in standup, but then neither is Black. Instead, she’s just really, really glad to be out of parliament, a new lightness radiating off her as the film ends. Her exit really is a loss to British politics. But my God, I’ve never seen someone look so happy to be walking the dog.Mhairi Black: Being Me Again aired on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Pope of Greenwich Village (1984)Looking as though she has strayed from another genre, Hannah plays Mickey Rourke’s girlfriend, a leggy aerobics instructor who keeps getting undressed. At least she’s more fun than Rourke and an insanely posturing Eric Roberts as deadbeat cousins ripping off the mob: roles originally written for Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.View image in fullscreenMickey Rourke, Daryl Hannah and Eric Roberts.Photograph: Mgm/Ua/Kobal/Shutterstock9. At Play in the Fields of the Lord (1991)Hannah acquits herself well as one of a group of American missionaries who cross paths with mercenary Tom Berenger while attempting to convert an Amazonian tribe. Of course it all ends in tears in this plodding epic-length adaptation of Peter Matthiessen’s novel, directed by Héctor Babenco.8. Steel Magnolias (1989)As a timid hairdresser in a fearsome, mostly female ensemble cast wielding Louisiana accents, Hannah holds her own against the likes of Sally Field and Shirley MacLaine, helped by unflattering specs, droopy cardigans and the film’s most diverting character arc, involving pregnancy and unsuitable men. Off-screen, meanwhile, Hannah would shortly be moving on from her nine-year relationship with Jackson Browne to a romantic entanglement with John F Kennedy Jr.View image in fullscreenSouthern belle … as Annelle Dupuy Desoto.Photograph: Tristar Pictures/Allstar7. The Clan of the Cave Bear (1986)In the Paleolithic era, Hannah plays a tall, blond Cro-Magnon woman raised by a Neanderthal tribe. John Sayles’ proto-feminist screenplay, adapted from Jean M Auel’s bestseller, is of course preposterous, but its star looks stunning in pelts, and also emerges intact from a gory fight with Bart the Bear and non-consensual sex with the actor who played Windows in The Thing.View image in fullscreenProto-feminist … Hannah in The Clan of the Cave Bear.Photograph: Warner Bros/Allstar6. Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992)Embodying the sort of tall, blond stunner of every schlub’s dreams, Hannah fleshes out what could have been a boring girlfriend role in a sci-fi thriller more fun than its reputation suggests, adapted from HF Saint’s terrific novel. Chevy Chase mercifully dials down the smarm in the title role, Sam Neill enjoys himself channelling James Mason in North By Northwest, and the early digital effects still look astonishing.5. The Real Blonde (1997)Hannah has a ball playing a soap-opera diva who gleefully belittles her preening male co-star in Tom DiCillo’s charming but underseen satire about the spiritual superficiality of Manhattan’s arts and media. Meanwhile, the marvellous Catherine Keener, as a makeup artist, ensures the film itself isn’t as shallow as its milieu.View image in fullscreenIn Roxanne with Steve Martin.Photograph: Columbia/Allstar4. Roxanne (1987)Hannah beefs up her blond-girlfriend persona with rocket-scientist smarts (she’s an astronomer) and impeccable comic timing opposite Steve Martin in this adorable reworking of Cyrano de Bergerac, transposed to small-town America. She thinks she prefers handsome but dim Rick Rossovich. But no, she and the fire chief with the enormous proboscis are made for each other.3. Splash (1984)Always a bit ethereal and otherworldly, Hannah is perfectly cast in Ron Howard’s fairytale romcom about a New Yorker (Tom Hanks) who falls in love with a mermaid who calls herself Madison, after the avenue. It’s darker than you might remember, and John Candy is downright skeezy as Hanks’ brother, but Hannah’s sense of innocent wonder is infectious.View image in fullscreenInfectious innocent wonder …Hannah as Madison in Splash.Photograph: Disney/Allstar2. Blade Runner (1982)In only a handful of scenes, Hannah makes an indelible mark on sci-fi cinema as Pris, the “basic pleasure model” who comes to a deeply upsetting end when she takes on Harrison Ford’s replicant-hunter. With her shock of hair, spray-on punk eye makeup and sex-doll athleticism, she’s a vital part of Ridley Scott’s groundbreaking vision.View image in fullscreenMakes an indelible mark … Hannah as Pris in Blade Runner.Photograph: THA/Shutterstock1. Kill Bill: Vol 1 (2003) and 2 (2004)Hannah serves up a delicious double-helping of pure malice in Quentin Tarantino’s martial arts pastiche as one-eyed Elle Driver, member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Whetherwhistling the theme from Twisted Nerveor clobbering Uma Thurman, she is mean and magnificent. We can only lament it didn’t lead to a career renaissance as an action star, though she has since kept busy with TV work, going public withher autism, environmental activism – and Neil Young,whom she marriedin 2018.Explore more on these topicsRankedDaryl Hannahbest ofShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But even squeezing in “brisk walks” can be a chore, with busy schedules and increasingly desk-bound jobs forcing more of us to remain sedentary for long periods. That is where walking pads come in, being lighter, smaller and often easier to store than bulky and tricky-to-manoeuvre running treadmills.When coupled with a standing desk, walking pads can be used while working – or when watching TV in the evening. Just a couple of 30-minute sessions add thousands of steps to your daily tally. In fact, a 60-minute walk at a very easy 3km an hour can burn between 200 and 300 additional calories, helping those who want to lose a little weight and tone up without the sweatiness and inconvenience of a full-on treadmill session.Walking pads are often cheaper than full-size treadmills, simple to use and relatively easy to store, and they’re perfect for adding a little more movement to your life without having to give up the day job.At a glanceBest overall walking pad:JTX MoveLight£499 at JTX FitnessBestbudget walking pad:Rattantree shock-absorbing treadmill£142.49 at DebenhamsBest foldable walking pad:BodyMax WP60£549 at AmazonBest walking pad for incline:Mobvoi Home Treadmill Plus£224.99 at MobvoiWhy you should trust meI’m a keen fitness fan who does everything from gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes to outdoor trail runs and cold-water surfing. As a result, I’ve often been tasked with testing fitness technology for industry magazines.I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whatever I’m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells.I’m a strong believer that you need to live with new-fangled tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the right environment. With walking pads, that meant strolling along, racking up the steps and burning calories – even while I wrote up this feature.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘Good build quality for the price and the setup process is painless’: the Mobvoi Home Treadmill Plus.Photograph: Leon PoultneyThere was only one way to properly trial the five walking treadmills we selected for this test, and that’s to mimic the customer journey by ordering, taking delivery, unboxing, setting them up and then shoehorning them into daily life.The best walking treadmills – or walking pads – aren’t quite as bulky asregular running treadmills, so I could have multiple models on the go at home at once: one under my desk, one in front of the television and one in my wife’s office upstairs, rotating through them to ensure the same time – at least three days – was spent on each.The testing process meant a lot of additional steps and – in some cases at least – a whining soundtrack that drowned out whatever Netflix series the family was attempting to enjoy.Besides general observations on the heft, ease of storage, quietness, ease of operation and build quality, I tested any additional features available, such as incline, speed adjustments and any remote controls or apps.Finally, to get a good idea of energy consumption, and the overall cost of running a walking treadmill, I plugged each unit into a power meter, which offered real-time readouts on energy consumption, and calculated the cost based on my energy tariff.Here are the four best walking treadmills you can buy now.The best under-desk treadmills and walking padsin 2025View image in fullscreen‘It feels like a walking pad that will go the distance’: the JTX MoveLight.Photograph: Leon PoultneyBest overall walking pad:JTX MoveLightView image in fullscreen£499 at JTX FitnessJTX tends to appear in the “best value” section of most reviews of home fitness equipment. The brand is known for offering great affordability and reliable build quality but lacks eye candy and technological flourishes.The MoveLight walking pad is different, though. It happens to be one of the most expensive walking pads we tested. At almost 30kg, it also happens to be one of the heaviest.But that’s no bad thing: there’s a tangible difference in the build quality when compared with the much cheaper Rattantree, for example. The JTX also offers a super-sized display, cushioned walking deck and super-quiet 1hp electric motor.It’s a solid treadmill offering speeds of up to 6km/h, meaning it’s also possible to use it for slow jogging without the worry of it falling apart.Why we love itThe JTX is similar in design to the BodyMax reviewed below and has a solid plastic chassis that gives it a more premium feel than its cheaper rivals. There’s also a generous running deck area.The extra-large LED console is easy to use and neatly scrolls through speed, time and step count information as you walk. The shrill beeps upon startup and when you adjust the speed do become tiresome, though. Any office mates will want to throw a pencil at you.A small plastic remote allows you to adjust the speed, stop or start the unit and scroll the display between distance, calories and time on one half and speed and step count on the other.The 1hp motor is powerful enough to propel the deck up to 6km/h, where it remains much quieter than some of the others tested. The deck cushioning is also tangible underfoot, offering a nice spring that makes longer walking sessions more comfortable.Overall, it feels like a walking pad that will go the distance – and so it should, given the price. But that solid build also makes it a pain to move around the house, with the overall weight requiring some serious muscle to tip it up on to its wheels. It also doesn’t fold like the similarly priced BodyMax machine.Oh, and one final public service announcement: those with wooden floors will want to take care that the wheels and plastic feet don’t scratch the surface during transport.During testing, we found it to be slightly more power-hungry than rivals, supping about 100W at 3.5km/h, meaning it costs about 3p an hour to power – or 83p a month if used for an hour each day.It’s a shame that …it’s so big and heavy to move around, which makes storing after each session a chore.Size:147 x 60 x 12.5cm (LWH)Weight:29.5kgWalking deck size:45 x 122cmMaximum user weight:100kgAverage running cost:3p an hourIncline:noneMaximum speed:6km/hFolding:noBestbudget walking pad:Rattantree shock-absorbing treadmillView image in fullscreen£142.49 at DebenhamsIt was a bit of a surprise when this Rattantree treadmill – which is available in three colours, including a rather garish pink – arrived sporting HomeFitnessCode branding. It’s a mega-value, fairly generic option that hails from China, and it’s no surprise that it doesn’t offer all the bells and whistles of its pricier rivals. The build quality isn’t fantastic, but it is very lightweight, an absolute doddle to use and covers the basics required by most working walkers.It’s marketed for both walking and running, with the belt managing speeds of up to 10km/h, but this feels extremely fast for such a barebones machine.Why we love itLet’s get straight to the point: this is a budget option. It’s much cheaper than most of the others tested and doesn’t come with any fancy features such as Bluetooth, incline or built-in speakers.It’s a simple 39 x 102cm revolving running deck, paired with a powerful (but noisy) 2.5hp electric motor that’s able to crank the belt up to 10km/h. Speed adjustment is taken care of by a small remote, which needs two AAA batteries to operate.Upon unboxing, the cost savings are immediately obvious. It is not only light but also very basic in its build. A simple steel frame, a motor and a belt are about all you get.A small and often tricky-to-read LED console at the top scrolls through distance travelled, time elapsed and a rough guide to how many calories you’ve burned, but there’s no way of jumping to the data field you want. You just have to wait for it to come around again.The lighter overall weight makes it much easier to move around the house than others, but I found it also started to move around underfoot, creak and generally complain a little as the speeds went beyond 8km/h. Put it this way: I don’t think this lightweight walking pad would last an indoor marathon at a training pace.As a simple walking pad to tuck under a desk, though, it’s absolutely fine. The belt needed adjusting after about a week of use, but slurping just 70W of power at 3.5km/h means it costs pennies to use daily.It’s a shame that …it cranks up to speeds of 10km/h because it doesn’t feel sturdy enough for those speeds.Size:122 x 49 x 14cm (LWH)Weight:19kgMaximum user weight:110kgAverage running cost:2p an hourWalking deck size:39 x 102cmIncline:noneMaximum speed:10km/hFolding:noBest foldable walking pad:BodyMax WP60View image in fullscreen£549 at AmazonThe most expensive model on test, the BodyMax walking pad also happens to be one of the best built and easiest on the eye. It’s the only model that genuinely folds in half, making it easier to squeeze into a cupboard or wardrobe.However, weighing the best part of 30kg, it’s not the easiest to move, despite wheels at the front that allow it to be tipped on its end and rolled around.Potential portability issues aside, this machine offers a fantastic walking experience, with a neat, bright and easy-to-read LED panel that gives clear and scrolling readouts of workout time, distance, speed and average calorie burn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

This is a really handy feature, meaning you won’t be constantly distracted by irksome remote-control fiddling.The deck itself is nicely cushioned and the motor is among the quietest on test. It feels like BodyMax hasn’t scrimped on materials, nor has it been distracted by Bluetooth speakers and other gimmicks, which can’t be said for all.Those wanting their walking pad to double up as a running treadmill may be disappointed: the WP60 tops out at 6km/h, which is a very fast walking pace but a slow jog for most. Not a single walking pad I’ve tested has done a convincing job as a running treadmill, though, being either too flimsy underfoot, too noisy or simply not built to withstand the endless thumping of a sprint session.If you’re seeking robust build quality, the BodyMax WP60 walking pad is well worth the additional outlay. As it folds in half, it can be tucked under a desk or rested against a wall when not in use.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy and awkward to move around when folded, and it’s expensive.Size:143 x 55 x 12.9cm (LWH)Weight:28kgWalking deck size:42 x 120cmMaximum user weight:100kgAverage running cost:2.5p an hourIncline:noneMaximum speed:6km/hFolding:yes, folds in half for storageBest walking pad for incline:Mobvoi Home Treadmill PlusView image in fullscreen£224.99 at MobvoiMobvoi is best known for itsTicWatchline of fitness-tracking smartwatches and good-valuewireless headphones, but it also offers a small range of domestic treadmills in the UK.One of the most versatile is the Home Treadmill Plus. This pad offers a slightly larger walking deck area than the brand’sHome Treadmill SE, as well as the ability to add a small amount of incline thanks to flip-out feet for height.The build quality is good for the price and the setup process is painless, while a decent spread of speeds and the ability to transform it into a more traditional running machine (with a folding handrail) make it a versatile choice for home users.Why we love itMobvoi manages to make its Home Treadmill Plus feel relatively premium and well built without sending the price soaring.It’s ready to use out of the box (although that box is heavy, so get someone to help), with wheels at one end to make it easier to move around the home – especially if you have hard floors. You wouldn’t want to keep lugging it up and down the stairs, though.When “folded” into walking mode, the built-in handrail lays flat, allowing you to slide it under a standing desk. From here, you control it with a small remote control to adjust the speed and turn the machine on and off.It doesn’t fold in half for storage, but the slim side profile means it will slide under a sofa or bed, so long as you have 12cm or more of clearance.It includes a safety mechanism for running that clips to your clothes and attaches to a specific point on the machine with a strong magnet, as you’d get on a gym running machine. There’s no way of safely attaching it when the handrail is tucked away in walking mode, however, so it will continue to operate even if you step off it. Most walking pads are the same, but it always strikes me as a bit dangerous.When extending the handrail and pushing the 2.5hp electric motor to its 12km/h top speed, however, that emergency cord could well come in handy. While it’s nice that it reaches a running pace that’s so fast – feeling like a sprint for many – it’s not really designed for long and arduous sprint sessions. The running deck isn’t big enough and there isn’t much in the way of shock absorption. I tried running on a couple of occasions but always found the experience a tad claustrophobic, not to mention noisy and generally a bit flimsy-feeling underfoot – particularly when maxing out the speed.The pad does offer an efficient and quiet way of racking up the step count while engaging in side tasks. The fold-out incline legs are a nice touch because adding a small incline helps burn more calories and work different leg muscles.In terms of efficiency, I found it drew around 80W of power at a sedate 3.5km/h speed, meaning it will cost a couple of pence to run for an hour a day on most common tariffs.Other niceties include Bluetooth functionality, allowing it to pair with virtual workout software such asZwift, while a built-in speaker allows music to be streamed from a smartphone. That said, the speaker isn’t great – you’d be far better off with a good pair ofheadphonesinstead.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy to move around, the remote is hit-and-miss and the legs add only a tiny bit of incline.Size:138cm x 64cm x 12cm (113cm in running mode) (LWH)Weight:24.6kgWalking deck size: 42 x 102cmMaximum user weight:120kgAverage running cost:2p an hourIncline:six degreesMaximum speed:12km/hFolding:yes – safety handle for runningWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenUsing a walking pad for an hour each day should only add about £10 a year to your energy bills.Photograph: Leon PoultneyHow much should I spend?Prices vary when it comes to walking pads, with the most affordable costing about £150. Anything less than that is unlikely to last until the end of the month.From my testing, the sweet spot seems to be about £250, where you can get a good blend of value and decent build quality. But some of the best we tested were, predictably, among the most expensive. These high-end models typically cost up to £500.How much room do you need?If you’ve got good clearance underneath a bed or sofa, most walking pads will happily slide underneath without the need to fold them up. Imagine a slimmed-down treadmill without the safety handle and you’re basically there.Models like those from BodyMax fold in half, which drastically reduces the length (or height, depending on how you store it), making it much easier to slide into more compact spaces such as a cupboard or wardrobe. But bear in mind the overall weight – many weigh up to 30kg, so they can be tricky to move without help.How easy is it to maintain a walking pad?Most walking pads come with a small bottle of silicone oil provided. This is used to lubricate the underside of the rubber deck every couple of months to ensure smooth movement. Most manufacturers also supply the required hex key so you can tighten the belt if it’s slipping or has moved slightly off-centre.Quickly check the deck alignment and any moving parts every couple of months and it should be enough to keep a walking pad running smoothly for years.Do walking pads use a lot of electricity?Walking pads use much less powerful motors than their running treadmill counterparts and they often do away with power-sapping incline motors and connected Bluetooth features that can see electricity bills spiral.During testing, most walking pads drew between 70 and 100W at a relatively standard 3km/h walking pace. This figure increased slightly as the speed increased.Using a walking pad for an hour each day at those sorts of figures equates to about 2-3p a day – or about £10 a year. Much cheaper than a gym membership, but more costly than getting out in nature.Can I run on a walking pad?Some walking pad speeds are capped at about 6km/h, which makes running on them tricky. A plodding jog is a better description.Some walking pads we tested did reach much higher speeds, but most came with a folding safety handle that extends to allow them to safely reach those speeds, giving the runner something to hang on to should the worst happen. These also came with a separate safety system, with a small magnetic tag that attaches to clothing. If this becomes detached, the machine shuts off.It’s worth noting that the general build and robustness of walking pads aren’t up there with their running-focused counterparts, though. That means they can be noisy, shift around underfoot and generally feel a bit flimsy during faster and longer runs.On top of this, those without handles don’t have the automatic shut-off functionality either, which can make them more dangerous, particularly when using them at higher speeds.In summary,running treadmillsare better suited to those wanting to move at higher speeds. They feature more underfoot cushioning or built-in suspension systems, which makes longer, faster sessions more comfortable and easier on the joints.Leon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of the biggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.

The 44-year-old historian Karina Longworth has other ideas. The former LA Weekly film critic launched her podcast, You Must Remember This, in 2014, setting out to tell “the secret and/or forgotten histories of Hollywood’s first century”, as she puts it in the show’s introduction. Its title is lifted from the jazz standard As Time Goes By (“You must remember this / A kiss is still a kiss …”) as featured in Casablanca. Hearing that wistful, timeworn lyric, it is easy to overlook the imperative hiding in plain sight. With each fastidiously researched and gloriously entertaining episode, Longworth seems to be telling us: youmustremember this. To not do so, or to allow fact to curdle into legend, would be unconscionable.View image in fullscreenKarina Longworth with her director husband, Rian Johnson, at the Hollywood Critics Association’s 2023 awards.Photograph: Jeffrey Mayer/Alamy“I don’t want to be a schoolmarm scolding people for forgetting,” she says from a sunny upstairs room in the Los Angeles home she shares with her husband, Rian Johnson, director of the Knives Out whodunnits and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. “But I think we can only understand where we are at and where we’re going if we look to where we’ve been.”One reason she steers clear of modern topics on the podcast is the possible conflict of interest with her husband’s career. Jamie Lee Curtis’s appearance in the original Knives Out, for instance, precluded Longworth from ever making an episode about that actor’s parents, Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, even though they would be ideal subjects. As if further evidence were needed of her passion for the past, a framed poster of Marcel Pagnol’s 1936 melodrama César dominates the wall behind her today. Later, she will dismiss several questions about modern Hollywood with the same bored riposte: “I don’t care about new movies.”She gives us the Hitchcock not of Vertigo and Psycho but of the astringent Frenzy and the meandering Family PlotThat was one of the reasons she hung up her pen at the LA Weekly in 2012. Shortly before quitting, she mocked James Bond’s backstory in Skyfall as his “formative sads” and wrote the film off as “Downton Abbey with cybercrime and shower sex”. She dismissed Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris as “a Bill and Ted sequel for cultural studies majors”, and said Joss Whedon was “crippled by his short-term need to please the crowd” in the first Avengers movie.Film criticism’s loss is cinema history’s gain. Over 11 years of You Must Remember This, Longworth has covered in granular, invigorating detail everything from the anti-communist blacklist to the influence of Charles Manson and the Hollywood phenomenon of the dead blonde. She is a factchecker par excellence – a full 19 episodes were devoted to clearing up the scurrilous, spiteful untruths in Kenneth Anger’s gossip bible Hollywood Babylon. She is also the ally any neglected genius would want on their side, as proved by her season on the late Polly Platt, a largely unsung figure in the careers of Peter Bogdanovich and Wes Anderson.View image in fullscreen‘It feels proto-psychedelic’ … Ingrid Thulin and Glenn Ford in The Four Horsemen Of The Apocalypse by Vincente Minnelli (1962).Photograph: BFIThe latest series, The Old Man Is Still Alive, addresses the declining years of 14 cinematic titans, among them Vincente Minnelli, whose visually groundbreaking The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse sparked the idea for the season after Longworth saw it in Paris on a rainy Saturday evening in 2023. “It’s from the early 1960s but it feels proto-psychedelic. Seeing it reminded me why I started the podcast: to talk about things that have been forgotten.”Even with Scorsese, there’s this sense of: ‘Aw, the old man is trying to do something else before he dies!’With that in mind, she gives us theHitchcocknot of Vertigo and Psycho but of the astringent Frenzy and the meandering Family Plot; theJohn Fordof Cheyenne Autumn, a well-meaning if not wholly effective critique of the western’s values; and theBilly Wilderdrawn back to the mournful territory of Sunset Boulevard in Fedora.It’s fascinating to hear Longworth charting the corkscrew turns these film-makers took as they twisted themselves out of shape trying to keep up with the times. But there’s no escaping the fact that she has taken on a supremely unfashionable topic: dead white men. A deliberate provocation? “No, it’s what I’m legitimately interested in,” she scoffs. “My podcast isreallyhard to make. I can only do it if I care about the subject. Sure, in the world right now there is anger at specific older white men. Part of it is an impulse to say: ‘We should just burn it all down and start again.’ But history makes us who we are today.”View image in fullscreenAlfred Hitchcock directing Family Plot (1976).Photograph: Universal/AllstarAs a student, she was taught the importance of DW Griffith, the director ofThe Birth of a Nation. “There was only a cursory conversation around whether the film was racist,” she recalls.“It was primarily all about the technique. I don’t think that’s the way to do it either, but nor do I think we should burn all copies of The Birth of a Nation. That sets a dangerous precedent.”The phrase “institutional memory” crops up in the new series, and it is this, along with the nuance of considered investigation over kneejerk reaction, that Longworth is fighting to defend. That said, people today are time-poor and inundated with viewing options. With the BFI Southbank hosting a month-long series of the movies covered in the podcast, some of which Longworth will be introducing in person, how does she think potential audiences will respond to the invitation to sample, say, The Only Game in Town, starring Warren Beatty and Elizabeth Taylor? By her own admission, it is “the least successful of the George Stevens films I’ve seen, [though] aesthetically it has its moments”. Hardly a ringing endorsement. “I don’t care,” she shrugs. “I’m not trying to change the paradigm. I’m just reacting to movies the way I react to them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When I suggest that ageism is no longer as prevalent now that Martin Scorsese is revered at 82, while Ridley Scott is whooshing along like a runaway train at 87, she disagrees vehemently. “Look atMegalopolisand the way Coppola was treated as if he was a doddering old man foolishly spending his family’s legacy. Even with Scorsese, there’s this sense of: ‘Aw, the old man is trying to do something else before he dies!’ And that’s thepositivespin. The negative one is: ‘Why won’t he just make shorter movies?’”The podcast is the only way I can be free to do any kind of performance because nobody’s watchingAlong with erudition and tireless research, listeners of You Must Remember This get Longworth’s shimmering writing (on William Wyler’s How to Steal a Million: “Dressed in a slip, a car coat and rain boots, Audrey Hepburn invents grunge”) and plenty of shade (to anyone defending Otto Preminger’s last film, The Human Factor, she says: “You do you, babe”). It’s all delivered in her alluring conspiratorial tones, which suggest a film noir schemer. Or, as one online fan put it, “a sexy ghost”.When I ask how this exaggerated vocal style evolved from the chattier early episodes, she looks unimpressed. “I’m not trying to do anything differently,” she says. One indisputable change in the new season is that, to adapt TS Eliot and Charles Dickens, she do the directors in different voices. Whereas she once hired actors, even enlisting her husband to play John Huston, she now takes on every role herself, including an amusing Hitchcock with a severe case of irritable vowel syndrome.‘Never fails to make my day’: readers on their feelgood moviesRead moreDoes this have anything to do with her own background as a would-be child actor in LA? “I’m not acting,” she says firmly. “I’m doing what I would do if I were telling these stories at a cocktail party.” It was her mother who steered her into auditions as a child. “She wanted to be an artist and a model. When she had me, she stopped pursuing work outside of the house. That was not the right decision for her, and she killed herself when I was 11. She was in a situation common to many people of her generation: they had been told to want something and then, when they got it, it wasn’t fulfilling and they didn’t know what to do about that.”Longworth’s acting career was short-lived. “I had trouble controlling my body and my face. A lot of that came from nervousness at being looked at. I still don’t like it. The podcast is the only way I can be free to do any kind of performance because nobody’s watching.” Channelling Greta Garbo and providing our conversation with a natural end, she says: “I want to be alone.”You Must Remember This Presents … The Old Man is Still Alive is at BFI Southbank, London SE1, until 30 AprilExplore more on these topicsFilmPodcastsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But I think the way we talk about it – “We need immigrants because there are gaps in the NHS” or even, “They’ve brought a lot to our country and contributed to our society” – is not helpful. It dehumanises immigrants: they become gap fillers.CliveIt’s reasonable to set a quota on the number of people to do a specific thing and let those people come to the UK. In general, I’m in favour of people coming as students, and if they get a job afterwards, contribute to society and the economy, then within reason that’s fine.

Just like birds will go to warmer climates, or penguins will march across the Antarctic, human beings move. Most migration happens within the global south.

You can lose it by greater or lesser degrees: you may be one of the luckier casualties. But that’s about as good as it gets. So, while there will have been initial relief in Downing Street on Wednesday night,a feeling even that Keir Starmer’s placating of Donald Trumplooks vindicated, what followed was no victory lap.How could it be, after that grotesquely swaggering show trial the president staged in the White House garden, all the better to jazz up an economic assault on what were once his country’s allies? Come on down, Britain, escaping with just the minimum10% tariffon its exports to the US and no drive-by insults! Better thanTaiwan(32% plus a lecture about how the US used to build all the semiconductors once), Vietnam (“They like me, I like them” but still a brutal 46%), the EU (“very very tough traders” and lucky to get away with 20%) or poor Lesotho, still reeling from the overnight collapse of US aid and now whacked by a 50% tariff. But even lucky Britain still emerged with a 25% duty on cars that the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) estimatescould cost 25,000 jobs, plus the grim realisation that this may be just the beginning of a long unravelling. Globalisation is dead, protectionism is back, and all to satisfy one man’s delusions that life was better in the 1800s before income tax was invented.Ministers’ first worry will be about dumping – countries flooding Britain with cheap stuff they can no longer shift to the US, which is lethal for domestic producers – and the future of manufacturing jobs, many clustered in Labour seats. But beyond that lies the dismal prospect of more tax rises and spending cuts, given what this may do to alreadystuttering hopes of growth.Stock marketstumbled worldwidebut Trump seems past caring about that, or even about how ordinary Americans will react to the now inevitable price rises at home – not just on imported brands but on American-made ones involving foreign components. Instead, the president seems caught up in his own spectacle: the suspense stoked by refusing to brief friendly governments in advance, the made-for-TV drama of bringing a retired car-plant worker onstage to hail the supposed return of manufacturing to Detroit, the plot twists as he escalates or retreats. AsCanada and Mexico have discovered, Trump can lift tariffs unexpectedly quickly but then just as suddenly come back for more, and the fact they had trade deals with the US did not protect them. Now we’re all strapped to the same mad rollercoaster.It could be a long ride. Buried in that rambling speech was a tacit admission that tariffs abroad are raising funds for big tax cuts at home. That suggests Britons may end up paying with their jobs and prosperity for already wealthy Americans – those who can absorb higher prices now, and who don’t lose their jobs amid the unwinding of global supply chains – to get richer. Some special relationship that is. But it also implies that Trump will keep pushing the tariff button until the coffers are full enough, an outcome over which Britain has minimal influence. (We may have escaped relatively lightly this time less because of our Trump-whispering skills – other countries who tried buttering him up weren’t spared – than by being a service-based economy whose balanced trade with the US put us on the right side of a crude mathematical ledger.) Where political judgment could, however, make a difference is closer to home, as the various crises triggered by Trump start converging with each other.The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds,avoided denyingthis morning that he is considering nationalising British Steel, badly hit by a separate Trump tariff on steel. But that it’s even being considered is a sign of the times: defence manufacturing relies on steel, and a country forced into rapidly rearming will need a secure supply.Britain’s proposed trade deal, meanwhile, risks getting tangled up in a culture warpursued by JD Vanceand other key White House figures, seeking to impose their values – unfettered free speech, militant Christianity, deep suspicion of any regulation restricting profits – on a resistant Europe.This week it emerged that US government officials are “monitoring” the seemingly obscure British case of the anti-abortion protesterLivia Tossici-Bolt, who is challenging a fixed-penalty notice for allegedly breaching the legal buffer zone around a Bournemouth abortion clinic (designed to protect women being intimidated when seeking treatment). Washington is, apparently, “concerned about freedom of expression” in Britain. Though Reynolds stressed the case wasn’t raised in trade talks, the timing doesn’t seem wholly irrelevant.Perilous and chaotic, Trump’s ‘liberation day’ endangers the world’s broken economy – and him | Martin KettleRead moreNor does the fact that US officials havechallengedthe British regulator Ofcom about new laws on online social harms, aimed at removing illegal material and protecting children from harmful content. A chronically online White House seems to be trying to force itself not just into a debate over the tax treatment of American tech giants, but over thetoxic effectsof social media platforms on our everyday lives. If Brits don’t want to stew in an angry, poisonous, fake-news-addled information ecosystem any more than we want to eatchlorine-washed American chicken, that should be our sovereign choice. But will it?Starmer’s main aim for now is characteristically to sit tight and say little. There will be no instant retaliation, justweeks of consultationon what one may look like if it happened, and no revoking of Trump’s state visit. The government will push doggedly to get that trade deal signed, no matter how limited the protection it offers. Starmer will try to drain some drama from the situation, refocus on May’s local elections – though arguing about potholes and bin collections feels mildly surreal now – and quietly identify any small opportunities arising from this latest crisis.Maybe Britain could benefit from a brain drain of talent across the Atlantic, as scientists and investors spooked by American political instability and arbitrary cuts to research grantsseek to leave. Maybe, as the IPPR argues, now is the time for Britain to go all in on electric car production.But this May’ssummit with the EUnow looks more crucial than ever in determining whether this crisis draws us closer to Europe or pushes us further apart. British and American fates are still very intimately entwined. But this president has knowingly upended first our security, then our prosperity.

Maybe take a holiday, learn to juggle, work on their chess openings … or anything,anything, that doesn’t involve writing an entire novel in a month.I am, of course, referring to the sad news that theonline writing community NaNoWriMo is calling it a dayafter more than 20 years in existence. The organisation, which has existed officially as a nonprofit since 2006, has been a source of inspiration to many amateur (and professional) writers who’ve needed the requisite kick up the bum to actually get stuff down on the page. Because although NaNoWriMo – short for National Novel Writing Month – existed all year round as a support group for writers, it was known chiefly for its November writing marathon – could you write 50,000 words in that month alone? Or, to put it another way, could you average 1,667 words a day over a 30-day period? Or, to put itanotherway, were you willing to go stark-raving crackers for a month?I was once willing. Back in 2021, without any preplanning whatsoever,I tried to bash out my own bestselling novel in a month, and wrote about it for the Guardian. It was a revealing experience – the only way to really hit the deadline was to write without ever looking back, without editing, without even reading what had gone before. The result was both a success and a failure. A success because I did indeed manage 50,000 words. Not only that, but I staggered on for another fortnight until my tome had an ending and clocked in at a whopping 69,803 words. That’s no mean feat for six weeks’ work! Even if I did have to write some of it while having a pint of blood removed at the Macmillan cancer centre in order to hit the deadline.So why was it a failure? Well, largely because the resulting novel was bobbins. It seemed destined to be bobbins before I started writing it. It felt like utter bobbinswhileI was writing it. And then, whenI read it back and reviewed it a year later, its status as complete and utter nonsense-level bobbins was confirmed.A friend of mine insists that the whole thing ruined my confidence in writing fiction, and I do like the idea that if it wasn’t for taking on this near-impossible challenge I would currently be swanning around the London literary circuit with a couple of Booker prizes hanging out of my back pocket. But the truth is that NaNoWriMo had little effect on me either way. If someone ever asks me if I have ever written a novel, I instinctively say no, before remembering that actually, technically, I have. It just doesn’t really feel like it. It isn’t something that I consider a proper novel. In fact, I’ve just had a horrible vision of my kids discovering the book after I’ve died and reading through it, thinking, “ah man, Dad really was deluded, wasn’t he?”. Or worse – trying to honour me by getting it published. Must burn it tonight.NaNoWriModidprove that I could knuckle down and do the grunt work if necessary, which is perhaps a nice thing to have in the back of your mind. But it didn’t make me into a writer. I didn’t have a good enough idea of what I wanted to say – and without the 1% inspiration, the 99% perspiration doesn’t really amount to much.But different people write in very different ways and I can see how, for a writer with a plan and a voice raring to go, NaNoWriMo could have been a gamechanger. The fact that it is having to shut down, in a world where the arts are under attack from the far right and artificial intelligence, is pretty depressing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

These were exacerbated by various controversies: an equivocating stance on AI and an alleged failure to investigate a serious accusation against a moderator among them. To me, the project seems rather like parkrun, someone’s sweet idea that became unimaginably big (over 400,000 participants were reported to have taken in 2022, up from 21 in its first year). Suddenly there are all these unanticipated problems and voices to deal with and the original spirit needed a serious structure behind it to continue thriving. Parkrun has risen to the challenge but NaNoWriMo evidently struggled.But if the organisation is no more, there’s no need for the idea itself to die. The internet is a very different place to what it was in 1999, and no doubt there will be people well placed to step into the gap it leaves, either by continuing the original idea (as Bluesky did with X) or reshaping it as something similar but different. Maybe even better.So perhaps budding writers will still be cranking out 50,000 words this November after all. Not me, though. I’ll be doing something much more beneficial for the world of literature, like working on my Nimzowitsch defence.Explore more on these topicsBooksCreative writingFictioncommentShareReuse this content"

Publication of precise tariff rates, went a cheerful line of advance thinking, would at least allow investors to assess the probable trade effects on the basis of hard information. True optimists clung to the idea that Donald Trump would not wish to risk a truly severe market reaction.That narrative was blown apart when the president reached for his pub-style display of wares. This really was a case of going back to the tariffs rates of the 1920s or 1930s. Not even thepenguins of Heard Island and the McDonald Islandswere spared.TheS&P 500 index fell 4%in early trading and is down more than 10% from its high six weeks ago. The dollar fell sharply even though traditional logic says tariffs ought to be currency-positive if $600bn (£457.5bn) of extra revenue is on cards. On this occasion, the market simply adjusted to the higher likelihood of a US recession from higher prices and slower growth.Instead of clarity, there are just more questions. The first is a common one with Trump announcements: how much is designed to be permanent and how much is theatre to provoke a negotiation?On that score, analysts noted the simplistic – or plain perverse – formula behind the administration’s tariff arithmetic. It seems to have taken a country’s trade deficit in goods with US, divided it by its exports to the US and called the resulting number a trade barrier that deserves a “reciprocal” US tariff. The underlying logic, it would appear, is that every country should always have a perfect trade balance with the US – never mind the impossibility of achieving that outcome, and never mind that the tariffs don’t affect trade in services.“We worry this risks lowering the policy credibility of the administration on a forward-looking basis,” said George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank. “The market may question the extent to which a sufficiently structured planning process for major economic decisions is taking place. After all, this is the biggest trade policy shift from the US in a century.”At a push, one could argue that such an unserious methodology is intended to encourage negotiations. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, tried to hint along those lines: “As long as you don’t retaliate, this is the high end of the number.”Yet the opposite conclusion is also valid: it is hard to negotiate with a US partner that, seemingly, isn’t interested in nuances, won’t distinguish between tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade and is simply obsessed with a country’s overall trade balance in goods.That leads to the second question of retaliation, especially from the EU and China. The latter took a February tariff skirmish on the chin but surely can’t afford to ignore a 34% reciprocal tariff that takes its total to 54%.Option A for China is probably a currency devaluation to restore competitiveness (but risking even higher tariffs from the US). Option B would be retaliatory tariffs. Option C would be the longer haul of trying to stir domestic demand. A combination of all three might be the outcome, but all promise further disruption.For the EU, all eyes are on how hard it goes with counter-tariffs to a blanket 20%. The bluntness of Trump’s move almost guarantees a response if only to demonstrate strength before an eventual negotiation. A quick resolution is not the way to bet.The third question is the biggest: what will Trump do when, as virtually every economist predicts, the tariffs backfire? Snap estimates among economists suggested they would take as much as 2 percentage points off US growth this year and add 3 percentage points to inflation. How much pain is Trump prepared to take in pursuit of his signature policy?What Trump’s tariffs could mean for UK consumersRead moreThe view from bond specialist Pimco is that we should be wary. “He is certainly not entirely impervious to a market decline, nor is he unaffected by public sentiment, significant congressional pushback or concerns about a recession,” says Libby Cantrill, its head of US public policy.“So, there is likely a limit to how much pain he and his administration are willing to endure in order to rebalance the economy, but when that is or what that looks like remains to be seen. For now, we should assume that his pain tolerance is pretty high and that tariffs stick around for a while.”That seems a reasonable assumption. Within the internal logic of his trade policy, Trump needs to serve up a tax cut for US workers to parade the “winnings” from his approach; only then could he dial down the tariffs. We are a very long way from that point – if it ever arrives. The political test will come if recession arrives first.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsInternational tradeTariffsGlobal economyEconomicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s why that’s a huge problemThu 3 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 08.45 EDTShareEveryone is talking aboutAdolescence, the television drama focused on toxic masculinity that has triggered a continuing social and political debate. But only a handful of people are talking about what the hit drama says about the real-time crisis unfolding in the British television industry – and that needs discussion too.Adolescence is everything public service broadcasting should be: hard-hitting programming featuring the kind of people often ignored in TV drama – in this case, white working-class families in the north – discussed at the school gate andin parliament.After its British writer, Jack Thorne, met Keir Starmer in Downing Street, it was revealed that Adolescence was to be rolled outfor freeacross all UK secondary schools.The free bit needs emphasising because, unlike traditional public service broadcasters behind classic hits fromCathy Come HometoMr Bates vs the Post Office, Adolescence was commissioned by Netflix, one of the US-based streamers whose subscription models have appeared like missile-loaded drones landing on cash-strapped British broadcasters.View image in fullscreenRay Brooks and Carol White star in the 1966 BBC drama Cathy Come Home.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyFor many of the 66 million viewers who helped make Adolescence themost-watched UK title on Netflix ever, such a statement will come across as typical through-a-glass-darkly Britishness, when such brilliant TV should only be a cause for celebration. Using British talent to tell universal stories to a global audience should be win-win. Netflix also deserves huge credit for trusting the brilliant Stephen Graham, as well as Thorne (who also wrote the platform’s recent hitToxic Town).But Adolescence is still a rarity for US giants like Netflix. Far more common a phenomenon is streamers such as Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Disney ratcheting up production prices for domestic broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV, which are already struggling with declining revenues. In their bid to produce more and more content to keep their global users happy, streamersspent £2.82bn on British-made contentin 2024, up £600m in a year. Such investment has driven up production and talent costs, with the total spent on high-end TV produced in the UK up 11% last year, despite more than 40 fewer premium projects being undertaken. So more money has to be spent making fewer shows.Faced with real-terms funding cuts ofmore than a thirdsince 2010, the BBC announced on Monday that it would cut spending oncontent by almost £150min the next financial year. It blamed this “unprecedented content funding challenge” on the fact that, as well as driving up prices, streamers such as Netflix no longer agreed to share costs and revenues with UK broadcasters in so-called co-production deals. Latest figures from the British Film Institute suggest that total spending by all domestic broadcasters last year fell to thelowest level of investment since 2019, ( once you have stripped out the anomaly of 2020, when Covid shut down all film and TV production).View image in fullscreenMark Rylance and Damian Lewis in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light.Photograph: Nick Briggs/BBC/Playground EntertainmentDoes any of this matter, given the glories of current British television and the fact that when savings are made on screen, it is often only insiders who notice? Of course it matters. Thorne indicated that one scene on Adolescence which used 300 extras – the school fire drill – would have been too expensive for a public service broadcaster. Peter Kosminsky, the much-garlanded director of Wolf Hall, admitted that on the BBC expensiveoutdoor sceneshad to be axed and the most highly paid people behind the award-winning drama, including himself and lead actor, Mark Rylance,had to take significant pay cutsto get it made. Kosminsky warned that, without intervention, the British TV industry would get squeezed out of the big TV drama market because of “the inflated cost environmentcreated here by the streamers”.TheProducers Alliance for Cinema and Television(Pact) – the lobby group for the whole industry – reveals that15 TV dramasgreenlit by UK public service broadcasters were then mothballed because of escalating costs. We hear about the impact on drama, but no less affected is factual entertainment, and series such asDavid Attenborough’s Planet Earth. They too are feeling the squeeze because of the death of production deals.So what can be done? Kosminsky has lobbied MPs fora 5% levyon all UK subscription streaming revenues, with the proceeds collected for a British cultural fund to spend on television content. This system would not only bring in more money than the existing, slightlycomplicated tax creditsystem for so-called high-end TV, but would help end the argument that everything should be done to encourage global streamers and their ilk to invest in UK talent.Politicians must also do their bit. Although keen to have tea with Thorne and theAdolescencecreators, Starmer and his government have so far done absolutely nothing to address the issue facing British television, or to harness its soft power potential.Because if not now, when? We stand at one of those moments when a TV show reminds us why television matters: television that is more than entertainment, television that makes us think and reflect on ourselves, television that moves the dial. That never came cheap, it never will – but it’s hard to overestimate its value.Jane Martinson is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTelevision industryOpinionAdolescenceNetflixBBCITVTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

I’d sell it now, but prices have droppedThu 3 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 11.13 EDTShareAfter our children left home, my wife and I decided to treat ourselves and buy a new car for a driving holiday in Europe. We’d been driving a family estate car for years, loading it up with kids and making trips to and from universities, but we wanted something for ourselves.As a surprise, she booked a test drive for the Tesla Model S for my birthday. It was unlike any car I’d been in before. I thought “Wow, this is amazing.” It felt like the future: a computer on wheels that was constantly updating with new features. I can’t say I feel that way now – and many people seem to share that view. Tesla sales figuresdeclined by 13% in the first few months of this year. Others feel even more uneasy:more than 200 demonstrations happened last weekendoutside company facilities around the world to protest against Elon Musk and the wrecking ball he has taken to the federal government.I had no complaints about the car itself: it was quiet. It was large. And, importantly for us, as an electric vehicle it was environmentally friendly. Some people go for the sports car when they gain a new sense of freedom in later life, but I had done a bit of research and wanted to move away from diesel and petrol.Despite people voicing concerns about a lack of charging infrastructure, I found Tesla’s network to be wonderful. We drove all over Europe – driving to Switzerland one year, Italy another, and last summer to the south of France. At one point we even packed in five adults and all their suitcases after an airport pickup.I would consider myself left-leaning, but buying an electric car wasn’t a huge political statement for us at the time, but rather an acknowledgment of the way things are going to be in the future. Little did I know how our choice would be politicised for us six years down the line.In the early years of owning the car I remember a neighbour saying: “What is it like to own a car built by a madman?” But I brushed it off. I had watched videos of Musk at Tesla events, and he seemed like a poor man’s Steve Jobs. Much like the Apple CEO, I saw Musk as a frontman rather than the designer and didn’t take much notice of the business owner.Soon it was impossible to ignore him. My wife and I were horrified as he publicly adopted rightwing positions – with his endorsement of Donald Trump for US president and then for thefar-right AfDin Germany, as well as his support forTommy Robinson. It seemed so odd to us that a man who would champion electric vehicles would also hold such reactionary views.I started to notice a shift in the Tesla owners’ group on Facebook. Having not owned an electric car before, the group was a useful resource. People were very helpful and even recommended places to stop off during our European holiday. When Musk’s politics began to grow more extreme, members began to post that they no longer felt comfortable owning a Tesla. And then others would respond: ““We’re not interested in your politics.” I saw someone giving stick to the Guardian and even calling the BBC “BBC Stalin”, which was funny for me as I always personally felt it went too far the other way.View image in fullscreenProtesters demonstrate against Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, during a nationwide Tesla Takedown rally outside a dealership in Pasadena, California.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesI started to reflect on owning a Tesla and it was my daughter who made the case for selling it. But judging by people posting secondhand cars in the Facebook group, prices have been dropping. I feel trapped. I cycled to meet a friend recently, and he took one look at my reasonably nice bike and said “It’s probably worth more than your Tesla now.” Someone else said to me he was interested in buying a Tesla, but he was going to wait until they were virtually worthless.It’s a shame as in every other way the car is a perfect match for our lifestyle. It’s cheap to run, easy to service and Tesla has a mobile repair service that dispatches a “ranger” to your house to fix any issues.If I was buying a car from scratch I would boycott the company, but we are where we are. For now I am going to have to keep hold of it. Next time, maybe I’ll get a European electric vehicle.

I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able.I rise tonight because I believe, sincerely, that our country is in crisis.And I believe that not in a partisan sense, because so many of the people that have been reaching out to my office – in pain, in fear, having their lives upended – so many of them identify themselves as Republicans.After months of surrender, the Democrats have finally stood up to Trump – thank you, Cory Booker | Emma BrockesRead moreIndeed, conversations from in this body, to in this building, to across my state – and recently in travel across the country – Republicans as well as Democrats are talking to me about what they feel as a sense of dread about a growing crisis, or what they point to about what is going wrong.The bedrock commitments in our country – that both sides rely on, that people from all backgrounds rely on – those bedrock commitments are being broken.Unnecessary hardships are being borne by Americans of all backgrounds. And institutions which are special in America, which are precious, which are unique in our country, are being recklessly – and I would say even unconstitutionally – affected, attacked, even shattered.In just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans’ safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy, and even our aspirations as a people. From our highest offices: a sense of common decency. These are not normal times in America, and they should not be treated as such.John Lewis – so many heroes before us – would say that this is the time to stand up, to speak up. This is the time to get in some good trouble, to get into necessary trouble. I can’t allow this body to continue without doing something different – speaking out. The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent. And we all must do more. We all must do more against them.But those 10 words: “If it is to be, it is up to me.” All of us have to think of those 10 words – 10 two-letter words: “If it is to be, it is up to me.” Because I believe generations from now will look back at this moment and have a single question: “Where were you? Where were you when our country was in crisis and when American people were asking for help? Help me. Help me.” Did we speak up?When 73 million American seniors, who rely on social security, were to have that promise mocked, attacked, and then to have the services undermined – to be told that there will be no one there to answer if you call for help – when our seniors became afraid and worried and panicked because of the menacing words of their president, of the most wealthy person in the world, of cabinet secretaries … Did we speak up?When the American economy, in 71 days – 71 days – has been upended, when prices at the grocery store were skyrocketing, and the stock market was plunging, when pension funds, 401(k)s, were going down, when Americans were hurting and looking up, where the resounding answer to this question was: “No.”Are you better off economically than you were 71 days ago? Where were you? Did you speak up?At a time when the president of the United States was launching trade wars against our closest allies, when he was firing regulators who investigate America’s biggest banks and biggest corporations – and stop them from taking advantage of the little guy, or the little gal, or my grandmother, or your grandfather – dismantling the agency that protects consumers from fraud, the only one whose sole purpose is to look out for them … Did you speak up?When the president of the United States, in a way that is so crass and craven, peddled his own meme coin and made millions upon millions upon millions of dollars for his own bank account – at a time so many are struggling economically – did you speak up?Did you speak up when the president of the United States did what amounts to a conman’s house – the White House – when the president tried to take healthcare away? Where were you? Did you speak up?Threatening a program called Medicaid, which helps people with disabilities, helps expectant mothers, helps millions upon millions of Americans – and why? Why? As part of a larger plan to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, who’ve done the best over the last 20 years.For billionaires who seem so close to the president that they sat right on the dais at his inauguration and sit in his cabinet meetings at the White House.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When international students were being disappeared from American streets without due process? When American universities were being intimidated into silence, challenging that fundamental idea of freedom of thought, freedom of expression?When the law firms that represent clients that may not be favored were attacked, and attacked, and attacked – where were you?

This is un-American. This is not who we are. This is not America.” Did you speak up?And so I rise tonight because I believe to be about what is normal right now, when so much abnormal is happening, is unacceptable.I rise tonight because silence at this moment of national crisis would be a betrayal of some of the greatest heroes of our nation. Because at stake in this moment is nothing less than everything that we brag about, that we talk about, that makes us special.At stake right now are some of our most basic American principles – principles that so many Americans understand are worth fighting for, worth standing for, worth speaking up for.Cory Booker is a US senator from New JerseyExplore more on these topicsCory BookerOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpTrump tariffsUS SenateUS CongressUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The British Transport Police were rapid in their response, unsuccessfully but immediately halting a Victoria line train to find him, before arresting him the next week on his own way tohisteam’s home match. Over a few months of back and forth updates with the BTP the case was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service.This Saturday at a sunny pub with my dad, among chatter about Tottenham’s seasons’ woes while an FA Cup tie played out on the TV screens I got an unexpected call from BTP for a final update. The CPS had decided there was not enough evidence to secure a conviction against the individual.I was sexually assaulted on a train after Spurs v Brentford while a dad and his sons laughedRead moreOf course I wasn’t naive enough to think this wasn’t a probable outcome. The train was disgustingly packed and the case officer had already explained the issue with securing usable footage from the train or even the platform. The officer subsequently explained that the footage recorded by the assaulter’s sons as they filmed the incident in bouts of laughter was not looked at because they are not the individuals under arrest. Essentially, the case was never going to go anywhere with the available evidence coming from such a crammed environment.Despite assuming the outcome, it was still a punch in the gut. I remembered his smug face looking at me as I asked him to stop, fully knowing he held all the power in that moment and that nobody would stop him. With the case now complete, I wonder if the arrest itself was a big enough wake-up call for the individual or if the outcome will empower him to keep up his toxic behaviour with the knowledge that he can essentially “get away with it”.The second punch in the gut would come a few hours later when I saw a post by Women of the Lane, a group set up to be a community and bridge between Spurs and women and non-binary fans, revealing their correspondence with the club over Chris Brown’s scheduled appearance at the stadium. I hadn’t even seen the announcement but in finding the event online I was disgusted.Spurs were forthcoming with their support over the assault on me, opening an encouraging and frank dialogue. They explained their numerous projects and plans that support women at Spurs, including becoming the first club to sign up to the mayor of London’s women’s safety charter, co-launching Women of the Lane, participating in Haringey council’s “Walk for Women” through Tottenham, and ongoing conversations with Transport for London on how to create a safer environment for travelling fans.The appearance of a man with convictions for violence and who was once subject to a five-year restraining order after his ex-girlfriend alleged he had been abusive, and who has previously been denied entry to the UK due to serious criminal offence, performing at the veryhomeof my and other women’s beloved football club is more than saddening and disappointing. It rocks the very bones of my fanship for the team I’ve followed and adored for most of my life, through thick and thin. The stadium may be a venue with shrewd revenue capabilities for the owners, but at the very heart is still ultimately the home ground for one of the biggest and oldest Premier League clubs.The email from Spurs reminding me to renew my season ticket is still lingering, unopened in my inbox. Owning a season ticket was once a dream of mine but that is now muddied, inviting a complex conundrum where I want to continue watching and enjoying my club’s football, yet continuously dreading every journey there and back, feeling anxious and tense as match day approaches and knowing that despite progress, the club is still platforming an abuser such as Chris Brown.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But with a club like Spurs in 2025, you somehow expect better, and begin to question whether these positive conversations are inherently just lip service. My mind keeps returning to the two teenage boys on the train, laughing and filming as their dad committed assault and verbally abused a woman on public transport. I’m not sure what the future of fanship in the men’s game holds, but with the unapologetic platforming of an abuser and the lack of retribution for those carrying out toxic behaviour, it doesn’t feel very hopeful.Explore more on these topicsFootballcommentShareReuse this content"

But there is this important difference. If an asteroid struck the Earth, the impact would at least have been caused by ungovernable cosmic forces. The assault on world trade, by contrast, is a completely deliberate act of choice, taken by one man and one nation.Donald Trump’s decision to imposetariffson every country in the world is a monstrous and momentous act of folly. Unilateral and unjustified, it was expressed on Wednesday in indefensible language in which Mr Trump described US allies as “cheaters” and “scavengers” who “looted”, “raped” and “pillaged” the US. Many of the calculations on which Mr Trump doled out his punishments are perverse, not least the exclusion of Russia from the condemned list. The tariffs mean prices are certain to rise in sector after sector, in the US and elsewhere, fuelling inflation and perhaps recession. Mr Trump will presumably respond as he did when asked about foreign cars becoming more expensive: “I couldn’t care less.”The tariffs – a minimum of 10% on all imports to the US, with higher levies on 60 nations that Mr Trump dubbed the “worst offenders” – throw a grenade into the rules-based global trading order. These are large hikes, not small ones, even for nations like Britain that have escaped the higher tariffs. They are indiscriminate between sectors, but highly discriminatory against nations, all of them, even to the extent of penalisinguninhabited islandsin Antarctica.They overturn the trading system established – under US leadership – atBretton Woodsafter the second world war. In effect, the nation that has underpinned the global economy for the last 80 years has expelled itself from the trading system it always led. That system’s cardinal principle – that countries in the World Trade Organization should treat one another equally – was blown apart on Wednesday.The announcement ceremony conveyed the thrill Mr Trump derives from bullying and domination. A month after shutting down US development aid,his punishment listembodies special contempt for the world’s poor – 47% tariffs on Madagascar, the world’sninth poorestcountry, for instance, or 44% on devastated Myanmar. While much pre-announcement rhetoric was directed at China, some of the toughest tariffs have been inflicted on countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos. The impact on US soft power is likely to be devastating.The British government is trying tokeep calmand carry on. Like its trustworthy trading allies, Britain must do what it can to maintain the rules-based trading system. But economic war is clearly beckoning. The trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said on Thursday that even the UK is now preparing a list ofreciprocaltariffs on US goods. It is particularly vital that Britain defends itsinterestsin food and health systems, and against digitaltech giants.Any idea that Britain is a kind of winner in these circumstances, thanks to Brexit, is nonsensical. This country’s supposedly closest ally, the US, has just hiked the cost to British exporters by 10%, with an even greater rise of 25% in the case of steel, aluminium and cars. The consequences of Mr Trump’s tariffs will not be restricted to world trade but will impact on the global economic system more generally. This is a macro moment. It will require macro responses.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

More than 50,000 people have been killed, according to Palestinian health authorities. More are starving because Israel has cut off aid. The offensive is intensifying again – with 100 children killed or maimed each day since Israel resumed heavy strikes last month, the UNreports.Even so, Israel’skilling of 15 Palestinian paramedics and rescue workersis particularly chilling. Though they died on 23 March, it took days for Israel to grant access to the site, the UN said. Another man was last seen in Israeli custody. Two grounds for seeing this not only as tragic but as a war crime stand out. The first is that the UN says the men were shot “one by one”, and a forensic expertsaidthat preliminary evidence “suggests they were executed, not from a distant range”, given the “specific and intentional” locations of bullet wounds. Two witnessessaidsome of the bodies had their hands or legs tied. Prisoners are protected by the Geneva conventions. The second is that medics also enjoyspecific protections.Though the vehicles were clearly marked, the Israel Defense Forces claim that they were “advancing suspiciously” without headlights or emergency signals, a claim disputed bythe sole located survivor. They also allege, without providing evidence, that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants were among those killed. What is indisputable is the broader pattern of attacks on rescue and health workers. More than 1,000 medics have been killed across Gaza,according to a Guardian investigation, and hospitals reduced to ruins. The World Health Organization says about 300 medical staff have been detained. Several have subsequently described torture, beatings, starvation and humiliation. Doctors who have volunteered in Gaza see a systematic assault upon healthcare and the respected community figures working in the sector.None of this appears of great concern to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister. The international criminal court (ICC) hasissued a warrant for his arreston war crimes charges, but as he visited Hungary on Thursday, Budapestannounced it was withdrawingfrom the court. Donald Trump has emboldened all of those who see the ICC as an enemy and law itself as optional.The president’s plan for the USto “take over” Gaza, dependent on the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, made it all the easier for Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, to say that it will “seize large areas” of the territory. The right has long wanted a land grab. Israel has already extended buffer zones dramatically since the murderous Hamas raids of October 2023 triggered this war.That Mr Katz’s warning came in a week where Mr Netanyahu testified again in his corruption trial, and gave evidence to police (though not as a suspect) over a separate scandal involving allegedlinks between his aides and Qatar, was striking. The prime minister’s political survival remains linked to an endless war, to the despair of the families of the remaining Israeli hostages, as well as Palestinians.The Israeli military says it is investigating the 23 March killings, but only an independent inquiry will suffice. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, described Gaza as the deadliest place on Earth for humanitarian workers and rightly said that those responsible must be held accountable. In an age where impunity flourishes, crimes will multiply. Those who believe in justice must redouble their support for the embattled international institutions seeking to uphold it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Such an open-minded view risks overoptimism. Keynes’s support for the idea of tariffs was limited to specific short-term need, as in protection of fledgling industry. But Keynes knew well the harm of tariffs as long-term economic policy.Far from being uncertain, it is inevitable that Trump’s tariffs will fail. The deep interconnectedness of international supply chains means Americans will see a swift rise in inflation (that key growth-killer Trump campaigned to reduce) as indispensable worldwide component imports push up the price of domestic US goods and the reverse is repeated around the world.The only question is: how long is Trump prepared to punish the American people with this economic naivety? Be it tariffs, Ukraine, Russia, funding of federal services, overseas aid or giving licence to expansionist aggression, it is clear that, echoing our own Brexit self-harm, “learning the hard way” is actually the new world order that Trump embodies.Nick MayerSouthamptonThe main focus of comment regarding Trump’s tariffs has been on the dire economic impact around the world as globalisation comes to an end. My bigger fear is the longer-term geopolitical impact. Globalisation has led to a rise in living standards across the world, and China’s focus on growth has diverted it from an expansionist foreign policy.If, or rather when, world recession hits, China’s leaders and other authoritarian rulers will be tempted to turn to foreign adventures, including war, to distract their populations from their economic worries, with war having the added bonus that the young men who usually lead protests will be conscripted. If they object, they will be depicted as traitors, justifying harsh repressive measures.The Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930 were intended to boost the US economy after the 1929 Wall Street crash, and we know how that worked out (and Trump’s appeasing of Putin over Ukraine completes the very worrying picture).Adrian CoskerHitchin, HertfordshireThe Office for Budget Responsibility last week warned that the “most” severe scenario, in which the UK and other nations retaliated to US tariffs, would result in GDP being 0.6% lower than expected this year and 1% lower next year (Trump hits UK with 10% tariffs as he ignites global trade war, 2 April). The self-imposed disaster that was Brexit has lowered GDP, it is estimated, by 4%. Has the British government considered the economic sense of joining Europe, I wonder, in order to “protect British industry” as the prime minister has stated in relation to Trump’s tariffs?Gary NethercottWoodbridge, SuffolkThere was I thinking it would take a socialist revolution to bring down global capitalism. Mammon certainly moves in a mysterious way, its blunders to perform.Karen BarrattWinchesterI am surprised that San Serriffe was not included in the list of countries subjected to Donald Trump’s tariffs, along with the Antarctic islands only inhabited by penguins.

Do young women really think so poorly of men?, 31 March). As many surveys have shown – most recently in astudyby Humboldt University – straight men are more likely to be dependent on their female partners and cope worse after separation or divorce.Connolly suggests that online statements of “heteropessimism” are not being acted on, but Office for National Statistics figures from 2023 show a continuing increase insingle householdsof all ages – a phenomenon that has persisted over the last few decades despite increasing social precarity, spiralling housing costs and what the US sociologist Bella DePaulo describes as the “singles tax” – the financial disadvantage incurred by those who live alone or are unmarried.As married and partnered women continue to bear a greater burden of housework and childcare in the home, perhaps it’s time to forget the stereotype of the emotionally over-demanding woman and instead look at the actual labour burden placed on wives and, particularly, mothers – and how our social structures enforce and exacerbate this.Josephine GrahlStratford, LondonRachel Connolly’s musings on “heteropessimism” and young women’s attitudes to relationships with young men reminded me of Marge Piercy’s Body of Glass, published more than 30 years ago, when the main character, Shira, trying to survive in the decimated US of 2059, has a very satisfactory intimate relationship with a robot designed to protect and defend the population.The robot, Yod, turns out to be a wonderful lover, parent and defender of the rights of women, enabling Shira to regain custody of her son and reunite with her family of origin. Interestingly, Yod kills the ex-husband, but it’s hard to deduce whether he, as a robot defender, is guilty of a crime, or simply doing what he was programmed to do.

Ange Postecoglou, the remorselessly under-fire Tottenham manager, had been barracked by his own supporters when he replaced Lucas Bergvall with Pape Sarr in the 64th minute. Like every other Spurs player, Bergvall had struggled to impose himself but the fans do like him.“You don’t know what you’re doing,” they informed Postecoglou. So just imagine how the fiercely proud Australian must have felt shortly afterwards when Sarr won the ball off Moisés Caicedo and unloaded a low shot from distance, which theChelseagoalkeeper, Robert Sánchez, inexplicably allowed to beat him.Chelsea v Tottenham: Premier League – liveRead moreWell, we would not need to imagine because Postecoglou showed us. In full view of the press box behind him, he turned to face the Spurs fans, who were lost in celebration, and cupped his ear in their direction before standing and staring at them.In the moment it was impossible to believe this was anything other than hostility from Postecoglou boiling over. There have been flashpoints before between him and the supporters. Remember the scenes after the defeat at Bournemouth in December? Postecoglou’s attempt to backtrack in his post-match interviews, claiming he merely wanted to revel in the celebrations, to hear the cheers, was bizarre to say the least. The ear-cup is not open to interpretation.There would be a twist when the VAR, Jarred Gillett, went over the Sarr challenge on Caicedo and he did not need to look too long to see the foul, although he still took about six minutes. Sarr had kicked Caicedo’s knee. The goal was disallowed. Sarr was booked. Postecoglou raged inside.Chelsea had been in complete control up until the Bergvall/Sarr change, leading through Enzo Fernández’s header, the only wonder being how they were not further ahead. Guglielmo Vicario made a sensational save to deny Jadon Sancho. The outstanding Caicedo saw a goal chalked off by the VAR. Spurs had failed to do the very basics, pretty much all of them, beginning with carrying some sort of fight.View image in fullscreenEnzo Fernández heads Chelsea in front early in the second half.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesThe weird thing was that as passions raged and the game broke up, Spurs fashioned something of a revival. They got onto the front foot and it was possible to feel a few nerves among the Chelsea support. Enzo Maresca’s team would be indebted to Sánchez for a fine save from Son Heung-min just before the board went up to show 12 additional minutes.It was difficult in the extreme though to make the case for Spurs. The rally could not obscure the fault-lines and this was a game for which Postecoglou had all of his main players available – apart from the injured Dejan Kulusevski. For the manager, it was four of the most unwanted kind, a fourth defeat out of four against Chelsea across two seasons. And, to extend the poker analogy, it was easy to wonder whether we were looking at a busted flush.When it was all over, Postecoglou deliberately avoided following his players over to the end that housed the travelling fans. There was no applause from him towards them. In the build-up to the game Postecoglou had admitted there was “maybe a large portion of Tottenham fans who have lost a bit of faith and belief in what we’re doing.” There was little to redress the balance.Maresca’s sights are on a Champions League finish. Beforehand he had said that six more wins would suffice. This was No 1, something to fire momentum for the challenges ahead. Postecoglou, meanwhile, can see the season and probably his future resting on the Europa League, in which his team face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals. This was a tune-up that fell flat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He almost got in with less than a minute gone, bursting between Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven to prod goalwards. Vicario half-blocked and when Van de Ven’s panicked clearance hit Jackson, the ball ricocheted against a post and away.Chelsea were in the mood from the outset, pushing high, dominating the duels. Spurs struggled to get out. Postecoglou felt the frustration bubble. He delivered a rollicking to Bergvall in the 20th minute after the midfielder failed to track a run into the area by Palmer, who crossed low. Destiny Udogie made a saving challenge on Fernández in front of goal.Chelsea were able to find spaces in between the lines, to work their passing patterns whereas Spurs were tentative on the ball, gripped by anxiety. Time and again they misplaced passes. Son fired in a low shot from a tight angle, which Sánchez shovelled away but that was it from them as an attacking force in the first half.It was frustrating for Chelsea that they could not take a lead into the interval. Malo Gusto had rifled into the side-netting on eight minutes and there was the staggeringly good Vicario reflex save from Sancho’s close-range blast in stoppage-time.Chelsea continued to dominate after the restart, Palmer working Vicario and then crossing for Fernández to head home. Spurs’s defensive structure had broken down. Fernández was unmarked. Spurs caught a break when Caicedo fizzed home a volley after the visitors had half-cleared a set piece only for the VAR to rule that Levi Colwill was offside in the middle. After Van de Ven had gone close at the other end, the next VAR intervention would shape the story.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

You could see a lot of players grew in confidence and are in a good place.”Wiegman revealed that both the Brighton forward Fran Kirby and the Arsenal winger Chloe Kelly will miss the first Belgium match with “little niggles”, although she was hopeful they might be back for Tuesday’s game in Leuven.“It’s really disappointing for them because they are in a very good place,” ­Wiegman said. “It’s disappointing for the team.”Kirby was seen training individually on Thursday while Kelly was the only squad member not on the pitch. England remain without longer-term absentees including Alex Greenwood, Lauren Hemp and Georgia Stanway, so the biggest selection headache for Wiegman is in goal, and a choicebetween Hannah Hampton and Mary Earps.England are joint top of their Nations League group with four points from two games, alongside Portugal, after the Lionesses’1-0 win over the world champions Spainat Wembley in February. They know two victories against a Belgium side ranked 20th in the world would probably put them in a commanding position in the group, but Wiegman will also be conscious that England lost their most recent meeting with ­Belgium,away in October 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here is a look through the chances of all 34 contendersGreg WoodThu 3 Apr 2025 08.36 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 14.09 EDTShare1) I AM MAXIMUS (age 9, weight 11st 12lb)There was a lot going on in the spring of 1974. Abba won Eurovision, Manchester United were relegated and Red Rum became the most recent horse to win theGrand Nationalunder what was then the top weight of 12 stone. Just over half a century later, last year’s winner will attempt to emulate the greatest Aintree hero of them all and defy top weight, and though he is higher in the ratings, he won so readily 12 months ago that he would surely have done so with another 8lb on his back. Lacklustre in two runs this campaign but Willie Mullins will have been working backwards from here and he seems highly likely to leave that form behind now he is back at the scene of his greatest triumph.Verdict: classy acceleration to sealvictory last year, big chance to repeat from 8lb higher mark2) ROYALE PAGAILLE (11yo, 11st 9lb)It is a sign of the consistently high standard in a modern National that several runners towards the top of the weights have previously won a race at Grade One level – the pinnacle of jumps racing. Only Venetia Williams’s 11-year-old, though, has done so in the current season, having landed the Betfair Chase at Haydock for the second year running back in November. He is very much a Haydock specialist, however and also prefers deep ground to show his best form, so two important boxes remain unticked, while 11 would be an unusually advanced age for a modern National winner.Verdict: top-class at Haydock and when the mud is flying. Will not have either here3) NICK ROCKETT (8yo, 11st 8lb)The six-runner squad from Willie Mullins’s stable this year is two short of last year’s eight-strong challenge, but there is more strength in depth and this is the third Mullins runner near the top of the weights with very plausible claims. Spring ground seems to bring out the best in him and he was a close third – behind yet another fancied stable companion, Minella Cocooner – in the big end-of-season chase at Sandown last year. Also has fair form with both Intense Raffles and Perceval Legallois, albeit on better terms than today’s, and with Patrick Mullins holding the reins, a first father/son success since Papillon for Ted and Ruby Walsh in 2000 is no forlorn hope.Verdict: loves spring ground and in the mix, but worse off with a couple of rivals on recent form4) GRANGECLARE WEST (9yo, 11st 8lb)Arrives atAintreehaving had the bare minimum of six starts over fences required to qualify for the line-up, and one of the half-dozen was a Grade One win and another, a close second in the Irish Gold Cup in February with two subsequent Cheltenham Festival winners further down the field. It is the profile of a horse with untapped potential and must have made him a devilishly difficult runner for Martin Greenwood, the handicapper, to assess, but the decision to give him just 4lb less to carry than last year’s comfortable winner, for his first start beyond an extended three miles, does not scream Good Samaritan levels of generosity.Verdict: decent form already and best days still ahead of him but not cut much slack by the handicapperView image in fullscreenGrangeclare West has the profile of a horse with untapped potential.Photograph: Seb Daly/Sportsfile/Getty Images5) HEWICK (10yo, 11st 7lb)Came with a rare old rattleto win the King George VI Chase, one of the season’s most prestigious Grade One events, at Kempton in December 2023, prompting raucous scenes in the winner’s enclosure as Shark Hanlon, his larger-than-life trainer, led the celebrations as only he can. Technically at least, he switched to Tara Lee Cogan mid-season while the trainer served a six-month suspension, but Hanlon returned in time to saddle him for a confidence-boosting win over hurdles last month. A high-class chaser who stays well and loves spring ground, and very much in the mix.Verdict: the 2023 King George winner will love the ground and the trip but might lack a gear-change when it matters6) MINELLA INDO (12yo, 11st 3lb)The winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup, no less, back in 2021, and a very commendable third in this race 12 months ago having held a narrow lead over the last. For a stride or two, it looked as though Rachael Blackmore might be on the way to a second National triumph, but his age started to show as I Am Maximus, three years his junior, sprinted clear on the run-in. This is his second chance to become only the third horse – after Golden Miller and L’Escargot – to win both the Gold Cup and the National, but he is just 1lb lower in the weight ratings and a whole year older this time around, so will do well just to match last year’s performance.Verdict: big run last year and can’t get classier than a Gold Cup winner but may have missed best chance7) APPRECIATE IT (11yo, 11st 2lb)Seemed to have the jumping world at his hooves after running out a 24-length winner of the Supreme Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham in March 2021, but has had a stop-start career ever since and a six-length win in January was his first since his novice season in in 2022/23. Like his stable companion, Grangeclare West, he is running in a handicap for the first time, but has much more form in the book to give the assessor a steer and looks far less likely to improve for the marathon trip.Verdict: outstanding novice over hurdles, yet to show same form over fences or at an extended tripView image in fullscreenThe form of Appreciate It has been patchy since his successful novice season.Photograph: AFP/Getty Images8) MINELLA COCOONER (9yo, 11st 2lb)The fifth representative of Team Mullins in the top nine in the weights is without a win this season, but that has not stopped him creeping steadily closer to the market leaders in the betting in recent weeks as the likelihood of decent ground has increased. His popularity is not simply down to a narrow success on good going in last season’s Bet365 Gold Cup – although it is a compelling piece of form in the circumstances – but also a close third behind Intense Raffles in last year’s Irish Grand National. Behind both Nick Rockett and Intense Raffles in the Bobbyjo in February but will find the Aintree trip and conditions right up his street if, as seems likely, the National has been the plan for the best part of a year.Verdict: right blend of speed, class and stamina for a modern National, but yet to show his best form this year9) CONFLATED (11yo, 11st 2lb)A dual Grade One winner in Ireland back in 2022, but without a win of any kind since the second of those successes and beat just one rival home on his sole start at anything close to the National trip. Has been keeping decent company for the most part and travelled well in a handicap at Cheltenham last time until a bad mistake two out. There are few runners this year that can be easily dismissed, and here’s the exception to prove the rule.Verdcit: one-time top chaser under the right conditions. This isn’t the time, or the right conditions10) STUMPTOWN (8yo, 11st 2lb)Gavin Cromwell briefly had the 3-1 National favourite in his yard before Inothewayurthinkin, the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, was scratched in mid-March, but his other winner at last month’s Cheltenham festival - where he carried top weight to victory in the Cross Country Handicap – could prove a very able deputy. Several Aintree heroes of recent years, including the dual winner Tiger Roll, have either won or run well over those unusual obstacles as an Aintree prep, and it was noticeable that Stumptown’s stamina did not kick in until very late in the day.Verdict: Cross Country winner at Cheltenham under top weight, well in on these terms if he runs to the same level11) HITMAN (9yo, 11st 1lb)Part-owned by Sir Alex Ferguson but has developed a very un-Fergie-like habit of succumbing to last-gasp defeats. Finished second for the third year running in the Denman Chase at Newbury in February - the 10th time in all that he has filled the runner-up’s spot in 23 starts over fences – and appeared to be simply outstayed by the winner, which does not bode well for his chance of getting home over an extra mile-and-a-quarter.Verdict: outstayed over 3m last time, even the Hairdryer Treatment from part-owner Sir Alex unlikely to get him homeView image in fullscreenThe Alex Ferguson-owned Hitman.Photograph: Shutterstock12) BEAUPORT (9yo, 11st 1lb)Bryan Burrough’s blue and orange colours are already a part of Aintree folklore having been aboard Jenny Pitman’s Corbiere, the first National winner saddled by a female trainer, in 1983. Forty-two years on, his latest contender has Grade One quality over hurdles allied with limitless stamina, as evidenced by wins in both the Midlands and Berkshire Nationals in 2024. His previously iffy jumping has also been much improved this season, and the course should be more forgiving than it was in Corbiere’s era if he does throw in the odd mistake. All in all, Nigel Twiston-Davies’s gelding has plenty in the credit column for a horse priced up at 33-1 and each-way backers could get a big run for their money.Verdict: dual winner of lesser Nationals and Grade One quality over hurdles: the potential sweet spot for Aintree these days?13) BRAVEMANSGAME (10yo, 11st)Few would have believed it after his wide-margin win in the King George VI Chase at Kempton in December 2022, but the Boxing Day feature is still the most recent victory on his record after 11 subsequent starts and there have been distinct signs in recent months of irreversible decline. Paul Nicholls, of course, has a fine record of bringing horses back to their best on the big days, but he has also looked like a weak finisher at time and younger, keener rivals are likely to have his measure.Verdict: top-class at his best but on a long losing run and decline has been gathering paceView image in fullscreenBravemansgame’s last win came in the King George at Kempton in 2022.Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images14) CHANTRY HOUSE (11yo, 10st 13lb)A prolific winner in his novice season over fences, including a Grade One double at the Cheltenham and Aintree festivals in 2021, but has become increasingly unreliable with age and acquired a Timeform “squiggle”. Was an odds-shot when he became JP McManus’s 4,000th winner as an owner when he won the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham in 2022, but his chance of becoming McManus’s fourth winner of the Grand National are at least 50 points bigger.Verdict: useful novice chaser but nothing like the force of old and less reliable by the season15) THREEUNDERTHRUFIVE (10yo, 10st 12lb)His fourth-place finish in the Scottish Grand National in 2023 is a standout piece of form in the context of this race, but two years later it looks more like a career-high. Also looks like something of an Ascot specialist these days – which is a right-handed track, unlike left-handed Aintree – so his fair run into a close second there last time out is perhaps not as encouraging as it might seem. Does at least have consistency on his side, but it takes much more than that to win a National.Verdict: a sound jumper and stayer who is likely to get round, but a big career-best required to make the frame16) PERCEVAL LEGALLOIS (8yo, 10st 12lb)Like Stumptown, a runner for Gavin Cromwell’s Gold Cup-winning yard, and a fascinating “dark” horse to boot. He landed an ultra-competitive handicap hurdle at Leopardstown in February, backing up a win in a similarly warm race over fences at the same track at Christmas when Nick Rockett was back in fourth, and he renews rivalry on 2lb better terms. In early versions of the legend of the Knights of the Round Table, it was Perceval Legallois, and not Sir Galahad, who was packed off to look for the Holy Grail. His latter-day namesake might just be the one to bring it home on Saturday.Verdict: big-field form, on the upgrade and potential improver for the step up, a must for any shortlistView image in fullscreenPerceval Legallois will be among the favourites at Aintree on Saturday.Photograph: Seb Daly/Sportsfile/Getty Images17) KANDOO KID (9yo, 10st 11lb)Put away until the National weights were out after winning one of the most competitive handicap chases in the first part of the year, and the sense of satisfaction mixed with expectation that radiated from Paul Nicholls on that chilly November afternoon is still fresh in the mind. A pity, then, that he put a distinct blot on his form back at Newbury in early March, finishing a lacklustre eighth over two-and-a-half miles. He should improve for the return to a more suitable trip, but there is still a nagging sense that you should not be trying to make excuses for a potential National winner.Verdict: fair chance on his winning form in November but nowhere close to that level last time18) IROKO (7yo, 10st 11lb)The only runner from a British stable priced up below 20-1 and deservedly so, despite what is, on the face of it, a somewhat uninspiring record of just one win in seven starts over fences. Came good in the spring of his novice season over hurdles with a win at the Cheltenham festival, and his half-dozen starts since a winning chase debut have all carried hints that he is building up to something big. Latest second behind the top-class Grey Dawning was a new career-best on ratings and he was staying on again at the line. Arguably little juice left in his price, but a big chance all the same.Verdict: plenty in the book to suggest he is building towards a big run, arrives off new career-best19) INTENSE RAFFLES (7yo, 10st 10lb)It’s all been about the National for Tom Gibney’s seven-year-old since his win in the Irish Grand National in April last year. There were two low-key runs over hurdles – where he finished ninth of 20 and 14th of 19, not that it matters – before the Aintree weights came out, and then a much-improved return to fences in the Bobbyjo at Navan, often a key Aintree trial. He was second behind Nick Rockett there but looked much the likelier of the pair to appreciate a return to a well-run race over a longer trip.Verdict: has been aimed at this for the last 11 months, and track, trip and weight all look idealView image in fullscreenCan Intense Raffles become the first grey to win the race since Neptune Collonges in 2012?Photograph: Morgan Treacy/Shutterstock20) SENIOR CHIEF (8yo, 10st 10lb)Arrives with the minimum six races required to get a run, and was a big fancy for the valuable Coral Gold Cup at Newbury in November where he ran well to finish sixth, though his jumping was a little ragged in the closing stages. It’s arguable that jumping isn’t the key here any more, however, and has a very fair weight for a horse with his best days in front of him. Rachael Blackmore could have ridden him, though, and opted for Minella Indo instead, which dampens enthusiasm slightly.Verdict: attractive profile for a modern National contender, but passed over by the stable jockey21) IDAS BOY (11yo, 10st 10lb)A rebuff to anyone who claimed that the romance of the Grand National is dead, Richard Phillips’s 11-year-old was bought for £60,000 a few months ago by a group of friends styling themselves the Dozen Dreamers. In their dreams is the only place he is likely to be making much of a show, though, as there is next to nothing in his form to offer encouragement and every reason to think he is on the downslope of his career.Verdict: cheaper for his owners to buy a grandstand ticket, but not nearly as much fun24) FIL DOR (7yo, 10st 9lb)Has a rating that gets him a run in a National thanks to a decent career in mainly second-tier events over fences, and after an excellent season as a four-year-old over hurdles. But there’s just one win on his record – in a two-horse race at odds of 1-50 – since he was sold for an eye-watering €620,000 in February 2024, and has no form over an extended trip to suggest that he will repay any of that on Saturday. Ouch.Verdict: has not matched his hurdling form over fences and nothing in the book over a marathon tripView image in fullscreenFil Dor could struggle with the four-mile plus distance at Aintree.Photograph: Seb Daly/Sportsfile/Getty Images23) BROADWAY BOY (7yo, 10st 9lb)Noble Yeats, at 50-1, broke the long losing streak of seven-year-olds in the National just three years ago, which shows it can be done. He did at least arrive at Aintree in decent form, though, whereas this one is struggling to recapture his early promise earlier in the season. Ran Kandoo Kid to less than two lengths in the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury in November but has been way below his best in two outings since and his run in the Ultima at Cheltenham – when he set off as a fancied 11-1 shot – was too bad to be true.Verdict: realistic chance on his best form this season, none at all on his latest start24) COKO BEACH (10yo, 10st 9lb)Back for his fourth attempt to win a Grand National, after three previous outings with no whiff of a reason to think he has it in him to win. Was an obvious non-stayer in both 2022 and 2023 after racing up with the pace for a circuit-and-a-half, and then again last year under a more restrained ride, when he crossed the line 33 lengths behind I Am Maximus. If you picked him in the office sweep, it is definitely not your lucky day.Verdict: proven non-stayer in 2022, never mind 2023 and 2024, and you can’t change what’s in their genes25) STAY AWAY FAY (8yo, 10st 9lb)Had three different jockeys in as many days earlier in the week, as first Bryony Frost and then Jonathan Burke informed Paul Nicholls that, having agreed to take the ride, they had to stay home to wash their hair. Or something. In Burke’s case, the something was a booking for a very live contender in Minella Cocooner (and Frost was required in France) but the bottom line is that this is a horse struggling – and failing – to recapture the form of his youth over hurdles, when he was a Grade One winner in the three-mile novice at Cheltenham.Verdict: jockeys have been getting off him instead of trying to get on, best to take the hintView image in fullscreenStay Away Fay has jockeys staying away.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images26) MEETINGOFTHEWATERS (8yo, 10st 7lb)The last of Willie Mullins’s six runners in weight order is a lot further down the list than his five stable companions, a point that the trainer noted favourably when the handicap was published in February. But it is much the same mark that he had last year – 1lb higher, in fact – and he was 16 lengths behind I Am Maximus at the line then, while his two chase starts this season have not suggested that his form has gone up another notch or two.Verdict: same sort of chance as 12 months ago, no recent signs he might find the necessary improvement27) MONBEG GENIUS (9yo, 10st 6lb)Hit the headlinesin the run-up to this race last year amid speculation that Jonjo O’Neill’s gelding might be among the £75m of assets of his former owners, Doug Barrowman and Michelle Mone, that had been frozen during an investigation into £202m of contracts awarded to their firm PPE Medpro during the Covid-19 pandemic. He was, as it turned out, free to race, butwas scratcheda few weeks before Aintree and later sold to new owners at the O’Neill yard. It is, on the face of it, the kind of tangled back story that often attaches itself to a National winner, and he broke a long losing run on heavy ground at Uttoxeter last time out. Quicker ground at Aintree will be a big issue, though, as all he does is stay.Verdict: ended long losing run on heavy going last time but needs it deep to slow the others down28) VANILLIER (10yo, 10st 6lb)Lost his way somewhat after a fine staying-on second behind Corach Rambler in this race two years ago, when he started his run from the outskirts of Ormskirk, but blinkers for his last two starts, both over cross-country courses, have sparked a definite renaissance and he did particularly well to finish eight lengths behind Stumptown at Cheltenham last month having lost all of that and more when his jockey nearly took the wrong course. Place claims at least on that form, though one or two rivals might do him for speed from the last.Verdict: probably missed best chance two years ago but place claims on recent form with big fancy Stumptown29) HORANTZAU D’AIRY (8yo, 10st 6lb)If there is a runner in this year’s that screams “Netflix mini-series”, it has to be this one. Bought online via the racing equivalent of eBay, and sent to a young Newmarket trainer less than six months into his solo career who has yet to saddle a single winner over jumps. Newmarket has not produced a National winner since Golden Miller in the 1930s so the plotlines are all there for one of the great Aintree stories, and Michael Keady’s runner is at least a sound jumper who should get around. What really takes some believing, though, is that Willie Mullins would ever let him go if he felt he still had a Grand National in him.Verdict: fairytale runner for young trainer, but sold for a reason by the best stable in the businessView image in fullscreenHorantzau D’airy; the horse with an amazing backstory may come up short on Saturday.Photograph: Seb Daly/Sportsfile/Getty Images30) HYLAND (8yo, 10st 6lb)Gaping holes on otherwise glittering training cvs do not come much bigger than the one on Nicky Henderson’s record where the Grand National should be. The first of his 43 runners in the race – Zongalero, in 1979 – finished second, as did The Tsarevich eight years later, but it has otherwise been a near 50-year tale of woe, with more than half of his starters failing to finish. Still, every trend is there to be broken and there is plenty to like about Hyland’s profile: right age, just six runs over fences, form in Grade One company and a promising run last time out, when he was second in a well-run race at Kempton. Could well be Henderson’s best chance for at least 20 years, though he might just lack the finishing speed of a few classier rivals.Verdict: looking to break the Henderson duck, better chance than most recent runners from the yard31) CELEBRE D’ALLEN (13yo, 10st 6lb)The only teenager in this year’s field does at least have some idea of what to expect, having lined up for the Topham Chase over these fences in April 2023 and then Becher Chase eight months later. He finished both races, but looked likely to play a hand in the finish of the latter contest until his stamina visibly drained away after jumping the last. Has an extra mile or so to cover today and will not be threatening Sergeant Murphy’s 102-year-old status as the last 13-year-old to win the National.Verdict: too old and too slow, and looked like a non-stayer too32) THREE CARD BRAG (8yo, 10st 5lb)Looks much the best of Gordon Elliott’s five-strong team for this year’s race but that’s not saying much as the other four are all priced up at 66-1 or bigger. Has the bare six chase starts in the book but only one win, in a beginners’ race at Navan in January, and his jumping was also a little scrappier than usual when he was beaten in Grade Two at the same track a month later. The two horses in front of him there went on to finish second and third in a Grade One at Cheltenham, but the balance of his form suggests a relatively short price owes more to his trainer’s excellent record in the race.Verdict: lightly raced and has been keeping good company but hardly a blot on the handicap33) TWIG (10yo, 10st 5lb)Shares a father with a Grand National winner as the 33-1 shot Rule The World, victorious in 2016, was also sired by Sulamani, who took the French Derby in 2002. That, though, is about as tenuous as it gets in the search for an Aintree bet, and while he spent the early part of the season running over hurdles to protect his handicap mark, there was next to nothing about his return to chasing in the Grimthorpe at Doncaster in March that offers real encouragement.Verdict: trained all year with this race in mind, but no sign of the class or finishing speed required to figureView image in fullscreenTwig is at long odds and is unlikely to trouble the front runners.Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/Shutterstock34) DUFFLE COAT (8yo, 10st 4lb)Managed to sneak in at the bottom of the weights but has just one win in 13 starts over fences and that was off a rating more than a stone below his mark here. He was, admittedly, in the process of outrunning his odds of 50-1 when he was brought down in a race at Cheltenham’s festival last month, but not to the extent that he could be on anyone’s mind for a National.Verdict: exposed as a mid-ranking handicapper at best, carries the lowest weight in the race for a reasonGreg Wood’s verdict:1) Iroko2) I Am Maximus3) Senior Chief4) Perceval LegalloisExplore more on these topicsGrand NationalAintreeHorse racingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Time stealthily gouging out lines, on faces, over scars, around knees. A first season. A last.Here, suddenly, is April, unexpectedly sunny and dry. And with it, 135 years after the firstCounty Championship(minus one year for Covid, four for world war one and six for world war two), the 125th.County Championship 2025: team-by-team guide to the new seasonRead moreThis summer is the calm before the storm. Think you’ve read that before? You have. The layout of domestic cricket will change again in 2026 – with it looking likely that the number of Championship games will be reduced to give a bit more breathing space to a four-competition season. What won’t happen is a top-down “imposed” solution like the ill-fated Strauss plan, which was upended by the counties in 2022. But, for now, we know what we’ve got: 15 rounds, 14 games, 10 Division One counties, eight Division Two counties. Two balls – the Dukes and the Kookaburra (rounds nine-12). One winner.For 2025, as is the recent custom, Surrey start as favourites to collect what would betheir fourth Championship in a row. Their squad is a well-oiled machine, deftly coached by Gareth Batty and full of players that either dip in from England duty or purr along just under the radar. A couple of quality overseas players in Kemar Roach and Nathan Smith add a pinch of spice. People also enjoy watching them. More than 65,000 people attended County Championship games at the Oval last year, with 13,706 going through the turnstiles for the midsummer game against Essex, both records for the 21st century.Alec Stewart stepped down as director of cricket at the end of last season,after 11 years in the role. It’s safe to say he’s still in an adjustment period – no longer at the Oval at 6.30am, but still receiving emails every day. But after 44 years in and around senior cricket he’s got a pretty good idea of how the Championship stacks up.“Without county cricket you won’t have an international setup,” he says. “And the Hundred money will hopefully look after the domestic game for the next 25 years, so long as it is invested wisely.View image in fullscreenChampionship favourites Surrey will be without Alec Stewart after the former England man stepped down as director of cricket last summer.Photograph: Ben Hoskins/Getty Images for Surrey CCC“Not having all the teams in the first division play each other twice isn’t ideal, but the quality is good and, though we don’t have England players playing regularly, there are enough very good players coming through. Offer players the Championship or the T20 Cup and 90% would choose to win the Championship, which is a healthy sign. We just need to make sure that we are respecting it in terms of when and how we play it. Every time you play a match it should be an occasion, not ‘here we go again’.“Red-ball cricket is still where you make your reputation and where you see great players develop. The easy option is to be a white-ball cricketer but that could be a short-term view – one bad franchise competition and you get left out. Whereas if you have the ability to play all formats, you’ve got something to come back to. I’m really pleased that [Somerset’s] Will Smeed has come back to red-ball cricket, it’s a good example to everyone else that you don’t need to make a decision at that young age.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a hell of a lot of money out there, but making your debut for whatever county you’re at, I haven’t seen that diminish.”McGrath is not the only new coach around. Chris Silverwood replaces him at Essex, Richard Dawson goes to Glamorgan in interim charge, Ian Westwood steps into Mark Robinson’s boots at Edgbaston. And two big characters arrive, Darren Lehmann at Northants and Adam Hollioake at Kent. McGrath is thrilled. “It is brilliant for the County Championship, they’re two fantastic people and coaches. Adam was my captain for England Lions when we went to Australia. He has high standards, he’ll expect Kent to get going from the start.”On the field, Jimmy Andersoncontinues to fight the dying of the light, right calf notwithstanding, while his former teammates’ sons Rocky Flintoff (Lancashire) and Archie Vaughan (Somerset) dip their toes in the water for a second season. The overseas contingent is strong – to pick two: Kane Williamson at Middlesex and Jaydon Seales returning to promoted Sussex. Spin bowling is still difficult: Amar Virdi has been released by Surrey, while Shoaib Bashir is on loan to Glamorgan. There are Ashes tour places to play for (if England care to glance.) Careers will burst into life, others will fade.

The title appears destined for Anfield – Arsenal have been unable to sustain a consistent challenge for it all season – but Mikel Arteta will feel duty-bound to delay the seemingly inevitable for as long as possible on his return to Everton. Tuesday’s Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid may be the priority for Arsenal but rotating is hardly an option for Arteta at Goodison Park given he has four defenders available. A makeshift unit would benefit from a demanding afternoon together before welcoming Real to the Emirates. Arne Slot claimed it is unfair on Everton to have an early Saturday kick-off after Wednesday’s Merseyside derby. Depleted or not, Arteta’s team should take advantage.Andy HunterEverton vArsenal, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)2Richards an unsung hero in Palace defenceWhenChelsea recalled Trevoh Chalobahfrom his loan spell at Crystal Palace in January it meant that the south London club had only three frontline central defenders – potentially a major issue given Oliver Glasner’s preferred 3-4-2-1 formation. But while Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guéhi have also been outstanding, it was significant that the absence of Chris Richards fromthe game at Southamptonon Tuesday coincided with Palace conceding their first away goal of 2025, a remarkable run of seven fixtures in all competitions. Their record when the USA defender plays shows how important he has been under Glasner, with Palace picking up an average 2.03 points per game compared with just 1.1 without him. The good news is that the 25-year-old former Bayern Munich defender should be back for the Selhurst Park showdown with Brighton on Saturday.Ed AaronsCrystal Palace v Brighton, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenChris Richards slides in to deny Everton’s Jack Harrison.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images3Wolves lose Pereira for trip to IpswichVítor Pereira is a passionate and emotional figure on the touchline, which might explain why he is suspended from the dugout for Wolves’ trip to Portman Road. The head coach was booked during thecrucial win over West Hamin midweek but that did not stop him from celebrating wildly at full time, much to Graham Potter’s chagrin. It is rare to have a head coach that sets the tempo on the sidelines and Wolves will have to do without him and assistant, Luís Miguel, who has suffered the same fate. Pereira has drilled his players well since his appointment but how will Wolves cope without him on the sidelines? AfterIpswich’s surprise win at Bournemouth, another victory for the Tractor Boys on Saturday will close the gap to Wolves to six points.Will UnwinIpswich v Wolves, Saturday 3pm4Potter should roll the dice at West HamGraham Potter has been cautious since joining West Ham in January. His results since taking over: 3-2, 0-2, 1-1, 1-2, 0-1, 1-0, 2-0, 0-1, 1-1, 0-1. Excitement has been in short supply and performances at home have not exactly been sparkling. Potter, mindful of his team’s defensive struggles under Julen Lopetegui, has placed a heavy focus on containment since replacing the Spaniard. He has mainly used a back three, which has meant sacrificing an attacker, but the set-up was ineffective whenWest Ham lost 1-0 to Wolveson Tuesday. With little to play for before the end of the season, Potter should open up when West Ham host Bournemouth on Saturday.Jacob SteinbergWest Ham vBournemouth, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenGraham Potter will hope the returning Niclas Füllkrug can provide a spark up front for the Hammers.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA5January additions have revitalised VillaUnai Emery has achieved some magnificent feats since transforming Aston Villa but his latest trick is arguably his best yet: getting value for money – if that is the right phrase given the numbers involved – from the January transfer window. It is regarded as a notoriously difficult time to improve squads, one usually reserved for panic buys or to correct expensive mistakes, but the addition of Donyell Malen, plus loan arrivals Marcus Rashford, Marco Asensio and Axel Disasi have undoubtedly given Villa fresh impetus. Rashford, Malen and Asensio were all on the scoresheet inWednesday’s impressive victory at Brightonand since Asensio’s debut in February, no top-flight player has scored more goals in all competitions than the Spaniard, who has eight. After straight six wins, now Villa host Forest looking for further momentum before a Champions League quarter-final trip to Parc des Princes next week.Ben FisherAston Villa vNottingham Forest, Saturday 5.30pm6Mbeumo and Wissa eye Toney recordIvan Toney scored 20 goals in the 2022-23 season forBrentford, the highest ever tally by a Bees player in the Premier League. Within that there were six penalties, adding a useful boost to his statistics. Bryan Mbeumo has taken over the penalty duties and has scored all five taken this season as part of a total tally of 16 goals. His partner in crime, Yoane Wissa, has 14 to his name this campaign and another for either against Chelsea would give them a chance of catching up with Toney’s record total in the run-in. Even if they fail to match Toney individually, Mbeumo and Wissa know they have more than made up for the England international’s departure to Saudi Arabia. The Bees are the only team with two players in the top 10 scorers in the Premier League charts this season to more than prove that they have the individuals and unity to thrive without Toney.WUBrentford vChelsea, Sunday 2pm7Jones is not a long-term fix at right backArne Slot liked Curtis Jones’s performance at right-back inLiverpool’s Merseyside derby victory. It seems an unlikely long-term fix, though. Jones was an admirable stand-in but this was surely not an early taste of life without Trent Alexander-Arnold. It was a case of needs must with Conor Bradley also unavailable and it would not be a surprise if Slot tries something more orthodox when Liverpool visit Fulham. Jones, after all, is not a defender. His ability on the ball makes him an appealing option in games Liverpool expect to dominate but a more solid option could be the answer for tougher assignments. Jarell Quansah will be pushing to start against Fulham, who have a dangerous left flank, and Slot has suggested that Bradley could be in contention. Looking further ahead, Liverpool will need to spend on a replacement for Alexander-Arnold should his move to Real Madrid go through, if only to ensure they have enough cover when injuries strike.JSFuham vLiverpool, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenCurtis Jones wins a header under pressure from Everton’s Abdoulaye Doucouré.Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters8Dibling will want to impress suitorsAs Southampton edge ever closer to the Championship, they will be wondering who will still be there next season. Tyler Dibling is the Saints’ prized asset, and will cost someone a lot of money in the summer unless he decides to stay for the home comforts. One club repeatedly linked with the talented winger is Tottenham, where Dibling will visit on Sunday, perhaps with the thought of potentially impressing Ange Postecoglou and his recruitment boffins. Dibling came off the benchagainst Crystal Palace in midweekand will be fresh and eager this weekend. Dibling has his best years ahead of him and the brand of all-action football instilled by Postecoglou should suit his attributes – the teenager will be looking to show them off in north London.WUTottenham vSouthampton, Sunday 2pm9City aim for derby revenge after Etihad lossThis 196th local squabble pits the poorest Manchester United vintage of the Premier League era against a wobbly Manchester City, the champions of the past four seasons who are scrambling to qualify for the Champions League. The great cliche of any derby is that form goes out of the window due to the neighbourly rivalry: this one, on Sunday, epitomises it, but after United wonthis season’s reverse fixture, the view here is the City will find a way to win before the hostile Old Trafford faithful.Jamie JacksonManchester United v Manchester City, Sunday 4.30pmView image in fullscreenAmad Diallo scored a last-minute winner when the sides met in December.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Danehouse/Getty Images10Van Nistelrooy’s record is a woeful oneRuud van Nistelrooy has overseen 14 defeats – including seven in a row – in his 17 Premier League matches at the Leicester helm. It is a somewhat embarrassing record for the Dutchman. Foxes fans might be hoping they can get something when Southampton visit on 3 May because every match prior to that looks very difficult for a Leicester team short on quality and confidence. They failed to register a shot on target at Manchester City intheir latest meek loss. Van Nistelrooy needs to pick up points soon and another dispiriting defeat by Champions League-chasing Newcastle will add further concerns and questions over whether the Dutchman is the right man for the job of trying to bring them back up next season. Leicester’s survival bid may be fading but they need to at least find green shoots of hope before the summer.WULeicester v Newcastle, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3043732Arsenal3030613Nottm Forest3015574Chelsea3017525Man City3017516Newcastle2910507Aston Villa30-1488Brighton303479Fulham3044510AFC Bournemouth30114411Brentford3044112Crystal Palace2934013Man Utd30-43714Tottenham Hotspur30113415Everton30-53416West Ham30-173417Wolverhampton30-172918Ipswich30-332019Leicester30-421720Southampton30-4910Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendEvertonArsenalCrystal PalaceBrighton & Hove AlbionIpswich TownWolverhampton WanderersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That gave Price a bye through to the semi-finals, where he dominated a 6-2 win over Dobey to earn himself a shot at a third nightly victory.A tense final rarely hit the heights in terms of quality, with the first six legs all going against the darts before Bunting finally held with a 96 checkout.It was advantage Price, though, when he broke the throw again to lead 5-4, and he had two match darts but missed them both, making clear his displeasure with noises from the crowd.Bunting made the Welshman pay by levelling the contest and then finished in style with a checkout of 107.He told Sky Sports: “After the first win I was so relieved just to get off zero points. I’ve put a lot of work in behind the scenes, I’ve tried every week 110%. Tonight, oh my God, I’ve won an event and I’m so happy. It’s such a special moment.“There’s been times through the Premier League where I’ve thought: ‘Can I finish on zero points’? To get off the mark tonight and to win a night, such a special feeling. I know I’ve been playing well, I’ve just not got the result. Now this is going to give me huge confidence and I can’t wait to finish the campaign.”Bunting remains bottom of the table despite the victory while Price is up to third as the series moves on to Manchester.Explore more on these topicsDartsLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

In exchange, PIF would invest $1.5bn in PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial entity created after peace appeared to have broken out in summer 2023. The $1.5bn has been planned to match identical investment from the US-based Strategic Sports Group.Reopening of Trump-owned golf course delayed after damage by pro-Palestine groupRead moreThe PGA Tour replied to PIF’s demands on Monday, with neither deemed acceptable. Those with detailed knowledge of the situation stress reunification of golf is the PGA Tour’s core aim, a matter that is hardly assisted by LIV continuing in its present form. There would also be understandable unease within the PGA Tour should Rumayyan, whose organisation has bankrolled LIV, be afforded such a prominent position as the breakaway tour continues on its own path.Donald Trump, the US president,wants golf to come togetherbut if PIF sticks to its present standpoint, that feels highly unlikely. Trump is likely to appear at his Doral resort this week where LIV is staging a tournament.Last week’s correspondence between PIF and the PGA Tour is understood to have been the first since a fraught meeting at the White House in late February. There, Rumayyan is known to have made it clear he believed LIV had not been respected by the traditional ecosystem.A dozen players who perform under the LIV banner will tee up at the Masters next Thursday. Phil Mickelson, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson and others departed the PGA Tour for LIV amid significant rancour. Rumayyan clearly retains deep personal faith in LIV. It is also obvious these talks cannot continue indefinitely. The PGA Tour, meanwhile, declined to comment on the recent correspondence.Speaking early last month Rory McIlroy, a member of the PGA Tour’s transaction committee, appeared to make pointed reference to PIF’s role in negotiations. “It takes two to tango,”said the Northern Irishman. McIlroy also made clear a deal was no longer essential for the PGA Tour.Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, also used the recent Florida swing to highlight his organisation’s strength in respect of commercial pull, audience figures and engagement. Intriguingly, Monahan revealed the PGA Tour had polled their audience on reunification with 70% in favour. At the Players Championship Monahan said: “We believe there’s room to integrate important aspects of LIVGolfinto the PGA Tour platform.” Monahan’s tone implied a pendulum had swung back in his favour.Scott O’Neil, the recently appointed LIV chief executive, is expected to visit Augusta National forthe Masters. Speaking at Doral he said: “Do we have to do a deal? No. It would be nice to do a deal, so long as we’re all focused on the same things.” He is not directly involved in these negotiations. The next key test of LIV’s strength will arrive with contract renewals due for players who left the PGA Tour, originally for guaranteed payments worth hundreds of millions of dollars.PIF has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsGolfPGA TourLIV Golf SeriesUS sportsSaudi Arabia and sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Using both venues for a first World Cup inSpainhas obvious appeal while the San Mamés stadium in Bilbao hosted the Champions Cup final in 2018 and will do so again next year.Spain’s closest rival for the 2035 tournament is likely to be Italy with an expectation that, with Australia hosting the 2027 World Cup and the United States staging the 2031 edition, 2035 will mark a return to Europe. Japan are considered the early frontrunners for what is likely to be a World Cup in Asia in 2039, but there is interest from the Middle East and though there are hurdles to overcome, the financial incentives are clear.Spain last appeared at the World Cup in 1999 – they won a place at the 2023 tournament but were expelled for breaching eligibility regulations in qualifying – but have booked their spot for the 2027 competition. The women’s side has also qualified for the World Cup this year in England while Spain have made significant strides on the sevens circuit. A decision is expected to be made before the 2027 World Cup in Australia.“Spain is interesting because it’s an extension of the European market, 50 million people, quality stadiums, passionate support and culture,” said the World Rugby chair, Brett Robinson. “And their high-performance investment and focus in recent years has been at a pace where you’ve got two teams in [the Hong Kong sevens] tournament who are really competitive. The men’s team has qualified for the 2027 World Cup, the women’s World Cup this year. Is there a European competition where you do something with Italy, with the UK?”Spain’s bid appeals in part because World Rugby has dealt with a number of the logistics that would be encountered, such as discussing clashes with domestic football and Champions League calendars, as recently as 2023 when France hosted the World Cup. “The Spanish federation and Spanish government have had conversations with La Liga,” said World Rugby’s chief executive, Alan Gilpin.View image in fullscreenSpain qualified for the 2023 tournament but were expelled for breaching regulations.Photograph: Susana Vera/Reuters“When we’ve had tournaments before in England or in France in 2023, there’s been that conversation about we need you, Tottenham, to play two matches away in a row. It’s the same conversation with Spain. As we understand it, it’s with La Liga about whether they would support [it] and it seems to be [the case].“We took some big strategic decisions a few years ago to go men’s and women’s in Australia and the same in the US. And we’ve now got to think about the balance and whether we bring 2035 and 2037 back to Europe.

Jermy told the planning meeting on Thursday the intensive farm would threaten local jobs at established farms and businesses, including the vegetarian food giant Quorn, which has a manufacturing site in Methwold.Jake White, head of legal advocacy at WWF UK, told councillors the NGO estimated that the factory farm’s two sites would produce almost 50,000 tonnes of CO2a year. Over a 20-year lifespan the greenhouse gas emissions from the industrial-style farms would be more than 1m tonnes, he said.Cranswick plc, which provides chicken and poultry to leading British supermarkets, wants to build one of the UK’s largest industrial farms by expanding an existing site to rear 870,000 chickens and 14,000 pigs at any one time.In a briefing document submitted in the days before the planning meeting, the company said it wanted to modernise for a growing market, creating more British food to higher welfare standards through the redevelopment of existing farms.King’s Lynn and West Norfolk borough council was recommended to reject the application on ecology and climate change grounds by its officers. In a 200-page report, planning officers said the applicant “fails to demonstrate that the development would not result in significant adverse effects on [environmentally] protected sites”.There was also “insufficient environmental information to enable the council to reach a view” on its impact on the environment and climate change, the report added. A council lawyer said the company had not provided information on all the likely carbon emissions from the industrial farm and it would be unlawful for councillors to approve the application.There are also concerns about air pollution and the impact on a water-depleted area. The Environmental Law Foundation said the farm would need more water than its abstraction licence allowed.Cranswick said the new site was needed to keep up with demand from supermarkets. Barry Lock, managing director for Cranswick in East Anglia, denied claims that the company had plans to export poultry and pork. He said 96% of the food they produced was for British customers. Lock cited food security and increased jobs. He said approving the megafarm would reduce carbon emissions because it would reduce the need for imports of meat from abroad.Explore more on these topicsFarmingEnglandNorfolkClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump’s cuts put our vast reserves at riskThor HansonMaintaining seed diversity and abundance is essential – and requires constant work. It’s time for Congress to return to the seed businessThu 3 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 08.32 EDTShareFrom 1862 until 1923, US senators and members of Congress provided vast numbers of seeds to constituents. At its peak, the congressional seed distribution program deliveredover 60m seed packetsdirectly to farmers and market gardeners every year, helping introduce new varieties of everything from wheat and corn to oats, soybeans, flowers and vegetables. A century later, far fewer Americans till the soil for a living, but seeds remain central to our lives.To understand the importance of seeds, try to imagine a morning without them. It would begin naked on a bare mattress, with no cozy sheets or pajamas, and there would be no fluffy towel to wrap up in after your shower. All of those things come from the seeds of the cotton plant. Stumbling wet into the kitchen, you would find no coffee, and no toast or bagel to go with it. There would be no eggs, no bacon, no cereal, no milk. All of those staples come from seeds or from livestock raised on seed crops. And if you thought you might console yourself with a chocolate bar, you can forget it. Cocoa powder, and the cocoa butter that makes it melt in your mouth, are both derived from seeds.Logging is quietly ravaging US forests. Trump is taking an axe to protectionsRead moreMaintaining the seed diversity and abundance we rely on requires constant development of new varieties to combat disease, increase production and adapt to changing conditions. Seed advances are particularly urgent now, as farmers confront the fickle weather of a warming planet while working to meet a projected50-60% rise in global food demand by 2050. Although elected officials no longer send out seeds through the mail, federal support for these efforts remains vital.In the era of Doge, that support has been flipped on its head.The US Department of Agriculture employs many plant breeders directly and funds many more through grants and partnerships, but the crown jewel of its seed program resides in a bunker-like building in Fort Collins, Colorado. The national seed bank housesmore than 2bncarefully preserved specimens in a facility designed to withstand floods, fires, earthquakes, power outages and tornadoes. With over620,000 varieties from nearly 17,000 different species, it is one of the world’s largest seed collections and a major supplier to the global seed vault in Svalbard, Norway.Plants don’t wait on politics. Any seed varieties lost now will simply be unavailable to improve crops and address challenges in the futureIt is also at risk.While words like “vault” and “bank” imply simply turning the key and walking away, managing a seed collection demands constant activity. Even in cold storage, the specimens steadily degrade and must be tested regularly to make sure they’re still viable. When germination rates drop for any particular sample, those seeds must be planted and grown to maturity – in the right conditions – to produce a fresh supply. That activity takes place atover 20 research stationsin locations (and climates) as diverse as North Dakota, Texas, California, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.Known officially as theUS National Plant Germplasm System, the seed bank and its network of regional facilities recentlylost 10% of their workforcein the Doge firings, including farm managers, research scientists, lab technicians, IT specialists, orchardists and more. Some have since beenrehired, at least temporarily, but the program remains in turmoil. Projects interrupted or suspended range from germination trials to seed regeneration, research lending and many longterm breeding programs, weakening the entire enterprise.Plants don’t wait on politics. Any seed varieties lost now will simply be unavailable to improve crops and address challenges in the future. The importance of a robust and diverse seed bank cannot be overstated. To combat the invasive Russian wheat aphid, for example, plant breeders screenedover 54,000 wheat and barley samplesto find a handful of precious strains with natural resistance.It’s time for Congress to return to the seed business. Without its intervention, backed by the courts, additional firings appear imminent. Undermining the nation’s seed security undermines its food security and embodies the definition of reckless: “utterly unconcerned about consequences”.For those in the seed world, that attitude is hard to fathom. After all, planting a seed is always about what comes next, a conscious act of forethought and optimism. In other words, an act of hope.Thor Hanson is a biologist and author whose books include The Triumph of Seeds and Close to Home.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentOpinionAgricultureFarmingTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Burning this gas for electricity will generate 25,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases per day – the equivalent of 2.4 average US coal plants,according to the EPA greenhouse calculator, or 2.1m cars driven for one year.“This project represents our first commercial arrangement to supply natural gas directly to a data center site, and it will not be the last,” the company told investors, who reacted favourably to the deal, withEnergy Transfer’s shareprice rising 2.1% after it was announced.“In aggregate, we have now received requests for potential connections to approximately 62 power plants that we do not currently serve in 13 states … In addition, we have now received requests from over 70 prospective data centers in 12 states,” investors were told by executives, outlining how the company is benefiting from the Trump data center and AI boom.View image in fullscreenA screen grab from an Energy Transfer slideshow to investors.Photograph: Energy TransferEarlier this month, a jury with knownties to the fossil-fuel industryfound in favor of Energy Transfer and ordered Greenpeace to pay $660m in damages to the $65bn oil and gas company – an unprecedented figure that could bankrupt Greenpeace US and chill environmental activism. Greenpeace has said it will appeal.Energy Transfer is not the only fossil-fuel firm ready to benefit from the expected boom in AI and cryptocurrencies. The Guardian/OCI investigation illustrates how the US fracked-gas industry in particular looks set to use its influence on Trump and the GOP to expand operations and make billions in profits from powering data centers – while dumping huge amounts of additional planet-warming gases and other toxins into the atmosphere.The expected gas bonanza comes amid a growing climate breakdown, including a slew of deadly and costly disasters in the US in recent months, such as the Los Angeles wildfires andHurricane Helenein southern Appalachia. More than 150 “unprecedented” climate disastersstruck around the world in 2024– the hottest-ever year on record.The crypto industry was last year’s biggest corporate campaign donor for the White House and Congress – and the candidates it backed won big, including Trump. But even before the latest push, US authorities believed that crypto mining wasresponsible for up to 2.3% of the nation’s total electricity demand– roughly equivalent to the state of West Virginia.According to investment bankGoldman Sachs,the data-center-and-AI boom means that US power demand is “likely to experience growth not seen in a generation”. And this demand for energy, largely fuelled by fracked gas, is set to soar under Trump, who embraced cryptocurrencies during the campaign, postingon his Truth Social platform last summerthat Bitcoin mining would “help us be ENERGY DOMINANT!!!”View image in fullscreenThe Energy Transfer plant in Stanton, Texas.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesTrump is now betting big on AI, too, signing several executive orders since taking office to slash regulation. This includes one on his first day to roll back safety-testing rules for AI used by the government, followed byanother order three days laterrevoking existing policies “that act as barriers to American AI innovation”.Trump also announced private-sectorinvestment of up to $500bn to fund infrastructure for artificial intelligence, aiming to outpace rivals.In recent weeks, Meta, Google, OpenAI and other tech companies have lobbied theTrump administrationfor more AI tax breaks and incentives, to block state laws and for access to federal data to develop the technology – as well as for easier access to energy sources for their computing demands.Tech companies “are really emboldened by the Trump administration, and even issues like safety and responsible AI have disappeared completely from their concerns”, Laura Caroli, a senior fellow at the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a non-profit thinktank, told theNew York Times.Rachel Rose Jackson, director of climate research and policy at Corporate Accountability, said: “This investigation is a harrowing illustration of just how out of touch with reality this government is with the facts of climate science – and highlights the treacherous relationship between big tech and fossil fuels.“Not only are fossil-fuel corporations literally fueling the ramp-up of AI data centers, but big tech works with fossil-fuel corporations to use AI to discover and extract oil that should never see the light of day.”The gas industry – like the tech and crypto industries – is now set to reap the benefits of the data-center expansion.EQT Corporation, a leading fracked-gas producer and pipeline company and another major Trump donor, recently told investors that data centers are becoming the “cornerstone of natural gas bull case” – in other words, the cornerstone of fossil gas expansion and shareholder profits.In February, EQT, which is worth $32bn, told investors that the company was ideally placed to take advantage of a forecasted 10-18bn-cubic-feet increase in gas demand from AI, crypto, EVs and other data centers by 2030. This is a huge amount of extra fossil gas, which even at EQT’s lower forecast would generate as much carbon dioxide as 52 coal plants or 46.5m passenger cars over a year, according to the EPA calculator.Said EQT: “We’ll see those opportunities across the country – but we’ll also see those largely in our backyard as well, especially given the proximity to the data center demand that’s taking place.”View image in fullscreenA screen grab from an EQT Corporation slideshow shown to investors.Photograph: EQT CorporationThe Mountain Valley pipeline (MVP),a joint venture in which the gas giant is the controlling shareholder and operator, provides “unique access” to the US south-east region, which is home to “burgeoning data center demand”, investors were also told.The MVP, which stretches 300 miles (482km) from north-western West Virginia to southern Virginia and was pushed through by the Biden administration in 2023 despite court orders and environmental regulators blocking construction, looks set to boost the data-center boom – and EQT profits. “MVP capacity and long-term sales to the region’s largest utilities mean EQT’s natural gas can underpin power generation to support data-center build-out,” investors were told.A couple of days after the investor call, CEO Toby Rice told CNBC’s influential investor-focusedMad MoneyTV show: “We firmly believe that natural gas is going to take the lion’s share of power demand to meet this growing AI demand need.”View image in fullscreenToby Rice, the chief executive of EQT.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images“We need to unleash American energy,” added Rice,who has beenlobbying politicians in Washington about the need to expand American fracked gas. “Build, baby, build. Thank goodness this administration will let this happen. It could not have happened at a more critical time in the face of this AI boom that is taking place.”There are already almost 5,400 data centers in the US, 70% more than the next 10 largest markets combined, including China. They not only guzzle electricity, but also water. One large data center canconsume as much as 5m gallonsof water each day, the equivalent to a town of up to 50,000 people.EQT made a$250,000donation to the RepublicanSenate Leadership Fundjust days after Biden announced he would pause liquefied natural gas (LNG) export permits in January 2024.The Super Pac’s one stated goalis to build a Republican majority that will “defend America from Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats’ destructive far-left agenda”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It was organized by the fracking bossHarold Hamm, who for years has helped craft Republican energy policies. Hamm, who picked cotton barefoot as a child before making billions from fracking, runsContinental Resources, among the US’s largest fracked-gas companies.Also in attendance was longtime oil industry ally Doug Burgum, then the governor of North Dakota, who was appointed secretary of the interior in Trump’s new administration.After the meeting, it was reported by the Washington Post that the oil and gas executives discussed how to try to meet Trump’s request for $1bn to help fund his election campaign.In return, Trump promised to roll back environmental regulations, auction off more oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters, reverse pollution standards for new cars, and end drilling restrictions in the Alaskan Arctic, among other vows.The alleged “quid pro quo” event was later investigated by a group of high-ranking Democratic lawmakers including Sheldon Whitehouse, then the Senate finance committee chair, and Jamie Raskin from the congressional committee on oversight and accountability. “Such an obvious policies-for-money transaction reeks of cronyism and corruption,”they found.A second fossil-fuel fundraiser for Trump was organised the following month, in May 2024, by Warren of Energy Transfer,Vicki Hollubfrom Occidental Petroleum and Hamm, who has been calledTrump’s “energy whisperer”. The event, which took place at a luxurious hotel in Houston where guests had to hand over their phones, was sponsored by Trump’s Make America Great Again Pac.Hamm’s company, Continental Resources, donated$1m to the Maga Super Pacin April last year, the month after Hamm donated $614,000 to the Trump 47 Committee.Many of those present at Trump’s fundraising events last April and May already had long-term funding relationships with the Republicans. Continental Resources and Energy Transfer are among the top 20 funders of the Maga Super Pac, according toOpenSecrets.According to one analysis, big oil spent $445m throughout the last election cycle to influence Trump and Congress – including pouring $96m into Trump’s re-election campaign and affiliated political action committees.Big oil winsBurgum and Hamm were back at Mar-a-Lago to celebrate Trump’s November election victory. Shortly after Trump declared an energy emergency on his first day back in the White House in January, Mike Sommers, head of the API, said: “American energy was on the ballot and American energy won.”The API spent just over $13m in campaign donations and lobbying during the 2024 election cycle,according to OpenSecrets.Speaking at Davos just days after Trump’s inauguration, EQT’s Rice said: “Our lives are going to get easier. Donald Trump is a very welcome change.”The following month, during an Energy Transfer investor call, co-chief executive officer Thomas E Long said: “My goodness, how wonderful is life after this election. When we have a president and an administration that love this country, that fully recognizes how blessed we are … and we have a businessman that built his career on trading, doing deals, negotiating, employing, creating numerous jobs throughout all the businesses that he’s been associated with.“What an incredible excitement we have around this administration and what it’s going to do to mitigate just overwhelming regulation on all these assets, to streamline regulations.”So far, dozens of environmental regulations have been slashed, either by executive order or EPA rollbacks, including the end to Biden’s 2024 pause on LNG exports and new rules for cleaner exhausts from tailpipes – industry requests shared byHamm with the New York Times last May.This includes plans to roll back 31 key environmental rules – on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change – announced on a single day in March by Trump’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, who has been accused of endangering the lives of millions of Americans.“The American people are sick of billionaires buying elections,” said Democratic congressman Ro Khanna, who has introduced a bill with congresswoman Summer Lee to ban Super PACs. ‘[We need to] get big money out of politics. It’s past time,” said Khanna.Trump’s funders and backers are especially going to benefit from Trump’s policies to restrict regulations in the AI sector as part of an attempt to outpace China to become the global leader in the sector. The US is currently home to just more than half the mega data centers in the world. And with Goldman Sachs suggesting $1tn will be spent on AI data centers in the next few years, a lot is up for grabs.Artificial intelligence and the data centers used to feed the computing power will require huge amounts of energy, with the US government projecting that data-center demand will triple the domestic electricity demand within the next three years. A recent paper by Harvard Law School notes that utilities are now prioritising supplying data centers at the expense of American consumers, who face price rises.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with Harold Hamm in 2019.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APDays after the election,it was reportedthat oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron were jumping into the race to power AI data centers. Yet the fracking industry, including Energy Transfer and EQT, appear to consider themselves best placed to benefit from Trump’s pro-AI-and-data-center growth strategy.When Trump announced last November that Burgum would be the new secretary of the interior and chair of the newly formed National Energy Dominance Council, hesaidBurgum’s work would be key to winning “the battle for AI superiority, which is key to national security and our nation’s prosperity”.At his confirmation hearing, Burgum repeated the same message, claiming that without more fossil fuels, “we’re going to lose the AI arms race to China”.“In his first term, President Trump unleashed American energy while reducing carbon emissions to historic lows, proving that we can both restore American greatness and advance environmental stewardship. President Trump is committed to replacing unclean foreign energy with the liquid gold under our feet while ridding our environment of dangerous toxins,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson.EQT, Energy Transfer, Continental Resources and the API were contacted for comment but did not respond.“The most absurd part of this whole saga is that everyone who looks at it without a vested interest concludes that if we have to build data centers fast, it makes far, far more sense – economic and environmental – to use renewable energy,” said environmentalist Bill McKibben, founder of the non-profits 350.org and Third Act.“But just as they shamelessly used the war in Ukraine, the gas industry is now using this moment to try and lock in their climate-killing business. And they’ve purchased enough friends in high places to make it a real possibility.”Andy Rowell is a UK-based investigative reporter and contributing editor to Oil Change InternationalExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOil and gas companiesEnergy industryTrump administrationArtificial intelligence (AI)Donald TrumpRegulatorsShareReuse this content"

He said that without insurance, which is already being pulled in some places, many other financial services become unviable, from mortgages to investments.Global carbon emissions are still rising andcurrent policies will result in a rise in global temperaturebetween 2.2C and 3.4C above pre-industrial levels. The damage at 3C will be so great that governments will be unable to provide financial bailouts and it will be impossible to adapt to many climate impacts, said Thallinger, who is also the chair of the German company’s investment board and was previously CEO of Allianz Investment Management.Extreme weather cost $2tn globally over past decade, report findsRead moreThe core business of the insurance industry is risk management and it has long taken the dangers of global heating very seriously. In recent reports,Aviva said extreme weather damagesfor the decade to 2023 hit $2tn, whileGallagherRE said the figure was $400bnin 2024.Zurich said it was “essential” to hit net zero by 2050.Thallinger said: “The good news iswe already have the technologiesto switch from fossil combustion to zero-emission energy. The only thing missing is speed and scale. This is about saving the conditions under which markets, finance, and civilisation itself can continue to operate.”Nick Robins, the chair of the Just Transition Finance Lab at the London School ofEconomics, said: “This devastating analysis from a global insurance leader sets out not just the financial but also the civilisational threat posed by climate change. It needs to be the basis for renewed action, particularly in the countries of the global south.”“The insurance sector is a canary in the coalmine when it comes to climate impacts,” said Janos Pasztor, former UN assistant secretary-general for climate change.The argument set out by Thallinger in aLinkedIn postbegins with theincreasingly severe damage being caused by the climate crisis: “Heat and water destroy capital. Flooded homes lose value. Overheated cities become uninhabitable. Entire asset classes are degrading in real time.”“We are fast approaching temperature levels – 1.5C, 2C, 3C – where insurers will no longer be able to offer coverage for many of these risks,” he said. “The math breaks down: the premiums required exceed what people or companies can pay. This is already happening. Entire regions are becoming uninsurable.” He cited companiesending home insurance in Californiadue to wildfires.Thallinger said it was a systemic risk “threatening the very foundation of the financial sector”, because a lack of insurance means other financial services become unavailable: “This is a climate-induced credit crunch.”“This applies not only to housing, but to infrastructure, transportation, agriculture, and industry,” he said. “The economic value of entire regions – coastal, arid, wildfire-prone – will begin to vanish from financial ledgers. Markets will reprice, rapidly and brutally. This is what a climate-driven market failure looks like.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Australia’sdisaster recovery spendinghas already increased sevenfold between 2017 and 2023, he noted.The idea that billions of people can just adapt to worsening climate impacts is a “false comfort”, he said: “There is no way to ‘adapt’ to temperatures beyond human tolerance … Whole cities built on flood plains cannot simply pick up and move uphill.”At 3C of global heating, climate damage cannot be insured against, covered by governments, or adapted to, Thallinger said: “That means no more mortgages, no new real estate development, no long-term investment, no financial stability. The financial sector as we know it ceases to function. And with it, capitalism as we know it ceases to be viable.”The only solution was to cut fossil fuel burning, or capture the emissions, he said, with everything else being a delay or distraction. He said capitalism must solve the crisis, starting with putting its sustainability goals on the same level as financial goals.Manyfinancial institutions have moved away from climate actionafter the election of the US president, Donald Trump, who hascalled such action a “green scam”. Thallingersaid in February: “The cost of inaction is higher than the cost of transformation and adaptation.

No one suffers more than the beneficiaries of Sentebale itself.“On behalf of the former trustees and patrons, we share in the relief that the Charity Commission confirmed they will be conducting a robust inquiry.“We fully expect it will unveil the truth that collectively forced us to resign. We remain hopeful this will allow for the charity to be put in the right hands immediately, for the sake of the communities we serve.”Chandauka, a Zimbabwean corporate lawyer who has held roles at Meta and Morgan Stanley, and leads a biotechnology company in New York, said she had first raised “governance, administration and management matters” at Sentebale with the commission in February.She said: “For completeness, I should mention that we initiated an internal governance review last year, the findings of which we will share with the Charity Commission.“We hope that, together, these actions will give the general public, our colleagues, partners, supporters, donors and the communities we serve comfort that Sentebale and its new board of trustees are acting appropriately to demonstrate and ensure good governance and a healthy culture for Sentebale to thrive.”She added: “In the meantime, our exceptional executive team and operational staff remain focused on the day-to-day operations of the charity, ensuring continuity in our work and mission delivery.“We appreciate the patience, understanding and tremendous support we have received from our existing and prospective partners and supporters, and look forward to continuing to work together with you as we recalibrate for an ambitious future.”Chandauka, who had sought to restructure the charity by moving its leadership to Africa and focusing fundraising in the US, has complained of “poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir [misogyny directed towards black women]” at Sentebale, which is based outside Maseru, the capital of Lesotho, in southern Africa.The regulatory compliance case could lead to a range of outcomes including an official warning or the opening of a statutory inquiry, which would give the commission additional powers of investigation.Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryCharitiesVoluntary sectorLesothonewsShareReuse this content"

Expansion will deliver huge growth benefits for Luton with thousands of good, new jobs and a cash boost for the local council which owns the airport.“This is the 14th development consent order approved by this Labour government, demonstrating we will stop at nothing to deliver economic growth and new infrastructure as part of our ‘plan for change’.”About 16.7 million people used the airport last year. It is the fourth largest in the London area and a base for a number of leisure airlines. It isalso well situated for the Oxford-Cambridge arc championed by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, for future economic growth.The approval comes less than a week after Vauxhall’s van-making factory in Luton was closed by its parent company, Stellantis, putting as many as 1,100 jobs at risk.The airport claims to have majority local support for the expansion plan, although opponents cite the destruction of an adjacent park amid wider climate and noise concerns.Paul Kehoe, the chair of Luton Rising, the council’s airport-owning company, said: “Our scheme will deliver up to 11,000 new jobs, additional annual economic activity of up to £1.5bn, and up to an additional £13m every year for communities and good causes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Dart rail link, which opened in 2023, will also be connected to the second terminal, with new taxiways for aircraft and parking facilities added.Campaigners says the expansion will not bring growth while damaging the environment. The New Economics Foundation’s senior economist, Alex Chapman, said: “Expansion at Luton will see another 8 million UK residents taking their money overseas on holiday instead of spending it on UK high streets.“If this government is so desperate for growth, it should focus on investing properly in the vital public services upon which the health of our economy really depends.”David Oakley-Hill of Luton Friends of the Earth said the group was extremely disappointed that Alexander had ignored Labour’s own tests on emissions and noise for airport expansion.He said: “Increased flights and traffic will bring far more pollution, cause ill-health and early deaths for many residents, gridlock the east of the town and destroy Wigmore Park – a vital noise and pollution barrier between the airport and people’s homes.”Explore more on these topicsAirline industryTransportPlanning policyInfrastructureHeidi AlexanderGreenhouse gas emissionsTransport policynewsShareReuse this content"

Plans include a new pergola – and there is little Wimbledon likes more than a pergola – which will provide a space for more hanging plants to provide shade and protection from British summer rain.The pergola, which will replace the structure at the top of the Hill, will wrap around the area’s 150-year-old oak tree while the AELTC hopes to make the area more environmentally sustainable by replacing tarmac paths with permeable resin. New accessible pathways to cross the slope aim to make the Hill easier to navigate for wheelchair users.View image in fullscreenNew paths crossing the slope would be added to improve accessibility.Photograph: AELTC/Allies and Morrison“The redevelopment of our world-famous Hill, in time for the championships 2027, will allow even more tennis fans to enjoy its unique atmosphere and vantage point,” said Deborah Jevans, the AELTC chair.“I am particularly pleased that these plans will increase the accessibility of the Hill for our guests using wheelchairs or who have additional accessibility requirements. It is an exciting opportunity as we look towards 2027 and the 150th anniversary of the first championships.”A consultation for local residents to learn more about the plans and give feedback is planned on 10 April before a planning application is submitted to Merton council.The AELTC will hope it is a smoother process than it experienced with its plan to vastly expand its grand slam venue, which aims to add 39 courts and an 8,000-seat show court, and to restore a lake designed by Capability Brown.In January a campaign group,Save Wimbledon Park, startedlegal actionto stop the expansion of the club, calling for a judicial review of plans to convert a swathe of the former Wimbledon Park golf course.The protest group says the development of the 29-hectare (72-acre) site – which was givenplanning permissionin September by the mayor of London’s office – is “inappropriate”.Work on the new-look Hill will start after the 2026 championships, and is expected to be unveiled – presumably with Pimm’s to toast the occasion – for the 150th anniversary of the tournament in 2027.Ruth Hopkins, general manager and head of access at the charity Level Playing Field, said: “I am delighted that Level Playing Field has played an important role in working with the AELTC to enhance their world-famous hill to be an inclusive and accessible space for everyone attending Wimbledon.“These plans will deliver significant improvements for all guests but particularly for those with accessibility requirements.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledonTennisLondonDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

They told the BBC that there wasno evidence that another person was involved.Postmortem examinations confirmed Searle died from hanging and Kerr suffered “multiple blows to the head with a blunt and sharp-edged object”.The couple married in 2023 and had two children each from previous relationships. They had lived in Aveyron for five years.Kerr was the mother of the Scottish actor and musician Callum Kerr, who played PC George Kiss in the Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, and appeared in Netflix’s Virgin River.Astatement on Kerr’s Instagramconfirmed he and his sister were grieving the loss of their mother, and that their step-brother and step-sister were mourning the loss of their father. The post also asked for the family’s privacy to be respected.According to his LinkedIn profile, Andrew Searle retired in 2015 after a career in financial crime prevention.After quitting as a consultant in financial crime assurance at Barclays in Glasgow, Searle posted that he was “enjoying life in rural France – renovating!”. He previously worked for 21 years at Standard Life, in Edinburgh, where he was responsible for the bank’s anti-crime initiative.Kerr’s Facebook profile said she grew up in the Scottish borders and went to school in the port town of Eyemouth.

Companies that breach the act face fines of up to £18m or 10% of worldwide revenue, which in the case of those such as Facebook’s owner, Meta, or Google would equate to billions of pounds. In extreme cases, services can also be taken down in the UK.Beeban Kidron, a cross-bench peer and internet safety campaigner, said: “The Labour party has lost its way. It’s pretty clear from my inbox this morning that their voters could not conceive that they would trade child safety for crumbs from Trump’s table.” The NSPCC, a UK child safety charity, said the government “must not roll back” on its commitment to improving the online environment for children.Asked in the House of Commons on Thursday whether the digital safety and competition laws and the digital services tax were part of the trade talks, the business secretary said there were “real differences of opinion” on some issues such as VAT but refused to “go into the content of all of the negotiations”. A source close to Reynolds did not deny the Playbook report.The technology secretary, Peter Kyle,told LBC last monththat the government was standing behind its online safety measures and “none of our protections for children and vulnerable people are up for negotiation”.The prime minister’s spokesperson said the government’s position on online safety had not changed.“We’ve said previously our Online Safety Act is all about protecting children online, making sure what is illegal offline is illegal online,” they said. “The technology secretary has reiterated that our basic protections for children and vulnerable people are not up for negotiation.”Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyChild protectionTrade policyChildrenTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

We know the community will want answers quickly and our investigators are working hard to establish the facts as we piece together what happened and how.“We have obtained details of some members of the public who witnessed the incident who we will be contacting, however we know there were many people near the station around the time of the shooting and we want to hear from anyone who may have seen the incident or has footage of it.“We have contacted the man’s family and will meet with them soon to explain our role. We will keep them regularly updated throughout our investigation.”The provisional cause of death was a single gunshot wound to the abdomen, the IOPC said. The officers involved provided their initial accounts of the incident to the watchdog and all officers who attended the scene were being treated as witnesses.People in the flats above Milton Keynes Central station reported hearing a single loud noise before a large police and ambulance presence arrived on Tuesday. Alan Brockbank, 70, said: “All I heard sounded like something heavy had been dropped, it didn’t sound like a shot or anything.”A large police presence attended about 10 minutes later, he said, adding: “Then, of course, they were all around the front of the building, actually we could see the person lying on the floor and they were trying to resuscitate him.”He saw a man receiving CPR chest compressions who was partly obscured by the awning at the station exit.Another man who lives in the flats, but did not want to be identified, said he immediately thought it was a gunshot “because it was really loud”.Explore more on these topicsMilton KeynesPoliceEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The UK owns golden shares in companies that are regarded as crucial to its security, including the weapons manufacturers BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce.The takeover had been called in for a review in August on national security grounds, because Royal Mail’s letter delivery still plays a crucial – albeit diminishing – role in the country’s communications infrastructure.The Royal Mail brand will also be protected for as long as EP owns the company.EP Group has also agreed to retain the universal service obligation, which guarantees a first-class postal service to anywhere in the UK for a fixed price six days a week, while Křetínský is in control.

The blast completely destroyed one property and made neighbouring houses uninhabitable.Galbraith had previously denied manslaughter and was due to go on trial next month but appeared at Newcastle crown court via a prison video link to change his pleas to guilty on Thursday.Northumbria police said its investigations had revealed that Galbraith and his friend Laws were using the property as a drug lab to produce cannabis concentrates, known as “shatter” or “butane honey oil”.This in turn was used to create cannabis edibles, or “gummies”.Archie and his family were asleep in the premises directly above where the “highly dangerous” extraction process was taking place, police said.Det Ch Insp Katie Smith, who led the investigation, said Archie had his whole life before him, describing it as an “unimaginable tragedy”.She added: “The process of creating cannabis shatter and other drugs in this way is exceptionally dangerous. The truly devastating impact of this case should be enough to make anyone doing this think again.”At a previous magistrates court hearing, prosecutors said police had stopped Galbraith’s car in April last year and found drugs. His home was searched and moulds to make cannabis sweets were discovered. He was released pending further investigation.Analysis of his mobile phone showed 80 text messages relating to the sale of cannabis sweets.Claire Armstrong, representing the prosecution at the magistrates court hearing, said the explosion on 16 October was caused by butane gas that was in the property to process drugs. “Following the explosion, 100 butane canisters were found,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He will be sentenced on 14 May by Mr Justice Cotter after a report has been prepared.Galbraith has also admitted possessing and supplying cannabis between November 2023 and October 2024.Police said they were keen to hear from anyone who becomes aware of people buying, taking delivery of or being in possession of multiple butane canisters or propane bottles.Explore more on these topicsNewcastleNorth of EnglandTyne and WearEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But from 1 April, the government introduced a cap of £25,000 on the exemption after giving just three months’ notice of the change. It claimed 94% of church building projects will be unaffected, but many churches fear the change puts their repair and restoration programmes in jeopardy.According to the National Churches Trust, a charity that supports church buildings of all denominations, the change will place a huge additional burden on cash-strapped parish churches which are already dependent on fundraising, grants and donations to maintain heritage buildings.More than three-quarters of the Church of England’s 16,000 church buildings, many dating from Norman and medieval times, are listed by HistoricEngland. Many have benefited from the VAT exemption since it was introduced in 2001.St Mary’s Totnes, a church built from Devon stone in the 15th century, is facing a shortfall of £200,000 on a £1.68m repair and restoration project after the VAT change.The church attracts 50,000 visitors a year to admire its rare full width 15th century rood screen, Kempe stained glass window, 19th century Willis organ and restored oak wagon roof.As well as religious services, it hosts concerts, talks and lectures and choir practices. A weekly community cafe had to be reduced to monthly over the winter due to the cold.Father Jim Barlow, the rector, said the church was a local landmark, but “constantly crumbling”. The regular maintenance bills were entirely financed by voluntary contributions.View image in fullscreenSt Mary’s attracts 50,000 visitors a year.Photograph: Gillian ModrateA major programme of work to repair and replace the damp and sinking nave floor, install a new carbon zero heating system and improve accessibility had been planned for 15 years. Funds to pay for the work were raised from the National LotteryHeritageFund, grants, trusts, and the local community.Barlow said he was “gutted” at the cap on VAT exemption. “For a small parish church, this is a big blow. We’d actually gone slightly over our fundraising target, but now we have a £200,000 hole in our budget.“To stop now would be so demoralising and we’d lose all the money we’ve already spent on development work.“We’ve already signed contracts, so we have to press on. We may have to try to cut the cost of the project but we’ve already trimmed it as much as we can. It’s difficult to see what else we can do.”Other listed churches are also reckoning with the imposition of VAT on major repairs. St Mary Magdalene in Newark, Nottinghamshire, a Grade I-listed 12th century church, is now facing a £600,000 shortfall on a £4m restoration project that has been planned for five years.“It was a huge struggle to raise the funding,” wrote Andrew Fearn, a church warden, to his local MP. “This is a grievous blow as we do not have funds to cover [the shortfall].”St John the Baptist, in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, has raised £386,000 to repair its 15th-century spire – the tallest in the county at 198ft. Jo Slade, chair of trustees for Friends of John the Baptist, said the VAT change was “a blow to our project, and fundraising by volunteers will have to continue”.St Michael le Belfrey inYorkis set to fall short by £1.4m on a £12m repair and renewal project on the Grade I-listed building which supports a food bank and debt counselling. Building work began last summer to install sustainable heating and upgrade facilities.Sir Philip Rutnam, chair of the National Churches Trust, said:“The burden of looking after these buildings already falls on local people. Now they’ll have to raise funds to pay VAT to the Treasury on top of everything else. If these cuts remain, it’s inevitable more churches will close.“This is not just about heritage. Churches house food banks, parent and toddler groups, and provide social action worth £55bn a year. At a time when deep cuts are being made to welfare, the government should be backing this kind of community support, not undermining it.”St Mary’s Totnes and other churches are asking the government to reverse its decision. “These churches are a big part of the nation’s heritage, but small rural congregations are struggling with the huge responsibility of preserving them,” Barlow said.Explore more on these topicsHeritageEnglandDevonYorknewsShareReuse this content"

People have been asked not to light outdoor fires.“It is crucial that people understand the impact of careless fire-setting,” the area commander and local senior officer for Highland, Michael Humphreys, the SFRS wildfire lead, said. “Even with the best intentions, small fires can rapidly spread, causing devastating damage. If you light a campfire during high winds, high temperatures and low humidity, there is potential that it could get out of control.“Always take steps to ensure your campfire is fully extinguished before you leave. Simple steps to act safely and responsibly is a must.”The fire service warned just last month that spring would prove the “most critical period for wildfires in Scotland”.Earlier in the week, crews had already extinguished a wildfire near Bonhill in West Dunbartonshire and another in the Kilpatrick Hills near Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire.InEngland, the Moors Valley country park on the Dorset-Hampshire border remains closed after multiple wildfires there since Monday.Dorset and Wiltshire fire and rescue service (DWFRS) said crews were called to the park again on Wednesday after more hotspots were discovered during a re-inspection near Ringwood. Several hectares of woodland have been destroyed. No injuries have been reported.A spokesperson for the fire service said: “The cause is still unknown at this time. There is currently an amber wildfire alert in place for the service area, and we urge people to take extra care while enjoying our open spaces in the sunshine.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of the victims has beennamed: a 68-year-old man named Garry Moore who was a fire chief in Cape Girardeau county, Missouri. At least a dozen injuries have also been reported from the storms.The White House has approved a state of emergency request from Tennessee, where rising floodwaters have menaced Nashville.Indiana, meanwhile, has declared its own state of emergency, activating 50 national guard members to deal with severe weather that has affected 41 of the state’s counties.“In times like these, I’m immensely grateful for the soldiers who are on the ground ensuring Hoosier safety,” said Mike Braun, Indiana’s governor.The storms are now tracking east, after leaving more than 213,000 householdswithout powerfrom Texas to Ohio. A “high-risk” excessive rainfall warning was issued by the National Weather Service for parts of Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky that are expected to be deluged over the next two days.Dozens of tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings were issued in parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri andMississippion Wednesday evening. In Arkansas, the National Weather Service told residents: “This is a life threatening situation. Seek shelter now.”At least one person died due to the storms inMissouri, police there said, with multiple reports of damage across several states. Homes were ripped apart in Lake City, Arkansas, with trees shredded and cars flipped over.In parts of Tennessee, people were told to not use the roads due to the amount of debris on them. Several Tennessee school districts have announced closures or virtual learning in preparation for tomorrow’s anticipated storms, theWeatherChannel reports.The Tennessee governor, Bill Lee, after examining the devastation, said Thursday it was too early to know whether there were more deaths as searches persisted.A rare tornado emergency was declared around Blytheville,Arkansas, on Wednesday evening after debris was hurled at least 25,000ft into the air.“It’s definitely going to be a really horrible situation here come sunrise in the morning in those areas, coming out of Arkansas,” Chelly Amin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service,told the Associated Press.In Indiana, winds reached 81mph (130km/h) and caused widespread power outages. Debris from damage has covered roads in the state and schools have been closed.While the US south and midwest have long faced the prospect of such storms, the severity of such events is being amplified by the climate crisis, scientists have said.Tornadoes may be shifting to different parts of the country, while a warmer climate holds more moisture, leading to more intense downpours.The coming days are likely to bring severe flash flooding across several states, with more than a foot of rain possible. There will be “significant, life-threatening flash flooding” until Saturday, the National Weather Service warned, adding: “Historic rainfall totals and impacts are possible.”Flooding in rural south-eastern Oregon caused by historic levels of snowmelt and rainfall has prompted evacuation orders, school closures and public health concerns.Officials say more than 1,000 people are under the highest level of evacuation orders. County authorities say drinking water is safe, but warn that floodwaters could be contaminated with bacteria such asEcoli. Residents have been urged to avoid floodwaters when possible. The Oregon governor Tina Kotek declared a state of emergency due to the flooding, which followed rapid snowmelt in the area.Heavy rain has already started to swell rivers around Memphis, Tennessee, with the National Weather Service warning of the threat of flooding in the city as soil becomes saturated with water.“Flash flooding will emerge as a primary concern with this extremely active pattern,” the weather service said on Thursday.The looming floods are likely to cause further damage and increase the death toll. One man did manage an unusual escape, though, after a tornado destroyed his home in Selmer, Tennessee.Matt Vandevander jumped into his bathtub to shelter from the storm but it ripped him out of his house and threw him into his neighbor’s yard. Somehow, Vandevander survived with just a few scratches.“It’s a miracle,” hetold WMC, a CNN affiliate. “I’m very happy – happier than I probably should be.”Explore more on these topicsUS weatherArkansasTornadoesClimate crisisIllinoisIndianaMississippinewsShareReuse this content"

It is also seeking a $2.4bn “restitution fund” for victims of hate and violence incited on Facebook.I was a content moderator for Facebook. I saw the real cost of outsourcing digital labour | Sonia KgomoRead moreOne of the claimants is the son of Prof Meareg Amare Abrha, who was murdered at his home in Ethiopia after his address and threatening posts were published on Facebook in 2021 during a civil war in the country. Another claimant is Fisseha Tekle, a former researcher at Amnesty International who published reports on violence committed during the conflict in Tigray in northern Ethiopia and received death threats on Facebook.Meta has argued that courts in Kenya, where Facebook’s Ethiopia moderators were based at the time, did not have jurisdiction over the case. The Kenyan high court in Nairobi ruled on Thursday that the case fell within the jurisdiction of the country’s courts.Abrham Meareg, the son of Meareg, said: “I am grateful for the court’s decision today. It is disgraceful that Meta would argue that they should not be subject to the rule of law in Kenya. African lives matter.”Tekle said he cannot return home to Ethiopia because of Meta’s failure to make Facebook safe. “Meta cannot undo the damage it has done, but it can radically change how it moderates dangerous content across all its platforms to make sure no one else has to go through what I have,” he said. “I look forward to this matter now being heard by the court in full.”The case, supported by non-profit organisations including Foxglove and Amnesty International, also demands a formal apology from Meta for the murder of Meareg. The Katiba Institute, a Kenya-based NGO focusing on the Kenyan constitution, is the third claimant in the case.In 2022an analysisby the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Observer found that Facebook was letting users post content inciting violence through hate and misinformation, despite being aware that it was fuelling tensions in Tigray.Meta rejected the claims at the time, saying it had “invested in safety and security measures” to tackle hate and inflammatory language along with “aggressive steps to stop the spread of misinformation” in Ethiopia.In January the company said it wasremoving factcheckersand “dramatically” reducing the amount of censorship on the platform, although it would continue to tackle illegal and high severity violations.Meta said it did not comment on ongoing legal matters.Explore more on these topicsMetaEthiopiaSocial mediaFacebookInternet safetyDigital mediaSocial networkingnewsShareReuse this content"

The fires forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people in the region and within days laid waste to 60sq miles (97sq km) and destroyed nearly 17,000 structures.The city is continuing to reckon with the aftermath of the blazes and rebuilding is expected to take years. Meanwhile, several victims from January’s wildfires are still unidentified.Identifying remains from the fires relies on “complex scientific methods”, the medical examiner’s office said, including comparisons using dental records and DNA and the use of radiographs to find any medical prosthetics or devices that might have serial numbers.“The DME also works with law enforcement agencies to gather information on suspected missing persons to conduct follow-up with families,” the statement said. “Due to the complexity of these methods and the process, it can take considerable time to confirm a decedent’s identity in these types of cases.”Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresCaliforniaLos AngelesUS wildfiresExtreme weatherWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

But a ‘bad dancer’ is not a person that is bad and a dancer,” said Berthet. “So bad is really modifying the meaning of dancer here.”It was previously thought animals such as birds and chimpanzees were only able to produce the former type of combination, but scientists have found bonobos can create both.The team recorded 700vocalisations from 30 adult bonobos in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, checking the context of each against a list of 300 possible situations or descriptions.The results reveal bonobos have seven different types of call, used in 19 different combinations. Of these, 15 require further analysis, but four appear to follow the rules of human sentences.Yelps – thought to mean “let’s do that” – followed by grunts – thought to mean “look at what I am doing”, were combined to make “yelp-grunt”, which appeared to mean “let’s do what I’m doing”. The combination, the team said, reflected the sum of its parts and was used by bonobos to encourage others to build their night nests.The other three combinations had a meaning apparently related to, but different from, their constituent calls.For example, the team found a peep – which roughly means “I would like to …” – followed by a whistle – appeared to mean “let’s stay together” – could be combined to create “peep-whistle”. This combination was used to smooth over tense social situations, such as during mating or displays of prowess. The team speculated its meaning was akin to “let’s find peace”.The team said the findings in bonobos, together with the previous work in chimps, had implications for the evolution of language in humans, given all three species showed the ability to combine words or vocalisations to create phrases.“The cognitive building blocks that facilitate this capacity is at least 7m years old,” said Dr Simon Townsend, another author of the research. “And I think that is a really cool finding.”Explore more on these topicsAnimal behaviourPrimatologyBiologyLanguagenewsShareReuse this content"

It created the extraordinary situation where Loomer appeared to have more influence than the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, over the NSC and undercut Waltz in having aides axed under him.Loomer brought a booklet of papers laying out the perceived disloyalty of about a dozen staffers, including Waltz’s principal deputy, Alex Wong, to the meeting, which was also attended by JD Vance, the chief of staff Susie Wiles, the commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and Waltz himself.The fired officials included Brian Walsh, the senior director for intelligence who previously worked for now secretary of state Marco Rubio on the Senate intelligence committee; Thomas Boodry, the senior director for legislative affairs who previously served as Waltz’s legislative director in Congress; and Maggie Dougherty, the senior director for international organizations, the people said.While the firings appeared arbitrary, one of the people said that the White House looked through Loomer’s opposition research and verified parts of it. Ultimately, it found that one NSC official had recently criticized Trump on social media and others had ties to Republican establishment figures like the senators John McCain and Mitch McConnell, whom Trump despises.The firings did not include Wong, who has been one of Loomer’s top targets. Loomer has vilified Wong over the work of his wife, Candice, at the justice department, which involved prosecuting January 6 Capitol rioters. Loomer has also publicly suggested that Wong has sympathies with the Chinese communist party.Loomer did not immediately respond to questions sent by text about the alleged sins of the NSC officials she targeted. Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the NSC, did not respond to a request for comment.But in the days since Waltz inadvertently added a journalist from the Atlantic to a Signal group chat, where the defense secretary Pete Hegseth shared updates about a US military strike against the Houthis in Yemen, Loomer suggested Wong and other career NSC officials were trying to sabotage Trump by causing a scandal.She baselessly claimed Wong deliberately added the Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to the sensitive chat “as part of a foreign opp to embarrass the Trump administration on behalf of China”. (The White House’s final internal conclusion,the Guardian has reported, was that Waltz added Goldberg by mistake himself.)Loomer has been part of a group of Trump allies to disparage Waltz and his team, calling them “neocons” – short for neo-conservatives – as a pejorative term to castigate them for being too hawkish and eager to project US military power abroad, at odds with Trump’s “America first” foreign policy.The online vilification of Waltz and his team took a turn on Wednesday when Loomer appeared at the White House for the meeting. It was not immediately certain how Loomer was cleared to access the White House complex given she lacks a “hard pass” even as a reporter, a sore issue she has complained about in recent weeks.Loomer sat directly across from Trump in the Oval Office as she made her pitch to him directly to remove the people she was targeting. TheNew York Times reportedthat the Republican representative Scott Perry, who had his own concerns about staffers in the administration, was also trying to meet with Trump at the same time.The effect on Waltz was not clear. He left the White House with Trump on Marine One on Thursday, which signaled support from the president, who last week declined to fire Waltz over the Signal chat episode. Waltz has also recently shown more deference to Wiles, the chief of staff, in an effort to win her support, the people said.But Waltz’s political enemies point out that Waltz survived the Signal chat episode principally becauseTrump was unwilling to give the news media a victory, and not because of his confidence in Waltz. His main ally is also perceived to be the senator Lindsey Graham, as opposed to a network of allies inside Trump’s inner circle.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpFar right (US)US politicsSignal group chat leakUS national securitynewsShareReuse this content"

If you want to strengthen security in the Arctic, as we would like, let’s do it together.”Accusing the US of subjecting Denmark and Greenland to “pressure and threats”, she said: “What should we believe about the country we have admired for many years?”View image in fullscreenMette Frederiksen talks with the newly elected head of government, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, in Nuuk, Greenland.Photograph: Mads Claus Rasmussen/ReutersNielsen said: “Dialogue is of course the way forward, but it is also a great uncertainty that there is no dialogue now. That is why it is important to have dialogue that is based on respect.”Calling for unity, Greenland’s prime minister said: “Because of the things happening outside the country, we must stand together. Also within the realm, but also in our relationship with our allies.”Egede said Greenland wanted to cooperate with the US on trade, but reasserted his previous comments, saying: “We are not for sale.”Meanwhile, in Brussels, the US state department said Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, had reaffirmed the “strong relationship” between the US and Denmark during a meeting with Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the Danish foreign minister.Afterwards, Rasmussen said that he had “used this opportunity to state some things on behalf of the Danish kingdom”. He added: “More specifically, that these repeated statements from the US president with a vision or ambition to control Greenland are in no way sustainable. It has reached a point where it actually challenges our sovereignty as a kingdom.”In contrast to last week’s Greenland visit by the US vice-president,JD Vance– which, after a diplomatic outcry, was limited to the US military base Pituffik and did not involve Greenlandic or Danish representatives – Frederiksen was greeted at the airport by Egede and went straight to the capital, Nuuk, where she met Nielsen.Frederiksen’s visit had initially been criticised by members of the governing coalition because the new government has not yet been officially approved. However, before her arrival, Nielsen said: “Denmark is our closest partner and it is natural we meet as soon as possible.”The last time Frederiksen was in Greenland was in March 2024 on ajoint visitwith the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A general election last month resulted in the most US- and Trump-friendly party leaving coalition talks, after which the four other parties, led by Nielsen’s Democrats, signed a coalition agreement hours before Vance touched down in Greenland last Friday.Page one of the agreementstated: “Greenland belongs to us.”Frederiksen’s visit takes place amid reports from the US that the White House is preparing an estimate of what it would cost the government to control Greenland as a territory.According to the Washington Post, the White House budget office is assessing the cost of running Greenland and working out an estimate of how much revenue could be earned from its natural resources.Among the options on the table is to offer Greenland a higher figure in subsidies, approximately £500m a year, than Denmark currently does.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkTrump administrationEuropeDonald TrumpJD VanceUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The dossier assembled in 2016 created a political storm just before Trump’s inauguration with rumours and uncorroborated allegations that have since been largely discredited.Orbis had said the lawsuit should be thrown out because the report had never been meant to be made public and was published by BuzzFeed without the permission of Steele or Orbis. It also said the claim had been filed too late.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It also advocates for LGBTQ+ people, who have faced years of brutalpersecutionin Russia.In its statement, Russia’s prosecutor general’s office designated the EJAF as an “undesirable organisation”, a label that bans the group from operating inRussiaand exposes its staff and partners to potential criminal prosecution.The prosecutor general’s office accused the foundation of promoting “non-traditional sexual relationships, western family models, and gender reassignment”.The prosecutor’s office alleged that EJAF held “negative attitudes” toward countries that “uphold traditional spiritual and moral values”. It accused the foundation of taking part in a campaign to “discredit Russia” since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.“When a musician plays along with those trying to sow the seeds of democracy, it is propaganda. And when it’sElton Johncalling the tune, then it’s more than just anti-Russian propaganda too,” the statement read.“In our country, the British foundation works closely with non-profit organisations designated as foreign agents,” the Russian law enforcement agency added.The ruling is the latest blow to human rights groups supporting Russians living with HIV and Aids. According to Rospotrebnadzor, the federal agency for public health and consumer rights, more than 1.2 million people in Russia have HIV, the highest per capita rate inEurope.The country has faced chronic shortages of HIV medication since 2023, leaving many patients struggling to access tests and life-saving antiretroviral therapy.Repression of Russia’s LGBTQ+ people has escalated since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

You get a new impression of new locations, traditions, people and so on … You want also to be there,” Magnus said.Magnus had just finished taking his own photos on a small boat, staged in one of the park’s canals for visitors to take their own Instagrammable images.View image in fullscreenStaff plant and nurture 7m flower bulbs for the garden, which is only open for eight weeks in the year.Photograph: Robin van Lonkhuijsen/EPAStaff plant and nurture a staggering 7m flower bulbs to ensure visitors who flock to the Keukenhof from around the world all get to see a vibrant spectacle during the eight weeks the garden is open.In recent years, the garden has increasingly catered to the public’s thirst for social media content and created spaces where guests are encouraged to pose.Selfie spots include flower archways, pink velvet couches and another Dutch classic – oversized wooden clogs.View image in fullscreenAnother picture opportunity at the Keukenhof.Photograph: Robin van Lonkhuijsen/EPAThe Keukenhof’s own social media channels have some suggestions about the best locations and the Dutch tourism board even advises on how to get the perfect tulip selfie.“Make your image come alive and place the subject of your photo slightly off-centre.

It runs incredibly smoothly and will reinvigorate even the most hardened – dare I say jaded – Mario Kart player.Elsewhere there is a more traditional Mario Kart experience where everyone gets to finish the race. You’re still sprinting across some configuration of a world map – one moment you’re driving through Boo’s cinema, the next you’re hurtling through a Toad-branded manufacturing plant. Tweaks from the previous game include: a few new weapons, skidding feels less agile, the tracks feel less claustrophobic and they’ve styled Waluigi like Steven Van Zandt.Super Mario Party JamboreeView image in fullscreenQuirky … Super Mario Party Jamboree.Photograph: NintendoMario Party is Nintendo’s party game franchise – board games, mini games, screwing each other over, players taking it far too seriously … you get the drill. This series has always allowedNintendoto showcase the quirkier aspects of its hardware, and the camera works well in the mini games I played. I enjoyed the goomba-catching mini game (named Goombalancing Act): you stand in front of the console and camera, then marvel as you’re projected on to the TV, now with a red pedestal on your head; as goombas begin falling from the sky you bob and weave to catch, stack and balance. The player with the most goombas at the end wins.Elsewhere, there’s a squatting/standing decision based game (I can already see the camera being incorporated into the next Ring Fit/Wii Fit title) and a game that rewards those who move and shout the most, making use of the inbuilt microphone (this one might quickly grow old). It’s all very reminiscent of PlayStation’s EyeToy. The mouse functionality gets a run-out too – tagging Bob-ombs with spray scans is the standout (you literally shake the Joy-Con like a canister when you run out of spray).At the roundtable we’re told that Nintendo developed the microphone to remove unwanted external noise, but the sound of clapping will still get picked up, to allow the full emotion of the experience to come through. Nintendo is clearly trying to keep the spirit of local multiplayer gaming alive at a time where people are more isolated and less inclined to leave their homes. There’s an option to have your friends appear via camera at the bottom of your screen too. Being able to look people in the eye as you stab them in the back at a digital board game – that’s what makes life worth living.Drag x DriveDrag x Drive is Nintendo’s combination of Rocket League and wheelchair basketball. You hold the Joy-Con in “mouse mode”, one in each hand, and then manouvre as though you’re operating a wheelchair. There’s a tutorial which takes some getting used to and at times it makes your arm ache a bit, but thankfully the game itself is less taxing and much more about smaller motions and precision. If you don’t have a table in front of you to use the mouse then it’s designed to work on your lap. I gave this a try, but quickly became conscious of the fact that I was a 35-year-old man furiously rubbing his legs under a table.And the rest …There have been concerns that the more iterative approach to the new Switch marks a new age for Nintendo, one where its less weird. Well, look no further thanNintendo Switch2 Welcome Tour. Picture the Switch 2 on its side, then enlarge it to the size of the airport, then turn buttons into kiosks with digital receptionists that you can explore: essentially it’s a playable guide to your console through the medium of mini games, explainers, tutorials and quizzes. It is more fun that it sounds … just.In Donkey Kong Bananza you run around and destroy a lot of rocks. Maybe it was just the early levels I played, but it feels as if it skews toward a beginner audience. It looks amazing though. Then there’s Metroid Prime 4. The opening sequence was playable here and all I’ll say is it looks and feels exactly like Metroid Prime Remastered (complimentary) but slightly more vibrant, cinematic and busy, with mouse functionality for those who play their shooters that way.The hardwareView image in fullscreenAn iterative hop … Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoThe Switch 2 is more of an iterative hop than a grand redesign. The focus is on pragmatic changes that improve quality of life. It’s a wider model than its predecessor, and though it feels sturdier it doesn’t feel that much heavier in handheld mode. The bigger screen pops, as you’d expect; and it all looks very sleek and less like a toy. It all feels like marginal gains, but together adds up to a much slicker, more modern device.The Joy-Con feels more durable, weightier than their predecessors and more comfortable to hold, with bigger buttons that are less awkward to press (the shoulder buttons in particular). I wasn’t able to test out the magnetic attach/detach aspect, but I was able to detach the thin case that goes over the edges once they’re no longer docked in the system – what a relief to no longer be messing about with those cheap black sliders. As for the dreadedJoy-Con drift, we were told during the roundtable that the new models have been designed from the ground up to account for bigger and smoother movements.The pro controller feels exactly as it did before, albeit with joysticks that feel slightly more durable and comfortable. I have minor concerns about accidentally hitting the new buttons at the base of the controller in the heat of karting battle – accidentally firing off a premature red shell maybe – but I’m sure I’ll get used to it. In the developer roundtable it was also confirmed that Joy-Con and pro controllers from the previous generation would be compatible with the Switch 2 (though presumably with some obvious restrictions on functionality).A note on the performance of the Switch 2: in my four hours’ playtime I remember seeing one loading screen. That was for Cyberpunk and it lasted maybe five to 10 seconds. I only had a few minutes to play, so immediately began shooting Night City cops to start a riot – and my brief impressions are that the hardware coped pretty well with the ensuing carnage. Likewise for Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I immediately loaded the save marked Korok Forest and sprinted under the Deku Tree, witnessing the forest for the first time without a single frame dropping.The verdictWhether or not Nintendo can convince diehard fans like me isn’t the question here. Nintendo has often struggled with following up its triumphs in the home console market, lurching from runaway success to squandered opportunities. When the original Switch came out in March 2017, it was off the back of the dismal performance of the Wii U, a device that sold 13.5m units in its lifetime. Its job was to move devotees on from a failing system and convince casual gamers to come back. Nintendo has a different job this time around: it now has to convince perhaps the largest install base in its history (150m units sold and counting) to make the switch (I’m sorry) to its reasonably similar new model. It’s a big ask for Nintendo, and in this climate ofhome console uncertainty, for the entire industry.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendo SwitchNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

My group, the Crystallettes, graced many a nightclub stage in competitions, and every time either us or [fellow Chicago girl group] the Emotions would win. But I remember singing some Aretha Franklin songs and people in the audience were throwing money on the stage, and they started calling me “little Aretha”. That’s when I connected the dots: “Oh, I see what this is all about.” I realised I didn’t have to become a teacher or a whatever I wanted to be when I grew up back then – I could be a singer!You have so much confidence and you just knew you and [the band] Rufus were going to make it big. Where does that confidence come from?stifwhiffWhen I was with Rufus, I knewIloved what we were doing, and I could only hope and pray everyone else loved it like I did. That’s all you can ask for. And that’s still how I am about the music I make. I have confidence in everything I do – all the time. And that is a necessary thing to have if you want success – if you’ve created something and you want everyone to love it,youhave to love it first. And that’s applicable to everything in life, not just music.View image in fullscreenThis is her night … Chaka Khan performing at the Auditorium theatre in Chicago, April 1980.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesYour coverofJoni Mitchell’s Hejirawas unbelievable. I’ve read about your plannedMitchell album for a long time. Are you still planning to release it?Jroel72I love Joni – she’s helped me out of a lot of rough spots, just with her music. We’re great friends, and have been for many, many years. I first met her when I did a little ad-lib on her songDreamland. She knows how to get a good collaboration going, and she always has a great rhythm section – my all-time favourite songs of hers are the ones where Jaco [Pastorius] is playing bass, God bless his soul. I am indeed working on a CD of some of my favourite songs by her, and it’ll be out … soon.View image in fullscreenI’m every woman … Chaka Khan circa 1970.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesI saw you in [stage musical]Mama, I Want To Sing!many years ago (which you were very good in). Do you have any ambitions to return to the stage?jaelliottNo. I’m glad you saw it and enjoyed it, but I got zonked out from doing that. [Acting on stage] is just too much hard work; I don’t need to do it and it’s just not my favourite thing to do – music is. I never get bored with songs and music and melody. I’m lucky to be doing something that feeds me and nurtures me and makes me feel good.How often do you play the drums now?KnobtwidllerIloveplaying drums. I just don’t often get the chance to play, unless I’m jamming at the club with somebody – and I don’t go out clubbing much these days. I love any drummer who’s in the pocket. Buddy Miles was my favourite, growing up, and my dad turned me on to Max Roach when I was a kid. My dad inspired me to play drums; he used to play congas. When I was a little girl, my sister and I used to go with him to the park, where they’d have a drum circle going, and we’d join in and have a great time. I can also play a little bass, and I took flute and violin in school for hot minutes. But I’m really a drummer. I’m going to just start doing some drums, some beats, on my recordings.Like Sugar [from 2019] is an absolute banger. Any plans to release more music soon?snak3spanI’m working on it right now! Sia and I are working on an amazing project, and I hope the first single will come out some time this summer. I’malwaysworking on music. And Sia is amazing – she’s my goddaughter! This is something we’ve been working on for a year now, and it’s killing us, because we keep coming up with more great music to do! We can’t finish, because we’ve got so much to give. It’s beautiful.I once heard you write poetry in your spare time. Have you given thought to compiling itand releasing a poetry book?JulesTheDreamerI’ve talked about doing a poetry book; I just can’t find all the scrap paper I’ve been writing my poems on! When I’m in creative mode, I need somebody to snatch those papers up before I go on to the next sheet! But I’ve got to start putting all that junk together and see if it inspires anybody, because sometimes the most disorganised stuff can be the best you’ve written. Life is inspiration to me – it’s like a bag of chips and popcorn, a major mix. I’m never at a loss of stuff to write about.View image in fullscreenOn stage with Sia in 2023, when Khan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Photograph: Kevin Kane/Getty Images for The Rock and Roll Hall of FameI lovedyour versionofA Night in Tunisia.Would you take such an innovative approach to other jazz standards?And when did you startloving jazz music?User28I’ve done plenty of jazz standards. I’ve loved jazz since I was a toddler – my mother and father were jazz fanatics. I heard everything from the Art Ensemble of Chicago – which was, you know,out there– to Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis. And I worked with Miles. He and Prince were very similar – big thinkers. Miles was always looking to grow. Prince was, too. The three of us collaborated onSticky Wicked, on my CK album in 1988, and it was a beautiful combination.What’s your favourite Stevie Wonder song? What was he like to work with?EddieChorepostI Was Made to Love Her. That song just wipes me out.I covered it as well[as I Was Made to Love Him]. Another genius.Youperformed once at Gay Pride in London inKennington Park. My first Pride – I was a young lesbian, 19 or 20. The power of your voice blasting across the field was incredible. Firstly, thank you. It felt like the gays were being blessed by you. Do you remember being there? Andhave you always been a champion of the LGBTQ+ community?FoolishBoyI’vealwaysbeen a champion. I’m so sorry, I don’t remember that day; it sounds remarkable. I’m so glad you were able to bathe in that wonderful feeling. I’m a champion of anyone who is having a problem getting their point across, of living their life, their love, the way they want or need to. If they are struggling to be heard, to be loved, to be understood, I’m behind them.View image in fullscreenKhan on stage with Prince in 2006.Photograph: Michael Caulfield Archive/WireImageWhat was performing with Prince like?GeeSNZ64It was like working with myself, more than anyone else I’ve worked with. Sia’s bringing up a close third, behind Prince and Miles Davis. Quincy Jones, too: he oozed inspiration and shared it. Prince just grabbed ideas out of the air and left you wondering: “Where did you get that?” He was a really deep and beautiful thinker. We worked on a lot of songs, and they’re all going to be on a CD I’m soon to release – there’s a lot of red tape that’s been in the way, but we’ve cleared it. It’s him and me and Larry Graham, together.Chaka Khan: ‘Someone said there were too many black people in our band.

I remember that he came out at around 4am and youandGeorge Bensonjoined him, and it was a great night. Other than that my memory is hazy. What do you remember of that night?WhistlebumpMy memory is at least as hazy as yours, I bet – probably more. Four o’clock in the morning? No one’s doing anything but craziness at four in the morning! So I’m sure it was like a wild, wonderful night. And don’t look for the little details; just remember the big feeling you had. That’s how I handlemymemories. I don’t remember a lot of what I did. And thank God! I’m a “next!” person. Life is about what’s happening now, what’s coming next. I’ve done a lot in my life, and over half of it I don’t remember. Did I ever keep a diary? Oh, hell no. That takes a special kind of patience.Does the fact that music is a universal language prove we all have a lot more in common than we realise?Twist27Absolutely. Music is the language of the angels – when I sing, I feel oneness with all creation, oneness with God, with everything. It’s a remarkable thing. And maybe it sounds a bit cuckoo, but it’s the truth. When everything comes together – the instruments, the vocal – that’s the sound of angels speaking.Chaka Khan will perform at theHampton Court Palace festivalon 18 June.

Orlando Bloom, who played Legolas,said in 2019that he had been paid $175,000 for all three films, while Sean Astin (Samwise Gamgee) said he got $250,000.Released between 2001 and 2003, Jackson’s three-film series grossed $2.96bnat the worldwide box office, with a reported budget of $281m.Explore more on these topicsFilmLord of the RingsScience fiction and fantasy filmsFilm adaptationsJRR TolkienCate BlanchettnewsShareReuse this content"

The Magician’s Nephew centres on two children, Digory Kirke and Polly Plummer, who discover the magical world through Digory’s uncle Andrew. Daniel Craig is also in talks for the film, withspeculation rising that he will play the uncle. Charli XCX is also in line for a role, rumoured to be Jadis, the White Witch.The film will be Gerwig’s first since megahit Barbie, which earned over $1.4bn at the global box office.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Such is the strength of feeling, almost all of it positive, about Minecraft that it was only a matter of time before someone tried to turn it into a film. After all, you have a historically popular product and a highly engaged fanbase: what could possibly go wrong? Turns out, quite a lot. Last September, thefirst trailerfor the film – titled A Minecraft Movie – was released, and the reaction was instant and violent. “Minecraft fans devastated by ‘awful’ live-action trailer”read one headlinethe following day.Some calledit “a crime against humanity”;others“a soulless neon abomination”. In less than 24 hours, the website GamingBible had called it “a curse on my eyes” and “pure nightmare fuel”. Within three days of its release, the trailer had been downvoted more than 1m times.If you’re familiar with Minecraft, you can probably understand why. Minecraft is a game with a highly distinctive look; everything is made of square blocks, and there’s a muted palette. The trailer, however, is insanely garish. Everything looks like it is made of Haribo and, worse, the blocks have slightly rounded edges. Worse still, there are humans in it. Heightened, ironic-looking humans.Jason Momoais in it, in an unflattering blond wig and hot-pink leather jacket. In other words, it looks like a film made by people who don’t understand Minecraft.“This is Jumanji but with a Minecraft skin,” was the first reaction of Argentinian YouTuberElVitt0ri0on seeing the teaser. “Minecraft offers an infinite number of narrative possibilities. And yet they decided to go with the ‘we go to another universe and learn about it’ storyline? What is this? Space Jam 3?”ElVitt0ri0’s response was to createA Movie About Minecraft (That Doesn’t Exist), a version of what the film should have been. The trailer was created with the open-source animation software Blender that was used to makeFlow, which won best animated feature at this year’s Oscars; it’s a fully animated trailer that retains the look of the original game and features characters recognisable to players. Underneath the video is the comment: “This is everything the Minecraft movie should have been, the game elements, the history, the community … it’s so perfect.”And ElVitt0ri0 is not alone. Dozens, maybe even hundreds, of fan-made Minecraft trailers have sprung up online since the official teaser went live, each trying to find their own way to undo the damage it caused. Vicky Fernandes, who runs the channel Gloomy Animations,made one entitledMinecraft Movie Trailer But It’s Actually Good. Her video is explicitly a fix rather than a reimagining; a shot-for-shot remake where everything is animated in a more immediately recognisable Minecraft style. And it is good; so good that the comments beneath the video are full of relieved now-that’s-what-I-expected sentiment.View image in fullscreenFor a certain type of fan, the Minecraft look is gospel.Photograph: Mojang“I think the movie should have been animated, not live action,” Fernandes says over email. “Mixing CGI cube-looking characters with real humans looks very weird. The CGI characters also look oddly realistic while keeping the cube proportions, making it look creepy. Overall, the film does not have an appealing art style.”What ElVitt0ri0 and Fernandes have in common is that they are Minecraft fans first and foremost. Fernandes first started playing the game in 2014, when she was eight years old, and began making fan videos four years later. ElVitt0ri0 started playing at age 11, and quickly got swept up in its peripheral YouTube content. “One thing fans have proved again and again is that Minecraft can function as an amazing platform to tell a story,” ElVitt0ri0 says. “Not just through animation either – you can look at whole series and movies that were made in-game.”Both YouTubers lament that this sense of history and appreciation seems to have been lost in the official movie. But perhaps that is to be expected, since Warner Bros has been trying to get a Minecraft movie off the ground for over a decade now. In 2014, when the studio first announced a film, it hired Shawn Levy to direct it. But that fell through, so Rob McElhenney stepped in to replace him. When he too stepped away shortly afterwards, Peter Sollett – best known for 2008’s Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist – briefly took his place. It was only in 2022 that the film found all of its pieces, with Napoleon Dynamite’s Jared Hess stepping in to direct a script from Masterminds writers Chris Bowman and Hubbel Palmer.In truth, Hess had his work cut out for him. Minecraft is a game without a traditional narrative. A sandbox game, where players are plunged into a procedurally generated landscape and are free to do whatever they like. If they want to extract raw materials from their surroundings to craft tools, they can. If they want to start fights with hostile creatures, they can. If they want to spend four days using the game to build a giant chicken (as my 10-year-old did this week), then that’s up to them.View image in fullscreenA ‘corpo-vomited product’? The Minecraft film.Photograph: Courtesy Warner Bros Pictures/APThe film nods to this with its title – it’sAMinecraft Movie, notTheMinecraft Movie, because it would be reductive to be so definitive – and, yet, Hess does appear to have taken the easy path, padding the bones of a Jumanji-style offering with blockier skin. Worse still, Hess has a distinctive visual style (he is essentially the Wes Anderson of ironic haircuts) that doesn’t intuitively mesh with the Minecraft look.And for a certain type of fan, that look is not only gospel, but in part fan led. For instance, Element Animation, a YouTube outfit that made its name with lushly animated, absurdMinecraft spoofswere so successful that they ended up being hired by game developer Mojang to make official Minecraft videos. Minecraft is now ultimately a feedback loop between the game and the people who play it, and the movie needed to reflect that.However, the story goes that Hess basically stumbled into making the film – when another project he was working on for Legendary fell through, they asked him to pitch for Minecraft – and perhaps this lack of familiarity shows. After all, Phil Lord and Chris Miller went out of their way to reassure people that they’dplayed with Lego all of their livesbefore making 2014’s rigorously faithful The Lego Movie. Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic went as far as saying that Super Mario Bros was their main source of entertainment as children when they were announced as directors for 2023’s Super Mario Bros Movie.This is the level of familiarity that fans have come to expect, and things have a habit of going wrong whenever directors try to impose themselves too forcefully on a beloved property. The first live-action Mario movie fell apart when it replaced Bowser (a gigantic muscular turtle) with Dennis Hopper in a shiny blazer. Paramount was forced to spend $5m redesigning Sonic the Hedgehog after his appearance in a movie trailer, all tiny eyes and human teeth, horrified viewers. But Minecraft is still a relatively new game. People like Fernandes and ElVitt0ri0, who have been playing the game for long enough to truly understand it, are still only in their early 20s. Maybe one day they’ll make a perfectly faithful Minecraft movie that satisfies the fans, but it won’t be for years.A Minecraft Movie review – building-block game franchise spin-off is rollicking if exhausting funRead moreBut, again, this isAMinecraft Movie, notTheMinecraft Movie. Warner Bros may have done enough to prevent this one from completely flopping – there is wall-to-wall promotion, both in-game and in the real world, plus a second trailer that seems slightly more faithful to the source material. But hardcore devotees may still feel that it’s time to put the fans in charge of any future big-screen offerings. An Element Animation Minecraft film is exactly what my children want to see, but perhaps the reins will be passed to someone else with an innate understanding of the game. As ElVitt0ri0 says, a film based on something as beloved as Minecraft should be “an actual piece of love towards the fans by fans, not just some corpo-vomited product by a big company”.A Minecraft Movie is out on 3 April in Australia and on 4 April in the UK and USExplore more on these topicsFilmMinecraftComedy filmsJack BlackComedyGamesJason MomoafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Despite being his mother, I hate him. I can’t stand to be around him and because of this I’m suffering from depression. Being his mother is the absolute worst experience.How can I cope with the disgusting feelings I’m having about being a mother?Eleanor says:Step one is not calling it disgusting. Nobody says loving your kids is any guarantee of always liking them, especially not during adolescence when their brains are hormone soup. Many parents have periods – even months at a time – of feeling angry, annoyed, disrespected, or like they just prefer it when the kid’s not home.I’m worried my appearance will jeopardise my career opportunities. Should I modify my look to fit in? | Leading questionsRead moreI don’t know the details of his behaviour, nor anything about your dynamic, so I want to be cautious. I can’t rule out that he’s acting in violent ways from what you’ve said. If that is the case your responses will need to be different, especially if you fear for your safety. But if his behaviour isbroadly standard adolescence, remember this period can be extraordinarily difficult. Big hormonal changes can mess you up; they make lots of us act in wildly uncharacteristic ways. He may not be strictly morally responsible for the ways he’s behaving right now.Still, you don’t need to feel wretched shame for having negative emotions in response to that behaviour. Shame might even make those feelings more intense. Sometimes negative feelings get stronger and more venomous if we can’t allow them in their milder form. It’s one thing to think “he’s driving me nuts right now”. But when that feels too shameful to articulate and we push it away, it can come back stronger. You can get caught in a loop that ultimately intensifies the feeling: I don’t like him right now / I can’t feel that / I hate him / I can’t feel that / I really hate him.Can you make room for a version of this feeling that’s neither total hatred nor total shame? Something like, “I don’t like the way he’s been treating me”, or “I feel worse when he acts like this in the house”, rather than “he’s bad”.That might be better for you, if it makes you feel less like a bad mother. You say you can’t stand to be around him. I wonder if it’s also feeling hard to be around the version of yourself that emerges in response to him? Letting go of some of this shame may also make it easier to seek professional help for the depression you say you are feeling.If you just try to push resentment away, you risk it leaping out in ways that confuse you both. That won’t help whatever’s going on for him. Although his adolescence is causing you a lot of suffering, he may well be suffering too.I know that’s hard to countenance. I know adolescents can be sophisticated in their cruelty. But it’s not necessarily representative of his character, or more importantly what his character will be, since it’s still under construction.Part of what will construct his future character is how people react to him now.Lots of people are able to learn from the patterns of pain they caused in adolescence – if there’s enough patience and support around them. Lots of parent-child relationships have a reunion of liking each other in adulthood – if the way you treat each other now leaves that possibility open.It is OK that motherhood does not feel at all pleasant right now. Being a good parent can coexist with anger, frustration, resentment, even the wish to have your kid out of your hair. It might be better for you both if you can allow yourself to feel some of those feelings as responses to temporary behaviour, so they don’t turn into full-blown hatred for him as a person.In Australia,Lifelineoffers 24/7 crisis support available on 13 11 14.

I’m left alone and in near total silence as I look along the train tracks that disappear in either direction. It feels as if I’m in the heart of the countryside, but actually, the Boulevard Périphérique, the traffic-choked ring road that encircles Paris, is just a stone’s throw away. This disused rail route, the Petite Ceinture, offers wildlife and quiet solitude just moments from the roaring motorway, thanks to a plan that is turning parts of the line into walkable green spaces – the French capital’s less manicured (and less central) alternative toManhattan’s High Lineor north London’s Parkland Walk, a rewilded railway line that’s part of the Capital Ring walk.Paris mapBuilt on the site of the Thiers wall, the last defensive wall of Paris, and its surrounding shantytown, the eight-lane Boulevard Périphérique (known as the Périph) is used by more than a million cars a day. The 20-mile (32km) railway line just inside the ring road was created to supply the Thiers wall, carrying goods and then passengers as the city’s first metropolitan railway service.But, as the Métro we know today developed, la Petite Ceinture’s popularity declined, with much of it becoming derelict. Together with the city of Paris, the line’s owner, SNCF Réseau (part of the state-owned railway company), have worked to regreen 4.5 miles of the track in small sections around the city since 2006 – and by 2026 a further 2.5 miles will be opened (the rest is inaccessible to the public).View image in fullscreenMuch of the Petite Ceinture stopped being used in the 1930s, and it was finally closed as a working railway in the late 1980s.Photograph: Michel Rubinel/AFP/Getty ImagesLike the city’s different arrondissements, each section of walkable track has its own personality and has been approached differently. In some places, paths, nature trails and shared gardens have been created, while others have been left to rewild. In residential Bel-Air in the 12th, the Ceinture is calm and well maintained, with trees and greenery on either side. I walk along the railway tracks behind an elderly couple strolling arm in arm, while a man rakes the soil in an allotment at the edge of the line. Mid-morning in the northern reaches of the 19th, I pass a man sweeping glass from around the entrance of La Gare-Le Gore, a club in an old Ceinture station that hosts experimental jazz until midnight and techno until 6am.In summer, tree canopies obscure the peripheries to give the impression that you’re enveloped in natureThe Ceinture is generally far less polished than New York’s High Line, but the most similar section – and the busiest and neatest – is in the 15th arrondissement, between the Pont du Garigliano and Parc Georges Brassens. Here, I take a lift down to the line from street level and walk past elaborate graffiti next to the fenced-off tunnel, and alongside the courts and clubhouses of the Vaugirard Tennis Club. I stop atVoie 15, a trendy restaurant, coffee shop and coworking space in a converted station building, full of young professionals on their laptops, while joggers run past along the tracks. Further on, I even snatch a view of the (top of the) Eiffel Tower framed by apartment buildings. One of the main aims of the repurposed Ceinture is to encourage wildlife to the city, with different areas feeling more or less “wild”. The sunken section between Avenue du Général Leclerc and Rue Didot in the 14th arrondissement, with its high, tree-studded banks, supports almost 250 different species of plants and animals. In winter, a colony of pipistrelle bats hibernate inside the tunnel at the western end, and along with the rest of the Ceinture, it’s an important habitat for hedgehogs and foxes. In spring and summer, vegetation crowds the tracks and tree canopies obscure the peripheries here to give the impression that you’re enveloped in nature. In the well-heeled 16th, the line has been taken over by a strip of woodland and 200 plant species have been recorded here, including hazel and blackthorn, gooseberries, viburnum and buddleia. Amid Paris’s neatly manicured parkland, it’s a rare opportunity to get my boots caked in mud.View image in fullscreenPeople stroll along the disused lines from the Villa du Bel-Air to Avenue du Général-Michel-Bizot in the 12th arrondissement.Photograph: Michel Rubinel/AFP/Getty ImagesSeveral grassroots, community-focused projects and venues thrive on the Ceinture’s undeveloped land and abandoned infrastructure. I head toLa REcyclerie, an urban farm and eco-centre focusing on repairs and recycling, which crams a lot into its stretch by the Porte de Clignancourt. The canteen in the old station building is buzzing with people finishing a late lunch or enjoying an early aperitif. A pop-up market focuses on vintage clothes, and on the 1,000sq-metre (10,700sq ft) urban farm, volunteers tend to the chickens. The events programme features everything from French language sessions for refugees to DIY courses. “In a very dense neighbourhood with few green spaces, it seems important to let nature reclaim its rights and help agriculture in the city,” says Marie-Eugénie Chanvillard, La REcyclerie’s eco-cultural project manager.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is an artefact of its time, before newfangled technology like laptops and having the internet in other places besides one room of your school. It’s also an artefact of its time in another important way: it is completely covered in images of hot guys of the time.Looking at it, you would assume that I was a regular horny straight teen girl, cutting out photos of Leonardo DiCaprio and Will Smith and Hanson to plaster all over my diary so the world could see my very-normal-don’t-look-too-closely-ha-ha desire for men. Well, it may shock you to learn that I wasn’t a normal straight teenage girl. I was a deeply closeted and sad teenage lesbian. I knew that something was different about me from about 11, even though at the time I hadn’t met any gay people, there were no gay people in pop culture, and there was no Google to ask “why am I weird”.How tired we all are, having worked this hard to get this far, only to see our progress backsliding againIt took me a long, long time to figure it all out, and even longer to feel safe telling anyone. Six or seven years after realising I was queer, I was still carefully choosing photos of men to pretend to be into, spending hours figuring out ways to remain undiscovered. I would continue this charade until I was about 22, when I finally came out. This is an effect of marginalisation, of discrimination and hate that doesn’t get spoken about enough. The amount of time, the amount of brain space, the amount of ENERGY it takes to livenot as yourselfis remarkable, and draining.View image in fullscreenRebecca Shaw’s teenage diary.Photograph: Rebecca ShawI also visited my home town last week for the first time in over a decade. Even though I am now 42 years old, have lived an extremely loud gay Sydney life for years, and was there holding hands with my girlfriend, I felt a heaviness in my chest. Remembering that time means acknowledging the years that I lost because society didn’t or wouldn’t understand me. It means thinking about what I could have done or been if I hadn’t used so much of my brain space on trying to hide myself, change myself, be anything but the real me. Instead of thinking about school and my real crushes and my future, I had to shut myself down, focusing on my differences and how to minimise them.Trump singled me out for ruining women’s sport. This is my response to him |  Austin KillipsRead moreI thought about all of the energy that the LGBTQI community has had to expend over decades; so much fighting to move forward inch by grudging inch. How tired we all are, having worked this hard to get this far, only to see our progress backsliding again in the face of rising anti-LGBTQI hate, pushed by politicians all over the world. I thought about the energy levels of the people in my community who have to fight even harder, like those who aren’t white and those who aren’t cisgender.While on a break from writing this (scrolling on another screen), I saw anInstagram postfrom comedian Mae Martin about their journey, and this bit struck me: “Transitioning unlocked a whole new part of my brain, and freed up a lot of mental space that had previously been occupied by anguish.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.

When I think about how much of my brain space has been taken up by the stress of being gay in a homophobic world, and I compare that to what my trans friends have to go through, to deal with and stay safe in the rampant transphobia of society in whatever ways they can – I can’t even imagine.Thinking about how much energy we all use up just trying to exist, I couldn’t help but consider the flipside.

The energy politicians are expendingboth overseasandat homeon fighting queer and trans people is a disgraceful waste and a distraction. In Australia, where people are struggling to pay bills and buy groceries and insure their homes against climate change events, the Coalition is using its energy to talk about the “woke” agenda in schools ahead of the election. In the US, the Trump administration is spending its energy on a similarly misguided scourge of “wokeness”. But where young queer people often have no choice but to spend most of their energy on keeping themselves safe – these governments and people in powerdohave a choice.I have unlimited energy to keep fighting for our community, we are not going anywhere – I would just rather we all got to use our energy for living true and good lives instead.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyIn Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

Here’s how to choose the most hardy specimens. Plus, readers celebrate the greenery that survived against all the oddsJane PerroneandGuardian readersThu 3 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 11.55 EDTShareThere is a good reason that we treat certain houseplants as the green wallpaper of our homes: the odd splash of water and they seem to rub along fine. These are the species that have proved, over many decades, that they are best adapted to surviving in a vast range of situations. Unfortunately, familiarity breeds contempt, so many of us dismiss snake plants, spider plants, Swiss cheese plants and dragon trees as uninspiring and basic, even though they are the species that are likely to thrive, whatever the conditions.The key to making “bog standard” houseplants look good is to display them in an atypical way: an oversized trough of snake plants rather than a few leaves in a lonely pot; the silhouette of a mass of plain green spider plants in a huge hanging basket instead of a spindly cream-striped specimen on a shelf; or a forest of dragon trees in a huge barrel planter. If you love flowers, moth orchids (Phalaenopsis) are a great choice as they are incredibly tough, and unfazed by the centrally heated air of our homes. Again, think about innovative ways of presenting them: they can look amazing massed in a single container.When it comes to shopping for houseplants, bear in mind that many plants sold in DIY stores, houseplant shops and supermarkets are not marketed with longevity in mind. Have you ever met anyone with a calathea older than a few months, for instance? So choose your purchase carefully. If your home lacks natural light (small windows and a north-facing aspect are the usual predictors of this), your options are far more limited: plain green-leaved houseplants such as the cast-iron plant (Aspidistra elatior), grape ivy (Cissus rhombifolia) and kangaroo ivy (Cissus antarctica) will do well in darker corners. But remember that if it is too dark to read a book without a light on, it’s too dark for a houseplant to grow.View image in fullscreenDraceanas on display.Photograph: janzwolinski/Getty Images/iStockphotoIf you have a sunnier home, cacti and succulents are a great choice: the forest cacti in particular are well suited to indoor growing and can live for decades. They are found in the tree canopies of South America, so do not need as much sunlight as the desert cacti. The Christmas, Easter and Thanksgiving cacti (Schlumbergerspecies) are probably best known but also look out for the mistletoe cacti (Rhipsalisspecies) and orchid cacti (Epiphyllumspecies). If you’re on a limited budget, these are easy to grow from cuttings, so beg your friends for cuttings to kickstart your collection.Jane PerroneIf only they could talk …Falls, house moves, young children, long journeys in biscuit tins: these readers’ plants have endured it all, and they’re still going strongMy elderly Swedish orchidsView image in fullscreenWhen I left Sweden in 2011, I couldn’t take my plants with me, especially my rock orchid, which would have died in the moving truck. It was a Valentine’s present from my husband, so I was sad to part with it, but I gave it to a friend. I kept two small offshoots, wrapped them in damp kitchen towel and newspaper, put them in a biscuit tin, and carried them in my hand luggage on the plane to London.Fourteen years later, I still have the orchids. They are happy to be watered whenever I remember, with water left out overnight. (It’s important never to use water straight from the tap.) People say orchids are very difficult, but my orchids are the only plants I can keep alive.Vanessa, library assistant, DorsetRalph, father of 20View image in fullscreenI purchased “Ralph”, my aspidistra, from a house clearance shop in Battersea in 1971. He has moved house with me many times during my long career. Over the years at least 20 root cuttings have been given to family, colleagues and friends, and they have thrived equally well. Ralph is best housed away from direct sunlight with space for new leaves to grow. He likes a drink once a week but does not start to turn yellow with anger until neglected for about three weeks.Keith Spanswick, 76, designer of medical equipment, NottinghamGreen-eyed monsteraWe bought a fairly small monstera (Swiss cheese plant) about eight years ago and put it in the corner of our conservatory. It thrived, sending its tendrils across the granite walls, and was repotted after a couple of years. It is now completely enormous – around 8ft (2.4m) tall. It is totally living its best life.Robert Dunn, 62, self-catering manager, Strontian,ScotlandThe peace lily that missed meView image in fullscreenMy peace lily started life as a very small office plant bought one lunchtime in Leeds market about eight years ago. It seemed happy enough while I was at work but every time I was away for a week or so it appeared to have died. I got many surprised comments from colleagues as I did some emergency intensive watering in the kitchen. It kept bouncing back and hung in there despite the bouts of neglect.When I retired four years ago, I brought it home and started to give it a bit more attention. Even so, I just water it when it looks droopy and feed maybe once or twice a year. It rewards me with beautiful glossy leaves and regular flowers.Gillian Richardson, West Yorkshireskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was given it as a leaving present from my last employment. It’s about 8ft tall and requires almost no upkeep – it tolerates being forgotten for weeks at a time and always looks really healthy. Lower leaves dry and fall off, but I think that’s normal. I love it.Kate Edmonds, former career and executive coach, Alfriston, East SussexThe rubber plant that bounced backView image in fullscreenI picked up my rubber plant from Columbia Road flower market in London in 2018, as a tiny sapling. It has been through seven house moves, a pandemic and the arrival of three children under three who terrorise everything in reaching distance. It is still going strong, sprouting new leaves, and is now enjoying its twilight years. The secret? No idea. None of my other plants has fared as well.Kevin, 41, charity sector recruiter,LondonMy 8ft umbrellaView image in fullscreenI have owned my umbrella plant since 2011, when I bought it from a DIY store in a 15cm pot. It is now about 8ft tall, and has been cut back several times.Like many houseplants, it thrives on neglect, but this one is remarkable. It has helped that it has been set up like an office plant rather than a typical houseplant: large planter, large volume of compost, watering only once every few weeks. It responds well to pruning and several cuttings have been taken and grown on.Kenneth Freeman, interior landscaping consultant,Swanley, KentThe begonias that won’t begoneView image in fullscreenI currently have three beefsteak begonias. The mother plant is about 30 years old and came from a single rooted leaf given out in a paper cup at a fundraiser for a political candidate. Over time I have rooted cuttings or broken off bits to give to family and neighbours. The mother plant was once knocked off the porch rail and fell 7ft to the ground; I gathered up the broken-off bits and rooted them.I keep it in a sunny southern window in the winter and outside on the northern-exposure front porch the rest of the year. It is an extremely forgiving houseplant and propagates easily from cuttings, blooming from February till the end of April, with light pink flowers.Juliana Inman, 73, architect,Salem, Oregon, US‘Watered’ by the catView image in fullscreenMy dwarf umbrella plant was a present on my 25th birthday. It quickly grew into a large plant that spent its early life in a pot on the floor next to my parents’ back door. Mum would occasionally throw some water on it, but it thrived on benign neglect – covered in dust, leaned on, leaves crushed, occasionally “watered” by the cat and then cut back to within an inch of its life as it dared to push new branches or leaves beyond its allotted corner. It eventually moved with me to my own home, where it has since lived a largely event-free life. Forty years later, it is still thriving on benign neglect.Sally Nunn, 64, retired, GrimsbyA lily that toils notView image in fullscreenI was given my clivia (bush lily) by my late husband’s grandmother when we married in 1987. It has luscious green leaves and should have a large orange flower. The plant has thrived but is very temperamental when it comes to flowering. I have divided or repotted it every few years and fed it in spring and summer, but I have had only a handful of flowers in more than 30 years.Liz,Bury St Edmunds, SuffolkEasy moneyView image in fullscreenI inherited my money plant from my parents. I believe it was a present from when they married in the 80s. It lived in their conservatory and survived for 18 months, completely solo, after they passed away. When their property was sold I took some of the furniture and the plant. I was warned it would probably die, as it would be in storage for a month with no light. It looked extremely sad when we got it down to where I live in Cornwall. However, a warm spot in our children’s play space and some watering bulbs slowly revived it. I added fertiliser when I saw new growth and it is looking much happier and healthier now. Clearly, it is a survivor.Mark Ferguson, 33, researcher, CornwallPeople featured in the article responded to a Community callout.

One expert said Trump was likely to be targeting countries that received investment from China, regardless of the situation in that country. Chinese manufacturers have previously relocated to countries such as Vietnam andCambodianot only due to lower operating costs, but also to avoid tariffs.The tariffs come as many countries in south-east Asia are alreadygrappling with the fallout from the cuts to USAID, which provides humanitarian assistance to a region vulnerable to natural disasters and support for pro-democracy activists battling repressive regimes.Cambodia, a developing economy where 17.8% of the population live below the poverty line, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is the worst-hit country in the region with a tariff rate of 49%. More than half of the country’s factories arereportedly Chinese-owned, with the countries exports dominated by garments and footwear.Next worse-hit is the landlocked south-east Asian nation of Laos, a country heavily bombed by the US during the cold war, with 48%. According to the ADB, Laos has a poverty rate of 18.3%.tariffs mapNot far behind is Vietnam with 46% and Myanmar, a nationreeling from a devastating earthquakeon Friday, and years of civil war following a 2021 military coup, with 44%.Indonesia, the biggest economy in south-east Asia, faces a 32% tariff rate, while Thailand, the second-largest, has been hit with a rate of 36%.Major US rival and trading partnerChinahas been hit with a 34% reciprocal tariff, on top of the 20% levy already imposed.Dr Siwage Dharma Negara, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the tariffs on south-east Asian nations were intended to hurt China.“The administration thinks that by targeting these countries they can target Chinese investment in countries like Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Indonesia. By targeting their products maybe it will affect Chinese exports and the economy,” he said.“The real target is China but the real impact on those countries will be quite significant because this investment creates jobs and export revenue.”Tariffs on countries such as Indonesia, he said, would be counterproductive for the US, and the detail of how they would be applied remained unclear.Where the tariffs will hurt most – chart“Some garments and footwear [companies] are American brands like Nike, or Adidas, US companies that have factories in Indonesia. Will they face the same tariffs as well?” he said.Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, said countries in south-east Asia would be forced to reconsider their relationships with Washington. “A closer tilt towards China could be the result. It’s hard to have constructive, productive relations with a country that has just dropped a ton of bricks on your head,” said Olson, a visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.“The world’s largest importer has now essentially hung a sign on its border saying ‘closed for business’,” he added. “We are now faced with two plausible scenarios: Either the impacted trade partners hold firm and retaliate in the hope that Trump will be forced to back down, or they look to cut deals with Trump in order to avoid the tariffs. It is unlikely that either scenario will end well.”Other nations among the hardest hit are several nations in Africa, including Lesotho – a country thatTrump claimed “nobody has ever heard of”– with 50%, Madagascar with 47% and Botswana with 37%. Lesotho, a small mountainous kingdom surrounded by South Africa, has the second-highest level of HIV infection of the world, with almost one in four adults HIV-positive.In south Asia, Sri Lanka is facing a 44% tariff. In Europe, Serbia faces a 37% rate.In addition to the reciprocal tariffs on a few dozen countries, Trump will impose a 10% universal tariff on all imported goods. That tariff will go into effect on 5 April, while the reciprocal tariffs will begin on 9 April.The US president has justified the changes by saying they are retribution for countries that have long “cheated” America, and the levies will bring jobs back to the US.But economists have warned the sweeping changes will raise costs, threaten jobs, slow growth and isolate the US from a system of global trade it pioneered, and furthered over several decades.“This is how you sabotage the world’s economic engine while claiming to supercharge it,” said Nigel Green, the CEO of global financial advisory deVere Group.“The reality is stark: these tariffs will push prices higher on thousands of everyday goods – from phones to food – and that will fuel inflation at a time when it is already uncomfortably persistent.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS foreign policyAsia PacificInternational tradeTrump administrationMyanmarCambodianewsShareReuse this content"

For him, the development was proof that Spanish teenagers and young men – many of whom had already absorbed the macho, misogynistic tropes of the “manosphere” – were also beginning to embrace the far-right political views that have gained so much ground globally over the past decade.“It showed that this had moved beyond the social networks where kids chat and had become something identitarian,” he says.View image in fullscreenJesús Moreno holding a workshop on masculinity in the town of San José de la Rinconada near Seville.Photograph: Jesus MorenoIn Spain,as elsewhere, the Netflix teen murder dramaAdolescencehas sharpened concerns over technology, toxic masculinity and intergenerational chasms, and dragged those issues to the fore. But, as the drawings in Moreno’s workshops attest, the country has the added ingredient ofthe still bitter legacy of the Franco dictatorship– and a powerful far-right political party.View image in fullscreenTeacher Alicia López.Photograph: Alicia LopezAlicia López, an ethics and philosophy teacher in centralSpain, has also noticed a change in the language used by some of her male students. Nostalgic, ignorant talk of Franco has begun to surface – even though the dictator died 50 years ago this November and young Spaniards know very little about the era – mingling with familiar attacks on the perceived anti-male biases of modern society.“The stuff that’s said is really crude,” she says. “They talk about Franco and Francoism without knowing about it … [And] feminism … is under constant attack. If you tell off a male student for something, they will immediately say, ‘Why aren’t you telling the girls off?’”And, despite living in an area with very low levels of immigration, López has detected a rise in xenophobic talk.“There are very few immigrant children in class, but you hear insults, like asking people if they eat ham, and kids calling their peers terrorists,” she says.View image in fullscreenGeneral Franco.Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG/Getty ImagesMoreno and López note that the increase in reactionary, anti-feminist, anti-immigrant language has, unsurprisingly, coincided with the growing political influence of the far right. Spain’s far-right, pro-Trump Vox party, once dismissed as an inconsequential band of provocateurs,broke through into the mainstreamalmost seven years ago and is now the third largest force in the Spanish congress. For many young men, much of Vox’s appeal lies in its rigid certainties and its fierce opposition to all things woke.A poll two years ago suggestedthat more than half of young men aged between 16 and 24 feel that the drive for women’s equality has gone so far that men are now discriminated against. Another, more recentsurvey foundthat 36.1% of men aged 18-28 would vote for Vox, compared with 14.6% of the population as a whole.While much of the support for Vox and apparent nostalgia for an unknown and repressive era may be rebellious adolescent posturing, it is nonetheless gaining ground.“The far right has sold them this idea that voting for them is a revolutionary act now, which feeds into that whole teenage process of thinking you’re unique,” says Moreno.López, who is the president ofColectivo DIME+, a nationwide group of teachers, counsellors and parents formed to fight the reactionary discourse around education, feels that boys’ embrace of extremes may also be an effort to be heard in a busy and time-poor world.“Because children’s voices and general wellbeing aren’t heeded enough, they end up in the arms of those they shouldn’t,” she says.View image in fullscreenVox’s leader, Santiago Abascal, speaking at a rally in the working-class neighbourhood of Nou Barris in May 2024.Photograph: Eric Renom/LaPresse/Rex/ShutterstockMaria Freixanet, gender investigation coordinator at Barcelona’s Institute of Political and Social Sciences, has been investigating the effects of influencers on young men in Catalonia.

She said the government was analysing where young people got their news and views from, involving them in conversations about “democracy, freedom, justice and the climate crisis”, and working to give them the tools, education and historical memory lessons needed to help them build a future.Spain’s youth ministry is also working to address the same issues as it prepares the country’s first youth law, which will include measures to protect the economic, social and democratic rights of young people, as well as their mental health and wellbeing. On Tuesday, the cabinet approved a draft law aimed at keeping children safe in the digital sphere.Despite the ugly and provocative language and stances adopted by many boys, López believes difficult conversations are essential.“If a boy can’t express himself in class – if he feels that his voice and opinion aren’t being listened to – then you’re not going to know where the problem is,” she says. It is better, she adds, to listen and then to introduce context and information about the realities of Franco’s four-decade dictatorship to counter the misconceptions.Moreno agrees that demonisation and performative moral panics are not helping. “We shouldn’t trivialise the fact that young men are now more likely to vote for the far right – the statistics are there,” he says. “But by creating a continuous self-confirming bias and calling them fascists, we turn into the paternalistic state that’s telling them what they’re like and how they have to be.”The psychologist also says that today’s young people are a diverse bunch – and that there are grounds for optimism. “A lot of young people know much more about feminism than I did when I was their age,” he says. “There are a lot of boys – the majority – who don’t take a position.”Today’s young people have amazing potential despite the grim state of the planet and its politicians, he adds.“They’re wide awake even though we’re giving them an uncertain future in which we don’t know whether we’ll screw up the planet in the next 50 years. And yet they’re always looking to make sense of their lives. What if we could give them a sense of belonging that had nothing to do with neo-Nazi or far-right discourse? What if there was a pro-rights discourse? That’s the challenge.”Explore more on these topicsSpainFrancisco FrancoYoung peopleMenThe far rightFeminismEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 3-metre-high (10ft) stacks are the culmination of days of hard work by families, from children up to grandparents, in the height of summer.Together they cut waist-high grass, leave it to dry in the hot sun and stack it up to be stored over the winter, combing the hay downwards to protect it from harsh winds, heavy rain and snow. Throughout winter, clumps of it are removed from the haystacks and fed to livestock.The work is labour-intensive and communal, and it benefits far more species than just humans and their livestock. Research shows thesemeadows are among the most biodiverse terrestrial ecosystemsanywhere, full of grasshoppers, butterflies and spiders, as well as more than 100 species of grasses and flowers, including grass vetchling, hedge bedstraw and field scabious.I see the huge value in what our ancestors created – their gentle touch on nature, their respect for itSarig AttilaIt is human activity that makes these habitats so rich for wildlife: hundreds of species of plant, bird and insect have adapted alongside centuries of cultivating and harvesting meadows, their life cycles becoming intertwined with farming.Studies have found that Romania’s traditional hay meadows can be richer in wildlife than meadows managed as nature reserves. From May to July, before the hay is cut, they are awash with wildflowers and insects.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenThe meadows can have more than 100 species of grasses and flowers, including hedge bedstraw and field scabiousRomania is home to some of the largest grasslands inEuropestill managed by traditional methods. But as modern agriculture creeps in, the haystacks are becoming a symbol of a vanishing way of life.Sarig Attila, a farmer from Ghimeş-Făget, a small mountain village in the eastern Carpathians, says: “I love the place where I grew up. I see the huge value in what our ancestors created – their gentle touch on nature, their respect for it, and how they work the fields, creating such rich biodiversity.” His family has lived in the village for at least four generations.View image in fullscreenFor centuries families have built the traditional haystacks but rural areas are changing and machines are becoming more commonGhimeş-Făget is home to 5,000 people, whose farms were largely self-sustaining for 400 years, with a mixture of sheep, cows, wheat and other grains. Many villagers canname more than 120 plant species, ethnoecologists have found.In most of western Europe, the advent of artificial fertilisers has put anend to the wildlife-rich hay meadowsthat would once have carpeted the countryside. The UKhas lost 97%of its wildflower meadows since the 1930s. Things are rapidly changing in Romania too: as young people leave the villages looking for work elsewhere in Europe, humans and horses are being replaced by machines and fertiliser.View image in fullscreenSarig Attila, a farmer, says small machines, then tractors were bought to modernise the workOver the past 15 years, small machines to cut grass and put it into lines have arrived in Ghimeş-Făget, and bigger tractors are also being used. Attila says: “There was almost no change in 300 or 400 years, and now, in the past 30 years, everything is changing extremely fast. In the last few years it’s been changing like lightning.”There are now only a few families making hay completely in the traditional way. As many young people have left, Attila cannot pay someone to help him, so it is cheaper for him to use a machine.“People are getting tractors because they are stronger than horses and can do many jobs,” says Attila, who is worried that a centuries-long connection to the land is being lost.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenOnly a handful of families continue to make the haystacks in the traditional wayMany people are working to ensure the golden haystacks do not become relics of the past.You can walk for days through hay meadows … We’re keen to give small-scale farmers an incentive to stayNat Page, Fundația AdeptNat Page is director ofFundația Adept, a biodiversity conservation and rural development organisation based in Romania that works with farmers on how best to manage grasslands profitably.

A 100-metre radius “vacuum state” has been imposed outside the court building to prevent demonstrations. More police buses arrived ahead of the verdict, bringing traffic to a near-standstill. Ancient palaces in the neighbourhood will close on Friday, depriving people of the chance to get a close-up view of their popular spring blossoms.View image in fullscreenA masked protester performs during a demonstration against impeached South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol in Seoul on Wednesday.Photograph: Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty ImagesHas South Korea just witnessed its own January 6 moment?Read moreThe security clampdown will extend well beyond barricades. Petrol stations near the court will close to prevent arson attacks, and rooftop access to high-rise buildings will be restricted to prevent people from jumping or throwing objects. Authorities are also planning to ban the release of firearms usually used to kill wild animals, with proposals to track licensed gun owners via GPS on the day of the ruling. Anguk station will close, and subway station lockers sealed to prevent bomb threats.A no-fly zone has been imposed over the court, with police deploying signal jammers against unauthorised drones. Eleven schools will close, and vendors have been told to close and remove items, such as flower pots, that could be used as weapons.View image in fullscreenTents of Busan University students who oppose Yoon Suk Yeol are seen on the fourth day of a student hunger strike in front of Gwanghwamun in Seoul on 18 March.Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty ImagesIf Yoon survives the ruling, he will have pulled off an extraordinary political comeback. If the decision goes against him, he will join a growing list of disgraced South Korean leaders who challenged the country’s democratic institutions.In December last year, Yoon deployed troops to the national assembly, claiming he needed to counter “anti-state forces” and investigate alleged election fraud. The military deployment lasted only hours before parliament voted to overturn the declaration, seeing his actions as a power grab.Yoon is also fighting for survival in aseparate criminal trialin which he is accused of instigating an insurrection – a crime that carries a life sentence or even the death penalty, though South Korea has not conducted an execution since 1997.Weeks of uncertainty have been marked byhuge and occasionally violent protestsby Yoon’s supporters and opponents, and standoffs between his security detail and government authorities.Last weekend hundreds of thousands of people rallied for and against Yoon in central Seoul, despite the cold weather.“The people are overwhelmed with fatigue and frustration as … the ongoing crises remain unresolved,” Lee Han-sol, an anti-Yoon demonstrator, said. “The delays have led to a growing sense of scepticism.”His supporters, some of whom held up Trump-inspired banners reading “Make Korea Great Again,” insisted the impeachment trial was unlawful. “The constitutional court won’t be able to ignore us,” said Lee Hye-sook, 58. “Look at us, there are so many of us here.”With the constitutional court’s verdict on the impeachment looming, authorities are making every effort to prevent further unrest.An unprecedented security operation is being put in place to prevent a repeat of January’sviolent storming of a Seoul courthouseby Yoon supporters that left dozens of police officers injured. And officials have not forgotten the tumult of March 2017, when four protesters died on the day the same court finalised former president Park Geun-hye’s impeachment.View image in fullscreenSouth Korea’s impeached president, Yoon Suk Yeol, attends a hearing in February.Photograph: Lee Jin-man/APThe court is already partially barricaded, while those declaring loyalty to Yoon, a former prosecutor who has flirted with rightwing populism and conspiracy theories since taking office in 2022, are observing a round-the-clock vigil outside.“We are setting up plans considering the worst-case scenarios,” said Lee Ho-young, acting police chief, as authorities declared the highest-level emergency status for the day of the ruling.View image in fullscreenYoon supporters at a rally to oppose his impeachment in Seoul on 15 March 2025.

The same court’s decision to remove Park came 11 days after the final hearings in her impeachment trial.“The country and the people are at breaking point,” said Kim Min-seok, an opposition Democratic party MP, said last month. “We wait for the court’s responsible decision. Further delay is abnormal and irresponsible.”Chung Sung-il, a 72-year-old anti-Yoon protester, said he expected the court to dismiss Yoon “100%”, adding: “If he is reinstated, so many dangerous things can happen.”View image in fullscreenYoon supporters gather to oppose his impeachment near the constitutional court in Seoul on 18 March.Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/APThe acting president, Han Duck-soo, whoseimpeachment was overturnedby the constitutional court late last month, called on South Koreans to respect the court’s ruling on Yoon.“Whatever decision is made, we must calmly and coolly accept the result in accordance with the principles of the rule of law,” Han said on Wednesday.The tense atmosphere has been stoked by inflammatory rhetoric from Yoon’s allies.

But what started as a revolution ended in acrimonyByFrancisco GarciaThu 3 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 07.23 EDTShareThe press conference began at 2.30pm on 2 September 2004 at the Wills Memorial Building, the grand neo-gothic home to the University of Bristol’s School of Law. Michael Naughton, a charismatic, fast-talking lecturer in sociology and criminal law, addressed the assembled media. If what he was attempting sounded radical, it was only a reflection of an increasingly dire situation, Naughton told a BBC reporter. There was no way of sugarcoating it, he said. The criminal justice system was failing the rising number of people who were claiming they had been wrongfully convicted, and who remained stuck in prison without any hope of exoneration.Naughton was launching the Bristol University Innocence Project to address this crisis. The premise was clear enough. Idealistic law students, under academic supervision and with pro bono legal support, would investigate potential miscarriages of justice, with the goal of preparing cases for appeal. Though the concept was well established in the US and Australia, nothing so bold had ever been attempted in the UK. But Michael Naughton was no ordinary academic. Born in early 1960s Lancashire to working-class Irish parents, conflict was an essential part of his upbringing. Being a Naughton man came with certain non-negotiables, including: always buy your round, and never back down from a fight.Having left school at 16, Naughton had embarked on a mechanical engineering apprenticeship. In his mid-20s, he enrolled at night school, taking A-levels in maths and sociology. An accident at work in his early 30s ended his engineering career, and forced him back to his books. He enrolled to study sociology as a mature student at the University of Bristol, and he became interested in miscarriages of justice. The deeper he delved, the more chilling his findings. He went on to do a PhD, in which he argued that wrongful convictions were not rare aberrations but the all-too-common products of a dysfunctional system. In Naughton’s view, the much-vaunted Criminal Cases Review Commission – an independent public body set up in the late 1990s to review miscarriages of justice in England, Wales and Northern Ireland – was already proving a dismal failure.From the vantage point of 2025, Naughton’s project looks prescient. In recent years, after thePost Office Horizon scandaland thewrongful conviction of Andrew Malkinson, there has been a resurgence of public interest in miscarriages of justice across the UK, and the CCRC has come under intense scrutiny for its errors in both cases. Last summer, an independent review blasted the CCRC for a “catalogue of failures”.For Michael Naughton, the workings of the criminal justice system were personal: growing up, he had friends and family members who had spent time in and out of trouble with the law. At the Innocence Project launch in 2004, moving testimony came from victims of miscarriages of justice, including Michael O’Brien, one of the three men wrongly imprisoned for the 1987 killing of Cardiff shop owner Phillip Saunders. They spoke of long wasted years in prison, followed by the immense task of rebuilding shattered lives. “You’re left to fend for yourself,” said O’Brien. “I am one of the lucky few who managed to get a journalist to investigate my case.”Naughton spoke about the need to build bridges between campaigners and victims, politicians and legal professionals. He assured the room he was no naive middle-class do-gooder. “I do not think that all those prisoners who say they are innocent are necessarily innocent,” he said. “But there is nothing in the system to address this massive problem.” He told the BBC that £65m a year was being spent imprisoning people who had been wrongfully convicted. To bring about change would require sincerity and commitment. It would need leaders who combined these qualities with a flair for publicity, as well as the requisite combativeness. It seemed it would require, in short, figures very much like Dr Michael Naughton.The Bristol Innocence Project’s first recruit was Gabe Harley, then Tan, who had arrived to study law in the UK from Singapore in 2004, aged 19. For a conscientious student with a keen interest in social justice, coming across Michael Naughton was transformational. During her relatively sheltered, middle-class upbringing, Harley had never thought to question Britain’s reputation as a world leader when it came to criminal justice. It was shocking – and invigorating – to hear her new lecturer rail against the iniquities of the British legal system. Joining the Innocence Project seemed like a way to help right these wrongs. “They didn’t judge me as a 19-year-old student,” Harley had thought at the time. “They wanted to inspire people. It sparked something [in] me.”Naughton explained that an innocence project could be a useful way of examining the law and holding it to account. Alongside education and research, the project’s main function would be to investigate active cases. To qualify for inclusion, prisoners needed to show there were doubts about the facts of their case, and would need at least three years remaining on their sentences, to allow students enough time to examine the evidence. Applications would only be accepted by those who did not have legal representation. The innocence project would be a last resort.Naughton had looked to the US for inspiration. The first innocence project was established at Benjamin Cardozo Law School at Yeshiva University, New York, in 1992, and had quickly chalked up a number of successful appeals, many based on DNA tests. The idea spread, and by the turn of the millennium, there were 10 projects that began to meet annually in Chicago. In early 2004, the Innocence Network was founded, with an initial 21 university projects across the US signing up by the end of the year.View image in fullscreenDr Michael Naughton in the library of the University of Bristol Law School, March 2025.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianIf such a model could work there, then why not in the UK, Naughton wondered. The idea of students working on active casework was not entirely unprecedented in the UK. In 1997, students from Northumbria University had taken on the case of a man called Alex Allan who had been found guilty of robbery, which he denied. After seven years of painstaking work, his conviction was quashed in 2001. But what Naughton was planning was bigger, and more ambitious.Perhaps the greatest challenge faced by the Bristol Innocence Project was how to navigate the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the world’s first statutory, state-funded body investigating potential wrongful convictions. It had been conceived as a radical solution to a crisis of public confidence in the criminal justice system, after a number of convictions connected to IRA bombings were found to be unsafe. The CCRC would refer a case back to the court of appeal only if it had identified new evidence which could lead to the real possibility of the conviction being overturned or the sentence reduced.No one was as outspoken on the problems with the CCRC as Michael Naughton. It was not the panacea that had been promised, he said. In fact, its creation had done harm by rendering wrongful convictions invisible in the eyes of the public. In the mid-2000s, the number of cases the CCRC referred back to the appeal courts was less than 40 in every thousand applications. (The imperative to bring fresh evidence presented applicants with a fiendishly high bar to clear.) In Naughton’s view, the new body had no power of its own, and was little more than the “lapdog” of the court of appeal. The CCRC’s remit was “too narrow”, Naughtontold the Guardianin June 2005. “[It] should be simply about getting innocent people out of jail.”Shortly after opening its doors, the Bristol Innocence Project was inundated with more than 150 applications, and Naughton’s office – the project’s HQ and nerve centre – was swiftly buried in stacks of casework and correspondence. Many involved prisoners serving lengthy sentences for murder and other serious acts of violence. “We were receiving tons of these letters,” Gabe Harley recalled. “We had to design a filtering system to narrow cases down.” Some of the applications seemed ludicrous. One correspondent admitted to stabbing a man in the groin, but argued that the fact he was drunk at the time meant he had been wrongfully convicted. Others were worth taking seriously. About 40 of these cases were assessed by an experienced local criminal defence lawyer, who advised that several merited further investigation.“We really hoped that we would highlight these injustices that the CCRC and court of appeal were not prepared to [investigate] or overturn,” said Naughton when we spoke recently. “And that would lead to widespread support for reform of the system, to make it better. We truly believed that.”Naughton’s project initially received positive coverage in the press, but its place at Bristol University was precarious. As a sociologist operating in the occasionally stuffy confines of a law school, Naughton considered himself an outsider, partly because of his working-class roots. As he saw it, his colleagues sometimes mistook his plain speaking for abrasiveness. What was commonly understood on a factory floor did not always translate to faculty meetings. Early on, a senior colleague had objected to Naughton’s appointment, on the grounds that someone who wasn’t a lawyer should not be part of a law school. “I said that’s OK, I wouldn’t hold it against him. He said it wasn’t personal,” Naughton told me. After the initial press coverage, the university had offered him a room to operate from, though this would be the limit of their support. They would not be giving the project any money or further assistance. “I said I hadn’t asked for any assistance,” recalled Naughton.While navigating the choppy waters of faculty politics, the fledgling Bristol project was inspiring similar undertakings across the country. By the end of 2005, innocence projects had been inaugurated at universities from London to Leeds, all under the banner of Naughton’s Innocence Network UK (INUK). In 2007, the investigative journalist Dr Eamonn O’Neill opened Scotland’s first innocence project in Glasgow, which would investigate cases with the goal of sending them to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC). The concept of clinical legal education – having law students sharpen their skills working with real clients – had become fashionable. What better introduction to criminal law, its proponents argued, than working with potential victims of miscarriages of justice?As well as working on its own caseload, Bristol would serve as a distribution centre for the growing network, sifting through applications from prisoners and assigning them to individual projects around the country. Students were certainly not given softball cases. At the Cardiff University Innocence Project, founded in 2005, students immediately began working on several cases of murder and serious assault. The project was set up by Prof Julie Price, a qualified solicitor and head of the university’s pro bono unit. “I went to Bristol at [Naughton’s] invitation and looked through some of the files,” recalled Price. “I came away with four of five murder cases. I got back to Cardiff and thought, ‘Shit I have some serious cases here … what the bloody hell do I do with them?’ [But] we were young and full of energy [and] thought we could change the world, the group of us together.”Prof Claire McGourlay co-founded the Sheffield University Innocence Project in late 2007. A few months earlier, she had travelled to Bristol for an Innocence Network event to examine the CCRC’s first 10 years, which doubled as the launch of Naughton’s book Rethinking Miscarriages of Justice. The atmosphere was electric. “I went back to [Sheffield] and said: ‘Right, this is what I want to do.’ The amount of students that came forward was incredible.”View image in fullscreenFormer post office workers celebrating outside the Royal Courts of Justice, London, after their convictions were overturned by the court of appeal in 2021.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAAt the Cardiff University Innocence Project, students under the guidance of Julie Price and Dennis Eady – a highly respected miscarriage of justice campaigner and lecturer in the law school – were making serious progress. Among the cases they were investigating was that of 18-year-old Dwaine George, who in 2002 had been found guilty of shooting another teenager dead in Manchester. Significant doubts had been raised over the quality of the forensic evidence used at trial. George’s first appeal failed, and his case was picked up by students at Cardiff in 2006. Sarah Magill, who became student team leader on the George case, had arrived at the law school in 2007 aged 22, having already spent several years working as a paralegal. “I got stuck into it quite quickly. We were pursuing new evidence around the gunshot residue,” she said. By 2009, George’s case was one of six that the Cardiff team had developed to the point where they could be sent to the CCRC for review.The various projects worked on their own cases, but Michael Naughton’s influence was everywhere. Not everyone was enamoured of his communication style. Even those who liked him recognised that he was divisive. “You’re Marmite, aren’t you,” Naughton remembers Price telling him. “People are either going to really like you, or they’re going to take against you.” Dark mutterings soon began about INUK’s apparent lack of tolerance for internal debate. For some, the network’s strict focus on establishing factual innocence presented its own difficulties. For practitioners used to running traditional university legal clinics, the constraints of the law required a more pragmatic approach. If the goal was to chalk up overturned convictions, then sometimes it made sense to focus not on proving the client’s innocence but to show how their convictions were unsafe in law. “They [were] teaching students to be lawyers, not to challenge the law,” said Naughton. “I’m about truth and you can’t have justice without truth. [People] often don’t like my brand of radicalism.”Naughton’s vision was clear, but it was also uncompromising. Members of the Innocence Network were discouraged from attending events hosted by the CCRC. For Naughton, the priority was casework, not what he saw as cosying up to the establishment. Groups were also troubled by Naughton’s intolerance of the slightest deviations from the party line. One veteran defence lawyer complained to a journalist that the tone of INUK debate brought to mind “the bad old days” of leftwing infighting, distracting from the real problems they wanted to address. When I spoke to Claire McGourlay – current head of the Manchester University Innocence Project – she did not mince her words. “I don’t think it was anti-democratic,” she said. “It was autocratic.”Others believed that innocence projects were giving students a distorted understanding of the legal profession. “They need to realise that they can’t always work for cases they find sympathetic,” Hannah Quirk, then a law lecturer at the University of Manchester, told the Independent in 2006. More fundamentally, people wondered whether the projects could even get results. An inexperienced student workforce, devoting themselves to cases that had already failed at appeal, did not look like a recipe for success. “We’re here to get a really good understanding of ancient legal principles,” said the president of the Cambridge University Law Society. In other words: activism should always be second place to traditional legal education. These reservations did not stop an INUK-affiliated innocence project opening at the university by the end of the decade.What the students lacked in experience they made up for in energy and idealism, of the kind that overstretched and underpaid criminal defence lawyers often found hard to muster. In 2011, students at Bristol began working with an ex-prisoner named William Beck, who had been jailed for six years aged 20 for his part in a violent 1981 bank robbery in the Scottish town of Livingstone. Despite the SSCRC twice refusing to send his case back to appeal, Beck had not given up hope of clearing his name, despite having long ago left prison. Two Bristol postgraduate students were assigned Beck’s case almost immediately after joining the innocence project. In September 2012, the SCCRC announced it would refer the case back to the appeal court in Edinburgh, thanks to the Bristol students’ work. “To get that validation for our arguments felt great,” one of the students, Ryan Jendoubi, recalled. To some, it began to seem as if a successful exoneration by an INUK project was not merely imminent, but inevitable.If there was one case that encapsulated the idealism and energy of Naughton’s Bristol Innocence Project – and its painful failures – it was that of Simon Hall. In April 2007, the Bristol project featured on the final episode of Rough Justice, a long-running BBC documentary series. The episode shadowed five students as they probed the case of 29-year-old Simon Hall, convicted of murdering Joan Albert, a 79-year-old friend of his mother, in her home near Ipswich in December 2001. Hall, jailed for life in February 2003, had protested his innocence from the moment of his arrest.In the programme, the students, including Gabe Harley, visit Hall’s small Suffolk home town to meet his elderly parents. They also interview Hall – a pallid, quietly confident figure – in prison. Forensic experts commissioned by the project consider the clothing fibre evidence relied upon by the prosecution. A distinguished criminal defence barrister offers his professional view. “Simon’s case is really peculiar because there is no particular reason to suspect he is guilty of this offence,” Keir Starmer says. The fibre evidence, continues the future prime minister, is the one link holding the conviction together. “It’s a very odd case. It’s circumstantial: break that central piece of evidence, and [it] falls apart.”In October 2009, thanks to the work of the Bristol Innocence Project, the CCRC referred the case back to the court of appeal. The CCRC accepted fresh expert opinion, commissioned by Naughton’s team, showing that the clothing fibre evidence could have been misinterpreted. It was also argued that the prosecution’s statistical evidence was misleading. Naughton and Harley were cautiously optimistic. Michael Mansfield – one of the best known defence lawyers in the country, who had acted for some of theBirmingham Six– signed on to represent Hall at the court of appeal.Hall’s case became a minor cause celebre. By the early 2010s, a number of MPs were voicing their concern at the evidence underpinning his conviction. Meanwhile, the campaign for Hall’s exoneration had developed plot twists worthy of a soap opera. A website, Justice 4 Simon, had been set up by a woman named Stephanie Bon, who was instrumental in drumming up early media support. She was then ousted by another Stephanie, a former colleague of Hall’s, who married him in prison. Stephanie Hall was relentless in pressuring the CCRC for answers.View image in fullscreenCardiff law students and Innocence Project staff outside the Royal Courts of Justice after they helped to overturn Dwaine George’s murder conviction in 2014.Photograph: Cardiff UniversityWhen the appeal was finally heard over three days in December 2010, Michael Naughton was confident Hall would get a retrial. But in January 2011, Simon Hall’s appeal was dismissed. “We have no reason,” the judges wrote, “to doubt the safety of the jury’s verdict.”Despite his public displays of confidence at the time, Naughton says he was not entirely surprised by the court’s decision. “There were so many ups and downs,” he told me. At first, Hall’s supporters were undaunted. His wife spoke publicly about the prospect of a further appeal. Private Eye continued to publish articles on the case. According to Gabe Harley, the setback did not sap the Bristol group’s momentum. “You think it’s a pro bono thing to come and do alongside your studies, and it’s impossible to leave at your door.” They kept going.Meanwhile, the wider university innocence movement was still growing. The coalition government was slashing legal aid budgets, leaving many people without representation. Students and academics were stepping in to fill the gap, and the number of INUK-affiliated innocence projects had climbed to 36 by 2013. Projects were now active from Plymouth to Durham, Lancaster to Bangor, North Wales. One was even inaugurated at the London office of White & Case, one of the world’s most prestigious law firms.Yet Naughton was becoming increasingly disillusioned. “We were obviously making mistakes, but trying our best. After [almost] 10 years you realise you had certain hopes and they were not actually being realised,” Naughton told me recently. Many innocence projects at other universities were not as collaborative as he had hoped. They “only wanted to work together when it benefited them”, he said.Personal tensions that had simmered from the earliest days of the movement were reaching boiling point. In 2012, a symposium hosted by INUK called for the urgent reform of the CCRC. The event featured high-profile journalists, academics and victims of wrongful conviction; the CCRC was not invited. Some asked if it was really helpful to attack a body that the innocence projects needed to keep onside if they were going to have any part in reforming it. In the buildup to the symposium, INUK had published a dossier of 44 cases of allegedly innocent prisoners who had been refused a referral back to the court of appeal. But at another conference later the same year, the CCRC’s then legal adviser pointed out that they had received just 17 applications from a total of five INUK projects.For some members, INUK’s lack of internal democracy was increasingly troubling. “[The network] doesn’t actually exist,” one anonymous project director told a later academic researcher. “It’s nothing other than Michael.” Several projects, including Cardiff, Portsmouth, Winchester and Sheffield Hallam, left the fold to continue independently in the early 2010s. One former innocence project leader told me about a memorably disastrous event hosted in London, in the summer of 2013. One of the panel, the distinguished lawyer and academic Prof Michael Zander, a central figure in the initial formation of the CCRC, served as a lightning rod for the crowd’s ire. “All hell was breaking loose, with people shouting at this old professor,” the former innocence project head told me. At the break Michael [Naughton] seemed completely unfazed by the whole thing and seemed to think that it was all going well. Others, like me, felt the atmosphere was febrile and rackety.”Naughton believed that if his plain talking upset people, that was their problem. One afternoon, he recalled, he had answered the phone in his office. The man on the other end of the line asked if he was speaking to the head of the Innocence Network. He was calling on behalf of his head of department at a well-respected English law school, who were keen to start their own innocence project. What is an innocence project, Naughton had asked in response. The caller was perplexed. Couldn’t Naughton tell him that? “I told the bloke not to ring me up unless he knew what it was. The guy said he’d never call back if that’s how I was going to talk to him. So I said: ‘Goodbye then.’”In April 2013 came another setback: William Beck’s appeal was rejected by the court of criminal appeal in Edinburgh. “It was frustrating, of course,” recalled Ryan Jendoubi. He said the barrister had taken a different line, ignoring the students’ argument.That August, the Bristol project suffered a more serious blow. After years claiming he had been the victim of a miscarriage of justice, Simon Hall suddenly confessed to the murder of Joan Albert.The media coverage ranged from quietly appalled to gleeful. The Daily Mail wrote excoriatingly about the naivety of Hall’s “hoodwinked” supporters. Albert’s family welcomed the news in a public statement, outlining how painful they’d found the 12 years of relentless publicity. Students and lawyers who had worked tirelessly on Hall’s case were left asking what had made him change his plea. But the question would remain unanswered. In February 2014, Simon Hall was found dead in his cell in Wayland prison, Norfolk. He had taken his own life.Bythe middle of 2014, the atmosphere at INUK meetings had become ugly. Claire McGourlay of the Manchester Innocence Project remembers a training event in Bristol, with the heads of several of the leading projects in attendance. Matters got off to a bad start when Naughton would not allow her co-director into the room, saying that only one representative would be permitted. The mood blackened as the project directors took turns to plead with Naughton to delegate some of the running of the network’s day-to-day affairs. “It was horrendous. You could feel the atmosphere,” McGourlay told me. “There was an American speaker over and we weren’t invited for dinner that evening. And that was it, I never spoke to Michael again.” Naughton agrees that the event drifted into acrimony, but told me that he had simply “lost faith” in the many of the remaining projects by this time.That summer, Naughton called time on Innocence Network UK. After a decade of ceaseless work, he had had enough. The punishing 100-hour weeks had strained relations with his own family, and leadership of the increasingly unwieldy INUK had begun to feel like an impossible burden. Funding and burnout had also become persistent issues, he said. Several member universities were simply not pulling their weight, he added at the time, instead using their projects as “recruiting tools” to attract students, without contributing meaningfully to casework. “They were handing second year students cases and telling them to get on with it,” Naughton told me when we spoke last year. “When they should be the ones leading the case.”Simon Hall’s name was nowhere to be found in the official communication about INUK’s disbandment, but his case may have been the final straw. Gabe Harley is cautious with her recollections of its unravelling. The Hall case “was a traumatic event for everyone concerned,” she said. “I don’t think we were prepared for all of that.” After the end of INUK, Michael Naughton’s health collapsed. “I call it a breakthrough rather than a breakdown. My brain was fine but my body packed in,” he told me. “The doctor said I was like a central heating [system] that should be running six radiators, but it was running 12. He said I was on the verge of a heart attack and a stroke.”Many university innocence projects closed over the following months and years. Today, around five official innocence projects remain in the UK, spread across Cardiff, London and Manchester. The intervening years have witnessed some limited successes. In December 2014, following work by the Cardiff project, the court of appeal overturned Dwaine George’s 2002 murder conviction. Four years later, another Cardiff client was exonerated. Gareth Jones, a Welshman with complex learning difficulties, had been convicted for a serious sexual assault in the late 2000s. In 2018, the court of appeal quashed his conviction. In both cases, appeal judges praised the diligence and persistence of the Cardiff Innocence Project.Sarah Magill, the student leader on George’s case, is now a criminal barrister at a chambers in Manchester. She remembers getting news of his exoneration as she prepared for a case in Preston crown court. “I was delighted and overwhelmed,” she said. “And sad, at the scale of the loss experienced by him and the victim’s family.” George’s story, like so many at the harshest end of the criminal justice system, is not straightforward. In March 2022, George – now going by Ibraheem Abdullah after his conversion to Islam while in prison – was jailed for 12 years for his part in a £1.2m cocaine smuggling plot.The CCRC continues to attract criticism. This January, the commission’s chair,Helen Pitcher, stood downfollowing 18 months of intense pressure after Andrew Malkinson’s conviction was overturned. Pitcher told the Times she had been made a scapegoat. There is no doubt that the CCRC is a hollowed out institution. Between 2004 and 2023, its annual budget was cut by a third, despite its caseload doubling over the same period. The current backlog of cases sits at well over 1,000. Yet the CCRC’s travails are just one part of an increasingly broken system. According to the Law Society, the number of duty solicitors – the representation given to those otherwise unable to afford it – has declined by a quarter since 2017 after catastrophic cuts to legal aid. The amount of people defending themselves in court has trebled over the past decade. Concerns have also been raised about the reliability ofprivatised forensic sciencelabs across the country.In this dire climate, the need for effective support for potential victims of wrongful conviction are as acute as they have ever been. And so, perhaps unsurprisingly, new innocence projects are being launched. Tejal Roma-Williams, co-director of the new City Law School Innocence Project, joined the university in 2023 after a 12-year stint as both criminal defence solicitor and a senior prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service. Being well aware of the projects’ complex history, she is keen to focus on achievable goals. When I met with the first intake of City students last year, they were working on just two cases. “There shouldn’t be a reliance on charities and universities when it comes to this kind of work,” Roma-Williams said, “but while we deal with those bigger problems, at least [we] can help.”In 2016, the CCRC’s then chair, Richard Foster, expressed his views on the value of university innocence work. “If you think that you have a terminal illness, would you rather have your case considered by medical students in the bar on Friday night – or would you rather send it to a consultant oncologist?” But when I approached the CCRC with an interview request last year, the response was blandly conciliatory: “Our purpose is to find, investigate and refer to the appeal courts potential miscarriages of justice. We welcome support from anyone that can help us to do this.”How do 11 people go to jail for one murder?Read moreMeasured in terms of overturned convictions, it is difficult to argue that the UK’s university innocence projects have been anything other than a failure, particularly compared to their US equivalents. In 2021, the US National Registry for Exonerations recorded 2,708 convictions overturned since the start of the innocence projects. The Northeastern University legal scholar Daniel S Medwed has written that their success represents the “civil rights movement of the 21st century”. Few would make that claim for their British counterparts. But the well-funded US projects do not have to contend with the UK’s straitjacketed appeal system, or scramble around finding experts and lawyers willing, or able, to work for nothing.Yet success could be measured in other ways. For many of those who claim to have been wrongly convicted, innocence projects are still the only available means of legal support. When Cardiff surveyed 20 of their former clients, the overwhelming majority gave positive feedback even though the project had failed to overturn their convictions. “They said we listened, that we tried our best. That we saw their point of view and approached with open minds,” said Eady, director of the Cardiff project. “We have had quite moving letters saying ‘you saved my life’ and things like that.”Last December, Louise Hewitt, Professor of Law at the University of Greenwich and director of the London Innocence Project, introduced me to one of their current clients, a man in his 30s currently serving a life sentence for murder, having been convicted under thecontroversial joint enterprise lawin the mid-2000s. After working on his CCRC application for several years, both he and Hewitt were quietly confident it was almost ready to send. On the phone from prison, he said: “Louise knows I’m not someone to bank on anything. [But] when you see their enthusiasm and hard work … it’s given me hope that there is a chance of a favourable decision.”Today, Michael Naughton no longer devotes his time to active casework. He is still heavily involved in teaching and research at Bristol, and receives dozens of messages every month from people claiming to be the victims of wrongful conviction. The passing years have not exactly mellowed him, but he has had time to reflect. “I’m not a good leader,” he told me. “I don’t want to be a leader. I’m not very good at massaging people’s egos.”In 2022, Naughton founded Empowering the Innocent, a research project focused on raising awareness about miscarriages of justice and their causes. Its website, CCRC Watch, carries articles examining the organisation’s failings, with contributions from the wrongfully convicted and their advocates. There were still more than enough concerning cases to keep him busy. “We might be crap at it. There might not be many people reading it, but I can’t control that. We can only do what we can do.”Doubt is not a luxury Naughton permits himself. He believes in his calling just as strongly as he did back in the earliest days of the Bristol University Innocence Project. “I don’t care if I get any success. It’s faith that drives me. I know what I’m doing is a just cause. And I’m not going to stop, because I know that it’s the right thing to do.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readUK criminal justicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Speaking outside the White House, he said for too long the country had been ‘looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike’. Now that would come to an end, he said, as he slapped eye-watering tariffs on countries around the world.The Guardian’s senior economics correspondent,Richard Partington, explains why Trump has taken such action and how it could affect the global economy. ‘It could come at huge costs to consumers,’ he says, as markets around the world react with confusion.

It is the most severe earthquake I have experienced in my life.”Esther Jis a reporter based in Bangkok, Thailand, more than 600 miles (966km) away from her home country ofMyanmar– the epicentre of last week’s 7.7 magnitude earthquake.Described by the Red Cross as causing a level of devastation that “hasn’t been seen in over a century in Asia”, the earthquake has killed at least 3,000 people in Myanmar with the figure expected to rise.Esther has been speaking to survivors who have described relatives trapped under the rubble and worshippers crushed during Friday prayers – but she has been unable to report from the country itself because of the military junta that remains in power.“The apartment I used to live in before the coup was already raided by the military and also my bank account was frozen. It’s not safe for me to go inside Myanmar.”Rebecca Ratcliffe,the Guardian’s south-east Asia correspondent, tellsHannah Moorethat four years of military rule and civil war had already left Myanmar in crisis before the disaster. Food insecurity was rife and healthcare systems had been devastated. And yet despite this, she describes how the military has been conducting airstrikes during the relief efforts and blocking the movement of some international aid.In the last year, the military has suffered a number of battlefield defeats and its power is now greatly diminished, reportedly controlling only a fifth of the country. While some opposition groups believe that the fall of the junta is inevitable, after calling for a ceasefire on Wednesday night, Rebecca explains that the regime may be trying to turn the tide and improve relations with its most significant supporter, China.Photograph: Thein Zaw/APExplore more on these topicsEarthquakesToday in FocusMyanmarAsia PacificSouth and central Asia"

It is also seeking a $2.4bn “restitution fund” for victims of hate and violence incited on Facebook.I was a content moderator for Facebook. I saw the real cost of outsourcing digital labour | Sonia KgomoRead moreOne of the claimants is the son of Prof Meareg Amare Abrha, who was murdered at his home in Ethiopia after his address and threatening posts were published on Facebook in 2021 during a civil war in the country. Another claimant is Fisseha Tekle, a former researcher at Amnesty International who published reports on violence committed during the conflict in Tigray in northern Ethiopia and received death threats on Facebook.Meta has argued that courts in Kenya, where Facebook’s Ethiopia moderators were based at the time, did not have jurisdiction over the case. The Kenyan high court in Nairobi ruled on Thursday that the case fell within the jurisdiction of the country’s courts.Abrham Meareg, the son of Meareg, said: “I am grateful for the court’s decision today. It is disgraceful that Meta would argue that they should not be subject to the rule of law in Kenya. African lives matter.”Tekle said he cannot return home to Ethiopia because of Meta’s failure to make Facebook safe. “Meta cannot undo the damage it has done, but it can radically change how it moderates dangerous content across all its platforms to make sure no one else has to go through what I have,” he said. “I look forward to this matter now being heard by the court in full.”The case, supported by non-profit organisations including Foxglove and Amnesty International, also demands a formal apology from Meta for the murder of Meareg. The Katiba Institute, a Kenya-based NGO focusing on the Kenyan constitution, is the third claimant in the case.In 2022an analysisby the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Observer found that Facebook was letting users post content inciting violence through hate and misinformation, despite being aware that it was fuelling tensions in Tigray.Meta rejected the claims at the time, saying it had “invested in safety and security measures” to tackle hate and inflammatory language along with “aggressive steps to stop the spread of misinformation” in Ethiopia.In January the company said it wasremoving factcheckersand “dramatically” reducing the amount of censorship on the platform, although it would continue to tackle illegal and high severity violations.Meta said it did not comment on ongoing legal matters.Explore more on these topicsMetaEthiopiaSocial mediaFacebookInternet safetyDigital mediaSocial networkingnewsShareReuse this content"

It says the expansion took place a decade earlier. Oaklandclaims 84,000 peoplefrom at least 28 villages were affected by the expansion plan.This week, the bank publisheda 70-page reportfollowingits own investigation, which found “critical failures in the planning and supervision of this project and that these have resulted in serious harm”.The report, published on 2 April, notes that “the project should have recognised that enhancing Tanapa’s capacity to manage the park could potentially increase the likelihood of conflict with communities trying to access the park.”Anna Bjerde, World Bank managing director of operations, said, “We regret that the Regrow project preparation and supervision did not sufficiently account for project risks, resulting in inadequate mitigation measures to address adverse impacts. This oversight led to the bank overlooking critical information during implementation.”The report includes recommendations aimed at redressing harms done and details a $2.8m project that will support alternative livelihoods for communities inside and around the park. It will also help fund a Tanzanian NGO that provides legal advice to victims of crime who want to pursue justice through the courts.A second, much bigger project, understood to be worth $110, will fund alternative livelihoods across the entire country, including Ruaha.The total investment, thought to be the largest amount the bank has ever allocated to addressing breaches of its policies, is a reflection of the serious nature of the allegations.View image in fullscreenThe project aimed to increase management of Ruaha national park and develop it as a tourist asset.Photograph: Michael Goima/The GuardianThe bank had alreadysuspended Regrow fundingin April 2024 afterits own investigationfound the Tanzanian government had violated the bank’s resettlement policy and failed to create a system to report violent incidents or claim redress. The project was cancelled altogether in November 2024. A spokesperson said the bank “remains deeply concerned about the serious nature of the reports of incidents of violence and continues to focus on the wellbeing of affected communities”.By the time the project was suspended the bank had already disbursed $125m of the $150m allocated to Regrow.The Oakland Institute estimates that economic damages for farmers and pastoralists affected by livelihood restrictions, run into tens of millions of dollars.Anuradha Mittal, executive director of the Oakland Institute,said the “scathing” investigation “confirmed the bank’s grave wrongdoing which devastated the lives of communities. Pastoralists and farms who refused to be silenced amid widespread government repression, are now vindicated.”She added that the bank’s response was “beyond shameful”.“Suggesting that tens of thousands of people forced out of their land can survive with ‘alternative livelihoods’ such asclean cooking and microfinance is a slap in the face of the victims.”Inspection panel chair Ibrahim Pam said critical lessons from the Regrow case will be applied to all conservation projects that require resettlement and restrict access to parks, especially those implemented by a law enforcement agency.View image in fullscreenA proportion of the new World Bank funding will go to support communities within Ruaha national park.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianRegrow was given the go ahead in 2017. The Oakland Institute described its cancellation by the government in 2024 as a landmark victory, but said communities “remain under siege – still facing evictions, crippling livelihood restrictions and human rights abuses”.In one village near the southern border of Ruaha, the brother of a young man who was killed three years ago while herding cattle in an area adjacent to the park, said: “It feels like it was yesterday. He had a wife, a family. Now the wife has to look after the child by herself.” He did not want to give his name for fear of reprisal.Another community member whose husband was allegedly killed by Tanapa staff said: “I feel bad whenever I remember what happened to my husband. We used to talk often. We were friends. I was pregnant with his child when he died. He never saw his daughter. Now I just live in fear of these [Tanapa-employed] people.”View image in fullscreenCows grazing on harvested rice paddy fields in Ruaha national park, central Tanzania.Photograph: Michael Goima/The GuardianThe Oakland Institute said the affected communities reject the bank’s recommendations, and have delivered a list of demands that includes “reverting park boundaries to the 1998 borders they accepted, reparations for livelihood restrictions, the resumption of suspended basic services, and justice for victims of ranger abuse and violence.“Villagers are determined to continue the struggle for their rights to land and life until the bank finally takes responsibility and remedies the harms it caused.”The bank has said it has no authority to pay compensation directly.Wildlife-based tourism is a major component of Tanzania’s economy, contributing more thanone quarter of the country’s foreign exchange earningsin 2019. The bank has said any future community resettlement will be the government’s decision.Additional reporting by Peter MururiExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentTanzaniaAfricaIndigenous peoplesConservation and indigenous peopleHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

One expert said Trump was likely to be targeting countries that received investment from China, regardless of the situation in that country. Chinese manufacturers have previously relocated to countries such as Vietnam andCambodianot only due to lower operating costs, but also to avoid tariffs.The tariffs come as many countries in south-east Asia are alreadygrappling with the fallout from the cuts to USAID, which provides humanitarian assistance to a region vulnerable to natural disasters and support for pro-democracy activists battling repressive regimes.Cambodia, a developing economy where 17.8% of the population live below the poverty line, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is the worst-hit country in the region with a tariff rate of 49%. More than half of the country’s factories arereportedly Chinese-owned, with the countries exports dominated by garments and footwear.Next worse-hit is the landlocked south-east Asian nation of Laos, a country heavily bombed by the US during the cold war, with 48%. According to the ADB, Laos has a poverty rate of 18.3%.tariffs mapNot far behind is Vietnam with 46% and Myanmar, a nationreeling from a devastating earthquakeon Friday, and years of civil war following a 2021 military coup, with 44%.Indonesia, the biggest economy in south-east Asia, faces a 32% tariff rate, while Thailand, the second-largest, has been hit with a rate of 36%.Major US rival and trading partnerChinahas been hit with a 34% reciprocal tariff, on top of the 20% levy already imposed.Dr Siwage Dharma Negara, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, said the tariffs on south-east Asian nations were intended to hurt China.“The administration thinks that by targeting these countries they can target Chinese investment in countries like Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Indonesia. By targeting their products maybe it will affect Chinese exports and the economy,” he said.“The real target is China but the real impact on those countries will be quite significant because this investment creates jobs and export revenue.”Tariffs on countries such as Indonesia, he said, would be counterproductive for the US, and the detail of how they would be applied remained unclear.Where the tariffs will hurt most – chart“Some garments and footwear [companies] are American brands like Nike, or Adidas, US companies that have factories in Indonesia. Will they face the same tariffs as well?” he said.Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, said countries in south-east Asia would be forced to reconsider their relationships with Washington. “A closer tilt towards China could be the result. It’s hard to have constructive, productive relations with a country that has just dropped a ton of bricks on your head,” said Olson, a visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute.“The world’s largest importer has now essentially hung a sign on its border saying ‘closed for business’,” he added. “We are now faced with two plausible scenarios: Either the impacted trade partners hold firm and retaliate in the hope that Trump will be forced to back down, or they look to cut deals with Trump in order to avoid the tariffs. It is unlikely that either scenario will end well.”Other nations among the hardest hit are several nations in Africa, including Lesotho – a country thatTrump claimed “nobody has ever heard of”– with 50%, Madagascar with 47% and Botswana with 37%. Lesotho, a small mountainous kingdom surrounded by South Africa, has the second-highest level of HIV infection of the world, with almost one in four adults HIV-positive.In south Asia, Sri Lanka is facing a 44% tariff. In Europe, Serbia faces a 37% rate.In addition to the reciprocal tariffs on a few dozen countries, Trump will impose a 10% universal tariff on all imported goods. That tariff will go into effect on 5 April, while the reciprocal tariffs will begin on 9 April.The US president has justified the changes by saying they are retribution for countries that have long “cheated” America, and the levies will bring jobs back to the US.But economists have warned the sweeping changes will raise costs, threaten jobs, slow growth and isolate the US from a system of global trade it pioneered, and furthered over several decades.“This is how you sabotage the world’s economic engine while claiming to supercharge it,” said Nigel Green, the CEO of global financial advisory deVere Group.“The reality is stark: these tariffs will push prices higher on thousands of everyday goods – from phones to food – and that will fuel inflation at a time when it is already uncomfortably persistent.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS foreign policyAsia PacificInternational tradeTrump administrationMyanmarCambodianewsShareReuse this content"

Despitethe reprieve, however, the US has placed 25% taxes on Canadian steel, aluminum and vehicles.“The president’s actions will reverberate here inCanadaand across the world,” the Canadian prime minister said at a press conference. “They are all unjustified, unwarranted, and in our judgment misguided.”Trump announces sweeping new tariffs, upending decades of US trade policyRead moreIn response to US trade policy, Carney said his government would impose the taxes on vehicles that are not compliant with the continental free trade deal. The new tariffs would not apply to auto parts and would not affect vehicle content from trade ally Mexico.Carney’s comments come against the backdrop of a global economy in turmoil.Trillions have been wipedfrom markets as multiple nations digest a new – and grim – trading relationship with the United States.The newly installed prime minister cited recent conversations with Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, as well as with European leaders and trade officials amid a broader attempt to pivot trading relationships away from the US in the pursuit of “free and equitable” trade relationships.“If the US no longer wants to lead, Canada will,” he said, outlining new relief measures for sectors affected by looming job losses, including using the money generated from the taxes to support workers and companies. “In this new world, we need to look out for ourselves. Because we are Canadian, we will always look out for each other.”The trade war comes as Canada is in the midst of a federal election campaign.Carney’s incumbent Liberals have experienced adramatic reversal of fortunesin recent weeks, in large part due to the actions of Trump. Recent national polling suggests the party is likely to secure a majority government in the coming weeks if support holds.Canada Trump tariff exemption ‘like dodging a bullet into the path of a tank’, says business leaderRead moreConservative leader Pierre Poilievre pledged on Thursday that if his party forms a government, he would “push hard to end the tariff madness” and “demand” a quick renegotiation of the pact governing free trade in North America. The Tory leader said he plans to remove federal taxes on automotive purchases, saving families thousands of dollars.Experts agree that sustained tariffs on the automotive sector, as well as on steel and aluminum, would inflict the most damage in Ontario – the country’s economic engine and largest manufacturing base. Already, one car plant in the border city of Windsor has announced a temporary shutdown of two weeks, a move that will affect more than 3,500 workers.Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, who oversees an economy worth more than C$1tn, said he was a “strong supporter of showing the US that we negotiate through strength not through weakness” ahead of Carney’s announcement.Ford told reporters the consensus among premiers was that Canada “got the best of a bad deal” in Wednesday’s theatrical unveiling of global tariffs, but that the current levies on Canadians goods remained “totally unacceptable”.Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsUS economyUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

He is appealing these convictions on the grounds that his lawyer was Gobbo, who was also a registered police informer.Mokbel has argued he would not have agreed to a plea deal in the case if he had known Gobbo was providing evidence against him to the force.Justice Karin Emerton, the president of the court of appeal, Justice Robert Osborn, and Justice Jane Dixon ruled on the appeal.Police engaged in ‘joint criminal enterprise’ with Lawyer X to take down Tony Mokbel, judge findsRead moreEmerton said it was clear Mokbel had been “deliberately misled and deceived”, and that he had “a very strong case that his convictions … should be quashed.”She found that while Mokbel previously fled Australia for Greece while on bail in 2006, that effort had been “spectacularly expensive and spectacularly unsuccessful”, and that stringent conditions would negate any risk of a similar plot.But she also commented that the court considered it unlikely Mokbel would flee while his appeals remained ongoing, and commented that the “harsh conditions” he had been held in for almost two decades would have had “some effect on deterrence”.Mokbel, a central figure in Melbourne’s gangland war, was granted bail on 31 conditions, including that he lives with his sister, report to police daily, abide by a strict curfew, be subject to electronic monitoring, and not own or use a smartphone. He was also released on a $1m surety.The hearing on Friday lasted less than 20 minutes, but it was nonetheless one of the more remarkable moments in a saga which has stretched on for more than six years, since Gobbo was outed as Lawyer X.Mokbel, who was transported to court in a police armoured vehicle known as a BearCat, stood briefly to confirm he understood the conditions of his bail.It is unclear exactly when he will be free for the first time in 17 years, but it is likely to be later on Friday.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

Many festivals around Australia have been cancelled in the last two years,including Dark Mofo’s summer equivalent, Mona Foma, which finished in 2024after 16 years.Estimates put Dark Mofo’s economic impact onTasmaniaat $54.3m in 2023, which reportedly fell to $7.1m in 2024, the fallow year. Now the festival has signed a new funding deal with the Tasmanian state government that will see Dark Mofo receive $7m a year for three years, allowing Walsh to step back and focus on other investments in the state.Dark Mofo 2022: one year on from major controversy, has the festival learned from its mistakes?Read moreWorks coming to Dark Mofo include a new work of “staggering scale” by Trawlwoolway artist and playwright Nathan Maynard: We threw them down the rocks where they had thrown the sheep, named for a quote by a white settler describing a massacre of 30 First Nations people in 1828 over the killing of three sheep. The work, which will involve sheep flesh, will highlight how the remains of First Nations people are held in galleries and museums around the world.Online, some people have reacted poorly to the way the festival has teased the work, which will explore cultural theft and erasure – perhaps because of Dark Mofo’s previous controversies, such as in 2021when a Spanish artist asked Indigenous Australians to donate blood for a work that was swiftly cancelled.View image in fullscreenChris Twite, Dark Mofo’s new artistic director.Photograph: Amy Brown/MonaChris Twite, the festival’s new artistic director, said: “I think people have a lot of preconceptions about the work that arts organisations do. Nathan is one of our greatest storytellers and he’s written a story in flesh this time. This is an ongoing and horrible state of affairs and something that Nathan has been working in various ways for many years.“I can’t speak to curatorial decisions before my time, but what I can say is that we wanted to work with artists who are asking really big questions and addressing these complex situations in their work. The First Nations artists on our program are making incredible work and pushing the boundaries to hopefully propel us towards new resolutions and new concepts.”Crash Body will see Brazilian artist Paula Garcia and a stunt driver drive specially equipped cars in Hobart’s Regatta Grounds for two hours of tension, in a tightly choreographed show of near misses that will culminate in a head-on collision. Twite said: “It is a very physically demanding work on Paula, she began training several months ago to get into the physical state to ensure the tension, stress and the eventual crash.”View image in fullscreenCrash Body by Paula Garcia.Photograph: Marcos CimardiNicholas Galanin, an artist of the Sitka tribe of Alaska, will invite visitors to his participatory work, Neon Anthem, to “take a knee and scream until you can’t breathe”. Twite said the work, which has been popular in galleries around the world, would provide “a moment of catharsis and protest”.“When we spoke to Nicholas about the work, he had concerns about what we would think about how many times people scream and how long they scream for,” he said. “We weren’t going to place any limitations upon people or him.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningCarlos Martiel, an American-Cuban artist known for putting his body through grueling, painful performances to address violence against people of colour, will present a new work titled Custody, which see him imprisoned inside an hourglass as a tonne and a half of sand falls on his naked and restrained body. It will only be performed once as “it is so demanding on his body”, Twite said, describing it as “a work that investigates the over-representation of people of colour inside the prison systems around the world”.Martiel’s previous work, Cuerpo, which saw him hang himself from a gallery ceiling with a noose around his neck while passersby “held his body aloft on the edge of life”, will also be screened. “It is a very confronting and challenging statement,” Twite said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you want to strengthen security in the Arctic, as we would like, let’s do it together.”Accusing the US of subjecting Denmark and Greenland to “pressure and threats”, she said: “What should we believe about the country we have admired for many years?”View image in fullscreenMette Frederiksen talks with the newly elected head of government, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, in Nuuk, Greenland.Photograph: Mads Claus Rasmussen/ReutersNielsen said: “Dialogue is of course the way forward, but it is also a great uncertainty that there is no dialogue now. That is why it is important to have dialogue that is based on respect.”Calling for unity, Greenland’s prime minister said: “Because of the things happening outside the country, we must stand together. Also within the realm, but also in our relationship with our allies.”Egede said Greenland wanted to cooperate with the US on trade, but reasserted his previous comments, saying: “We are not for sale.”Meanwhile, in Brussels, the US state department said Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, had reaffirmed the “strong relationship” between the US and Denmark during a meeting with Lars Løkke Rasmussen, the Danish foreign minister.Afterwards, Rasmussen said that he had “used this opportunity to state some things on behalf of the Danish kingdom”. He added: “More specifically, that these repeated statements from the US president with a vision or ambition to control Greenland are in no way sustainable. It has reached a point where it actually challenges our sovereignty as a kingdom.”In contrast to last week’s Greenland visit by the US vice-president,JD Vance– which, after a diplomatic outcry, was limited to the US military base Pituffik and did not involve Greenlandic or Danish representatives – Frederiksen was greeted at the airport by Egede and went straight to the capital, Nuuk, where she met Nielsen.Frederiksen’s visit had initially been criticised by members of the governing coalition because the new government has not yet been officially approved. However, before her arrival, Nielsen said: “Denmark is our closest partner and it is natural we meet as soon as possible.”The last time Frederiksen was in Greenland was in March 2024 on ajoint visitwith the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A general election last month resulted in the most US- and Trump-friendly party leaving coalition talks, after which the four other parties, led by Nielsen’s Democrats, signed a coalition agreement hours before Vance touched down in Greenland last Friday.Page one of the agreementstated: “Greenland belongs to us.”Frederiksen’s visit takes place amid reports from the US that the White House is preparing an estimate of what it would cost the government to control Greenland as a territory.According to the Washington Post, the White House budget office is assessing the cost of running Greenland and working out an estimate of how much revenue could be earned from its natural resources.Among the options on the table is to offer Greenland a higher figure in subsidies, approximately £500m a year, than Denmark currently does.Explore more on these topicsGreenlandDenmarkTrump administrationEuropeDonald TrumpJD VanceUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

All the elements are on the table.”Spain’s prime minister,Pedro Sánchez, lambasted Donald Trump’s “protectionist” tariffs, saying they ran “contrary to the interests of millions of citizens on this side of the Atlantic and in the US, who will unfortunately see their businesses and their purchase power” affected by the measures.In a strongly worded and defiant speech in Madrid on Thursday morning, Sánchez said the US administration did not distinguish between friends and enemies: “It goes against everyone and everything.”Sánchez described the tariffs as an “unprecedented” and “unilateral” US attack on Europe, adding: “Returning to the protectionism of the 19th century isn’t a smart way of tackling the challenges of the 21st century.”‘Liberation day’: what are tariffs and why do they matter?Read moreGermany’s outgoing chancellor,Olaf Scholz, said Trump’s decision was “fundamentally wrong” and “an attack on a trade system that has created prosperity all round the world, itself an American achievement”.France’s prime minister, François Bayrou, said the tariffs were “an immense difficulty for Europe” as well as “a catastrophe for the United States and for US citizens”.The head of the European Commission,Ursula von der Leyen, described the tariffs as “a major blow to the world economy” spelling “dire” consequences for millions of people. She said the EU was prepared to respond, but urged Trump to “move from confrontation to negotiation”.The EU is expected to announce retaliatory tariffs on US consumer and industrial goods – likely to include emblematic products such as orange juice, blue jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes – in mid-April,in response to steel and aluminium tariffspreviously announced by Trump.The bloc has yet to respond to the 25% duties on EU cars that entered into force on 3 April, nor the latest round of reciprocal tariffs announced on Trump’s so-called “liberation day”, dubbed variously “inflation day” and “resentment day” by senior politicians in the European parliament.The US president announced a20% tariff on EU exports to the USon Wednesday as part of a sweeping set of measures targeting countries around the world, rich and poor, largeand small.4:29World reacts to Trump's sweeping 'liberation day' tariffs – videoThe tariffs would affect 70% of all EU exports to the US, raising a theoretical €80bn (£67bn) for the US treasury, if trade remained unchanged, EU officials estimated.Von der Leyen said the EU was “preparing for further countermeasures to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail”.The EU executive is facing growing calls to broaden its armoury by targeting US services, from tech companies to big banks.Bernd Lange, the head of the European parliament’s international trade committee, said: “If we are really on an escalation ladder, then of course we will have a look to the tech giants as well,” although he added: “This is not the first choice.”The German Social Democrat MEP, who travels to Washington next week, also favours negotiations, but is sceptical. He said only Trump and his trade adviser, Peter Navarro, controlled trade policy and until they were willing to take part in discussions, “negotiations are not possible – that’s really a mess”.Lange also suggested Trump’s grievances went far beyond European tariffs, as the US’s stated grievances concerned EU legislation, from food law to safe internet rules. “This is of course not the ground for negotiation,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Retaliation is a means to an end,” said one senior EU official stressing the wish for a negotiated outcome.Map showing that almost the entire world was hit with tariffs on 2 April.Meanwhile, officials are seeking to finalise the first round of retaliatory tariffs amid national lobbying. Behind the scenes, France has been calling for US bourbon to be removed in the hope of avoiding a counter-punch against the French drinks industry. Trumpthreatened “200%” tariffs on wines, spirits and champagnefrom France and other EU countries when he learned of the plan to target US whiskey.The commission is also facing questions over whether it will invoke for the first time the EU’s anti-coercion law, which gives the bloc wide leeway to impose trade and investment restrictions on a foreign government deemed to be using trade as a weapon.This law could, in theory, allow the EU to revoke banking licences for large US banks, cancel US intellectual property rights in Europe and block US companies from bidding for European government contracts. It can be triggered only by a weighted majority of EU member states – a big step against an old ally many EU governments still hope to win round.The EU’s most senior trade official, Maroš Šefčovič, is due to speak to his US counterparts on Friday. “We’ll act in a calm, carefully phased, unified way, as we calibrate our response, while allowing adequate time for talks. But we won’t stand idly by, should we be unable to reach a fair deal,” Šefčovič wrote on social media.EU officials are also bracing for sectoral tariffs to hit three further industries: pharmaceutical, semiconductors and lumber.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsEuropean UnionEuropeGlobal economyInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

Withdrawal would come into effect one year later.Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, welcomed what he termed an “important decision”, adding that the “so-called international criminal court” had “lost its moral authority after trampling the fundamental principles of international law in its zest for harming Israel’s right to self-defence”.The Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, however, told reporters on the sidelines of a Nato meeting in Brussels that as long as Hungary remained officially a member of the ICC, it should “fulfil all its obligations to the court”.The ICC’s governing body voiced concern over Hungary’s decision, saying any departure “clouds our shared quest for justice and weakens our resolve to fight impunity”. It said the court was “at the centre of the global commitment to accountability” and the international community should “support it without reservation”.Netanyahu was welcomed in Budapest in an official ceremony, standing alongside Orbán as a military band played and cavalry carrying swords and bayonets passed by. He is expected to tour Budapest’s Holocaust Museum and hold a number of political meetings before leaving on Sunday.Orbán invited his Israeli counterpart to visit in November, the day after the ICC, which is based in the Hague and is the world’s only permanent global tribunal for war crimes and genocide,issued the warrant. The ICC’s move was described by Israel as politically motivated and fuelled by antisemitism.Netanyahu’s government has repeatedly said the court has lost its legitimacy by issuing a warrant against a democratically elected leader exercising his country’s right to self-defence after the October 2023 attack by Hamas-led fighters on southern Israel.View image in fullscreenViktor Orbán and Benjamin Netanyahu on the red carpet during a welcoming ceremony at the Lion’s Courtyard in Budapest.Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/ReutersLiz Evenson, the international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said Hungary’s withdrawal would “demonstrate how far Orbán’s government is willing to go to diminish protection of human rights globally and respect for the rule of law for people including in Hungary”.The country’s ICC obligations “remain intact”, Evenson said. In principle, Hungary, a founding member of the ICC treaty, should be required to detain and extradite anyone subject to a warrant from the court.Budapest, however, argues it never promulgated the law, so ICC measures cannot legally be carried out within Hungary. Many legal experts say that as a signatory and ratified state party, Hungary is nonetheless obliged to uphold the ICC’s Rome statute.Orbán, in any case, has said he would not respect the court’s Israel ruling, which he has previously described as “brazen, cynical and completely unacceptable”.The Hungarian prime minister has strongly supported Netanyahu for many years, embracing him as an ally who shares the same conservative, sovereignist and authoritarian views. Hungary has frequently blocked EU statements or sanctions against Israel.The visit marks Netanyahu’s second trip abroad since ICC warrants were announced against him and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant, as well as for the Hamas leaderMohammed Deif. In February, hetravelled to the US, which – like Israel, Russia and China – is not a member of the ICC.For the Israeli prime minister, the visit is a chance to show – at a time of mounting criticism of his leadership and a lengthening list of domestic scandals – that despite widespread international opposition to Israel’s conduct of the war he remains a leader on the world stage. For Orbán, it is another act of attention-grabbing defiance.ICC judges said when they issued the warrant that there were reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant were criminally responsible for acts including murder, persecution and starvation as a weapon of war.EU members are divided over whether to enforce the warrants, with some, such as Spain, the Netherlands and Finland, saying they would enforce them and others, including Germany and Poland, suggesting they could find a way for Netanyahu to visit without being arrested. France has said Netanyahu should be immune from the warrant since Israel is not an ICC member.The court, whose 124 members also include the UK, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan and many African, Latin American and Asia-Pacific countries, aims to pursue people responsible for grave crimes when countries cannot or will not do so themselves.It has opened more than 30 cases for alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and offences against the administration of justice, but is hampered by a lack of recognition and enforcement. Only Burundi and the Philippines have so far left the ICC.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuHungaryIsraelInternational criminal courtEuropeInternational criminal justiceMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

His lawyer, Raffaele Leone, told the Italian press that Argentino, 27, had confessed to the murder.The Messina prosecutor, Antonio D’Amato, claimed Argentino had “insistently and repeatedly” harassed Campanella since she started her university course two years ago.In a separate killing, the body of 22-year-old Ilaria Sula, a statistics student at Sapienza University of Rome, was found in a suitcase in a forested area outside the Italian capital early on Wednesday morning. She had been missing since 23 March and was allegedly stabbed to death. Her former boyfriend, Mark Samson, 23, is being questioned by police on suspicion of her murder and of hiding a body.The murders sparked protests in Messina, Rome and other Italian cities, including Bologna, on Wednesday night. Further events are planned on Thursday.Antonella Polimeni, the rector of Sapienza University, said Sula’s death was an “atrocious and brutal femicide that leaves us speechless and heartbroken”. She added: “We must no longer stand by and watch femicide incidents.”A minute of silence was held for Campanella at the University of Messina. Giovanna Spatari, the university’s rector, said students were “dismayed by this umpteenth episode of femicide”.The killings have also renewed political debate on violence against women in Italy, where there were 113 femicides in 2024, of which 99 were committed by relatives, partners or ex-partners.Mara Carfagna, party secretary for the centre-right Noi Moderati, called for a “cultural rebellion”. “From a regulatory point of view, Italy is more advanced than other countries, but culturally we haven’t managed to evolve at the same speed,” she told La Stampa newspaper. “For this we need a rebellion shared by everyone.”In March, Giorgia Meloni’s government approved a draft law which for the first time introduced a legal definition of femicide in criminal law, punishing it with life in prison while increasing sentences for crimes including stalking, sexual violence and “revenge porn”.The law followedthe strong public reactionto the killing of Giulia Cecchettin, a 22-year-old student who was murdered by her former boyfriend, Filippo Turetta, in November 2023.Turetta was sentencedto life in prison in December.A group of MPs with the opposition Democratic party has argued that an “incisive action of prevention” is now needed to stop this “continuous slaughter of women”, starting with education in schools.Explore more on these topicsItalyFemicideEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In a statement, the Israeli military said it had taken precautions to avoid civilian casualties in the bombing of what it described as a control centre for the militant groupHamas.Another 20 people were killed in a dawn airstrike on the Shejaia suburb ofGazaCity, bringing the total number of casualties reported by the local health ministry to 97 in the past 24 hours.The intense wave of Israeli bombing comes amid a major expansion of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) aerial and ground operations in the besieged Palestinian territory following Israel’s decision to abandon a two-month-old ceasefire two weeks ago.The Israeli military said on Thursday it had struck more than 600 “terror targets” across the strip since resuming large-scale airstrikes on 18 March. Gaza’s health ministry, which the UN relies on for casualty data, says 1,163 people have been killed in bombings since the ceasefire collapsed.Israel has chosen military occupation over a ceasefire in Gaza. Where does this end? | Sanam VakilRead moreOn Wednesday, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the army was “seizing territory” and“dividing up” Gaza. Israel has cut off humanitarian aid, food and fuel to the strip for over a month in an effort to pressure Hamas.He did not elaborate on how much Palestinian land Israel intended to capture in the renewed offensive, but according to Ocha, the UN humanitarian agency, the IDF has declared 64% of the territory military buffer zones and “no-go” zones for civilians.Netanyahu’s latest announcement has renewed fears of permanent displacement for the strip’s 2.3 million residents. It is also likely to inflame worries that Israel intends to permanently take control of the territory.On Thursday, local media footage showed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fleeing the southern city of Rafah and surrounding areas, as Israeli ground troops advanced to create Netanyahu’s newly announced security corridor. Movement was impeded, however, by at least three Israeli strikes on the two main roads leading north.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His two Red Crescent colleagues sitting in the front were killed but he survived by throwing himself to the floor of the vehicle.The Gaza paramedic killings: a visual timelineRead more“The door opened, and there they were – Israeli special forces in military uniforms, armed with rifles, green lasers and night-vision goggles,” Abed told the Guardian. “They dragged me out of the ambulance, keeping me face down to avoid seeing what had happened to my colleagues.”He was beaten, detained with his hands tied and made to lie on the ground, from where he was able to see some of what happened as other friends and colleagues arrived on the scene in ambulances and fire trucks, each one running into a hail of gunfire. In all, eight Red Crescent ambulance crew members and paramedics, six civil defence rescue workers and a UN employee were killed. Their bodies were found alongside their crushed vehicles last weekend in a sandy pit that Abed watched the troops dig. Other witnesses have told the Guardian that some of the deadhad had their hands or feet tied.View image in fullscreenA bulldozer retrieving a crushed vehicle from the pit.Photograph: Ocha/Red CrescentA Red Crescent ambulance officer, Assad al-Nassara, remains unaccounted for, but Abed said he saw him alive and in Israeli detention in the vicinity of the killings. Nassara has not been seen since. So far, Abed is the only one to return alive and tell his story.He was volunteering on 23 March at the ambulance station at the British field hospital in al-Mawasi, a coastal camp for displaced people, when the call came in shortly after 4am from the emergency services dispatcher in Hashashin, an area of barren sandy dunes on the northern outskirts of Rafah. (The name means The Assassins). Abed jumped in the back of an ambulance that left immediately. His friend, Mostafa Khufaga, was driving, with another ambulance officer, Ezzedine Shaath, beside him.Under international pressure, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Thursday they were launching a formal investigation into the shootings. Until now, however, the IDF has denied any wrongdoing, claiming it had fired on vehicles “advancing suspiciously” without headlights or emergency signals. Abed said that account was blatantly false.“The ambulance’s lights were clearly on, and the Red Crescent logo was visible as we headed to the scene,” he said. The IDF has described the area as a war zone, but Abed said Hashashin was “a civilian area where daily life had been going on as usual, not a designated combat zone”.They had almost reached the site of the reported airstrike at 4.20am, when they came under fire.Map“From the moment the shooting began, I immediately took cover on the floor of the ambulance. I didn’t hear anything from my colleagues, except for the sounds of their last moments, hearing them take their last breath,” he said. “Suddenly, everything went quiet, the ambulance came to a stop, and the lights went out. The driver’s side door opened, and I heard voices speaking in Hebrew. Fear and panic overtook me, and I began reciting some quotes from the Qur’an.“I was completely stripped, left only in my underwear, and my hands were bound behind my back,” Abed recalled. “They threw me to the ground, and the interrogation began. I endured severe torture, including beatings, insults, threats of death, and suffocation when one soldier pressed a rifle against my neck. Another soldier held a dagger to my left shoulder. After a while, an officer arrived and ordered the soldiers to stop, calling them ‘crazy people’ who didn’t know how to communicate.”An elderly man and his son who had been going fishing before sunrise were also detained and bound and made to lie on the ground beside Abed.“During this time, I noticed a civil defence vehicle and another ambulance approaching. As they neared, both were met with intense gunfire from the Israeli forces that lasted for about five minutes. After the shooting stopped, I didn’t see anyone leave the vehicles,” he said.“About five minutes later, two ambulances arrived from the direction of Rafah on the road leading to the Red Crescent ambulance centre. I could only see the red lights of the ambulances and hear the sound of gunfire. Another five minutes passed and a third ambulance arrived from the direction of Khan Younis, the same direction we had come from. It stopped near our vehicle and was shot at as well, just like the others.“As the sun began to rise around 6am, the landscape around us became clearer,” Abed said. “Tanks, quadcopters and drones came. The area was completely surrounded, and a large Israeli bulldozer and excavator arrived. They began digging a massive hole and threw the ambulances and civil defence vehicle into it, burying them and covering the hole.“As for my colleagues, I don’t know their fate. I only saw Asaad, but I’m certain that the others were killed immediately after being shot,” he said.The bodies of Abed’s colleagues, Khufaga and Shaath, were dug up from the same pit last weekend, along with the remains of six other Red Crescent workers: Saleh Muamer, Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan – six Palestinian civil defence workers and an employee of the UN relief agency, Unrwa.Satellite image showing the convoy of vehicles and the area from where the bodies were exhumed.Satellite image showing the convoy of vehicles and the area from where the bodies were later exhumedThe IDF had claimed it had killed nine militants from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the incident, but no other bodies have been recovered from the mass grave, and Abed was adamant there were no militants travelling with the ambulances.Abed himself was held for several hours, sometimes in a hole dug in the ground, during which he was fully stripped, beaten again and interrogated about his past. He was later forced to help in the vetting and photographing of local people who were ordered to leave the area and go to al-Mawasi.“Some of the women were carrying their children who had been killed. One mother carried her child, who had been shot in the chest and killed. Another mother carried her daughter, who had also been shot in the chest. Another girl carried their sister, who had been shot in the foot, and many elderly people were among them. No one stopped the women and children,” he said.“Then I began directing the men, bringing five at a time to stand in front of the camera,” Abed said. “Some of them passed without incident, but others were taken, dressed in white, and placed in a large hole. I still don’t know what happened to them.”Abed was released in the evening. He was given back his watch and underwear, but not his identity card, paramedic uniform or shoes. He was told to walk towards al-Mawasi, and was eventually able to flag down a passing Red Crescent vehicle.He said he was still in pain from the beatings and described his state of mind as “shattered”.View image in fullscreenFunerals being held at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis for the killed Red Crescent workers.Photograph: APAImages/Rex/ShutterstockAbed has volunteered for the Red Crescent since he was 18 and worked in the ambulances since the start of the war.“We entered this field out of love, despite the dangers that surround it and the risk we face during missions,” he said. But the work was sliding rapidly from the dangerous to the lethal.“We no longer find it surprising when someone is killed. Anyone can be targeted as we are dealing with an occupying force that disregards international laws and treaties,” Abed said. “Every mission we go on feels like it might be the last.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, announced a major expansion of attacks onGazaand the “capture of large areas that will be added to the security zones of the state of Israel”.The announcement followed a night of airstrikes on Khan Younis and Rafah in southern Gaza, which officials said had killed at least 21 people, including a pregnant woman. The intensification of Israel’s offensive comes after more than two weeks of airstrikes and ground operations that have, according to Gaza’s health ministry,killed more than 900 people.Unicef has said that at least 322of those killed since the renewed attacks have been children.Earlier this week 15 bodies of Palestinian paramedics and rescue workers, killed by Israeli forcesand buried in a mass grave, were discovered. According to witnesses, some victims were found with their hands or legs bound and had gunshot wounds to the head and chest.For today’s newsletter, I spoke with the Guardian’s international security correspondent,Jason Burke, who has reported on the war since its beginning, about Katz’s announcements and what they mean for Gaza’s future. That’s right after the headlines.Five big storiesUK economy| Donald Trump hashit the UK with tariffs of 10% on exports to the USas he ignited a global trade war.

Other orders forced tens of thousands across the north of Gaza to move. Many have only just returned to their former homes, most of which are in ruins.The Gaza health ministry now puts the number of people killed by the Israeli offensiveat more than 50,000, mostly civilians. In January the Lancet medical journal published a report that estimated that the death toll during the first nine months of war was approximately40% higher. International agencies estimate that at least110,000 peoplehave been injured, often very seriously.The war was triggered by a Hamas surprise attack into southern Israel that killed 1,200, also mostly civilians, and led to 251 being taken hostage, of whom 59 remain in Gaza.Capturingterritory“The language expressing a definite interest in taking control of territory, without giving any kind of timeline, feels much more explicit now and that’s a change,” Jason says.Throughout the war, some observers have warned that Israel’s offensive in Gazacould lead to annexationor resettlement. Israeli officials have previously avoided explicit statements about seizing territory in Gaza. One reason was undoubtedly pressure from the Biden administration, which insisted that Israelshould not reoccupyGaza after the conflict.However, things have changed following Donald Trump’s proposal to reconstruct Gaza as “the Riviera of the Middle East”, after displacing the Palestinian population to Egypt and Jordan. This prompteda warning against ethnic cleansingfrom the UN secretary general, António Guterres, but appears to have emboldened Israeli authorities, which threatened last month to annex parts of the devastated territory.According to the Israeli rights group Gisha, Israel has already taken control of around 62 square kilometres (approximately 17%) of Gaza as part of a buffer zone along its edges. In a video statement that was published on Wednesday evening, the Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces would capture a “second Philadelphi route”, referring to the narrow Israeli-held corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border. “[By] dividing up the strip, we are adding pressure step by step, so that our hostages will be given to us,” Netanyahu added. It is still not clear how much more land Israel wants to capture.“Of course territory could be seized simply to put pressure on Hamas during ongoing negotiations over a new ceasefire and hostage release deal, or used as a bargaining chip in any deal, or to carve out a very wide buffer zone but a lot of observers suspect other motives,” Jason says.What doesthis mean long-term?View image in fullscreenPalestinian children carrying drums of water home in eastern Gaza City.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAny seizure of land is potentially part of a broader, long-term ideological project of the Israeli right, particularly the far right, which wants the reoccupation of Gaza, the re-establishment of settlements and the displacement of the Palestinian population.Once dismissed as an Israeli fringe fantasy, this project has become far more plausible following Trump’s announcement of his plan for Gaza. Since then, Israeli authorities have approved a scheme to facilitate what they call “a voluntary transfer for Gaza residents who express interest in moving to third countries”, creating a bureau to oversee it. Legal experts are clear that under any reasonable interpretation of international law, any emigration in current circumstances from Gaza would be unlawful and constitutes ethnic cleansing. Many Palestinians have also made it clear that they are determined to stayand reject any proposalsinvolving resettlement.Since the first phase of the ceasefire that was agreed in January ended at the beginning of March, Israel has blocked all humanitarian aid from entering Gaza. Israeli authorities claim this is because Hamas is diverting aid for its own benefit, which Hamas denies. Israel thencut off remaining electricitysupplies, forcing the closure of a water desalination plant and so depriving more than 600,000 people of clean water. The UN World Food Programme has warned its supply of hot meals will last for no more than two weeks, adding that all bakeries have been forced to shut down due to a lack of fuel and flour.“If parts of the Israeli government and the extreme right more generally want to see ‘voluntary emigration’ from Gaza, making it unliveable is a good way to advance that project,” Jason says.Pressuring HamasNegotiations are ongoing but there is a massive gap between Hamas and Israel, Jason says. Hamas wants the previous ceasefire deal upheld, with a second phase that would end the war but allow Hamas to remain effectively in power in Gaza. Israel wants any pause to be temporary, and is offering a couple of months or so of ceasefire. This makes the imminent cessation of hostilities unlikely.“It has to be said that Hamas has sustained massive losses,” Jason continues. “It has few cards to play in any negotiations, other than the hostages and international public opinion. The only international public opinion that can influence Israel is the opinion of one individual, and that is the occupant of the Oval Office.”Currently that occupant has seemingly given Netanyahu a blank cheque, and this is not universally popular in Israel. Families of hostages have expressed their dismay at the expansion of the attacks, asking whether their loved ones were being sacrificed for the sake of territorial gains and expressing concern that the mission of returning their relatives had been pushed to the bottom of the government’s priorities. Arecent pollindicated broad Israeli support for a ceasefire deal that returns the hostages in exchange for IDF withdrawal from Gaza. “But the numbers who believe there should just be a ceasefire deal – Israeli withdrawal and Hamas stays there with its weapons – are really small,” says Jason.In the absence of a political plan for the administration of Gaza, “a vacuum will inevitably emerge, which Hamas or a successor organisation will fill”, he adds. “Israeli authorities who imagine they can eradicate Hamas in Gaza purely through sustained military force are wrong.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The resulting project, Nā́rī, includes artworks made in collaboration with some of the women she photographed. For this image of Praween Devi, for instance, she asked her subject to alter the image through embroidery.As Malik explains: “When she embroidered the portrait inphulkari, a traditional craft originally from the Punjab region, she didn’t remove the photograph of the men but instead inserted three women – figures draped in pink and green, mirroring her own clothing.”Her goal, Malik says, is to “disrupt the traditional power dynamics of documentary photography” by putting creative control in the hands of her subjects. “The act of embroidery becomes an extension of their voice, a reassertion of agency in a world that often silences them. Through Nā́rī, I aim to amplify their stories of survival and resilience – one stitch at a time.”Sign up herefor a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every SundayBored at work?And finally, the Guardian’s puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day.

In recent days, sources in Orbán’s government havereportedly floatedthe possibility of withdrawing from the court.The visit takes place as Netanyahu has said Israel is“seizing territory”and intends to “divide up” the Gaza Strip two weeks after it ended afragile ceasefirewith renewed bombing and the deployment of ground troops across the besieged Palestinian territory.It marks Netanyahu’s second trip abroad since the warrants were announced for him and his former defence chief, as well as for the Hamas leader Ibrahim Al-Masri.Israelhas rejected the court’s accusations, describing them as politically motivated and fuelled by antisemitism.In February, Netanyahutravelled to the US– which, like Israel, is not a member of the ICC – to meet Donald Trump. The US president seized on the visit to signan executive orderthat sought to impose sanctions on the ICC over its investigations into Israel’s actions in the conflict, which began when Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 captive.Since then, Israel’s retaliatory military campaign in Gaza haskilled more than 50,000 people,the majority of them civilians, according to the territory’s health ministry.Across the EU and its 27 members – all of whom are signatories to the ICC – the question of whether the warrants would be enforced has long been divisive. While states such as Spain, the Netherlands and Finland said they would uphold the warrants, Poland earlier this yearmulledthe possibility of Netanyahu attending the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, while Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz,said last monthhe had promised to find a way for Netanyahu to visit Germany without being arrested.When asked earlier this week about reports of Netanyahu’s visit, a spokesperson for the European Commission said all states should ensure “full cooperation with the courts including by the prompt execution of outstanding arrest warrants”,according to Politico.Hungary’s decision to flout the court’s ruling has been criticised by rights groups.In a statement, Erika Guevara Rosas of Amnesty International said: “Prime Minister Netanyahu is an alleged war criminal, who is accused of using starvation as a method of warfare, intentionally attacking civilians and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts. Hungary’s invitation shows contempt for international law and confirms that alleged war criminals wanted by the ICC are welcome on the streets of a European Union member state.”Human Rights Watch pointed to accusations Orbán has repeatedly faced ofweakening democratic institutionsand gradually undermining the rule of law.“Allowing Netanyahu’s visit in breach of Hungary’s ICC obligations would be Orbán’s latest assault on the rule of law, adding to the country’s dismal record on rights,” said Liz Evenson of the organisationin a statement.“All ICC member countries need to make clear they expect Hungary to abide by its obligations to the court, and that they will do the same.”In a statement to the Guardian, the ICC said member states had a legal obligation to enforce the court’s rulings and added that it was not up to parties but to the ICC “to unilaterally determine the soundness of the court’s legal decisions.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuHungaryInternational criminal courtInternational criminal justiceMiddle East and north AfricaGazanewsShareReuse this content"

They are closer to Myanmar than mainland India.New Delhi plans to invest at least $9bn (£6.7bn) to expand naval and airbases, troop accommodation, the port and the main city in the region.Dhaliwal said Polyakov kept blowing a whistle off the shore of North Sentinel Island for about an hour to attract the tribe’s attention before he went ashore.“He landed briefly for about five minutes, left the offerings on the shore, collected sand samples, and recorded a video before returning to his boat,” Dhaliwal said. “A review of his GoPro camera footage showed his entry and landing into the restricted North Sentinel Island.”Police said Polyakov was arrested late on Monday, about two days after he went ashore, and had visited the region twice in recent months.He first used an inflatable kayak in October 2024 but was stopped by hotel staff, police said on Thursday. Polyakov made another unsuccessful attempt during a visit in January 2025.This time Polyakov used another inflatable boat with a motor to travel the roughly 35 kilometres (22 miles) of open sea from the main archipelago.The Sentinelese, whose language and customs remain a mystery to outsiders, shun all contact and have a record of hostility to anyone who tries to get close.A photograph issued by the Indian coastguard and Survival International two decades ago showed a Sentinelese man aiming a bow and arrow at a passing helicopter.Indian authorities have prosecuted any locals who have aided attempts to enter the island and are trying to identify anyone who may have helped Polyakov.The Andamans are also home to the 400-strong Jarawa tribe, who activists say are also threatened by contact from outsiders. Tourists have previously bribed local officials in an attempt to spend time with the Jarawa.Explore more on these topicsIndiaIndigenous peoplesSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

It is part of theTatagroup of companies, which includes Tetley Tea and Jaguar Land Rover.Steve Beer, the lead claimant in London, told the employment tribunal that he had been made redundant in an “unfair and discriminatory manner” by TCS, an IT outsourcing business whose clients included Virgin Atlantic, the Danish shipping company Maersk and the insurer Aviva.Beer, a former partner hired by TCS in February 2019, claims that the company “targeted for redundancy an age mature, predominantly non-Indian national group of employees” who worked in the consulting services and integration (CS&I) division.He said TCS “deliberately orchestrated” its redundancy process to ensure these employees were singled out for redundancy, while younger, Indian nationals were spared.He said this was achieved via a “tickbox” consultancy process whose outcome had already been decided.In his claim, Beer said TCS had deployed a “bait-and-switch” practice to attract potential clients around the world, incorporating “local” staff into its sales proposals, before substituting them with Indian staff once the contract was secured.This was done, he claimed, because non-Indian staff, including many who worked in CS&I, were perceived internally as “more costly and less culturally ‘malleable and compliant’”.This, he said, meant that keeping those staff on the contracts could lower TCS’s profit margins and affect performance metrics that influenced bonuses.He said TCS sometimes understated its likely costs in order to win contracts, which made it even more likely that more “seasoned” but more expensive CS&I staff would be replaced on the contracts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was later confirmed that more than 80% of USAID programmes had been cancelled.InAfghanistan, where health clinics have closed in 28 out of 34 provinces,this is leading to an “escalating humanitarian crisis”, according to the WHO, with the country already grappling with poverty and outbreaks of diseases such as measles, malaria and polio.Afghanistan has already seen arise in polio casesdue to restrictions imposed by the Taliban on its vaccination programme.Ajyal Sultany, head of communications at WHO in Afghanistan, said: “The closure of health facilities is compounding these crises, with displaced and marginalised communities facing heightened risks of disease, malnutrition, and inadequate medical care.”In the worst-affected regions – north, west and north-east Afghanistan – more than a third of health clinics have now shut down, according to the WHO, with another 220 health facilities expected to close by June due to a lack of funding.In some rural areas, the clinics were the only access the local population had to health services. The problem is compounded by the Taliban’s restrictions on women travelling without a male relative as a “guardian”.View image in fullscreenA doctor measures a child’s height at a clinic run by the aid group World Vision in Yaka Dokan, Herat. Malnutrition is likely to worsen as feeding schemes are shut down.Photograph: ReutersOther humanitarian organisations are also feeling the strain of US funding cuts across their global programmes. Save the Children reported that it had to close down 18 of its 32 clinics due to funding shortfalls. “The remaining 14 only have enough funding to remain open for another month,” a spokesperson told the Guardian. “These 32 clinics supported over 134,000 children in January alone.”Abdul*, a coordinator for health projects in Herat, western Afghanistan, told the Guardian that his organisation had been forced to close 23 of its facilities, including mobile health teams, after it lost funding in January. It had relied on support from international organisations.“These clinics were located in remote areas of Herat province in nine districts where people did not have access to health services. We covered a population of nearly 120,000, including many women and children, and at least 20,000 new and expecting mothers.“We were able to secure some funding from a different source and temporarily resume four of the clinics,” he said, but most of the people they help remain without any healthcare services.Abdul said local populations had appealed to doctors and healthcare workers to keep the clinics open. “Since the closure, people from these communities have been reaching out to us through religious leaders andshuras[gatherings of tribal elders] asking us to reopen clinics.‘I begged them, my daughter was dying’: how Taliban male escort rules are killing mothers and babiesRead more“Unfortunately, we have tell them, with all transparency, that there is little we can do now,” he said.The WHO said the availability of healthcare for Afghans may now worsen even further. “The termination of US funding may lead other donors to scale back or withdraw their humanitarian assistance,” Sultany said. “This would further exacerbate operational challenges and reduce the capacity to deliver life-saving services.”The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) confirmed it had been forced to close two community resource centres that had been providing housing, food and other support to internally displaced Afghans, with a further two at risk of closure.“I want to emphasise that NRC Afghanistan is not shutting down its operations,” said Suze van Meegen, NRC’s interim director in Afghanistan, but she added: “Due to United States funding suspensions and cuts, NRC has been forced to end some of its programming in Afghanistan.”*Name changedExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentRights and freedomAfghanistanUSAIDGlobal healthSouth and central AsiaTalibanUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Our ambition is to make rail the preferred mode of travel to Europe, and we know that high-speed rail can reduce carbon emissions by up to 96% compared with flying.”Sinclair said there was opportunity for growth on existing routes, as people were hoping to connect onwards in Paris or Brussels, adding that there was “significant generational demand” from younger people: “Growth will come our way more than aviation.”The scheme will cut up to 50% off certain charges paid by operators on the first year of new services – including any additional trains put on by the current sole operator,Eurostar– while overall track access charges could also be reduced if the high-speed line was used more fully, Sinclair said.The operator is charged about £7,600 on the track from London to Folkestone at present and there would be approximately a £2,000 reduction on a new route, with a smaller discount in the next two years.There could be an outlay of £40m-£60m from LSPH, although that sum would be a fraction of the revenues it could expect to earn from a growth in the number of services on the route.The rail regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, this week said Eurostar wasable to make room in its Temple Mills depotfor competitors hoping to start international rail services.Virgin Group said it meant “the last hurdle” had been cleared in itsambition to run trainsto France and beyond. Two other potential entrants are the Spanish firm Evolyn and British startup Gemini Trains.Getlink, the owner of Eurotunnel,is also pushing for new routesand competition to Eurostar.Sinclair said the combination of factors meant a “step-change” in the availability of trains to Europe was coming – including plans for redevelopment of parts of St Pancras and faster check-in and boarding, upping the capacity from about 2,000 passengers an hour to nearly 5,000.He said: “This is a system, and there are a lot of parties working to achieve this – and the government is very supportive. It wants economic growth, sustainable travel and better relationships with Europe, and we tick all of those boxes.”A spokesperson for Eurostar said: “Eurostar welcomes any incentives which enable more sustainable international travel and support our plans to run more services. Our ambitions are why we’re also investing in key international stations like St Pancras and the Temple Mills depot to create more space.”Explore more on these topicsTransportEurostarChannel TunnelnewsShareReuse this content"

Chinacondemned “unilateral bullying”practices and the EU said it was drawing up countermeasures.While Trump timed hisWednesday evening Rose Garden addressto avoid live tickers of crashing stock markets, that fate arrived when Asian exchanges opened hours later.Graph showing falls in global stock exchangesDrawing comparisons with the market crashes at the height of the coronavirus pandemic and the 2008 financial collapse, the sell-off swept the globe, sending exchanges plunging in Asia and Europe.

The tech-heavyNasdaqfell 5.97%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow dropped 4.8% and 3.9%, respectively. Apple and Nvidia, two of the US’s largest companies by market value, lost a combined $470bn in value by midday.Libby Cantrill, the head of US public policy at Pimco, one of the world’s largest bond fund managers, said investors were growing increasingly concerned as Trump appeared to be unwilling to soften his stance in the face of market turmoil, although hope remained that he would ultimately strike deals with US trading partners.“There is likely a limit to how much pain he and his administration are willing to endure in order to rebalance the economy, but when that is or what that looks like remains to be seen,” she said.“For now, we should assume that his pain tolerance is pretty high and that tariffs stick around for a while.”The US dollar hit a six-month low, falling 2.2% on Thursday morning, amid a growing loss of confidence in a currency previously considered the safest in the world for most of the past century.Graph showing how the dollar has fallenWarning clients to beware a “dollar confidence crisis”, George Saravelos, the head of foreign exchange research at Deutsche Bank, said: “The safe-haven properties of the dollar are being eroded.”The heaviest falls in share prices on Thursday were reserved for US companies with complex international supply chains stretching into the countries that Trump is targeting with billions of dollars in fresh border taxes.Apple, which makes most of its iPhones, tablets and other devices for the US market in China, was down 9.5% at close of trading, and there were steep declines for other large multinationals including Microsoft, Nvidia, Dell and HP.Commodities fell sharply, including a 7% plunge in oil prices, reflecting growing concerns over the global economic outlook.Chart showing fall in price of brent crudeSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump said: “I think it’s going very well. It was an operation like when a patient gets operated on and it’s a big thing. I said this would be exactly the way it is … We’ve never seen anything like it. The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom.”Trump later said: “Every country is calling us. That’s the beauty of what we do.

Vietnam faces 46% tariffs and Myanmar,reeling from a devastating earthquakeand years of civil war after a 2021 military coup, was hit with 44%.Analysts warned that garment and sports shoe makers, which rely heavily on production in south-east Asia, face rising costs, which will push up prices for consumers around the globe. The share prices of Nike, Adidas and Puma all fell steeply.Analysts said Trump’s measures would raise the average tariff, or border tax, charged by the US to the highest level since 1933, in a development that threatened to sink the US into recession while increasing living costs for consumers.List of all Trump’s tariffsTrump’s plans involve imposing a 10% tariff on all US trading partners from just after midnight on 5 April, before additional higher tariffs of up to 50% are imposed on countries including China, Vietnam and the EU.The non-partisan Tax Foundation thinktank said it estimated the plan would represent a “$1.8tn tax hike” for US consumers, which would cause imports to fall by more than a quarter, or $900bn, in 2025.While the measures will hit the US hard, researchers at the consultancy OxfordEconomicssaid they could sink global economic growth to the lowest annual rate since the 2008 financial crisis, barring the height of the Covid pandemic.Countries scrambled to assess the fallout and whether to retaliate. The UK, which was hit with the lowest level of 10% tariffs, suggestedit may retaliate even as it tries to strike a deal with Washington.It published a417-page listof US products on which it could impose tariffs, including meat, fish and dairy products, whiskey and rum, clothing, motorcycles and musical instruments.The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, told MPs that ministers were still pursuing an economic deal with the US as the priority but “we do reserve the right to take any action we deem necessary if a deal is not secured”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said Trump’s decision to impose tariffs of 20% on EU goods was“brutal and unfounded”, while Germany’s outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, called it “fundamentally wrong”.Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the “protectionist” tariffs ran “contrary to the interests of millions of citizens on this side of the Atlantic and in the US”.The EU is thought to be preparing retaliatory tariffs on US consumer and industrial goods – likely to include emblematic products such as orange juice, blue jeans and Harley-Davidson motorbikes – to be announced in mid-April,in response to steel and aluminium tariffspreviously announced by Trump.Explore more on these topicsGlobal economyTrump tariffsStock marketsEconomicsTrade policyUS politicsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Five world experts answerRead moreSome MPs have been pushing for further restrictions that go beyond harmful content – including onaccess to social media for those under 16, full bans on smartphones in schools or restrictions on social media algorithms that are able to train addictive content on young teenagers.In a paper Orben published this week withfour co-authors in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), they said bans and restrictions were unlikely to be effective – though they did advocate for children and teens to have phone-free spaces.“Bans and restrictions have been successfully used for public health issues such as smoking. But smoking is not comparable with smartphone and social media use because the harms from smoking are extensive, clear-cut and by far outweigh the benefits,” the paper said.“Prescribing abstinence from all technologies to protect against harms is unrealistic and potentially detrimental in a society where technology use is a practical necessity and confers various benefits, including information access and social support.”The paper said that there had been “increased public pressure to mitigate the potential harmful effects of smartphones and social media on health, wellbeing … academic performance, disruptive behaviours and bullying.”But it said the evidence suggested there were “no simple, one-size-fits-all answers” and that while most parents and policymakers were “primed to believe arguments that smartphones and social media are inherently harmful, the evidence about their overall effect on children is not clear-cut”.Bans on devices could “undermine children’s rights to technology design and education that will help them thrive as adults”, the academics warned.The paper acknowledged that for some more vulnerable children “access to certain digital content can result in grave harm” but said legislators should also acknowledge restricting access “can be harmful to other high risk populations”.The researchers did raise concern about “trending content” aimed at younger users to encourage recurrent use, saying those designs were “purposefully not supporting the development of healthy tech habits”.Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary,appointed Orben in January to lead further research into the effects of smartphones on children’s health and wellbeing. Orben, a leading academic in the field, said she did not herself advocate for specific policy positions. Her work has been cited by both opponents and proponents for bans, including by the Australian government, which hasbanned social media for under-16s.She told the Guardian: “Understanding the digital world’s impact on young people is complex and there are no simple solutions. The report my team is currently leading was commissioned by government to produce recommendations on the types of research which could help generate high-quality evidence, not to provide policy recommendations.”“As an independent researcher my role is to examine and communicate evidence clearly, not advocate specific policies. In the BMJ article, we highlighted the benefit of multiple approaches noting technology-free spaces are important but smartphone or social media bans are not a complete solution, as other areas such as digital literacy and platform safety are also important parts of the online safety picture.”Ministers have come under pressure in recent months to go further on smartphone use for teenagers, especially in the wake of the Netflix drama Adolescence which depicts a murder committed by a13-year-old in thrall to toxic “manosphere” content online.The Labour MP Josh MacAlister was forced to drop plans in a private member’s bill on restricting social media algorithms for teenagers when ministers opposed the plans.The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is reviewing her department’s guidelines on smartphone bans in schools, by looking at a small cohort of schools to see if the current rules are working effectively.The prime minister,Keir Starmer, convened a roundtable with campaigners and the makers of Adolescence in No 10 on Monday, where he suggested that it should be discussed more widely in schools. But he said there “isn’t one single policy lever to pull” when it came to addressing potential harms.The DSIT has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsSmartphonesChild protectionSocial mediaDigital mediaChildrenKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

She said that in 2021, South Yorkshire police and West Midlands police, which was brought in after the disaster to investigate, agreed a settlement with families and survivors formisfeasance in a public office, based on a claim that the forces perpetrated a cover-up.“It feels like a cover-up of a cover-up,” Brookes said.In a letter notifying bereaved families of its findings, the IOPC did find Duckenfield and three other senior officers culpable of gross misconduct for failures at the semi-final. Duckenfield was also found to have committed gross misconduct for the lie he told at 3.15pm as people were dying, falsely telling his senior officer, the assistant chief constable Walter Jackson, and football officials thatLiverpoolsupporters had forced open an exit gate.In fact Duckenfield had himself ordered the gate to be opened, to relieve a crush outside the Leppings Lane end turnstiles. After an independent police investigation for the IOPC termed Operation Resolve, 11 separate elements of gross misconduct by Duckenfield were found, including for ordering the opening of the gate, and failing to safely direct the people who came through it.Duckenfield did not order the closure of a tunnel leading to crowded central “pens” on the terrace, and the lethal crush developed after people who came through the exit gate went into those pens, rather than to the sides.Jackson was found culpable of gross misconduct for failures of planning and his response to the disaster; the former superintendent Roger Marshall for crowd management outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles and for asking Duckenfield to open the exit gate; and gross misconduct was also found by the former superintendent Bernard Murray, Duckenfield’s second-in-command in the police control room.Duckenfield was prosecuted for gross negligence manslaughter after the inquest verdict;he was acquitted in 2019.The IOPC said in the letter it had found no case to answer against any senior South Yorkshire police officers who were investigated for whether they gave inaccurate, false or deliberately misleading evidence or “irrelevant criticism of fans’ behaviour” after the disaster.Senior officers were also cleared over the instruction given to officers not to write their accounts of the day in their official police notebooks, and a subsequent process of amending the accounts made by officers. One officer, the former detective chief inspector Alan Foster, was found culpable of gross misconduct, after an investigation into whether senior officers put “undue pressure” on some other officers who refused to make alterations to their original accounts.A complaint was upheld against one officer on duty in the control box, the former constable Trevor Bichard. He was found to have deleted from the evidence provided to the 1989 inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor a log entry which recorded that at 2.55pm an officer had requested the tunnel leading to the central pens be closed. Mervyn Jones, the then assistant chief constable ofWest Midlandspolice, was also found culpable of gross misconduct for instructing the deletion of “policy files”, and retaining policy books “in his personal possession” after he retired.No officers will face misconduct proceedings,the IOPC has previously said, because they have all retired. The findings against officers, which include dozens more individual complaints currently being notified to families, are opinions of the IOPC.The IOPC has explained of its findings: “Like the [2012] Hillsborough Independent Panel report and the inquests, we found no evidence to support police accounts to the media, the Taylor inquiry and both sets of inquests, which suggested that the behaviour of supporters caused or in any way contributed to the disaster.”However, in a letter to families last month, the watchdog said that while South Yorkshire police did seek to “deflect the blame from themselves”, with no duty of candour required the force “was entitled, within the law at the time, to present its ‘best case’ and be selective with the evidence it presented”.At Labour’s conference in Liverpool in September, Keir Starmer promised to introduce the Hillsborough law by this month’s 36th anniversary of the disaster, but the deadline will be missed, as families have argued that the proposals do not deliver the required duty of candour. Starmer cancelled a visit to Liverpool last week where he was due to announce the new law to families.Charlotte Hennessy, who was six when her father, Jimmy, 29, was unlawfully killed at Hillsborough, said she was “frustrated and very disappointed” after learning of the delay.“In my opinion, the prime minister has used the deaths of the 97, their anniversary and the Hillsborough law, to gain himself votes,” she said. “There just seems to be this continual pattern, where he says things and then he takes them back. And to do that on the back of a Hillsborough anniversary – I’m appalled by it.”Starmer’s spokesperson said: “We remain fully committed to bringing in a Hillsborough law, which will include a legal duty of candour for public servants and criminal sanctions for those who refuse to comply. We’re working on the bill at pace, and we’ll set out next steps shortly.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterLiverpoolIndependent Office for Police ConductSouth YorkshireWest MidlandsPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Plans include a new pergola – and there is little Wimbledon likes more than a pergola – which will provide a space for more hanging plants to provide shade and protection from British summer rain.The pergola, which will replace the structure at the top of the Hill, will wrap around the area’s 150-year-old oak tree while the AELTC hopes to make the area more environmentally sustainable by replacing tarmac paths with permeable resin. New accessible pathways to cross the slope aim to make the Hill easier to navigate for wheelchair users.View image in fullscreenNew paths crossing the slope would be added to improve accessibility.Photograph: AELTC/Allies and Morrison“The redevelopment of our world-famous Hill, in time for the championships 2027, will allow even more tennis fans to enjoy its unique atmosphere and vantage point,” said Deborah Jevans, the AELTC chair.“I am particularly pleased that these plans will increase the accessibility of the Hill for our guests using wheelchairs or who have additional accessibility requirements. It is an exciting opportunity as we look towards 2027 and the 150th anniversary of the first championships.”A consultation for local residents to learn more about the plans and give feedback is planned on 10 April before a planning application is submitted to Merton council.The AELTC will hope it is a smoother process than it experienced with its plan to vastly expand its grand slam venue, which aims to add 39 courts and an 8,000-seat show court, and to restore a lake designed by Capability Brown.In January a campaign group,Save Wimbledon Park, startedlegal actionto stop the expansion of the club, calling for a judicial review of plans to convert a swathe of the former Wimbledon Park golf course.The protest group says the development of the 29-hectare (72-acre) site – which was givenplanning permissionin September by the mayor of London’s office – is “inappropriate”.Work on the new-look Hill will start after the 2026 championships, and is expected to be unveiled – presumably with Pimm’s to toast the occasion – for the 150th anniversary of the tournament in 2027.Ruth Hopkins, general manager and head of access at the charity Level Playing Field, said: “I am delighted that Level Playing Field has played an important role in working with the AELTC to enhance their world-famous hill to be an inclusive and accessible space for everyone attending Wimbledon.“These plans will deliver significant improvements for all guests but particularly for those with accessibility requirements.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledonTennisLondonDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

It created the extraordinary situation where Loomer appeared to have more influence than the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, over the NSC and undercut Waltz in having aides axed under him.Loomer brought a booklet of papers laying out the perceived disloyalty of about a dozen staffers, including Waltz’s principal deputy, Alex Wong, to the meeting, which was also attended by JD Vance, the chief of staff Susie Wiles, the commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and Waltz himself.The fired officials included Brian Walsh, the senior director for intelligence who previously worked for now secretary of state Marco Rubio on the Senate intelligence committee; Thomas Boodry, the senior director for legislative affairs who previously served as Waltz’s legislative director in Congress; and Maggie Dougherty, the senior director for international organizations, the people said.While the firings appeared arbitrary, one of the people said that the White House looked through Loomer’s opposition research and verified parts of it. Ultimately, it found that one NSC official had recently criticized Trump on social media and others had ties to Republican establishment figures like the senators John McCain and Mitch McConnell, whom Trump despises.The firings did not include Wong, who has been one of Loomer’s top targets. Loomer has vilified Wong over the work of his wife, Candice, at the justice department, which involved prosecuting January 6 Capitol rioters. Loomer has also publicly suggested that Wong has sympathies with the Chinese communist party.Loomer did not immediately respond to questions sent by text about the alleged sins of the NSC officials she targeted. Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the NSC, did not respond to a request for comment.But in the days since Waltz inadvertently added a journalist from the Atlantic to a Signal group chat, where the defense secretary Pete Hegseth shared updates about a US military strike against the Houthis in Yemen, Loomer suggested Wong and other career NSC officials were trying to sabotage Trump by causing a scandal.She baselessly claimed Wong deliberately added the Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to the sensitive chat “as part of a foreign opp to embarrass the Trump administration on behalf of China”. (The White House’s final internal conclusion,the Guardian has reported, was that Waltz added Goldberg by mistake himself.)Loomer has been part of a group of Trump allies to disparage Waltz and his team, calling them “neocons” – short for neo-conservatives – as a pejorative term to castigate them for being too hawkish and eager to project US military power abroad, at odds with Trump’s “America first” foreign policy.The online vilification of Waltz and his team took a turn on Wednesday when Loomer appeared at the White House for the meeting. It was not immediately certain how Loomer was cleared to access the White House complex given she lacks a “hard pass” even as a reporter, a sore issue she has complained about in recent weeks.Loomer sat directly across from Trump in the Oval Office as she made her pitch to him directly to remove the people she was targeting. TheNew York Times reportedthat the Republican representative Scott Perry, who had his own concerns about staffers in the administration, was also trying to meet with Trump at the same time.The effect on Waltz was not clear. He left the White House with Trump on Marine One on Thursday, which signaled support from the president, who last week declined to fire Waltz over the Signal chat episode. Waltz has also recently shown more deference to Wiles, the chief of staff, in an effort to win her support, the people said.But Waltz’s political enemies point out that Waltz survived the Signal chat episode principally becauseTrump was unwilling to give the news media a victory, and not because of his confidence in Waltz. His main ally is also perceived to be the senator Lindsey Graham, as opposed to a network of allies inside Trump’s inner circle.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpFar right (US)US politicsSignal group chat leakUS national securitynewsShareReuse this content"

One of the victims has beennamed: a 68-year-old man named Garry Moore who was a fire chief in Cape Girardeau county, Missouri. At least a dozen injuries have also been reported from the storms.The White House has approved a state of emergency request from Tennessee, where rising floodwaters have menaced Nashville.Indiana, meanwhile, has declared its own state of emergency, activating 50 national guard members to deal with severe weather that has affected 41 of the state’s counties.“In times like these, I’m immensely grateful for the soldiers who are on the ground ensuring Hoosier safety,” said Mike Braun, Indiana’s governor.The storms are now tracking east, after leaving more than 213,000 householdswithout powerfrom Texas to Ohio. A “high-risk” excessive rainfall warning was issued by the National Weather Service for parts of Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky that are expected to be deluged over the next two days.Dozens of tornado and severe thunderstorm warnings were issued in parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri andMississippion Wednesday evening. In Arkansas, the National Weather Service told residents: “This is a life threatening situation. Seek shelter now.”At least one person died due to the storms inMissouri, police there said, with multiple reports of damage across several states. Homes were ripped apart in Lake City, Arkansas, with trees shredded and cars flipped over.In parts of Tennessee, people were told to not use the roads due to the amount of debris on them. Several Tennessee school districts have announced closures or virtual learning in preparation for tomorrow’s anticipated storms, theWeatherChannel reports.The Tennessee governor, Bill Lee, after examining the devastation, said Thursday it was too early to know whether there were more deaths as searches persisted.A rare tornado emergency was declared around Blytheville,Arkansas, on Wednesday evening after debris was hurled at least 25,000ft into the air.“It’s definitely going to be a really horrible situation here come sunrise in the morning in those areas, coming out of Arkansas,” Chelly Amin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service,told the Associated Press.In Indiana, winds reached 81mph (130km/h) and caused widespread power outages. Debris from damage has covered roads in the state and schools have been closed.While the US south and midwest have long faced the prospect of such storms, the severity of such events is being amplified by the climate crisis, scientists have said.Tornadoes may be shifting to different parts of the country, while a warmer climate holds more moisture, leading to more intense downpours.The coming days are likely to bring severe flash flooding across several states, with more than a foot of rain possible. There will be “significant, life-threatening flash flooding” until Saturday, the National Weather Service warned, adding: “Historic rainfall totals and impacts are possible.”Flooding in rural south-eastern Oregon caused by historic levels of snowmelt and rainfall has prompted evacuation orders, school closures and public health concerns.Officials say more than 1,000 people are under the highest level of evacuation orders. County authorities say drinking water is safe, but warn that floodwaters could be contaminated with bacteria such asEcoli. Residents have been urged to avoid floodwaters when possible. The Oregon governor Tina Kotek declared a state of emergency due to the flooding, which followed rapid snowmelt in the area.Heavy rain has already started to swell rivers around Memphis, Tennessee, with the National Weather Service warning of the threat of flooding in the city as soil becomes saturated with water.“Flash flooding will emerge as a primary concern with this extremely active pattern,” the weather service said on Thursday.The looming floods are likely to cause further damage and increase the death toll. One man did manage an unusual escape, though, after a tornado destroyed his home in Selmer, Tennessee.Matt Vandevander jumped into his bathtub to shelter from the storm but it ripped him out of his house and threw him into his neighbor’s yard. Somehow, Vandevander survived with just a few scratches.“It’s a miracle,” hetold WMC, a CNN affiliate. “I’m very happy – happier than I probably should be.”Explore more on these topicsUS weatherArkansasTornadoesClimate crisisIllinoisIndianaMississippinewsShareReuse this content"

The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 6%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow dropped 4.8% and 3.9%, respectively. Apple and Nvidia, two of the US’s largest companies by market value, had lost a combined $470bn in value by midday.GraphMeanwhile, the US dollar hit a six-month low, going down at least 2.2% on Thursday morning compared with other major currencies, and oil prices sank on fears of a global slowdown.Though the US stock market has been used to tumultuous mornings over the last few weeks, US stock futures – an indication of the market’s likely direction – had plummeted after the announcement. Hours later, Japan’s Nikkei index slumped to an eight-month low and was followed by falls in stock markets in London and across Europe.GraphThe White House drafted up a list of countries, including some of its largest trade partners and onesuninhabitedby humans, that will be receiving reciprocal tariffs. Many economies, including the EU, China, Japan and Taiwan, will see new tariffs above 20%.The 10% baseline tariff will go into effect on 5 April, while the reciprocal tariffs will begin on 9 April, according to theWhite House.“The markets are going to boom,” Trump told reporters at the White House as he left for Florida for the weekend. “I think it’s going very well.”Economists have for monthswarnedthat high tariffs are a major risk to the US economy, pushing prices up for consumers on everything from cars to wine along with destabilizing the US’s role in the global economy.But that didn’t stop Trump from taking a celebratory tone at the event he dubbed “liberation day”. Trump tried to paint the tariffs as the start of “the golden age of America”.“We are going to start being smart and we’re going to start being very wealthy again,” Trump said.On Thursday, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, defended the move. “The president is not going to back off what he announced yesterday. He is not going to back off,” he told CNN.Multiple major American business groups have spoken out against the tariffs, including the Business Roundtable, a consortium of leaders of major US companies including JP Morgan, Apple and IBM, which called on the White House to “swiftly reach agreements” and remove the tariffs.“Universal tariffs ranging from 10-50% run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters,” the Business Roundtable said in a statement. “Damage to theUS economywill increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Apollreleased on Wednesday before Trump’s announcement found that just 28% of Americans believe tariffs help the economy, while 58% believe the impacts will be damaging.But in his speech yesterday, Trump appeared ready to be defiant against any criticism.“In the coming days, there will be complaints from the globalists and the outsources and special interests and the fake news,” he said. “This will be an entirely different country in a short period of time. It’ll be something the whole world will be talking about.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsStock marketsUS economyDonald TrumpTrump administrationTariffsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

First, all imported goods will be subject to a 10% universal tariff starting 5 April. Then, on 9 April, certain countries will see higher tariff rates – what Trump has deemed “reciprocal tariffs” in retaliation for tariffs the countries have placed on American exports.Keep in mind that tariffs are paid by American companies that are importing goods such as wine from Europe or microchips from Taiwan.Map of the world, with different countries in varying shades of pinkSome of the highest tariffs will be put on imports from Asian countries, including China, India, South Korea and Japan. EU exports will also have a 20% tariff.Chart with x and y axis covered in red dotsHow did the White House calculate its reciprocal tariffs? The administrationsaidthat it looked at the trade deficit between the US and a specific country as a percentage, and then considered that to be a tariff. So, for example, the value of US goods that are exported to China are 67% of the value of the Chinese goods that are imported into the US.The White House calls this definition a “tariff” placed on American goods, though a deficit and a tariff are not the same thing.It then halved the “tariff” and used that percentage to represent the new levy that the US would place on goods from that country.A list of every country, delineated by “New US tariffs, %” and, in quotes, ‘Tariffs charged to the USA’Canada and Mexico are notably absent from the list, despite being targets of a proposed 25% tariff. The White House said that goods covered under an existing trade agreement between the two countries will continue to have no tariffs.Graph with blue dots arranged on lines that say Asia, Americas, Europe and OceaniaTargeting key trading partnersTrump and his economic advisers argue that the tariffs will strengthen US manufacturing while also lowering barriers other countries put on American goods. But the US has long been in a trade deficit, importing more goods than exporting.Graph with lines going above and below the x axisWhile increasing domestic manufacturing and relying less on foreign suppliers could strengthen the US economy in the long run, economists say that Trump’s tariffs are too aggressive and uncertain for them to actually encourage domestic investment. Instead, companies have said they will pass the cost of the tariffs on to consumers.Chart of countries on globe colored in shades of blueFear on Wall StreetMarkets immediately plummeted when exchanges started trading on Thursday morning, as Wall Street reacted to the new levies.Wall Street has been slumping for the last month as Trump introduced new tariffs and teased the ones he announced on Wednesday. All three exchanges went into correction territory in March, meaning that the indexes fell more than 10% from their recent peaks.Jagged line graphThe tariffs have also hit stock markets abroad. The UK’s FTSE 100 saw its worst day since August 2024, while markets in Japan, Hong Kong and Germany also tumbled.Leaders around the world expressed shock and frustration over the new tariffs. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, called the tariffs “a major blow to the world economy”.“The global economy will massively suffer,” she said Thursday. “Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences will be dire.”Jagged overlapping line graphThe new tariffs have also made the US dollar fall in value in relation to other major currencies.Jagged line graphThe strength of the US dollar is an important measure of how the US economy is seen by investors, relative to other economies. That the dollar has been falling shows that investors see instability in the US economy that is likely to last.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsUS foreign policyUS domestic policyDonald TrumpTariffsUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While M&S is not considering withdrawing the sweets, tariffs could push up prices and make them less popular.The pink confectionery which sells more than 18m bags a year in the UK and is apparently enjoyed by celebrities includingAdeleand Olivia Rodrigo, went on sale in the US on 30 March both in Target stores across the US and on its website in what was described as Percy’s “biggest journey to date”.The US president on Wednesday announced sweeping tariffs on imports, including a10% tariff on those coming from the UK.2:27Trump announces sweeping new tariffs, upending decades of US trade policy – videoNorman added that M&S was also rethinking plans for its Christmas TV campaign as new rules on advertising foods high in fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) come in to force in the UK.Swizzels agrees to M&S demand to redesign its rival sweet to Percy PigRead moreThe government announced last year that junk food adverts would be banned before 9pm on TV from October 2025, as part of efforts to tackle obesity in children.“It probably means we can’t run our Christmas ad,” Norman told the conference in London “You won’t be able to run an ad that includes Christmas pudding, your mince pies or sausages.”The former Conservative MP said retailers faced a wave of new regulations this year including new rules on packaging and labour rights. “M&S will manage with everything as we are a growing business with no debt,” Norman said, adding that “for the little guy these things become really damaging” and it was “going to be tough for some people”.He said it was “pretty clear that we can’t run a traditional food ad during the day and we probably can’t run a YouTube ad during the day”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, he pointed to the vast private equity losses in fast-track grocery delivery firms such as Gorillas, adding that “there has been more wealth destroyed in people trying to develop food online businesses than any other industry I can think of”.Explore more on these topicsMarks & SpencerRetail industryAdeleDonald TrumpAdvertisingChristmas adsArchie NormannewsShareReuse this content"

The title appears destined for Anfield – Arsenal have been unable to sustain a consistent challenge for it all season – but Mikel Arteta will feel duty-bound to delay the seemingly inevitable for as long as possible on his return to Everton. Tuesday’s Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid may be the priority for Arsenal but rotating is hardly an option for Arteta at Goodison Park given he has four defenders available. A makeshift unit would benefit from a demanding afternoon together before welcoming Real to the Emirates. Arne Slot claimed it is unfair on Everton to have an early Saturday kick-off after Wednesday’s Merseyside derby. Depleted or not, Arteta’s team should take advantage.Andy HunterEverton vArsenal, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)2Richards an unsung hero in Palace defenceWhenChelsea recalled Trevoh Chalobahfrom his loan spell at Crystal Palace in January it meant that the south London club had only three frontline central defenders – potentially a major issue given Oliver Glasner’s preferred 3-4-2-1 formation. But while Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guéhi have also been outstanding, it was significant that the absence of Chris Richards fromthe game at Southamptonon Tuesday coincided with Palace conceding their first away goal of 2025, a remarkable run of seven fixtures in all competitions. Their record when the USA defender plays shows how important he has been under Glasner, with Palace picking up an average 2.03 points per game compared with just 1.1 without him. The good news is that the 25-year-old former Bayern Munich defender should be back for the Selhurst Park showdown with Brighton on Saturday.Ed AaronsCrystal Palace v Brighton, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenChris Richards slides in to deny Everton’s Jack Harrison.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images3Wolves lose Pereira for trip to IpswichVítor Pereira is a passionate and emotional figure on the touchline, which might explain why he is suspended from the dugout for Wolves’ trip to Portman Road. The head coach was booked during thecrucial win over West Hamin midweek but that did not stop him from celebrating wildly at full time, much to Graham Potter’s chagrin. It is rare to have a head coach that sets the tempo on the sidelines and Wolves will have to do without him and assistant, Luís Miguel, who has suffered the same fate. Pereira has drilled his players well since his appointment but how will Wolves cope without him on the sidelines? AfterIpswich’s surprise win at Bournemouth, another victory for the Tractor Boys on Saturday will close the gap to Wolves to six points.Will UnwinIpswich v Wolves, Saturday 3pm4Potter should roll the dice at West HamGraham Potter has been cautious since joining West Ham in January. His results since taking over: 3-2, 0-2, 1-1, 1-2, 0-1, 1-0, 2-0, 0-1, 1-1, 0-1. Excitement has been in short supply and performances at home have not exactly been sparkling. Potter, mindful of his team’s defensive struggles under Julen Lopetegui, has placed a heavy focus on containment since replacing the Spaniard. He has mainly used a back three, which has meant sacrificing an attacker, but the set-up was ineffective whenWest Ham lost 1-0 to Wolveson Tuesday. With little to play for before the end of the season, Potter should open up when West Ham host Bournemouth on Saturday.Jacob SteinbergWest Ham vBournemouth, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenGraham Potter will hope the returning Niclas Füllkrug can provide a spark up front for the Hammers.Photograph: Nick Potts/PA5January additions have revitalised VillaUnai Emery has achieved some magnificent feats since transforming Aston Villa but his latest trick is arguably his best yet: getting value for money – if that is the right phrase given the numbers involved – from the January transfer window. It is regarded as a notoriously difficult time to improve squads, one usually reserved for panic buys or to correct expensive mistakes, but the addition of Donyell Malen, plus loan arrivals Marcus Rashford, Marco Asensio and Axel Disasi have undoubtedly given Villa fresh impetus. Rashford, Malen and Asensio were all on the scoresheet inWednesday’s impressive victory at Brightonand since Asensio’s debut in February, no top-flight player has scored more goals in all competitions than the Spaniard, who has eight. After straight six wins, now Villa host Forest looking for further momentum before a Champions League quarter-final trip to Parc des Princes next week.Ben FisherAston Villa vNottingham Forest, Saturday 5.30pm6Mbeumo and Wissa eye Toney recordIvan Toney scored 20 goals in the 2022-23 season forBrentford, the highest ever tally by a Bees player in the Premier League. Within that there were six penalties, adding a useful boost to his statistics. Bryan Mbeumo has taken over the penalty duties and has scored all five taken this season as part of a total tally of 16 goals. His partner in crime, Yoane Wissa, has 14 to his name this campaign and another for either against Chelsea would give them a chance of catching up with Toney’s record total in the run-in. Even if they fail to match Toney individually, Mbeumo and Wissa know they have more than made up for the England international’s departure to Saudi Arabia. The Bees are the only team with two players in the top 10 scorers in the Premier League charts this season to more than prove that they have the individuals and unity to thrive without Toney.WUBrentford vChelsea, Sunday 2pm7Jones is not a long-term fix at right backArne Slot liked Curtis Jones’s performance at right-back inLiverpool’s Merseyside derby victory. It seems an unlikely long-term fix, though. Jones was an admirable stand-in but this was surely not an early taste of life without Trent Alexander-Arnold. It was a case of needs must with Conor Bradley also unavailable and it would not be a surprise if Slot tries something more orthodox when Liverpool visit Fulham. Jones, after all, is not a defender. His ability on the ball makes him an appealing option in games Liverpool expect to dominate but a more solid option could be the answer for tougher assignments. Jarell Quansah will be pushing to start against Fulham, who have a dangerous left flank, and Slot has suggested that Bradley could be in contention. Looking further ahead, Liverpool will need to spend on a replacement for Alexander-Arnold should his move to Real Madrid go through, if only to ensure they have enough cover when injuries strike.JSFuham vLiverpool, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenCurtis Jones wins a header under pressure from Everton’s Abdoulaye Doucouré.Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters8Dibling will want to impress suitorsAs Southampton edge ever closer to the Championship, they will be wondering who will still be there next season. Tyler Dibling is the Saints’ prized asset, and will cost someone a lot of money in the summer unless he decides to stay for the home comforts. One club repeatedly linked with the talented winger is Tottenham, where Dibling will visit on Sunday, perhaps with the thought of potentially impressing Ange Postecoglou and his recruitment boffins. Dibling came off the benchagainst Crystal Palace in midweekand will be fresh and eager this weekend. Dibling has his best years ahead of him and the brand of all-action football instilled by Postecoglou should suit his attributes – the teenager will be looking to show them off in north London.WUTottenham vSouthampton, Sunday 2pm9City aim for derby revenge after Etihad lossThis 196th local squabble pits the poorest Manchester United vintage of the Premier League era against a wobbly Manchester City, the champions of the past four seasons who are scrambling to qualify for the Champions League. The great cliche of any derby is that form goes out of the window due to the neighbourly rivalry: this one, on Sunday, epitomises it, but after United wonthis season’s reverse fixture, the view here is the City will find a way to win before the hostile Old Trafford faithful.Jamie JacksonManchester United v Manchester City, Sunday 4.30pmView image in fullscreenAmad Diallo scored a last-minute winner when the sides met in December.Photograph: Alex Livesey/Danehouse/Getty Images10Van Nistelrooy’s record is a woeful oneRuud van Nistelrooy has overseen 14 defeats – including seven in a row – in his 17 Premier League matches at the Leicester helm. It is a somewhat embarrassing record for the Dutchman. Foxes fans might be hoping they can get something when Southampton visit on 3 May because every match prior to that looks very difficult for a Leicester team short on quality and confidence. They failed to register a shot on target at Manchester City intheir latest meek loss. Van Nistelrooy needs to pick up points soon and another dispiriting defeat by Champions League-chasing Newcastle will add further concerns and questions over whether the Dutchman is the right man for the job of trying to bring them back up next season.

Now, though, he is chasing the holy grail. Every four years, athletics is the biggest sport at the Olympics. In between, for most casual fans, it tumbles off a cliff. But Johnson, a four-time gold medallist across the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Games, believes he can change all that with a new big-money professional track league, Grand Slam Track, which launches on Friday in Kingston, Jamaica.“Grand Slam Track is the equivalent of UFC and Formula One,” he tells the Guardian. “The research tells us that people watched track during the Olympics because of the stakes, the stars and the stories. So that is the recipe. And at the absolute heart of it is the head-to-head competition between the best athletes. Because that’s what people want to see.”Jess Warner-Judd: ‘I want to finish my track career on my terms, not epilepsy’s’Read moreThere will be four “slams” from April to June, with many of the biggest names in the sport chasing $12.5m (£9.5m) in prize money. But there is also an intriguing twist: at every three-day meet athletes will not only compete in their main speciality but against the world’s best in a second event.“We’ve got the podium from the Olympic 1500m all competing,” says Johnson. “Josh Kerr, Yared Nuguse and Cole Hocker. And in Kingston we’ve also got the Olympic 800m gold medallist Emmanuel Wanyonyi and the world 800m champion Marco Arop. They will be mixing it up against each other in both the 800m and 1500m, with no pacemakers. And we’ve got 10 more groups just like that.“So the athletes don’t just win one race and they are grand slam track champion, they have got to win enough points across two races: one of which is their dominant race, and one of which is not.”The prizes are not to be sniffed at either: each winner this weekend will walk away with $100,000 (£75,800), with second taking $50,000 and even last place picking up $10,000.View image in fullscreenOlympic 1500m champion Cole Hocker will take on the two men he beat to the top of the Olympic podium, Josh Kerr and Yared Nuguse.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt is tempting to imagine Grand Slam Track being around in the era of Seb Coe, Steve Cram and Steve Ovett – and the excitement if they had regularly raced each other. “For years, track fans have been putting matchups together, saying this will be my fantasy race,” Johnson says. “We have brought the fantasy to life.”Last year, the 57-year-old was quoted as saying that he thought he could save track, which – to put it mildly – divided opinion. But he insists there was more context to that statement than reported.“Track doesn’t need saving,” he says. “Every four years at the Olympics, it’s great. Every four years it’s the most popular sport on the planet. Then it drops off, but even in between, over 155 million people every year watch at least two track meets and 325 million people watch one. We know there is excitement out there. It’s just been so fragmented. So the pitch is that if you watched the Olympics and enjoyed it, you will absolutely enjoy this.”Johnson rattles off more of the 48 star names who have signed up for all four meets, including the 400m hurdles world record-holder, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, and the Olympic 200m champion, Gabby Thomas. Another 48 athletes will also be parachuted in as “challengers” for one or more of the slams, including Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith, who is racing over 200m and 400m this weekend.All these names are great, I tell Johnson, but don’t the athletes also have to do more themselves to push rivalries and tell us what they really think? Perhaps surprisingly, Johnson doesn’t entirely agree.“We in this sport have asked far too much of the athletes,” he says. “We’ve asked them to basically do it alone. Because there hasn’t been a professional exclusive league for them, no matter what anybody else says. The media does it too. ‘You need to show more personality. You need to be more like Bolt. You need to do this. You need to do that.’“But by creating a professional league and a platform for them, the athletes just have to show up, race, talk from the heart and be authentically themselves. They don’t have to try to manufacture some sort of personality, because that persona is not real.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But not everyone is a believer. Sceptics point to the fact that the two biggest stars of the Netflix series Sprint, the Olympic 100m champion, Noah Lyles, and the women’s 100m world champion, Sha’Carri Richardson, have not signed up – which would have certainly helped attract more eyeballs in the crucial US market. There are also no field events. And filling stadiums in Miami, Philadelphia and Los Angeles across three successive days of competition will also be a hefty challenge.View image in fullscreenMichael Johnson: ‘If you watched the Olympics and enjoyed it, you will absolutely enjoy this.’Photograph: José Manuel Vidal/EPAHowever, it is one that Johnson clearly relishes. “We’re doing what every athlete and fan, along with Sebastian Coe, the head of WorldAthletics, has said the sport needs,” he says. “We need to grow the sport. We need athletes to make more money. We need better broadcast deals. We want head-to-head competition. So I am not going to over-focus on the few people that have said it’s not for me.”So what does success in the first year look like? “It’s about growing the brand, growing our fanbase, growing our attendance at our live events and growing engagement,” says Johnson. “But we’ve already done two of the most difficult parts of all this: getting 48 of the best in the world signed up to the league, and having broadcast distribution in 189 countries.”That includes the UK, where every round of the Grand Slam Track will be shown live on TNT Sports andDiscovery+, with the Kingston event starting at 11.30pm on Friday.Johnson also has a message to those who fear the $30m of investment in Grand Slam Track could run out before he is able to change the sport he loves for the better. “We’re in this for the long haul,” he says. “Startups aren’t profitable in year one. You know if anybody comes to you with a startup, saying: ‘Hey, we’re going to be profitable in year one,’ run away as fast as you can. But we will continue to grow.”In his book, Slaying the Dragon, Johnson talks about learning to love pressure. So how is he feeling on the eve of the big event? “There’s pressure, but there’s excitement right alongside it,” he insists, smiling. “We’re ready to finally get this thing started.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was bitter, it was undignified and, rather than an act of defiance, it is probably going to be remembered as the moment of high farce that finally broke Postecoglou’s relationship with Tottenham’s fans.Here was a man on the edge, the list of grievances piling high, the emotion impossible to contain as he watched his side somehow cancel out Chelsea’s 1-0 lead at Stamford Bridge. Postecoglou had heard the chants of “You don’t know what you’re doing” from the travelling supporters when he brought Pape Sarr on for Lucas Bergvall in the 64th minute. Now came vindication. On 66 minutes: a first shot on target. This was progress. Three minutes later, Sarr charging into midfield, knocked Moisés Caicedo over and unleashed a shot that went in thanks to more dreadful goalkeeping from Robert Sánchez.Fernández lifts Chelsea into top four as Tottenham fans turn on PostecoglouRead moreNobody seemed quite sure how to react. Spurs were lucky not to be 4-0 down, but now the entire feel of the evening had changed. Stunned, Chelsea pointed at Caicedo lying on the turf and complained to Craig Pawson about his decision to play on. Postecoglou, though, was not to know that the video assistant referee was about to get involved. Too wrapped up in his own redemptive arc, he did not anticipate that there was a strong chance that the goal was going to be chalked off.And so Postecoglou made his move. What was that, mate? I don’t know what I’m doing? The satisfaction was immense. Postecoglou could not stop himself. He looked left, gazing at the celebrations in the away end, and lifted his right hand to his ear. Spurs, at long last, had finally seen a cup. Postecoglou sarcastically waved at the critics. He had not counted on Pawson wandering over to the pitchside monitor to have a closer look at Sarr’s tackle. He had not imagined the moment would slip from his grasp so quickly.It did not take long to see that Sarr had caught Caicedo before making off with possession. There was no way the goal could stand. Postecoglou looked disbelieving but the reality was that his self-indulgence had backfired. Nobody was buying it when the Australian later insisted that he had only been trying to tell the away fans to make some noise.The situation looks almost impossible to salvage. Success in the Europa League could change everything but Spurs do not look like a team ready to win silverware. They are a clownish proposition under Postecoglou. Conviction is missing with and without the ball. The defence is a mess and there are no patterns in attack. Chelsea, who have lacked creativity in recent months, could have been out of sight inside the first 20 minutes.View image in fullscreenPape Sarr wins possession but fouls Moisés Caicedo in the process.Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty ImagesDoctor Tottenham will see you now. Chelsea needed their appointment with the Premier League’s most effective healing force. Enzo Maresca, another manager dealing with a fanbase teetering towards mutiny, relished the chance to divert from his patient approach and target Postecoglou’s inviting high line with a series of direct long balls. Nicolas Jackson, back from a two-month layoff, could have scored after speeding away from Cristian Romero inside a minute. The striker’s shot was saved and Micky van de Ven, sprinting back to help out, whacked the rebound against the woodwork.The tone was set. Malo Gusto shot just wide and Jackson continued to bully Romero. Spurs were frazzled, timid and uncoordinated. There was no composure. Guglielmo Vicario made a good save from Jadon Sancho, who produced an improved display on Chelsea’s left, but he also flapped at crosses and sent simple passes into touch. Djed Spence tripped over his own feet trying to dribble out from the back. Bergvall dozed off and lost Cole Palmer, who almost set up Enzo Fernández for a tap-in. Dominic Solanke waited forlornly for someone to pass to him. James Maddison drifted around, offering nothing. The wingers made no impact.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They had the incentive of reclaiming fourth place and reigniting their push for Champions League qualification. They still have flaws but this was better. Jackson’s movement made a difference up front and when the goal came, Fernández taking advantage of awful marking to head home early in the second half, there was joy for Maresca in seeing Palmer emerge from his slump to claim his first assist since December.Spurs were well beaten. This was their 16th defeat of a dreadful league campaign, heightening the sense that Postecoglou is on borrowed time. He hung around on the pitch when it was over but he did not dare go to the away end. The divisions are probably too big now. Faith in Angeball was already dwindling. The ear-cupping will do nothing to bring back the believers.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurAnge PostecoglouChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

But now he is part of the drama he so often comments onAndrew LawrenceThu 3 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 09.44 EDTShareWho would win in a fight between LeBron James and Stephen A Smithis a question only Stephen A Smith would think to ask. There has been little avoiding the question since the Los Angeles Lakers superstarconfronted ESPN’s No 1 personalityduring a recent game against the New York Knicks. The player was venting his displeasure at Smith for his pointed comments about James’s eldest son,and Lakers teammate, Bronny – the 55th pick in last year’s NBA draft.James approached Smith, a courtside spectator for the game, and appeared to tell him to “keep my son out of this shit” – a callback to Smith questioning whether Bronny deserved to be on a league roster. Smith went on TV the next day to make clear that he wasn’t actually picking on Bronny, the player; he wasreallycalling out LeBron as a bad father forsetting a high barfor his son’s pro career. Smith would come back to this point often while making the media rounds after signing a $100m ESPN extension. That should have been the end of the argument – but then last week LeBron sat down with Pat McAfee, whose show follows Smith’s on ESPN, and dismissed Smith as anice cream-bingeing, couch-bound fanboy.That set the stage last Thursday for Smith to makehis most unhinged ESPN appearanceyet. Among other things, he bashed James for skipping the hall of fame induction ceremony for his friend and former teammate Dwyane Wade and for skipping Kobe Bryant’s funeral – claims that were made in bad faith, as it turned out. Viewers were quick to remind Smith that James had indeed attended Bryant’s funeral, and had a pretty good excuse for missing Wade’s ceremony: Bronny had justsuffered a cardiac arrest. But the wildest shot by far was the 6ft 1in, 57-year-old Smith saying he “would have immediately swung on” James if the 6ft 9in, 250lb NBA forward had “put hands on me.” That was the moment when the sports world realized its narrator had made himself a main character – although Smith did at least have the good sense to admit he would have lost the fight.Smith definitely has main character energy; he’s the ESPN omniscient who struts into the arena dressed to the nines while cameras are rolling, just like the players, and criesblasphemy!at the ideas that offend his logic. For a minimum of two hours on weekdays, the native New Yorker can be seen offering up his singular brand of hysterically provocative opinions on ESPN’s morning show, First Take. That’s when he’s not serving up cultural takes on his podcast orentertaining a run for presidenton The Sean Hannity Show oracting on General Hospital. It’s enough to make you wonder if Smith ever sleeps or runs out of steam.I can’t knock Smith’s hustle. He has been starting arguments as far back as the late-1980s, when he was a scholarship basketball player at Winston-Salem State in North Carolina – a powerhouse historically Black College. Tim Grant, a longtime Winston-Salem hoops assistant, remembers dividing the team between two vans for one far-flung away game, and his boss – the legendary coach Clarence “Big House” Gaines – picking Smith to ride with him in the one that didn’t have a functioning radio. (“He’ll talk all the way to Memphis,” Gaines quipped.) While writing for the college paper, Smith called for Gaines – who trailed only Kentucky’s Adolph Rupp on the NCAA’s all-time wins list – to retire. “But then my dad helped him get his first gig at the Greensboro News & Record, a newspaper,” says Clarence Gaines Jr, a respected formerNBAscout. (Smith’s playing career was ultimately cut short by a freak knee injury.)Within six years Smith was on the Philadelphia 76ers beat covering Allen Iverson – a close relationship that set the stage for his rise. He broke through at ESPN in 2005 as a talkshow host and NBA analyst, only to wind up out of a job four years later when he and the network couldn’t agree on a new contract. He’d spend the next two years in TV wilderness – on CNN one minute weighing in on thegovernment intervention in Wall Street pay practices, on ABC the next playing a bit part as a fixer on America’s longest-running soap – before ESPN brought him back as a debate partner for Skip Bayless, another columnist who became a TV blowhard.With Bayless, Smith turned the network from a journalism paragon that once penalized on-air personalities for expressing their political views to the wanton clickbait farm where Smith now measures himself against McAfee – the ex-NFL punter turned$85mshow pony who has filled ESPN with frat house energy. Sadly, that includes amplifying dismal rumors abouta teenage college student. Still: even within the mad scramble of the sports media hunger games, there’s something surreal in seeing Smith – an NBA booster for a TV rights holder – get sucked into a slanging match with the biggest name in the sport. In response to Smith’s fighting words,James posted a clipof Smith creakily swinging at a boxing trainer’s padded hands.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.

(Some observers reckon the bad blood goes back to Smith spending years promoting Michael Jordan as the greatest basketball player of all time over James.) It also has James, the most media friendly superstar in sports since he entered the NBA in 2003, acting out of character. The egos in conflict here are unfathomably large. “I was here before he got here in 2003, and, in all likelihood I’m going to be here when he’s gone,” Smith said – as if James isn’t also a media mogul in his own right. It’s a weird flex coming from a soap opera actor, even if drama is the point.Sport feuds tend not to break out when the athlete and the media star are both at the top of the game. Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell never feuded publicly, but they did have plenty of on-air exchanges full of sharp words and good-natured banter – with Ali getting in the best jabs at Cosell’shairpieces and speaking cadence. And even when Cosell did buck up and say Ali was past his prime as the champ kept on fighting into his late-30s, most saw those blows for what they were: tough love.It used to be that if a sports journalist criticized an athlete on the record, they faced them afterward to accept the consequences – so give Smith some credit for making himself available for James’s broadside. He could have maintained the higher ground by acknowledgingtheaudacity(to borrow Smith’s words) of the most prominent Black man in media calling another Black man who grew up fatherless a bad dad for – checks notes – raising a son who somehow managed to beat the odds and achieve his own NBA dream. Instead, Smith tripled and quadrupled down.Besides, Bronny’s rookie struggles don’t mean he doesn’t belong in the NBA – players often take a while to find their feet. Reed Sheppard and Tidjane Salaun, who went No 3 and No 6 overall in last year’s draft, have spent time in the G-League alongside Bronny, and Smith hasn’t spent significant airtime interrogating their pro prospects. No, LeBron hooking up his kid with his job isn’t the best argument for fair play – even though LeBron has pulled that move before with his high school teammates togangbusters effect. But the second round of the draft is kind of a crapshoot anyway. The Lakers could’ve done worse than pick Bronny over a similar caliber player who hasn’t been in their orbit for the past six years. Andafter Bronny’s furious run to close the G-league season, who can’t say the Lakers were justified in taking the flyer?There’s a saying in journalism: never become the story. By beefing with James, Smith shows why his opinions shouldn’t be regarded as anything more than an exercise in making television. The longer he runs his yap, the more he ruins the games by making them all about him. Sports discourse overall is poorer for it.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballLeBron JamesESPNUS sportsUS television industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And a 2022 injury that led to a redshirt year gave Bueckers yet another season. While many speculate she stayed for lucrative NIL deals –estimated at around $1.5m this season– Bueckers insists her decision is rooted in loyalty to UConn, her teammates, and her coaches. “Family camaraderie, loving it here, loving my teammates, and loving my coaches,” she says.Extended collegiate careers have become common at UConn, with Aubrey Griffin using six years and Caroline Ducharme and Azzi Fudd taking a fifth. Still, one member of the UConn coaching staff told the Guardian that injuries rather than NIL orWNBAreadiness have been behind these decisions.Why hasn’t middle America given Paige Bueckers the Caitlin Clark treatment?Read moreBueckers addressed the issue during an appearance on Sue Bird’s Togethxr virtual panel, pushing back against the assumption that NIL money is the driving force behind her fifth year. “You just look at the comments, and it’s like, ‘Yeah, she’s just staying in college because she’s gonna make so much more [money] in college than in the WNBA [where the rookie maximum salary is $78,000],’” she said. “And it’s like, you guys have no idea. You’re making NIL in college, and once you get to the WNBA, those endorsements are going to follow you on top of the salary you’re already making. It’s not that hard to educate yourself.”Still, Bueckers’ decision led to a debate. Some on social media criticized the age gap between the 23-year-old UConn star and many of her competitors, with one X user saying, “Paige Bueckers is an adult about to be playing basketball with 18-year-olds.” While staying an extra year is becoming more normalized, the conversation around extended eligibility, and the narratives attached to it, show no signs of fading.Hailey Van Lith, a fifth-year senior at TCU, has faced similar scrutiny. She pushed back on the criticism in a recent news conference. “It’s just the new norm, it’s just what’s going to happen now. It’s funny to see people react and think about it negatively, but when you really analyze it, a lot of it comes down to frustration that they didn’t have that opportunity … I’m not gonna allow people to make me feel bad because I was blessed with this opportunity to play five years.”And she’s not wrong, this opportunity may be a “blessing” for players. The combination of NIL opportunities, academic advancement, and the ability to improve draft stock has created an undeniable shift in women’s college basketball. As Kentucky guard Georgia Amoore says, “I think everyone had their own reasons [for staying in college for five years] and I’ve seen a variety of them, but mine was primarily for more development [before playing in the WNBA].”Despite the noise, Van Lith remains firm. “I think people are only saying that about me because I’m one of the ones they’re paying a lot of attention to. There’s a lot of girls taking their fifth years, and there’s a lot of girls having a lot of success [like] I’m having that are taking their fifth years.”And the numbers back her up. As of March 2025, just seven days after the transfer portal opened, more than 1,100 Division I female college basketball players have entered it, with a significant number being seniors. Among them is a surprising fifth-year transfer from Notre Dame’s star player Olivia Miles,who had been the projected No 2 pickin the draft.This heightened focus on women’s college basketball, marked by repeated years and mass transfers, is not incidental. It represents a departure from the traditional structure of college ball. By comparison, in men’s basketball, where players can declare for the NBA after just one year, programs are increasingly urging male athletes to stay longer.But there are far more reasons for male athletes to hurry into the NBA than there are for female athletes to join the WNBA. For a start there are more opportunities. In the NBA, 60 draft picks are distributed across 30 teams. The WNBA has just 39 picks spread among 13 teams. And while the rookie minimum in the NBA is a little over $1m, in the WNBA it’s less than $80,000. It’s true that theWNBA’s popularity and revenue is growingthanks to the influx of stars such as Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese but NBA commissioner Adam Silver hasacknowledged the WNBA’s financial struggles, saying in a 2024 statement, “This season, the [league] will lose $40m.”With the WNBA’s low salaries as well as its limited practice facilities and player amenities, there’s a significant incentive for athletes to extend their college careers, holding out to see if the league expands further before they go pro. And with only 39 draft spots available each season and a surplus of NCAA women’s basketball seniors competing for them, staying an extra year to improve one’s draft stock isn’t just a trend. It’s a strategic decision.Also, the WNBA is set to negotiate a newCollective Bargaining Agreementdue to the league’srising value. According to WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike, this agreement will bring significant change, including franchise expansion –with the addition of two new teams– an increased salary cap, improved working conditions, additional player benefits, and, most importantly, a share in WNBA equity for players. For seniors considering a fifth year, this presents an incentive. By staying an extra season, they can not only secure larger and more lucrative NIL deals in the short term but also enter the 2026 draft under a more favorable financial arrangement, ultimately earning a higher salary than if they declared this year.For some players, the decision isn’t as calculated, it could be just about wanting to win an NCAA championship. Amoore echoed this sentiment. “I’ve trusted Coach Brooks for four years, and he’s put me in positions to succeed,” she said last month. “So, with his move [from Virginia Tech to Kentucky] and the challenge of competing in that talented conference with a brand-new team, it was a massive jump I was willing to take.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fudd, known for her indecisiveness, made that clear well before the declaration window, “I’ll see about a fifth year,” she said.UConn head coach Geno Auriemma even gave her an ultimatum, demanding an answer within 48 hours of the Big East Tournament.“I think she will [come back]. I think Azzi will [return],” Auriemma said. “But again, I’m not the number one voice in her ear anymore, like I used to be. Now, there’s a lot of voices.”One of those voices was returning senior Ducharme. “Every once in a while, I’d be like, ‘So, any closer to deciding?’” Ducharme told theHartford Courant. “One day, I just asked her when we were in the tubs, and she was like, ‘Don’t tell anyone, but I did make the decision.’”Just two weeks later, Fudd took toInstagramto post a photo of her smiling gleefully at the UConn scoreboard: 101 points to Arkansas State’s 31 points, a game in which she had scored 27 points. She captioned the photo, “Hey Gampel, thanks for last night… See you next year🤗😝😏 #onemoreyear.”Fudd, like many others, would be returning for a fifth year.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsBasketballUS sportsWNBAfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In exchange, PIF would invest $1.5bn in PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial entity created after peace appeared to have broken out in summer 2023. The $1.5bn has been planned to match identical investment from the US-based Strategic Sports Group.Reopening of Trump-owned golf course delayed after damage by pro-Palestine groupRead moreThe PGA Tour replied to PIF’s demands on Monday, with neither deemed acceptable. Those with detailed knowledge of the situation stress reunification of golf is the PGA Tour’s core aim, a matter that is hardly assisted by LIV continuing in its present form. There would also be understandable unease within the PGA Tour should Rumayyan, whose organisation has bankrolled LIV, be afforded such a prominent position as the breakaway tour continues on its own path.Donald Trump, the US president,wants golf to come togetherbut if PIF sticks to its present standpoint, that feels highly unlikely. Trump is likely to appear at his Doral resort this week where LIV is staging a tournament.Last week’s correspondence between PIF and the PGA Tour is understood to have been the first since a fraught meeting at the White House in late February. There, Rumayyan is known to have made it clear he believed LIV had not been respected by the traditional ecosystem.A dozen players who perform under the LIV banner will tee up at the Masters next Thursday. Phil Mickelson, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson and others departed the PGA Tour for LIV amid significant rancour. Rumayyan clearly retains deep personal faith in LIV. It is also obvious these talks cannot continue indefinitely. The PGA Tour, meanwhile, declined to comment on the recent correspondence.Speaking early last month Rory McIlroy, a member of the PGA Tour’s transaction committee, appeared to make pointed reference to PIF’s role in negotiations. “It takes two to tango,”said the Northern Irishman. McIlroy also made clear a deal was no longer essential for the PGA Tour.Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, also used the recent Florida swing to highlight his organisation’s strength in respect of commercial pull, audience figures and engagement. Intriguingly, Monahan revealed the PGA Tour had polled their audience on reunification with 70% in favour. At the Players Championship Monahan said: “We believe there’s room to integrate important aspects of LIVGolfinto the PGA Tour platform.” Monahan’s tone implied a pendulum had swung back in his favour.Scott O’Neil, the recently appointed LIV chief executive, is expected to visit Augusta National forthe Masters. Speaking at Doral he said: “Do we have to do a deal? No. It would be nice to do a deal, so long as we’re all focused on the same things.” He is not directly involved in these negotiations. The next key test of LIV’s strength will arrive with contract renewals due for players who left the PGA Tour, originally for guaranteed payments worth hundreds of millions of dollars.PIF has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsGolfPGA TourLIV Golf SeriesUS sportsSaudi Arabia and sportnewsShareReuse this content"

When carboxyhemoglobin saturation exceeds 50%, it is considered lethal. In Gardner’s case, the test showed a saturation of 64%.“It’s important to note that adjacent to this room is a dedicated machine room, where it’s believed there may be some type of contamination toward these rooms,” Zúñiga said. He added that, during the autopsy, a “layer” was detected on the boy’s organs, which forms when there is a high presence of the poisonous gas.Gardner died on 21 Marchwhile staying with his family at a hotel on the Manuel Antonio beach on Costa Rica’s Pacific coast.Asphyxiation was initially thought to have caused his death. After an autopsy that theory was ruled out. Another line of investigation centered on whether the family had suffered food poisoning. Family members had reported feeling ill after dining at a nearby restaurant the night before the teenager’s death and received treatment from the hotel doctor.Brett Gardner, 41, was drafted by the Yankees in 2005 and spent his entire major league career with the organization until her retired in 2021. He was a popular figure with fans and teammates during his long career with the club.“Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile,” Brett Gardner and his wife, Jessica, said in a statement after their son’s death. “He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.”The Yankees said the organization was “filled with grief”.“Words feel insignificant and insufficient in trying to describe such an unimaginable loss,” a statement from the team said. “It wasn’t just Brett who literally grew up in this organization for more than 17 years – so did his wife, Jessica, and their two boys, Hunter and Miller.”Explore more on these topicsNew York YankeesMLBBaseballUS sportsCosta RicanewsShareReuse this content"

In the immediate aftermath the former driver Giedo van der Garde described Red Bull’s treatment of the 23-year-old as “closer to bullying or a panic move” and that they “gave Liam two races only to crush his spirit” in a post on Instagram, which was liked by Verstappen.Red Bull need to adapt fast and that is why they axed Liam Lawson | Giles RichardsRead moreSpeaking in the buildup to this weekend’s Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, the world champion was explicit that he concurred with Van der Garde’s opinion. “Well, I liked the comment, the text, so I guess that speaks for itself; it [the like] was not a mistake,” he said.Verstappen would not elaborate on his opinion but he made it clear with a terse finality that suggested he had stated his position, and apparent displeasure regarding the Lawson decision and the status of their car – which is off the pace and sorely lacking in balance – with the leadership atRed Bull.“My reaction was shared with the team,” he said. “But in general about not only the swap; about everything. We discussed that during last weekend back at the factory. Everything has been shared with the team, how I think about everything. Sometimes it’s not necessary to always share everything in public.”Lewis Hamilton noted that he was not surprised by Red Bull’s actions and described dropping Lawson after such a short time as “pretty harsh”.Red Bull were insistent the decision to switch the two drivers had been agreed across the team management and their Austrian corporate owners, and with the team’s motorsport adviser, Helmut Marko, who oversees the development and deployment of young drivers. It had been an abrupt volte-face after the more experienced Tsunoda had been passed over in favour of Lawson, who had completed 11 F1 races, at the end of last season. Tsunoda described being snubbed after the decision to get rid of Sergio Pérez as brutally hard.Marko had spoken extensively this week about the rationale behind the team’s decision. However, that there might not quite be such equanimity behind the scenes was further indicated in Japan, when Tsunoda said he found it odd Marko had not contacted him at all since he was promoted.View image in fullscreenYuki Tsunoda says he is not feeling the pressure of driving alongside Max Verstappen at his home GP in Japan.Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images“Surprisingly, he didn’t call me yet, very unusual,” he said. “Not sure [why], maybe he was busy with other things. It’s very unusual. From F3, F2, F1, he’s always been calling me. But this is the only time he didn’t. I’m sure there’s not anything from his side.

Verstappen admitted in Japan there were a host of issues with it including that it was nervous and unstable.“We are focusing on making the car more drivable,” he said. “I don’t think we are there yet but we are working on it. Last week we had good meetings in the factory with everyone involved to try and address the things we want to address in the car. Find more balance and of course, at the end, more pace in the car.”Tsunoda, however, is approaching his Red Bull debut with a cool head and believes he will be given a proper chance to adapt to the new team and car. “I didn’t get any specific races or time that I have to prove myself,” he said. “Pressure will always come once you hit the track. For now, really relaxing somehow, it feels similar to when I was at Racing Bulls, when I enter hospitality I was only thinking about breakfast.“Christian Horner wants me to be as close to Max as possible and support him in the race. Their main priority is Max, which I understand because he is a four-time world champion.”Explore more on these topicsRed BullMax VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Ange Postecoglou, the remorselessly under-fire Tottenham manager, had been barracked by his own supporters when he replaced Lucas Bergvall with Pape Sarr in the 64th minute. Like every other Spurs player, Bergvall had struggled to impose himself but the fans do like him.“You don’t know what you’re doing,” they informed Postecoglou. So just imagine how the fiercely proud Australian must have felt shortly afterwards when Sarr won the ball off Moisés Caicedo and unloaded a low shot from distance, which theChelseagoalkeeper, Robert Sánchez, inexplicably allowed to beat him.Chelsea v Tottenham: Premier League – liveRead moreWell, we would not need to imagine because Postecoglou showed us. In full view of the press box behind him, he turned to face the Spurs fans, who were lost in celebration, and cupped his ear in their direction before standing and staring at them.In the moment it was impossible to believe this was anything other than hostility from Postecoglou boiling over. There have been flashpoints before between him and the supporters. Remember the scenes after the defeat at Bournemouth in December? Postecoglou’s attempt to backtrack in his post-match interviews, claiming he merely wanted to revel in the celebrations, to hear the cheers, was bizarre to say the least. The ear-cup is not open to interpretation.There would be a twist when the VAR, Jarred Gillett, went over the Sarr challenge on Caicedo and he did not need to look too long to see the foul, although he still took about six minutes. Sarr had kicked Caicedo’s knee. The goal was disallowed. Sarr was booked. Postecoglou raged inside.Chelsea had been in complete control up until the Bergvall/Sarr change, leading through Enzo Fernández’s header, the only wonder being how they were not further ahead. Guglielmo Vicario made a sensational save to deny Jadon Sancho. The outstanding Caicedo saw a goal chalked off by the VAR. Spurs had failed to do the very basics, pretty much all of them, beginning with carrying some sort of fight.View image in fullscreenEnzo Fernández heads Chelsea in front early in the second half.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesThe weird thing was that as passions raged and the game broke up, Spurs fashioned something of a revival. They got onto the front foot and it was possible to feel a few nerves among the Chelsea support. Enzo Maresca’s team would be indebted to Sánchez for a fine save from Son Heung-min just before the board went up to show 12 additional minutes.It was difficult in the extreme though to make the case for Spurs. The rally could not obscure the fault-lines and this was a game for which Postecoglou had all of his main players available – apart from the injured Dejan Kulusevski. For the manager, it was four of the most unwanted kind, a fourth defeat out of four against Chelsea across two seasons. And, to extend the poker analogy, it was easy to wonder whether we were looking at a busted flush.When it was all over, Postecoglou deliberately avoided following his players over to the end that housed the travelling fans. There was no applause from him towards them. In the build-up to the game Postecoglou had admitted there was “maybe a large portion of Tottenham fans who have lost a bit of faith and belief in what we’re doing.” There was little to redress the balance.Maresca’s sights are on a Champions League finish. Beforehand he had said that six more wins would suffice. This was No 1, something to fire momentum for the challenges ahead. Postecoglou, meanwhile, can see the season and probably his future resting on the Europa League, in which his team face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals. This was a tune-up that fell flat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionMaresca had restored Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson to the starting line-up and the latter was a handful. He almost got in with less than a minute gone, bursting between Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven to prod goalwards. Vicario half-blocked and when Van de Ven’s panicked clearance hit Jackson, the ball ricocheted against a post and away.Chelsea were in the mood from the outset, pushing high, dominating the duels. Spurs struggled to get out. Postecoglou felt the frustration bubble. He delivered a rollicking to Bergvall in the 20th minute after the midfielder failed to track a run into the area by Palmer, who crossed low. Destiny Udogie made a saving challenge on Fernández in front of goal.Chelsea were able to find spaces in between the lines, to work their passing patterns whereas Spurs were tentative on the ball, gripped by anxiety. Time and again they misplaced passes. Son fired in a low shot from a tight angle, which Sánchez shovelled away but that was it from them as an attacking force in the first half.It was frustrating for Chelsea that they could not take a lead into the interval. Malo Gusto had rifled into the side-netting on eight minutes and there was the staggeringly good Vicario reflex save from Sancho’s close-range blast in stoppage-time.Chelsea continued to dominate after the restart, Palmer working Vicario and then crossing for Fernández to head home. Spurs’s defensive structure had broken down. Fernández was unmarked. Spurs caught a break when Caicedo fizzed home a volley after the visitors had half-cleared a set piece only for the VAR to rule that Levi Colwill was offside in the middle. After Van de Ven had gone close at the other end, the next VAR intervention would shape the story.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueChelseaTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Her clubmate, the England captain Williamson, praised Russo’s character, saying at St George’s Park on Thursday: “Everyone will always say how nice a person Alessia is and everyone wants to see her do well for that reason. But to be a No 9 you do have to have that sort of – not arrogance – but confidence about you.“We all want to see Alessia playing the way she is and I hope she carries that on because she deserves it as a human and works hard for it. We know what a talent she is. When she is scoring goals, she is getting confidence and is giving back to the team.”Mary Earps on life at PSG: ‘There was a lot of noise so it’s been nice to escape’Read moreThe England head coach, Sarina Wiegman, also recognised the form of Russo, Williamson and several other members of the squad after two English sides reached the Champions League semi-finals. Asked about Russo she said: “What we have seen since the last camp is there have been many competitive games. It has been really enjoyable to watch and you saw the level went up again. There have been big challenges with games involving many England players so that was really good to see. You could see a lot of players grew in confidence and are in a good place.”Wiegman revealed that both the Brighton forward Fran Kirby and the Arsenal winger Chloe Kelly will miss the first Belgium match with “little niggles”, although she was hopeful they might be back for Tuesday’s game in Leuven.“It’s really disappointing for them because they are in a very good place,” ­Wiegman said. “It’s disappointing for the team.”Kirby was seen training individually on Thursday while Kelly was the only squad member not on the pitch. England remain without longer-term absentees including Alex Greenwood, Lauren Hemp and Georgia Stanway, so the biggest selection headache for Wiegman is in goal, and a choicebetween Hannah Hampton and Mary Earps.England are joint top of their Nations League group with four points from two games, alongside Portugal, after the Lionesses’1-0 win over the world champions Spainat Wembley in February. They know two victories against a Belgium side ranked 20th in the world would probably put them in a commanding position in the group, but Wiegman will also be conscious that England lost their most recent meeting with ­Belgium,away in October 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said that in 2021, South Yorkshire police and West Midlands police, which was brought in after the disaster to investigate, agreed a settlement with families and survivors formisfeasance in a public office, based on a claim that the forces perpetrated a cover-up.“It feels like a cover-up of a cover-up,” Brookes said.In a letter notifying bereaved families of its findings, the IOPC did find Duckenfield and three other senior officers culpable of gross misconduct for failures at the semi-final. Duckenfield was also found to have committed gross misconduct for the lie he told at 3.15pm as people were dying, falsely telling his senior officer, the assistant chief constable Walter Jackson, and football officials thatLiverpoolsupporters had forced open an exit gate.In fact Duckenfield had himself ordered the gate to be opened, to relieve a crush outside the Leppings Lane end turnstiles. After an independent police investigation for the IOPC termed Operation Resolve, 11 separate elements of gross misconduct by Duckenfield were found, including for ordering the opening of the gate, and failing to safely direct the people who came through it.Duckenfield did not order the closure of a tunnel leading to crowded central “pens” on the terrace, and the lethal crush developed after people who came through the exit gate went into those pens, rather than to the sides.Jackson was found culpable of gross misconduct for failures of planning and his response to the disaster; the former superintendent Roger Marshall for crowd management outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles and for asking Duckenfield to open the exit gate; and gross misconduct was also found by the former superintendent Bernard Murray, Duckenfield’s second-in-command in the police control room.Duckenfield was prosecuted for gross negligence manslaughter after the inquest verdict;he was acquitted in 2019.The IOPC said in the letter it had found no case to answer against any senior South Yorkshire police officers who were investigated for whether they gave inaccurate, false or deliberately misleading evidence or “irrelevant criticism of fans’ behaviour” after the disaster.Senior officers were also cleared over the instruction given to officers not to write their accounts of the day in their official police notebooks, and a subsequent process of amending the accounts made by officers. One officer, the former detective chief inspector Alan Foster, was found culpable of gross misconduct, after an investigation into whether senior officers put “undue pressure” on some other officers who refused to make alterations to their original accounts.A complaint was upheld against one officer on duty in the control box, the former constable Trevor Bichard. He was found to have deleted from the evidence provided to the 1989 inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor a log entry which recorded that at 2.55pm an officer had requested the tunnel leading to the central pens be closed. Mervyn Jones, the then assistant chief constable ofWest Midlandspolice, was also found culpable of gross misconduct for instructing the deletion of “policy files”, and retaining policy books “in his personal possession” after he retired.No officers will face misconduct proceedings,the IOPC has previously said, because they have all retired. The findings against officers, which include dozens more individual complaints currently being notified to families, are opinions of the IOPC.The IOPC has explained of its findings: “Like the [2012] Hillsborough Independent Panel report and the inquests, we found no evidence to support police accounts to the media, the Taylor inquiry and both sets of inquests, which suggested that the behaviour of supporters caused or in any way contributed to the disaster.”However, in a letter to families last month, the watchdog said that while South Yorkshire police did seek to “deflect the blame from themselves”, with no duty of candour required the force “was entitled, within the law at the time, to present its ‘best case’ and be selective with the evidence it presented”.At Labour’s conference in Liverpool in September, Keir Starmer promised to introduce the Hillsborough law by this month’s 36th anniversary of the disaster, but the deadline will be missed, as families have argued that the proposals do not deliver the required duty of candour. Starmer cancelled a visit to Liverpool last week where he was due to announce the new law to families.Charlotte Hennessy, who was six when her father, Jimmy, 29, was unlawfully killed at Hillsborough, said she was “frustrated and very disappointed” after learning of the delay.“In my opinion, the prime minister has used the deaths of the 97, their anniversary and the Hillsborough law, to gain himself votes,” she said. “There just seems to be this continual pattern, where he says things and then he takes them back. And to do that on the back of a Hillsborough anniversary – I’m appalled by it.”Starmer’s spokesperson said: “We remain fully committed to bringing in a Hillsborough law, which will include a legal duty of candour for public servants and criminal sanctions for those who refuse to comply. We’re working on the bill at pace, and we’ll set out next steps shortly.”Explore more on these topicsHillsborough disasterLiverpoolIndependent Office for Police ConductSouth YorkshireWest MidlandsPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

The Football Association expects Wembley to host the final, although Fifa will have ultimate signoff. United’s planned new home, which is mooted to have a capacity of 100,000, may also play a focal part if the venue has been completed according to projections.The FA’s CEO, Mark Bullingham, confirmed United would be consulted to ascertain whether their stadium can be included in November’s formal bid submission. “We’re going to have conversations with them and work out if they can be part of it or not,” he said.“We’ve got a number of different stadia being built in the country, potentially Man United, potentially Birmingham, and with a 10-year horizon you’ve got to work out exactly where you’ll be then. There will be lots of conversations to be had, understanding timescales for stadium builds, understanding what people want and knitting that together.”Bullingham was speaking on the sidelines of Uefa’s annual congress in Belgrade, where Infantino’s morning announcement to delegates stole the show from European football’s governing body. Infantino also said Fifa intended to expand the Women’s World Cup to 48 teams, mirroring the new look of the men’s competition, from 2031; Bullingham said the UK would be ready to accommodate an event of such sprawling scale.“We’re really well set up for that,” he said. “You’ve then got to have 16 stadiums. We’d be happy either way, but we’d be really comfortable with 48 teams. It just creates more impact across the whole country.”Cardiff’s Principality Stadium would be expected to host games, while the redevelopment of Wrexham’s Racecourse Ground is likely to make that a viable venue. Hampden Park is the obvious candidate to lead Scotland’s part of the bid and Bullingham said the job of increasing Belfast’s Windsor Park, which holds 18,500, to the necessary 20,000 capacity could be “easily achieved”.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The smooth path to host status is a boost to the FA, which had been uncertain over the status of a potential rival bid from Spain, Portugal and Morocco. The deadline for expressions of interest passed on Monday but it was only early on Thursday that Fifa clarified the state of play. Infantino also named the US, probably alongside other Concacaf members, as the only candidate for the 2031 edition. Concacaf covers North and Central America, along with the Caribbean.England successfully held the Women’s European Championship, which Sarina Wiegman’s team won, in 2022. It was unsuccessful in bids to host the 2006 and 2018 men’s World Cups, losing out to Germany and Russia respectively. The men’s European Championship in 2028, which will be hosted across the UKand the Republic of Ireland, may be helpful for the 2035 showpiece.Wiegman, who has been preparing her side for Friday’s match against Belgium, was among those to hail the announcement. “Of course it’s really good news and it will be great if the tournament is held here,” she said. “We know from the experience of the Euros how big the game is already here and what that momentum did in this country and also worldwide. It is the biggest female event we have in the world. It is so exciting.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think 2022 was a great demonstration of that intent.”The bid has full government backing and Keir Starmer highlighted its potential transformative effect. “Today’s fantastic news is a huge step forward towards the UK hosting the World Cup once again, all while boosting growth and prosperity,” the prime minister said. “Our daughters could be those on the pitch in 2035, playing football for our country. And the economic benefits that come alongside hosting a major tournament like this cannot be overstated.”The UK’s bid must be ratified at Fifa’s congress in 2026. Government guarantees around tax issues and security are required to be provided to Fifa by the end of this month.Explore more on these topicsWomen's World CupWomen's footballFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But Ceferin left no doubt it would not have Uefa’s backing and was evidently unimpressed by its unexpected emergence.“This proposal that was made was even more surprising than it was for you,” he said after Uefa’s annual congress concluded in Belgrade. “I think it’s not a good idea for the World Cup itself, and it’s not a good idea for our qualifiers as well. So I’m not supporting that idea. I don’t know where it came from, but it’s strange that we didn’t know anything before this proposal at theFifacouncil.”Uefa will be sending 16 teams to the 2026 World Cup when it adopts a 48-team format for the first time. That number would grow again in the event of a 64-team competition but there is little appetite within the organisation for a vastly watered-down qualifying tournament.The 2030 edition will be held in Spain, Portugal and Morocco with one-off matches in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay. It is the next World Cup in which Russia could potentially participate, pending a peaceful resolution to the country’s war in Ukraine. Ceferin held his usual line when the subject of their reintegration, a live topic in sport’s corridors of power, was raised.“When the war stops, they will be readmitted,” he said. “The first decision [to ban Russia] was done together with Fifa. And as much as we discussed with Fifa, I think we will do it together when we do it.”View image in fullscreenUefa president Aleksander Ceferin speaks during a press conference after the 49th Uefa Congress on Thursday.Photograph: Predrag Milosavljevic/AFP/Getty ImagesCeferin’s counterpart at Fifa, Gianni Infantino, had earlier expressed a wish to see Russia compete when the conditions are right. Infantino addressed the congress and nodded to the example of Yugoslavia’s disqualification from the 1992 European Championship when expressing a wish for Russia to play again. Yugoslavia were ejected after war led to the country’s disintegration; Russia have been banned from Fifa and Uefa events since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago.“We have always to use sport, and football in particular, to bring people together,” Infantino said. “In our world, which is divided, we need to use every opportunity to make sure people speak to each other. As talks are going on for peace in Ukraine I hope we can soon move to the next stage and bring back, as well, Russia to the football landscape because this would mean everything is solved. That’s what we have to cheer for, to pray for.”Ceferin was significantly less strident when asked to describe the difference between Uefa’s treatment of Russia and Israel. The latter’s teams continue to play in international competitions despite widespread calls to bar them amid the war in Gaza. “If you speak about football, you can see the rankings,” he said. “If you speak about politics, don’t ask me.”In what could be interpreted as another jab at Fifa and Infantino, Ceferin pointed to the added workload some players will experience at this summer’s controversial Club World Cup. “The Club World Cup is happening, and that’s it,” he said. “The clubs from Europe wanted it and I don’t see this as competition to our competition. It will be more matches for some of the players, but maybe that’s more of a question for my dear colleague Gianni Infantino.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are suggestions that some of Uefa’s federations would back him if he decided to run for an unprecedented fourth term and he did not quash the idea this time.“Let’s speak about today’s congress now,” he said. “I’ve heard many things, you’ve heard many things, but it’s not a good time to speak about it.”In a series of votes to fill vacant spots on Uefa’s executive committee, Andriy Shevchenko was the most high-profile candidate to fall by the wayside. The president of Ukraine’s football association had run for one of two available two-year terms but his 15 votes were not enough to secure a seat at the table. Israel’s Moshe Zuares was more successful, amassing 31 votes and being elected along with the Spaniard Rafael Louzán Abal.Overnight a spate of graffiti had appeared outside Sava Centar, the venue for the congress, protesting against Israel’s continued activity within Uefa and its tournaments.Explore more on these topicsUefaWorld CupFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Arne Slot welcomed the move on Thursday after Tarkowski was only cautioned for a reckless ­challenge on Alexis Mac Allister.The referee, Sam Barrott, gave Tarkowski a yellow card and David Moyesconceded his defender was fortunateto stay on the pitch. PGMOL believes the video assistant referee, Paul Tierney, should have ­recommended a review.It’s unfair to blame Liverpool for being the best team: that’s how you win titles | Barney RonayRead moreThere was a VAR check but ­Tierney decided no further action was ­necessary because he felt the ­referee’s call was not a clear and obvious error. PGMOL notes that Tarkowski initially played the ball but deems that his follow-through on Mac Allister met the threshold for serious foul play, and therefore was worthy of a red card. Howard Webb, the head of PGMOL, has contactedLiverpoolto admit the latest high-profile error involving VAR.Slot, speaking at his press ­conference to preview ­Sunday’s visit to Fulham, welcomed PGMOL’s response on Thursday and said ­refereeing ­standards had been ­adequate in the Premier League this season.“It is always good if they think they made a mistake that they ­acknowledge that,” said Slot. “We all know mistakes are being made in a football match, by us, by me, by ­referees. It is good that they ­acknowledged the mistake, but it was so clear. There were so many pundits that are not Liverpool fans who were clear on it as well.“We are all aiming for a league without mistakes. I am aiming for a season without me making one mistake in my lineups. But unfortunately, this will probably never happen. Not with me and not with refereeing decisions. I follow the Dutch league and there is so, so, so, so much criticism of the referees over there and it is something that is inside this world. If there is a possibility to be negative, eight out of 10 people want to be negative. So if a referee makes a wrong decision, everyone will fall over it.“I think it is quite an OK season for the referees in England actually. ­Mistakes are being made, but the most important thing is that it doesn’t influence the league table and that will be seen at the end of the season.”Moyes, theEvertonmanager, said: “We could have been lucky we didn’t get a red.

The government body ruled that the joint league-federation commission that had announced that the players could not be registered lacks the jurisdiction to rule on their case and that they had incorrectly denied the players a licence,thus “annulling the RFEF-Liga agreement”. Olmo and Víctor faced having their registration removed with immediate effect, but can now continue until 30 June, after which Barcelona will again have to meet financial fair play limits to register them for next season.Barcelona’s ability to register them in the next window was, though, again cast in doubt on Wednesday when the league alleged that, contrary to what had been believed in January, Barcelona have not reached what is known as 1:1 where a club operates normally, spending a euro for every euro of income. The league said that the income from a €100m deal from two unnamed investors to buy VIP boxes at the new Camp Nou, which allowed them meet the threshold in January, does not now appear in the club’s profit and loss statement.With time running out Barcelona had employed unnamed auditors on 31 December– on Thursday reported by Cadena Ser to be a Catalan company called Abauding – which provided the certificate that accredited the income. That firm took over from the previous auditors Grant Thornton and was then replaced by Crowe Auditores. Crowe prepared the club’s accounts that were delivered to the league after the close of the transfer window. According to the league, those audited accounts do not now include the €100m deal.View image in fullscreenThe Camp Nou site in August 2023.

It also said it had asked the CSD to investigate fully and that it would report the auditors who certified that income to the Institute of Accounting and Accounts Auditing (ICAC). The Barcelona president, Joan Laporta, claimed that the league’s announcement was part of a campaign against his club. “That they come out with controversies like this is not chance,” he said. “It’s another attempt to destabilise us.”La Liga announced on 31 December that Barcelona had missed the deadline to comply with financial controls. Still over their €426m salary limit, that meant that the temporary registrations given to Olmo and Víctor in August ran out and the pair were removed from the squad.Barcelona said that a late €100m deal to sell VIP boxes at the new Camp Nou to Middle Eastern investors had been completed. The club’s vice-president Elena Fort said she did not know who the two companies were that had bought the package. Laporta subsequently said there was one Qatari company and another from Saudi Arabia but he did not name them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Federation (RFEF) rules prevent a club registering a player twice in one season, denying them the opportunity to effectively re-sign the two players. A statement from the Comisión de Seguimiento del Convenio de Coordinación RFEF-LaLiga, the body that oversees the relationship between the league and federation, then announced that they could not be included in the squad.Barcelona had previously failed in two legal challenges raised against the ruling but succeeded in convincing the CSD to apply acautelar, essentially an injunction suspending the decision pending an investigation. The CSD said then that it did so in order to avoid irreparable damage to the players and to Spanish football. Barcelona provided a 60-page document defending the players’ right to work and alleging that the Commission does not have the competence to rule in this case. On Thursday the CSD upheld that argument, rejecting La Liga and the RFEF’s argument that the Commission had only communicated decisions made by the relevant bodies at both institutions.The CSD insisted that its ruling did not bring into question the legitimacy of the salary limit rules at La Liga, although some clubs are concerned that the structure may now have been severely undermined. Nor did the ruling make any mention of the €100m payment that La Liga is now questioning; those are effectively two different, if related issues. Barcelona have not responded formally to La Liga’s statement.Explore more on these topicsBarcelonaLa LigaEuropean club footballFinancesShareReuse this content"

As we approach the run-in of a Premier League campaign where anything resembling jeopardy is at a premium, Ivan Juric’s side are clawing their way towards the holy grail that is Not Being As Terrible As2007-08 Era Derby County. Managed at first by Billy Davies and then Paul Jewell, the Rams of that particular campaign were consigned to the Championship and the history books as the worst team in Premier League history, infamously acquiring just 11 points over the course of a season. And while it is probably unfair to single out the likes of Robbie Savage, Danny Mills and Kenny Miller for their roles in securing this unwanted record, a special shout-out should almost certainly go to pub-quiz staples, Newcastle United, the only team to get beaten by the worst top-flight rabble ever assembled.Having already amassed 100% more wins than that Derby omnishambles and avoided the ignominy of being relegated before April, Southampton could perhaps argue they are not quite as bad but they still need two more points before they can book the celebratory open-top bus parade through Hampshire. And with eight games to go and an appointment with a distracted Dr Tottenham looming large, there is every chance the embarrassment of Derby’s class of 2008 will endure for at least another season. “Tonight I’m disappointed because we deserved to win the game,” sighed their grizzled boss Juric after being pegged back toa last-gasp 1-1 draw by Crystal Palace. “The guys must train and prepare for every game like we did today, then the points will arrive.”While Saints’ record-threatening points tally is fairly jaw-dropping, the fact they remain seven points worse off than a Leicester City side who invariably look more haplessly terrible than them also seems remarkable. Ruud van Nistelrooy’s side haven’t so much battled against the drop as enveloped themselves in its warm embrace and have now lost seven top-flight gamesin a rowwithout so much as scoring a goal. “We have to focus on game to game and presenting ourselves in the best possible way,” parped Ruud van Nistelrooy, as a panicked Wout Faes skittered past him like Bambi on ice, with his bushy barnet hanging in the breeze. “That is the main target now.”Least worst of a bottom three who have acquired fewer points between them after 30 games than any trio of Premier League bottom-feeders in history, Ipswich at least gave themselves a puncher’s chance of staying up byconsigning Bournemouth to another defeatand must now host the top flight’s only other relegation candidates on Saturday. Beat Wolves and Kieran McKenna’s side will close the gap to six points with seven games to go and who knows what could happen? Oh.

I’ve never seen a BMW/Mercedes/Renault pickup truck before, but I’m certain they’ll develop creative party features – champagne chiller, paté slicer, bratwurst steamer – and take tailgating to the next level.

Postecoglou’s decision to introduce Sarr for Lucas Bergvall had been met with chants from the travelling support that he did not know what he was doing.Fernández lifts Chelsea into top four as Tottenham fans turn on PostecoglouRead moreWhen Sarr’s goal hit the net, Postecoglou turned to the Spurs fans and cupped his ear. The goal would then be disallowed by the VAR, Jarred Gillett, after a lengthy delay for a foul by Sarr on Moisés Caicedo. To add further insult, Sarr was booked for the kick at Caicedo’s knee.“Jesus mate, it’s incredible how things get interpreted,” Postecoglou said. “We’d just scored, I just wanted to hear them cheer. Because we’d been through a tough time and I thought it was a cracking goal. I wanted them to get really excited. I felt at that point we could potentially go on and win the game.Ange Postecoglou in feisty post-match Sky Sports interview.“It’s not the first time they’ve booed my substitutions or my decisions – that’s fine, they’re allowed to do that. But we’d just scored an equaliser … I was just hoping we could get some excitement.”Postecoglou was asked whether the gesture risked alienating the supporters, who have endured a difficult season. This was Spurs’s 16thPremier Leaguedefeat. “I am at such a disconnect with the world these days that who knows, maybe you’re right … I don’t know,” he replied. “But that’s not what my intention was.”Postecoglou has long been an outspoken critic of the VAR system. “VAR was called in for clear and obvious errors,” he said. “How long did it take tonight? Six minutes. For a clear and obvious error. Who cares if it was a foul or not? There were so many incidents out there. What does it matter? What’s the point of having a referee then? Clear and obvious means you go to the screen … [not] standing around for six minutes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That gave Price a bye through to the semi-finals, where he dominated a 6-2 win over Dobey to earn himself a shot at a third nightly victory.A tense final rarely hit the heights in terms of quality, with the first six legs all going against the darts before Bunting finally held with a 96 checkout.It was advantage Price, though, when he broke the throw again to lead 5-4, and he had two match darts but missed them both, making clear his displeasure with noises from the crowd.Bunting made the Welshman pay by levelling the contest and then finished in style with a checkout of 107.He told Sky Sports: “After the first win I was so relieved just to get off zero points. I’ve put a lot of work in behind the scenes, I’ve tried every week 110%. Tonight, oh my God, I’ve won an event and I’m so happy. It’s such a special moment.“There’s been times through the Premier League where I’ve thought: ‘Can I finish on zero points’? To get off the mark tonight and to win a night, such a special feeling. I know I’ve been playing well, I’ve just not got the result. Now this is going to give me huge confidence and I can’t wait to finish the campaign.”Bunting remains bottom of the table despite the victory while Price is up to third as the series moves on to Manchester.Explore more on these topicsDartsLuke LittlernewsShareReuse this content"

Plans include a new pergola – and there is little Wimbledon likes more than a pergola – which will provide a space for more hanging plants to provide shade and protection from British summer rain.The pergola, which will replace the structure at the top of the Hill, will wrap around the area’s 150-year-old oak tree while the AELTC hopes to make the area more environmentally sustainable by replacing tarmac paths with permeable resin. New accessible pathways to cross the slope aim to make the Hill easier to navigate for wheelchair users.View image in fullscreenNew paths crossing the slope would be added to improve accessibility.Photograph: AELTC/Allies and Morrison“The redevelopment of our world-famous Hill, in time for the championships 2027, will allow even more tennis fans to enjoy its unique atmosphere and vantage point,” said Deborah Jevans, the AELTC chair.“I am particularly pleased that these plans will increase the accessibility of the Hill for our guests using wheelchairs or who have additional accessibility requirements. It is an exciting opportunity as we look towards 2027 and the 150th anniversary of the first championships.”A consultation for local residents to learn more about the plans and give feedback is planned on 10 April before a planning application is submitted to Merton council.The AELTC will hope it is a smoother process than it experienced with its plan to vastly expand its grand slam venue, which aims to add 39 courts and an 8,000-seat show court, and to restore a lake designed by Capability Brown.In January a campaign group,Save Wimbledon Park, startedlegal actionto stop the expansion of the club, calling for a judicial review of plans to convert a swathe of the former Wimbledon Park golf course.The protest group says the development of the 29-hectare (72-acre) site – which was givenplanning permissionin September by the mayor of London’s office – is “inappropriate”.Work on the new-look Hill will start after the 2026 championships, and is expected to be unveiled – presumably with Pimm’s to toast the occasion – for the 150th anniversary of the tournament in 2027.Ruth Hopkins, general manager and head of access at the charity Level Playing Field, said: “I am delighted that Level Playing Field has played an important role in working with the AELTC to enhance their world-famous hill to be an inclusive and accessible space for everyone attending Wimbledon.“These plans will deliver significant improvements for all guests but particularly for those with accessibility requirements.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledonTennisLondonDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

They’re investing a lot of money into our game and we want to make sure that pays dividends.”County Championship bursts back into life with calm before the stormRead moreOne sticking point is the issue of overseas TV rights. “We’ve got brilliant supporters for our UK domestic market through Sky, but there are probably significant opportunities in the overseas broadcast market and that’s very much something that they’re focused on,” Gould said. “But there are differences in the markets.“The UK market is all on a subscription model, and the Indian market is all on advertising. Those are really very different dynamics when you’re just trying to work out how to maximise value. We need to make sure we’ve got something which is fit for purpose across the global markets, not just a UK market.”At the same time, the ECB is launching another review of the domestic schedule, following on from previous reviews in 2018 and 2022. Like those, it will almost certainly conclude that there needs to be a reduction in the overall amount of cricket being played across the formats, but the ECB is hoping by taking a different route to the same conclusion – this review is going to be led by the counties and the newly formed Professional Game Committee – something will actually change this time around. The review is scheduled to take two to three months, and the hope is that the changes will be introduced in 2026.“I think one thing is clear and that is that everybody recognises the schedule is not perfect,” said the managing director of professional cricket, Rob Andrew.“It’s an easy thing to say that and a very difficult thing to say, well, OK, so what should it look like? We’ve got 18 counties that agree that it’s not right, but we’ve got 19 different versions of what the answer is. And our job over the next few months is to try to pull all of those views together to get to a schedule where everybody can look at it, and then we can all find a solution.” Andrew said that the onus will be on the counties themselves to consult with their members.It seems likely that a new schedule will include fewer T20 Blast matches, given that the money coming in from the Hundred sale means the counties are under less financial pressure; fewer days of Championship cricket; and ensuring that at least some 50-over cricket is played outside August, when the best players are all involved in the Hundred.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Using both venues for a first World Cup inSpainhas obvious appeal while the San Mamés stadium in Bilbao hosted the Champions Cup final in 2018 and will do so again next year.Spain’s closest rival for the 2035 tournament is likely to be Italy with an expectation that, with Australia hosting the 2027 World Cup and the United States staging the 2031 edition, 2035 will mark a return to Europe. Japan are considered the early frontrunners for what is likely to be a World Cup in Asia in 2039, but there is interest from the Middle East and though there are hurdles to overcome, the financial incentives are clear.Spain last appeared at the World Cup in 1999 – they won a place at the 2023 tournament but were expelled for breaching eligibility regulations in qualifying – but have booked their spot for the 2027 competition. The women’s side has also qualified for the World Cup this year in England while Spain have made significant strides on the sevens circuit. A decision is expected to be made before the 2027 World Cup in Australia.“Spain is interesting because it’s an extension of the European market, 50 million people, quality stadiums, passionate support and culture,” said the World Rugby chair, Brett Robinson. “And their high-performance investment and focus in recent years has been at a pace where you’ve got two teams in [the Hong Kong sevens] tournament who are really competitive. The men’s team has qualified for the 2027 World Cup, the women’s World Cup this year. Is there a European competition where you do something with Italy, with the UK?”Spain’s bid appeals in part because World Rugby has dealt with a number of the logistics that would be encountered, such as discussing clashes with domestic football and Champions League calendars, as recently as 2023 when France hosted the World Cup. “The Spanish federation and Spanish government have had conversations with La Liga,” said World Rugby’s chief executive, Alan Gilpin.View image in fullscreenSpain qualified for the 2023 tournament but were expelled for breaching regulations.Photograph: Susana Vera/Reuters“When we’ve had tournaments before in England or in France in 2023, there’s been that conversation about we need you, Tottenham, to play two matches away in a row.

As we understand it, it’s with La Liga about whether they would support [it] and it seems to be [the case].“We took some big strategic decisions a few years ago to go men’s and women’s in Australia and the same in the US. And we’ve now got to think about the balance and whether we bring 2035 and 2037 back to Europe.

You would need 736 floppy disks to hold those same files; now it takes up no physical space at all to store 10,000 documents on the cloud.As data storage has evolved, so too has the whole information landscape, and with it the challenges of storing, transferring and appropriately using people’s personal data.An exhibition by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), which opened atManchesterCentral Library this week, charts the evolution of data privacy through 40 items, each chosen to illustrate how access to information has evolved, or how data has been at the heart of some of the biggest news events of the past four decades.“I think the wonderful thing about the exhibition is that the world that we occupy, like any specialty, is filled with jargon and technicalities,” the information commissioner, John Edwards, said.“[People] won’t know what a data controller is, they don’t know what a data processor is, they don’t know what a data subject is, we have to use some of these specialist terms. What the exhibition shows is what we do is about people, and it’s about real human impacts.”Items in the exhibition,which is also available to view online, include a Pokémon toy, a floppy disk, a Tesco Clubcard, a modem, a millennium bug pamphlet, a football shirt and a Covid vaccination card.Other exhibits highlight how the ICO has made changes in society; from ending the “employment deny list” in the construction industry, to the introduction of public food hygiene ratings for restaurants.Edwards’ favourite item? A pair of spiked lawn aerator shoes, which illustrate an early example of enforcement action when, in the 1980s, the company behind them was found to be making almost as much money from selling its customers’ information as it was from selling the shoes.“They were fined quite significantly for their exploitative marketing techniques,” Edwards said.View image in fullscreenInformation commissioner John Edwards’ favourite item in the exhibition is a pair of spiked lawn aerator shoes.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianThe 40th plinth in the exhibition remains empty, with members of the public asked to put forward their own ideas for objects that have shaped the data landscape.“That’s to reflect the notion that privacy is personal, subjective,” Edwards said. “We each have our own expectations and experiences.”The ICO was founded 40 years ago, in a small office near Manchester, as the UK’s data protection regulator, responsible for presiding over a new Data Protection Act. Since then the landscape overseen by the regulator has changed beyond all recognition.View image in fullscreenAn NHS Covid vaccination card.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAToday, people have “tens of thousands of times” more personal data out in the world than they did when the role was created, Edwards said.“You just move through the world today shedding data wherever you go,” Edwards said. He asks how the Guardian travelled to this interview (by bus). “Did you tap on?” he asked. “You created data there.“You used your cell phone on the way, so you’re pinging off cell towers the whole way. Forty years ago, none of this was a thing.“We’ve had this, kind of, data world sneak up on us, and most of that data, for most of those years, was an accidental byproduct.“We’ve now got to a stage where all these companies are going, hang on a minute, we could make money out of that.”Every year, he said, “hundreds of billions of data transactions” took place, and with “infinite variety”. The ICO was regulating everything from small schools, GP surgeries and libraries to huge “fiercely competitive” social media companies, which Edwards said often “don’t pause long enough to test the privacy implications of what they’re doing”.“The biggest challenge has been trying to keep up with the pace of change,” Edwards said. “Companies innovate very quickly, we regulate and investigate very slowly.“I think part of the objective of an investigation is to put some lines in the sand for companies to say: ‘You can’t do this,’” he added. “But if it takes us three years to do that, then all the companies have moved on by the time we learn that lesson. So that’s the biggest challenge, and that’s something we’ve got to get better at.”What will data and privacy look like in 40 years’ time? “Look, I don’t know where we’re going to be four weeks from now,” Edwards said.“The geopolitical situation is really kind of volatile at the moment,” he said. “We’ve got an environment where US tech firms are pushing back on a lot of regulation that affects them, even when it’s in a jurisdiction that they want to do business in. We haven’t seen how that’s going to play out.”“Quantum computing has potential to change everything,” he added. “Agentic AI is the next AI coming down the pipeline.“It’s going to be really fascinating even the next 12 months,” he said, “let alone the next 40 years.”Explore more on these topicsData protectionInformation commissionerPrivacyArtificial intelligence (AI)ManchesterSocial mediaEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

I’d sell it now, but prices have droppedThu 3 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 11.13 EDTShareAfter our children left home, my wife and I decided to treat ourselves and buy a new car for a driving holiday in Europe. We’d been driving a family estate car for years, loading it up with kids and making trips to and from universities, but we wanted something for ourselves.As a surprise, she booked a test drive for the Tesla Model S for my birthday. It was unlike any car I’d been in before. I thought “Wow, this is amazing.” It felt like the future: a computer on wheels that was constantly updating with new features. I can’t say I feel that way now – and many people seem to share that view. Tesla sales figuresdeclined by 13% in the first few months of this year. Others feel even more uneasy:more than 200 demonstrations happened last weekendoutside company facilities around the world to protest against Elon Musk and the wrecking ball he has taken to the federal government.I had no complaints about the car itself: it was quiet. It was large. And, importantly for us, as an electric vehicle it was environmentally friendly. Some people go for the sports car when they gain a new sense of freedom in later life, but I had done a bit of research and wanted to move away from diesel and petrol.Despite people voicing concerns about a lack of charging infrastructure, I found Tesla’s network to be wonderful. We drove all over Europe – driving to Switzerland one year, Italy another, and last summer to the south of France. At one point we even packed in five adults and all their suitcases after an airport pickup.I would consider myself left-leaning, but buying an electric car wasn’t a huge political statement for us at the time, but rather an acknowledgment of the way things are going to be in the future. Little did I know how our choice would be politicised for us six years down the line.In the early years of owning the car I remember a neighbour saying: “What is it like to own a car built by a madman?” But I brushed it off. I had watched videos of Musk at Tesla events, and he seemed like a poor man’s Steve Jobs. Much like the Apple CEO, I saw Musk as a frontman rather than the designer and didn’t take much notice of the business owner.Soon it was impossible to ignore him. My wife and I were horrified as he publicly adopted rightwing positions – with his endorsement of Donald Trump for US president and then for thefar-right AfDin Germany, as well as his support forTommy Robinson. It seemed so odd to us that a man who would champion electric vehicles would also hold such reactionary views.I started to notice a shift in the Tesla owners’ group on Facebook. Having not owned an electric car before, the group was a useful resource. People were very helpful and even recommended places to stop off during our European holiday. When Musk’s politics began to grow more extreme, members began to post that they no longer felt comfortable owning a Tesla. And then others would respond: ““We’re not interested in your politics.” I saw someone giving stick to the Guardian and even calling the BBC “BBC Stalin”, which was funny for me as I always personally felt it went too far the other way.View image in fullscreenProtesters demonstrate against Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, during a nationwide Tesla Takedown rally outside a dealership in Pasadena, California.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesI started to reflect on owning a Tesla and it was my daughter who made the case for selling it. But judging by people posting secondhand cars in the Facebook group, prices have been dropping. I feel trapped. I cycled to meet a friend recently, and he took one look at my reasonably nice bike and said “It’s probably worth more than your Tesla now.” Someone else said to me he was interested in buying a Tesla, but he was going to wait until they were virtually worthless.It’s a shame as in every other way the car is a perfect match for our lifestyle. It’s cheap to run, easy to service and Tesla has a mobile repair service that dispatches a “ranger” to your house to fix any issues.If I was buying a car from scratch I would boycott the company, but we are where we are. For now I am going to have to keep hold of it. Next time, maybe I’ll get a European electric vehicle.

The statement was published on Change.orgas a petitionwhich has since garnered 7,000 signatures.“I was horrified to see that my novels were on the LibGen database and I’m disgusted by the government’s silence on the matter,” said novelist AJ West, who is leading today’s protest. “To have my beautiful books ripped off like this without my permission and without a penny of compensation then fed to the AI monster feels like I’ve been mugged.”Acourt filingmade in January by a group of authors suing Meta for copyright infringement in the US – which includes Ta-Nehisi Coates, Jacqueline Woodson, Andrew Sean Greer, Junot Díaz and the comedian Sarah Silverman – claimed that company executives, including Zuckerberg, were aware that LibGen is a database believed to contain pirated material when they allowed its use.Authors are “rightly up in arms”, said SoA chief executive Anna Ganley. “The fact that these online libraries of pirated books continue to exist is bad enough, but when global companies use them to unlawfully access and exploit authors’ copyright-protected works, it is a double blow for authors.”Demonstrators are encouraged to make placards, and the SoA has suggested several protest hashtags: #MetaBookThieves, #DoTheWriteThing and #MakeItFair.Explore more on these topicsBooksMetaArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingKate MosseTracy ChevalierRichard OsmannewsShareReuse this content"

It is also seeking a $2.4bn “restitution fund” for victims of hate and violence incited on Facebook.I was a content moderator for Facebook. I saw the real cost of outsourcing digital labour | Sonia KgomoRead moreOne of the claimants is the son of Prof Meareg Amare Abrha, who was murdered at his home in Ethiopia after his address and threatening posts were published on Facebook in 2021 during a civil war in the country. Another claimant is Fisseha Tekle, a former researcher at Amnesty International who published reports on violence committed during the conflict in Tigray in northern Ethiopia and received death threats on Facebook.Meta has argued that courts in Kenya, where Facebook’s Ethiopia moderators were based at the time, did not have jurisdiction over the case. The Kenyan high court in Nairobi ruled on Thursday that the case fell within the jurisdiction of the country’s courts.Abrham Meareg, the son of Meareg, said: “I am grateful for the court’s decision today. It is disgraceful that Meta would argue that they should not be subject to the rule of law in Kenya. African lives matter.”Tekle said he cannot return home to Ethiopia because of Meta’s failure to make Facebook safe. “Meta cannot undo the damage it has done, but it can radically change how it moderates dangerous content across all its platforms to make sure no one else has to go through what I have,” he said. “I look forward to this matter now being heard by the court in full.”The case, supported by non-profit organisations including Foxglove and Amnesty International, also demands a formal apology from Meta for the murder of Meareg. The Katiba Institute, a Kenya-based NGO focusing on the Kenyan constitution, is the third claimant in the case.In 2022an analysisby the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Observer found that Facebook was letting users post content inciting violence through hate and misinformation, despite being aware that it was fuelling tensions in Tigray.Meta rejected the claims at the time, saying it had “invested in safety and security measures” to tackle hate and inflammatory language along with “aggressive steps to stop the spread of misinformation” in Ethiopia.In January the company said it wasremoving factcheckersand “dramatically” reducing the amount of censorship on the platform, although it would continue to tackle illegal and high severity violations.Meta said it did not comment on ongoing legal matters.Explore more on these topicsMetaEthiopiaSocial mediaFacebookInternet safetyDigital mediaSocial networkingnewsShareReuse this content"

Just a couple of 30-minute sessions add thousands of steps to your daily tally. In fact, a 60-minute walk at a very easy 3km an hour can burn between 200 and 300 additional calories, helping those who want to lose a little weight and tone up without the sweatiness and inconvenience of a full-on treadmill session.Walking pads are often cheaper than full-size treadmills, simple to use and relatively easy to store, and they’re perfect for adding a little more movement to your life without having to give up the day job.At a glanceBest overall walking pad:JTX MoveLight£499 at JTX FitnessBestbudget walking pad:Rattantree shock-absorbing treadmill£142.49 at DebenhamsBest foldable walking pad:BodyMax WP60£549 at AmazonBest walking pad for incline:Mobvoi Home Treadmill Plus£224.99 at MobvoiWhy you should trust meI’m a keen fitness fan who does everything from gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes to outdoor trail runs and cold-water surfing.

With walking pads, that meant strolling along, racking up the steps and burning calories – even while I wrote up this feature.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘Good build quality for the price and the setup process is painless’: the Mobvoi Home Treadmill Plus.Photograph: Leon PoultneyThere was only one way to properly trial the five walking treadmills we selected for this test, and that’s to mimic the customer journey by ordering, taking delivery, unboxing, setting them up and then shoehorning them into daily life.The best walking treadmills – or walking pads – aren’t quite as bulky asregular running treadmills, so I could have multiple models on the go at home at once: one under my desk, one in front of the television and one in my wife’s office upstairs, rotating through them to ensure the same time – at least three days – was spent on each.The testing process meant a lot of additional steps and – in some cases at least – a whining soundtrack that drowned out whatever Netflix series the family was attempting to enjoy.Besides general observations on the heft, ease of storage, quietness, ease of operation and build quality, I tested any additional features available, such as incline, speed adjustments and any remote controls or apps.Finally, to get a good idea of energy consumption, and the overall cost of running a walking treadmill, I plugged each unit into a power meter, which offered real-time readouts on energy consumption, and calculated the cost based on my energy tariff.Here are the four best walking treadmills you can buy now.The best under-desk treadmills and walking padsin 2025View image in fullscreen‘It feels like a walking pad that will go the distance’: the JTX MoveLight.Photograph: Leon PoultneyBest overall walking pad:JTX MoveLightView image in fullscreen£499 at JTX FitnessJTX tends to appear in the “best value” section of most reviews of home fitness equipment. The brand is known for offering great affordability and reliable build quality but lacks eye candy and technological flourishes.The MoveLight walking pad is different, though. It happens to be one of the most expensive walking pads we tested. At almost 30kg, it also happens to be one of the heaviest.But that’s no bad thing: there’s a tangible difference in the build quality when compared with the much cheaper Rattantree, for example. The JTX also offers a super-sized display, cushioned walking deck and super-quiet 1hp electric motor.It’s a solid treadmill offering speeds of up to 6km/h, meaning it’s also possible to use it for slow jogging without the worry of it falling apart.Why we love itThe JTX is similar in design to the BodyMax reviewed below and has a solid plastic chassis that gives it a more premium feel than its cheaper rivals. There’s also a generous running deck area.The extra-large LED console is easy to use and neatly scrolls through speed, time and step count information as you walk. The shrill beeps upon startup and when you adjust the speed do become tiresome, though. Any office mates will want to throw a pencil at you.A small plastic remote allows you to adjust the speed, stop or start the unit and scroll the display between distance, calories and time on one half and speed and step count on the other.The 1hp motor is powerful enough to propel the deck up to 6km/h, where it remains much quieter than some of the others tested. The deck cushioning is also tangible underfoot, offering a nice spring that makes longer walking sessions more comfortable.Overall, it feels like a walking pad that will go the distance – and so it should, given the price. But that solid build also makes it a pain to move around the house, with the overall weight requiring some serious muscle to tip it up on to its wheels. It also doesn’t fold like the similarly priced BodyMax machine.Oh, and one final public service announcement: those with wooden floors will want to take care that the wheels and plastic feet don’t scratch the surface during transport.During testing, we found it to be slightly more power-hungry than rivals, supping about 100W at 3.5km/h, meaning it costs about 3p an hour to power – or 83p a month if used for an hour each day.It’s a shame that …it’s so big and heavy to move around, which makes storing after each session a chore.Size:147 x 60 x 12.5cm (LWH)Weight:29.5kgWalking deck size:45 x 122cmMaximum user weight:100kgAverage running cost:3p an hourIncline:noneMaximum speed:6km/hFolding:noBestbudget walking pad:Rattantree shock-absorbing treadmillView image in fullscreen£142.49 at DebenhamsIt was a bit of a surprise when this Rattantree treadmill – which is available in three colours, including a rather garish pink – arrived sporting HomeFitnessCode branding. It’s a mega-value, fairly generic option that hails from China, and it’s no surprise that it doesn’t offer all the bells and whistles of its pricier rivals. The build quality isn’t fantastic, but it is very lightweight, an absolute doddle to use and covers the basics required by most working walkers.It’s marketed for both walking and running, with the belt managing speeds of up to 10km/h, but this feels extremely fast for such a barebones machine.Why we love itLet’s get straight to the point: this is a budget option. It’s much cheaper than most of the others tested and doesn’t come with any fancy features such as Bluetooth, incline or built-in speakers.It’s a simple 39 x 102cm revolving running deck, paired with a powerful (but noisy) 2.5hp electric motor that’s able to crank the belt up to 10km/h. Speed adjustment is taken care of by a small remote, which needs two AAA batteries to operate.Upon unboxing, the cost savings are immediately obvious. It is not only light but also very basic in its build. A simple steel frame, a motor and a belt are about all you get.A small and often tricky-to-read LED console at the top scrolls through distance travelled, time elapsed and a rough guide to how many calories you’ve burned, but there’s no way of jumping to the data field you want. You just have to wait for it to come around again.The lighter overall weight makes it much easier to move around the house than others, but I found it also started to move around underfoot, creak and generally complain a little as the speeds went beyond 8km/h. Put it this way: I don’t think this lightweight walking pad would last an indoor marathon at a training pace.As a simple walking pad to tuck under a desk, though, it’s absolutely fine. The belt needed adjusting after about a week of use, but slurping just 70W of power at 3.5km/h means it costs pennies to use daily.It’s a shame that …it cranks up to speeds of 10km/h because it doesn’t feel sturdy enough for those speeds.Size:122 x 49 x 14cm (LWH)Weight:19kgMaximum user weight:110kgAverage running cost:2p an hourWalking deck size:39 x 102cmIncline:noneMaximum speed:10km/hFolding:noBest foldable walking pad:BodyMax WP60View image in fullscreen£549 at AmazonThe most expensive model on test, the BodyMax walking pad also happens to be one of the best built and easiest on the eye. It’s the only model that genuinely folds in half, making it easier to squeeze into a cupboard or wardrobe.However, weighing the best part of 30kg, it’s not the easiest to move, despite wheels at the front that allow it to be tipped on its end and rolled around.Potential portability issues aside, this machine offers a fantastic walking experience, with a neat, bright and easy-to-read LED panel that gives clear and scrolling readouts of workout time, distance, speed and average calorie burn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

This is a really handy feature, meaning you won’t be constantly distracted by irksome remote-control fiddling.The deck itself is nicely cushioned and the motor is among the quietest on test. It feels like BodyMax hasn’t scrimped on materials, nor has it been distracted by Bluetooth speakers and other gimmicks, which can’t be said for all.Those wanting their walking pad to double up as a running treadmill may be disappointed: the WP60 tops out at 6km/h, which is a very fast walking pace but a slow jog for most. Not a single walking pad I’ve tested has done a convincing job as a running treadmill, though, being either too flimsy underfoot, too noisy or simply not built to withstand the endless thumping of a sprint session.If you’re seeking robust build quality, the BodyMax WP60 walking pad is well worth the additional outlay. As it folds in half, it can be tucked under a desk or rested against a wall when not in use.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy and awkward to move around when folded, and it’s expensive.Size:143 x 55 x 12.9cm (LWH)Weight:28kgWalking deck size:42 x 120cmMaximum user weight:100kgAverage running cost:2.5p an hourIncline:noneMaximum speed:6km/hFolding:yes, folds in half for storageBest walking pad for incline:Mobvoi Home Treadmill PlusView image in fullscreen£224.99 at MobvoiMobvoi is best known for itsTicWatchline of fitness-tracking smartwatches and good-valuewireless headphones, but it also offers a small range of domestic treadmills in the UK.One of the most versatile is the Home Treadmill Plus. This pad offers a slightly larger walking deck area than the brand’sHome Treadmill SE, as well as the ability to add a small amount of incline thanks to flip-out feet for height.The build quality is good for the price and the setup process is painless, while a decent spread of speeds and the ability to transform it into a more traditional running machine (with a folding handrail) make it a versatile choice for home users.Why we love itMobvoi manages to make its Home Treadmill Plus feel relatively premium and well built without sending the price soaring.It’s ready to use out of the box (although that box is heavy, so get someone to help), with wheels at one end to make it easier to move around the home – especially if you have hard floors. You wouldn’t want to keep lugging it up and down the stairs, though.When “folded” into walking mode, the built-in handrail lays flat, allowing you to slide it under a standing desk. From here, you control it with a small remote control to adjust the speed and turn the machine on and off.It doesn’t fold in half for storage, but the slim side profile means it will slide under a sofa or bed, so long as you have 12cm or more of clearance.It includes a safety mechanism for running that clips to your clothes and attaches to a specific point on the machine with a strong magnet, as you’d get on a gym running machine. There’s no way of safely attaching it when the handrail is tucked away in walking mode, however, so it will continue to operate even if you step off it. Most walking pads are the same, but it always strikes me as a bit dangerous.When extending the handrail and pushing the 2.5hp electric motor to its 12km/h top speed, however, that emergency cord could well come in handy. While it’s nice that it reaches a running pace that’s so fast – feeling like a sprint for many – it’s not really designed for long and arduous sprint sessions. The running deck isn’t big enough and there isn’t much in the way of shock absorption. I tried running on a couple of occasions but always found the experience a tad claustrophobic, not to mention noisy and generally a bit flimsy-feeling underfoot – particularly when maxing out the speed.The pad does offer an efficient and quiet way of racking up the step count while engaging in side tasks. The fold-out incline legs are a nice touch because adding a small incline helps burn more calories and work different leg muscles.In terms of efficiency, I found it drew around 80W of power at a sedate 3.5km/h speed, meaning it will cost a couple of pence to run for an hour a day on most common tariffs.Other niceties include Bluetooth functionality, allowing it to pair with virtual workout software such asZwift, while a built-in speaker allows music to be streamed from a smartphone. That said, the speaker isn’t great – you’d be far better off with a good pair ofheadphonesinstead.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy to move around, the remote is hit-and-miss and the legs add only a tiny bit of incline.Size:138cm x 64cm x 12cm (113cm in running mode) (LWH)Weight:24.6kgWalking deck size: 42 x 102cmMaximum user weight:120kgAverage running cost:2p an hourIncline:six degreesMaximum speed:12km/hFolding:yes – safety handle for runningWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenUsing a walking pad for an hour each day should only add about £10 a year to your energy bills.Photograph: Leon PoultneyHow much should I spend?Prices vary when it comes to walking pads, with the most affordable costing about £150. Anything less than that is unlikely to last until the end of the month.From my testing, the sweet spot seems to be about £250, where you can get a good blend of value and decent build quality. But some of the best we tested were, predictably, among the most expensive. These high-end models typically cost up to £500.How much room do you need?If you’ve got good clearance underneath a bed or sofa, most walking pads will happily slide underneath without the need to fold them up. Imagine a slimmed-down treadmill without the safety handle and you’re basically there.Models like those from BodyMax fold in half, which drastically reduces the length (or height, depending on how you store it), making it much easier to slide into more compact spaces such as a cupboard or wardrobe. But bear in mind the overall weight – many weigh up to 30kg, so they can be tricky to move without help.How easy is it to maintain a walking pad?Most walking pads come with a small bottle of silicone oil provided. This is used to lubricate the underside of the rubber deck every couple of months to ensure smooth movement. Most manufacturers also supply the required hex key so you can tighten the belt if it’s slipping or has moved slightly off-centre.Quickly check the deck alignment and any moving parts every couple of months and it should be enough to keep a walking pad running smoothly for years.Do walking pads use a lot of electricity?Walking pads use much less powerful motors than their running treadmill counterparts and they often do away with power-sapping incline motors and connected Bluetooth features that can see electricity bills spiral.During testing, most walking pads drew between 70 and 100W at a relatively standard 3km/h walking pace. This figure increased slightly as the speed increased.Using a walking pad for an hour each day at those sorts of figures equates to about 2-3p a day – or about £10 a year. Much cheaper than a gym membership, but more costly than getting out in nature.Can I run on a walking pad?Some walking pad speeds are capped at about 6km/h, which makes running on them tricky. A plodding jog is a better description.Some walking pads we tested did reach much higher speeds, but most came with a folding safety handle that extends to allow them to safely reach those speeds, giving the runner something to hang on to should the worst happen. These also came with a separate safety system, with a small magnetic tag that attaches to clothing. If this becomes detached, the machine shuts off.It’s worth noting that the general build and robustness of walking pads aren’t up there with their running-focused counterparts, though. That means they can be noisy, shift around underfoot and generally feel a bit flimsy during faster and longer runs.On top of this, those without handles don’t have the automatic shut-off functionality either, which can make them more dangerous, particularly when using them at higher speeds.In summary,running treadmillsare better suited to those wanting to move at higher speeds. They feature more underfoot cushioning or built-in suspension systems, which makes longer, faster sessions more comfortable and easier on the joints.Leon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of the biggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.

But how does the Switch 2 play? After the online presentation, I got to spend about four hours road-testing the new console at a press event in the Grand Palais, Paris, the box-white exhibition hall adorned in Nintendo red and lined with rows of high-end TV screens and Switch 2 consoles. There was also a 90-minute roundtable with three of the masterminds behind the console: Tetsuya Sasaki (hardware design lead), Kouichi Kawamoto (producer) and Takuhiro Dohta (director). Here’s what I learned.The gamesView image in fullscreenSmooth ride … Mario Kart World for the Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoMario Kart WorldThe headline feature here (playable cow aside) is Knockout Tour mode, which replaces the traditional three-lap circuits with hefty sprints across a sprawling world map. There are 24 racers, double that of its predecessor, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. As you progress, large checkpoints emerge on the horizon and at each of these the bottom four racers drop out. This continues until the final stretch, when the final four duke it out for first place. Think Mario Kart does battle royale. It’s intense. It’s exciting. It runs incredibly smoothly and will reinvigorate even the most hardened – dare I say jaded – Mario Kart player.Elsewhere there is a more traditional Mario Kart experience where everyone gets to finish the race. You’re still sprinting across some configuration of a world map – one moment you’re driving through Boo’s cinema, the next you’re hurtling through a Toad-branded manufacturing plant. Tweaks from the previous game include: a few new weapons, skidding feels less agile, the tracks feel less claustrophobic and they’ve styled Waluigi like Steven Van Zandt.Super Mario Party JamboreeView image in fullscreenQuirky … Super Mario Party Jamboree.Photograph: NintendoMario Party is Nintendo’s party game franchise – board games, mini games, screwing each other over, players taking it far too seriously … you get the drill. This series has always allowedNintendoto showcase the quirkier aspects of its hardware, and the camera works well in the mini games I played. I enjoyed the goomba-catching mini game (named Goombalancing Act): you stand in front of the console and camera, then marvel as you’re projected on to the TV, now with a red pedestal on your head; as goombas begin falling from the sky you bob and weave to catch, stack and balance. The player with the most goombas at the end wins.Elsewhere, there’s a squatting/standing decision based game (I can already see the camera being incorporated into the next Ring Fit/Wii Fit title) and a game that rewards those who move and shout the most, making use of the inbuilt microphone (this one might quickly grow old). It’s all very reminiscent of PlayStation’s EyeToy. The mouse functionality gets a run-out too – tagging Bob-ombs with spray scans is the standout (you literally shake the Joy-Con like a canister when you run out of spray).At the roundtable we’re told that Nintendo developed the microphone to remove unwanted external noise, but the sound of clapping will still get picked up, to allow the full emotion of the experience to come through. Nintendo is clearly trying to keep the spirit of local multiplayer gaming alive at a time where people are more isolated and less inclined to leave their homes. There’s an option to have your friends appear via camera at the bottom of your screen too. Being able to look people in the eye as you stab them in the back at a digital board game – that’s what makes life worth living.Drag x DriveDrag x Drive is Nintendo’s combination of Rocket League and wheelchair basketball. You hold the Joy-Con in “mouse mode”, one in each hand, and then manouvre as though you’re operating a wheelchair. There’s a tutorial which takes some getting used to and at times it makes your arm ache a bit, but thankfully the game itself is less taxing and much more about smaller motions and precision. If you don’t have a table in front of you to use the mouse then it’s designed to work on your lap. I gave this a try, but quickly became conscious of the fact that I was a 35-year-old man furiously rubbing his legs under a table.And the rest …There have been concerns that the more iterative approach to the new Switch marks a new age for Nintendo, one where its less weird. Well, look no further thanNintendo Switch2 Welcome Tour. Picture the Switch 2 on its side, then enlarge it to the size of the airport, then turn buttons into kiosks with digital receptionists that you can explore: essentially it’s a playable guide to your console through the medium of mini games, explainers, tutorials and quizzes. It is more fun that it sounds … just.In Donkey Kong Bananza you run around and destroy a lot of rocks. Maybe it was just the early levels I played, but it feels as if it skews toward a beginner audience. It looks amazing though. Then there’s Metroid Prime 4. The opening sequence was playable here and all I’ll say is it looks and feels exactly like Metroid Prime Remastered (complimentary) but slightly more vibrant, cinematic and busy, with mouse functionality for those who play their shooters that way.The hardwareView image in fullscreenAn iterative hop … Nintendo Switch 2.Photograph: NintendoThe Switch 2 is more of an iterative hop than a grand redesign. The focus is on pragmatic changes that improve quality of life. It’s a wider model than its predecessor, and though it feels sturdier it doesn’t feel that much heavier in handheld mode. The bigger screen pops, as you’d expect; and it all looks very sleek and less like a toy. It all feels like marginal gains, but together adds up to a much slicker, more modern device.The Joy-Con feels more durable, weightier than their predecessors and more comfortable to hold, with bigger buttons that are less awkward to press (the shoulder buttons in particular). I wasn’t able to test out the magnetic attach/detach aspect, but I was able to detach the thin case that goes over the edges once they’re no longer docked in the system – what a relief to no longer be messing about with those cheap black sliders. As for the dreadedJoy-Con drift, we were told during the roundtable that the new models have been designed from the ground up to account for bigger and smoother movements.The pro controller feels exactly as it did before, albeit with joysticks that feel slightly more durable and comfortable. I have minor concerns about accidentally hitting the new buttons at the base of the controller in the heat of karting battle – accidentally firing off a premature red shell maybe – but I’m sure I’ll get used to it. In the developer roundtable it was also confirmed that Joy-Con and pro controllers from the previous generation would be compatible with the Switch 2 (though presumably with some obvious restrictions on functionality).A note on the performance of the Switch 2: in my four hours’ playtime I remember seeing one loading screen. That was for Cyberpunk and it lasted maybe five to 10 seconds. I only had a few minutes to play, so immediately began shooting Night City cops to start a riot – and my brief impressions are that the hardware coped pretty well with the ensuing carnage. Likewise for Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I immediately loaded the save marked Korok Forest and sprinted under the Deku Tree, witnessing the forest for the first time without a single frame dropping.The verdictWhether or not Nintendo can convince diehard fans like me isn’t the question here. Nintendo has often struggled with following up its triumphs in the home console market, lurching from runaway success to squandered opportunities. When the original Switch came out in March 2017, it was off the back of the dismal performance of the Wii U, a device that sold 13.5m units in its lifetime. Its job was to move devotees on from a failing system and convince casual gamers to come back. Nintendo has a different job this time around: it now has to convince perhaps the largest install base in its history (150m units sold and counting) to make the switch (I’m sorry) to its reasonably similar new model. It’s a big ask for Nintendo, and in this climate ofhome console uncertainty, for the entire industry.Explore more on these topicsGamesNintendo SwitchNintendofeaturesShareReuse this content"

In short, it is a phenomenon.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Such is the strength of feeling, almost all of it positive, about Minecraft that it was only a matter of time before someone tried to turn it into a film. After all, you have a historically popular product and a highly engaged fanbase: what could possibly go wrong? Turns out, quite a lot. Last September, thefirst trailerfor the film – titled A Minecraft Movie – was released, and the reaction was instant and violent. “Minecraft fans devastated by ‘awful’ live-action trailer”read one headlinethe following day.Some calledit “a crime against humanity”;others“a soulless neon abomination”. In less than 24 hours, the website GamingBible had called it “a curse on my eyes” and “pure nightmare fuel”. Within three days of its release, the trailer had been downvoted more than 1m times.If you’re familiar with Minecraft, you can probably understand why. Minecraft is a game with a highly distinctive look; everything is made of square blocks, and there’s a muted palette. The trailer, however, is insanely garish. Everything looks like it is made of Haribo and, worse, the blocks have slightly rounded edges. Worse still, there are humans in it. Heightened, ironic-looking humans.Jason Momoais in it, in an unflattering blond wig and hot-pink leather jacket. In other words, it looks like a film made by people who don’t understand Minecraft.“This is Jumanji but with a Minecraft skin,” was the first reaction of Argentinian YouTuberElVitt0ri0on seeing the teaser. “Minecraft offers an infinite number of narrative possibilities. And yet they decided to go with the ‘we go to another universe and learn about it’ storyline? What is this? Space Jam 3?”ElVitt0ri0’s response was to createA Movie About Minecraft (That Doesn’t Exist), a version of what the film should have been. The trailer was created with the open-source animation software Blender that was used to makeFlow, which won best animated feature at this year’s Oscars; it’s a fully animated trailer that retains the look of the original game and features characters recognisable to players. Underneath the video is the comment: “This is everything the Minecraft movie should have been, the game elements, the history, the community … it’s so perfect.”And ElVitt0ri0 is not alone. Dozens, maybe even hundreds, of fan-made Minecraft trailers have sprung up online since the official teaser went live, each trying to find their own way to undo the damage it caused. Vicky Fernandes, who runs the channel Gloomy Animations,made one entitledMinecraft Movie Trailer But It’s Actually Good. Her video is explicitly a fix rather than a reimagining; a shot-for-shot remake where everything is animated in a more immediately recognisable Minecraft style. And it is good; so good that the comments beneath the video are full of relieved now-that’s-what-I-expected sentiment.View image in fullscreenFor a certain type of fan, the Minecraft look is gospel.Photograph: Mojang“I think the movie should have been animated, not live action,” Fernandes says over email. “Mixing CGI cube-looking characters with real humans looks very weird. The CGI characters also look oddly realistic while keeping the cube proportions, making it look creepy. Overall, the film does not have an appealing art style.”What ElVitt0ri0 and Fernandes have in common is that they are Minecraft fans first and foremost. Fernandes first started playing the game in 2014, when she was eight years old, and began making fan videos four years later. ElVitt0ri0 started playing at age 11, and quickly got swept up in its peripheral YouTube content. “One thing fans have proved again and again is that Minecraft can function as an amazing platform to tell a story,” ElVitt0ri0 says. “Not just through animation either – you can look at whole series and movies that were made in-game.”Both YouTubers lament that this sense of history and appreciation seems to have been lost in the official movie. But perhaps that is to be expected, since Warner Bros has been trying to get a Minecraft movie off the ground for over a decade now. In 2014, when the studio first announced a film, it hired Shawn Levy to direct it. But that fell through, so Rob McElhenney stepped in to replace him. When he too stepped away shortly afterwards, Peter Sollett – best known for 2008’s Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist – briefly took his place. It was only in 2022 that the film found all of its pieces, with Napoleon Dynamite’s Jared Hess stepping in to direct a script from Masterminds writers Chris Bowman and Hubbel Palmer.In truth, Hess had his work cut out for him. Minecraft is a game without a traditional narrative. A sandbox game, where players are plunged into a procedurally generated landscape and are free to do whatever they like. If they want to extract raw materials from their surroundings to craft tools, they can. If they want to start fights with hostile creatures, they can. If they want to spend four days using the game to build a giant chicken (as my 10-year-old did this week), then that’s up to them.View image in fullscreenA ‘corpo-vomited product’? The Minecraft film.Photograph: Courtesy Warner Bros Pictures/APThe film nods to this with its title – it’sAMinecraft Movie, notTheMinecraft Movie, because it would be reductive to be so definitive – and, yet, Hess does appear to have taken the easy path, padding the bones of a Jumanji-style offering with blockier skin. Worse still, Hess has a distinctive visual style (he is essentially the Wes Anderson of ironic haircuts) that doesn’t intuitively mesh with the Minecraft look.And for a certain type of fan, that look is not only gospel, but in part fan led. For instance, Element Animation, a YouTube outfit that made its name with lushly animated, absurdMinecraft spoofswere so successful that they ended up being hired by game developer Mojang to make official Minecraft videos. Minecraft is now ultimately a feedback loop between the game and the people who play it, and the movie needed to reflect that.However, the story goes that Hess basically stumbled into making the film – when another project he was working on for Legendary fell through, they asked him to pitch for Minecraft – and perhaps this lack of familiarity shows. After all, Phil Lord and Chris Miller went out of their way to reassure people that they’dplayed with Lego all of their livesbefore making 2014’s rigorously faithful The Lego Movie. Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic went as far as saying that Super Mario Bros was their main source of entertainment as children when they were announced as directors for 2023’s Super Mario Bros Movie.This is the level of familiarity that fans have come to expect, and things have a habit of going wrong whenever directors try to impose themselves too forcefully on a beloved property. The first live-action Mario movie fell apart when it replaced Bowser (a gigantic muscular turtle) with Dennis Hopper in a shiny blazer. Paramount was forced to spend $5m redesigning Sonic the Hedgehog after his appearance in a movie trailer, all tiny eyes and human teeth, horrified viewers. But Minecraft is still a relatively new game. People like Fernandes and ElVitt0ri0, who have been playing the game for long enough to truly understand it, are still only in their early 20s. Maybe one day they’ll make a perfectly faithful Minecraft movie that satisfies the fans, but it won’t be for years.A Minecraft Movie review – building-block game franchise spin-off is rollicking if exhausting funRead moreBut, again, this isAMinecraft Movie, notTheMinecraft Movie. Warner Bros may have done enough to prevent this one from completely flopping – there is wall-to-wall promotion, both in-game and in the real world, plus a second trailer that seems slightly more faithful to the source material. But hardcore devotees may still feel that it’s time to put the fans in charge of any future big-screen offerings. An Element Animation Minecraft film is exactly what my children want to see, but perhaps the reins will be passed to someone else with an innate understanding of the game. As ElVitt0ri0 says, a film based on something as beloved as Minecraft should be “an actual piece of love towards the fans by fans, not just some corpo-vomited product by a big company”.A Minecraft Movie is out on 3 April in Australia and on 4 April in the UK and USExplore more on these topicsFilmMinecraftComedy filmsJack BlackComedyGamesJason MomoafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a game about bloody revenge, but while you’re waiting to retaliate, you can buy lottery tickets and visit the arcade. When Bafta recently asked gamers to vote onthe most influential game of all time, I’m not sure even the most ardent Sega fans would have gambled on the success of an idiosyncratic Dreamcast adventure from 1999. Yet the results, released on Thursday morning, show Shenmue at No 1, with perhaps more predictable contenders Doom and Super Mario Bros coming in second and third respectively.How has this happened, especially considering the game was considered a financial failure at the time of its release, falling short of recouping its then staggering development costs (a reported $70m, which would now get you about a third of Horizon Forbidden West or Star Wars Outlaws)? Well, nostalgia is a funny thing – and so is the concept of cultural influence. When it was released more than two decades ago, Shenmue was an oddity: an open-world role-playing adventure that followed martial arts student Ryo Hazuki as he sought revenge for the murder of his father. But while there were fights and puzzles galore, there was also a lot of … other stuff. The game used an internal clock to switch between day and night, and to cycle through seasons. Often, the people Ryo needed to speak to (or beat up) were only available at certain times, so he had to kill time by wandering the streets of mid-1980s Yokosuka. You could go to shops, play old Sega arcade games, you could visit the hotdog stand. The world was filled with eccentric characters and strange mini-games – including the aforementioned forklift races.What players also enjoyed were its systemic and narrative oddities. Designer Yu Suzuki, who spent the 1980s making some of the greatest arcade games of all time, including OutRun, After Burner and Hang-On, was a stickler for authenticity and simulation – he understood that Ryo’s life would be boring and mundane at times – so that’s what the player got. He also loved to experiment with gameplay conventions, which in Shenmue led to the adoption of quick time events, highly choreographed action scenes in which the player dictates the action by following specific button prompts. It was, let’s say, controversial at the time, but it was interesting. Even the game’s rather wooden voice acting and clipped dialogue enraptured players. To this day, the thought of Ryo wandering the docks asking “Do you know where I can find some sailors?” is comedy gold to those in the know.It was the first time that an epic, immersive role-playing adventure also drew in elements of life simulations and dating games, to expand the interactive repertoire for players. Later titles such asGrand Theft AutoIII, would expand on the idea, but we can perhaps say that the concept of living, explorable worlds came from Shenmue and flavoured everything that has followed, from Assassin’s Creed to Skyrim.Shenmue did end up getting a sequel and, much later, a third title to close the trilogy. I was at the video game event E3 in 2015 when Yu came on to the stage during Sony’s press conference and announced that Shenmue III was in development. It was pandemonium. Sure, you could say thatSuper MarioBros has been more influential because it popularised the platformer and also the concept of a video game mascot character; you could say it was Doom because it made the first-person shooter the most important genre in PC gaming. But I like the fact that Shenmue has won, and not only because I love Sega and edited a Dreamcast magazine at the time. It’s because it shows that gamers still enjoy strange, exotic games, and if that’s the case, strange, exotic games will continue to be made. We certainly see that in the success of Shenmue’s illegitimate children: the Yakuza and Like a Dragon games, where action, dating and silly games still combine to hilarious effect.I like to think that there will always be players willing to just stop fighting for a second, head down to the docks and hunt for sailors.Baftamostinfluentialvideogame ofalltime list in full1.

We stand at a crossroads, wheretechnology, particularly the promise ofartificial intelligence, threatens both to illuminate and to obliterate.Whose perspectives will shape, and whose will be erased from, the future we build? AI, in particular, has become the latest battleground in a culture war that oscillates between unchecked techno-optimism and dystopian fear. We are told, on one hand, that AI will save us – from disease, inefficiency, ignorance – on the other, that it will replace us, dominate us, erase us.Frequently, mainstream discourse around technology and the future is framed in the narrow vision of broligarchs. The philosophy of the broligarchs is a derivative of the techno-utopian Californian ideology promoted in 1990sSilicon Valleyculture. However, this perspective has recently metastasized into the Dark Enlightenment, a techno-authoritarian, neo-reactionary philosophy now embraced by members of authoritarian governments like Elon Musk and in bureaucratic form expressed as Doge.This is where Afrofuturism enters – not just as a genre or an aesthetic, but as a paradigm shift.Contemporary Afrofuturism is a philosophy that empowers African people to locate themselves in the past, present and future with agency. Afrofuturism is transnational and translocal. Afrofuturism offers a vital perspective, not merely as a creative resource, but as a cultural and political framework for reimagining possibilities. Afrofuturism provides tools to envision alternative futures ethically grounded in the Black experience.As Ruha Benjamin reminds us, the “new Jim Code” is not merely a metaphor; it is a reality, where algorithms perpetuate systemic inequalities, a digital echo of historical oppression.Afrofuturism challenges the foundations of what we call “the future”. It rejects the a-historic narratives of clean-slate innovation and insists instead on ancestral reckoning. It knows that futures are made, not found – and that who gets to imagine them is a political question.Born from experimentation and exploration, from historical struggle as well as a wellspring of joy, play and boundless curiosity, Afrofuturism represents resilience and future-making. Our ancestors, facing dehumanization and erasure, created codes in spirituals and sound imagining vibrant, liberated worlds. These “Afro-rithms” were not just acts of resistance; they were the initial cultural software that contributed to forms of Indigenous foresight and liberation tech.Now, as AI evolves with increasing sophistication and speed, it can reflect the biases of its creators. Systems designed with a narrow perspective can perpetuate inequality. As writer and editor Sheree Renée Thomas stated: “We need Afrofuturists, like Walter Greason and William ‘Sandy’ Darity, to interrogate the foundations of global capitalism, to reveal the hidden histories of extraction and exploitation.”As historian Walter Rodney argued, Europe’s post-war redevelopment was built upon the intentional underdevelopment of Africa, a cycle of extraction masked as “fair trade”. Arikana Chihombori-Quao, the former permanent representative of the African Union to the United States, powerfully states, the aid Africa receives is insignificant “peanuts” compared with what the west has taken from the continent. Afrofuturism requires restorative justice.Yet, in the aftermath, Black and Indigenous communities have not only survived. They have created. They have built technologies of renewal, from kinship systems to cultural codes, ontologies that do not submit to nihilistic pessimism, and spirit-based epistemologies that contribute to insurgent data practices. This is the essence of ancestral intelligence – what we call the real AI.Afrofuturism, then, is not a niche or a novelty. It is the future done well – a future that is accountable, embodied, culturally rooted and morally urgent. And in this reactionary moment of AI hype, digital displacement, incels and disaffected rightwing accelerationists, characterized by some as the Dark Enlightenment, Afrofuturism – and ancestral intelligence more broadly – offer our best chance to imagine futures worth living in.For all its reach, AI is bound by the logic of its creators – logics shaped by biased large language models, anti-Black racism, capitalist extraction and techno-utopianism. AI today is coded with the biases of its time and its makers. Because of this, it too often obscures, exploits or erases the very communities who have long practiced their own form of collective healing intelligence: ancestral intelligence.This is the real AI.AfroRithms from the Future– a collaborative, storytelling game Professor Brooks co-designed with Ahmed Best, Jade Fabello, Eli Kosminsky and others – offers a path forward aligned with other imagination games amplifying Black and Indigenous futures as pathways that can leverage ancestral intelligence for us all.Imagine AI griots that channel the wisdom of Angela Davis, Fannie Lou Hamer, Steve Biko or Kwame Nkrumah, revealing the hidden architectures of power, or economic models that dismantle the exploitative structures inherited from Jim Crow, apartheid or colonialism. This is not fantasy. It’s what happens when we channel ancestral wisdom through speculative play. AfroRithms is both world-building and world-remaking.In theBlack Speculative Arts Movement(BSAM), we see blueprints for a different kind of intelligence – one rooted in kinship, reciprocity, imagination and healing.While some futurists speak only in data and charts, Sará King offers a different map: the body. In herScience of Social Justice, King defines healing as integral to futures literacy. This approach forms the basis for building an AI tool in development she calls the “Mirror of Loving Awareness” – cultivating mutual attunement and serving as a neural network of the soul. When we fuse King’s wisdom with the speculative, meditation and imagination become inseparable, giving rise to a new form of futures work rooted in ancestral intelligence.This depth of feeling is what Ahmed Best calls the Emotional Engine – a pathway to the driving emotional force that moves us toward fundamental change in how the futurefeels. It is empathy, purpose, and healing made kinetic. It’s what activates futures not just as ideas, but as lived emotional truths. As Stanford computer science student Anabelle Colmenares observes, ancestral wisdom and AI aren’t opposites – they curve back toward each other. The deeper you go into one, the closer you come to the other.Continuing this convergence of healing and technological foresight, Philip Butler explores the nexus of Blackness, neuroscience, technology and spirituality to shape radically pluralistic and liberatory futures. He is the founder of theSeekr Project, a distinctly designed conversational AI with embedded mental health capacities – an evolution in artificial cognition grounded in culturally attuned, healing-centered design.Together, King, Best and Butler advance a future where care, consciousness and ancestral wisdom become the very architecture of AI. The work of Toniesha Taylor at theCenter for Africana Futuresat Texas Southern University and the non-profit community work of LaWana Richmond and the Grioneers operate at the intersection of AI, visioning, the metaverse and technological futures to prepare young people for opportunities in policy and personal development.Audrey Williams amplifies speculative storytelling and writers withAncestral Futures. Countering the Dark Enlightenment, Alan Clark creates “the world’s most dangerous comix” through Afrofuturist landscapes. Julian Chambliss at Michigan State University actively recovers lost Black historic civic futures. Nina Woodruff, Jasmine Wade and Kaya Fortune reawaken youth agency through theCommunity Futures Schoolenvisioning Oakland in 2045. Nyame Brown conjures artistic Black utopias in hisOnyx universe. Joshua Mays literally covers Oakland in murals of Afrofuturist technicolor, reimagining it as the city of Olgaruth.Stacey Robinson, co-creator ofBlack Kirbyalongside John Jennings, visual artists Quentin VerCetty, Tim Fielder, digital scientist Zaika dos Santos, curator Natasha A Kelly, cosplayer Shannon Theus and theFirst Noble Instituteof the Netherlands reclaim political and visual space for the Black imagination. Their artistic productions are not only illustrations – they’re glyphs, visual nommo, sigils and frequencies of alternate time loops.Then there is Sheree Renée Thomas, whose editorial hand has shaped two volumes of Dark Matter and, recently, Africa Risen, anthologies of speculative African-centered literature that remind us that the future is not inevitable – it is curated. Tiffany Barber curated the End of the World with New York Live Arts, and we survived Covid-19. The work of Sahelian performance artist Ibrahim Oumarou Yacouba AKA Sage Soldat, Cameroon Afrofuturist Nkolo Blondel and South African sound artist Michael Bhatch engage ancestral intelligence at the nexus of heritage and digital innovation. These creators prove that African speculative innovation is not a niche – it is a necessity. It is how Black people carry our futures without dropping our past.The real AI is already here and preparing for these four challenges1 The broligarchs hierarchy v our collective agencyThe current obsession with order through authoritarianism and fantasies of xenophobic neo-feudal enclaves is countered by Afrofuturism’s decentralized communities. Octavia Butler’s Parable of the Sower narratives envisions grassroots networks thriving amid collapse, rejecting top-down control.2 Technology as control v liberationThe PayPal mafia and their ilk frame technology as an accelerant of capitalist alienation, transhumanism and a lack of support for democracy. Afrofuturism reimagines it as emancipatory. Janelle Monáe’s Dirty Computer explores digital consciousness as a site of resistance. Here, innovation fosters connection, not subjugation.3 Historical amnesia v ethical memoryThe techno-authoritarian nostalgia for a mythologized past ignores the violence embedded in historical hierarchies. Afrofuturism insists on confronting legacies of oppression to avoid their repetition, rejecting their a-historical escapism and attempts at the agency reduction of African peoples.4 Collapse v sustainable futurityThe techno-authoritarian impulse welcomes societal collapse as a Darwinian purge. Afrofuturism rejects this nihilism, prioritizing sustainable communities characterized by a spirit of Ubuntu and ecological balance countering the authoritarian death-drive with a commitment to intergenerational care.The urgency of Afrofuturist hopeThe techno-authoritarians offer a future stripped of empathy – a regression to domination disguised as pragmatism. Afrofuturism, by contrast, asserts that another world is not only possible but already being built.It challenges us to wield technology as a tool for justice, or what our ancestors called Maat, to honor history without being shackled to it, and to craft communities grounded in equity. In an age of climate crisis and resurgence of fascism, this vision is not merely artistic – it is a political imperative. The techno-authoritarians’ fatalism is a surrender; Afrofuturism is a rallying cry.Lonny Avi Brooks is Professor and Chair of Communication at Cal State East Bay, co-founder of the AfroRithm Futures Group, and co-creator ofAfroRithms From The Future, a visionary storytelling game that imagines liberated futures through Black, Indigenous, and Queer perspectivesReynaldo Anderson is Associate Professor of Africology and African American Studies Temple UniversityAcknowledgements: we wish to acknowledge Ben Hamamoto and Sheree Renée Thomas for their review of this article and their thoughtful suggestions and edits."

Five world experts answerRead moreSome MPs have been pushing for further restrictions that go beyond harmful content – including onaccess to social media for those under 16, full bans on smartphones in schools or restrictions on social media algorithms that are able to train addictive content on young teenagers.In a paper Orben published this week withfour co-authors in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), they said bans and restrictions were unlikely to be effective – though they did advocate for children and teens to have phone-free spaces.“Bans and restrictions have been successfully used for public health issues such as smoking. But smoking is not comparable with smartphone and social media use because the harms from smoking are extensive, clear-cut and by far outweigh the benefits,” the paper said.“Prescribing abstinence from all technologies to protect against harms is unrealistic and potentially detrimental in a society where technology use is a practical necessity and confers various benefits, including information access and social support.”The paper said that there had been “increased public pressure to mitigate the potential harmful effects of smartphones and social media on health, wellbeing … academic performance, disruptive behaviours and bullying.”But it said the evidence suggested there were “no simple, one-size-fits-all answers” and that while most parents and policymakers were “primed to believe arguments that smartphones and social media are inherently harmful, the evidence about their overall effect on children is not clear-cut”.Bans on devices could “undermine children’s rights to technology design and education that will help them thrive as adults”, the academics warned.The paper acknowledged that for some more vulnerable children “access to certain digital content can result in grave harm” but said legislators should also acknowledge restricting access “can be harmful to other high risk populations”.The researchers did raise concern about “trending content” aimed at younger users to encourage recurrent use, saying those designs were “purposefully not supporting the development of healthy tech habits”.Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary,appointed Orben in January to lead further research into the effects of smartphones on children’s health and wellbeing. Orben, a leading academic in the field, said she did not herself advocate for specific policy positions. Her work has been cited by both opponents and proponents for bans, including by the Australian government, which hasbanned social media for under-16s.She told the Guardian: “Understanding the digital world’s impact on young people is complex and there are no simple solutions. The report my team is currently leading was commissioned by government to produce recommendations on the types of research which could help generate high-quality evidence, not to provide policy recommendations.”“As an independent researcher my role is to examine and communicate evidence clearly, not advocate specific policies. In the BMJ article, we highlighted the benefit of multiple approaches noting technology-free spaces are important but smartphone or social media bans are not a complete solution, as other areas such as digital literacy and platform safety are also important parts of the online safety picture.”Ministers have come under pressure in recent months to go further on smartphone use for teenagers, especially in the wake of the Netflix drama Adolescence which depicts a murder committed by a13-year-old in thrall to toxic “manosphere” content online.The Labour MP Josh MacAlister was forced to drop plans in a private member’s bill on restricting social media algorithms for teenagers when ministers opposed the plans.The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, is reviewing her department’s guidelines on smartphone bans in schools, by looking at a small cohort of schools to see if the current rules are working effectively.The prime minister,Keir Starmer, convened a roundtable with campaigners and the makers of Adolescence in No 10 on Monday, where he suggested that it should be discussed more widely in schools. But he said there “isn’t one single policy lever to pull” when it came to addressing potential harms.The DSIT has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsSmartphonesChild protectionSocial mediaDigital mediaChildrenKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

But there is this important difference. If an asteroid struck the Earth, the impact would at least have been caused by ungovernable cosmic forces. The assault on world trade, by contrast, is a completely deliberate act of choice, taken by one man and one nation.Donald Trump’s decision to imposetariffson every country in the world is a monstrous and momentous act of folly. Unilateral and unjustified, it was expressed on Wednesday in indefensible language in which Mr Trump described US allies as “cheaters” and “scavengers” who “looted”, “raped” and “pillaged” the US. Many of the calculations on which Mr Trump doled out his punishments are perverse, not least the exclusion of Russia from the condemned list. The tariffs mean prices are certain to rise in sector after sector, in the US and elsewhere, fuelling inflation and perhaps recession. Mr Trump will presumably respond as he did when asked about foreign cars becoming more expensive: “I couldn’t care less.”The tariffs – a minimum of 10% on all imports to the US, with higher levies on 60 nations that Mr Trump dubbed the “worst offenders” – throw a grenade into the rules-based global trading order. These are large hikes, not small ones, even for nations like Britain that have escaped the higher tariffs. They are indiscriminate between sectors, but highly discriminatory against nations, all of them, even to the extent of penalisinguninhabited islandsin Antarctica.They overturn the trading system established – under US leadership – atBretton Woodsafter the second world war. In effect, the nation that has underpinned the global economy for the last 80 years has expelled itself from the trading system it always led. That system’s cardinal principle – that countries in the World Trade Organization should treat one another equally – was blown apart on Wednesday.The announcement ceremony conveyed the thrill Mr Trump derives from bullying and domination. A month after shutting down US development aid,his punishment listembodies special contempt for the world’s poor – 47% tariffs on Madagascar, the world’sninth poorestcountry, for instance, or 44% on devastated Myanmar. While much pre-announcement rhetoric was directed at China, some of the toughest tariffs have been inflicted on countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos. The impact on US soft power is likely to be devastating.The British government is trying tokeep calmand carry on. Like its trustworthy trading allies, Britain must do what it can to maintain the rules-based trading system. But economic war is clearly beckoning. The trade secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said on Thursday that even the UK is now preparing a list ofreciprocaltariffs on US goods. It is particularly vital that Britain defends itsinterestsin food and health systems, and against digitaltech giants.Any idea that Britain is a kind of winner in these circumstances, thanks to Brexit, is nonsensical. This country’s supposedly closest ally, the US, has just hiked the cost to British exporters by 10%, with an even greater rise of 25% in the case of steel, aluminium and cars. The consequences of Mr Trump’s tariffs will not be restricted to world trade but will impact on the global economic system more generally. This is a macro moment. It will require macro responses.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

More than 50,000 people have been killed, according to Palestinian health authorities. More are starving because Israel has cut off aid. The offensive is intensifying again – with 100 children killed or maimed each day since Israel resumed heavy strikes last month, the UNreports.Even so, Israel’skilling of 15 Palestinian paramedics and rescue workersis particularly chilling. Though they died on 23 March, it took days for Israel to grant access to the site, the UN said. Another man was last seen in Israeli custody. Two grounds for seeing this not only as tragic but as a war crime stand out. The first is that the UN says the men were shot “one by one”, and a forensic expertsaidthat preliminary evidence “suggests they were executed, not from a distant range”, given the “specific and intentional” locations of bullet wounds. Two witnessessaidsome of the bodies had their hands or legs tied. Prisoners are protected by the Geneva conventions. The second is that medics also enjoyspecific protections.Though the vehicles were clearly marked, the Israel Defense Forces claim that they were “advancing suspiciously” without headlights or emergency signals, a claim disputed bythe sole located survivor. They also allege, without providing evidence, that Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants were among those killed. What is indisputable is the broader pattern of attacks on rescue and health workers. More than 1,000 medics have been killed across Gaza,according to a Guardian investigation, and hospitals reduced to ruins. The World Health Organization says about 300 medical staff have been detained. Several have subsequently described torture, beatings, starvation and humiliation. Doctors who have volunteered in Gaza see a systematic assault upon healthcare and the respected community figures working in the sector.None of this appears of great concern to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister. The international criminal court (ICC) hasissued a warrant for his arreston war crimes charges, but as he visited Hungary on Thursday, Budapestannounced it was withdrawingfrom the court. Donald Trump has emboldened all of those who see the ICC as an enemy and law itself as optional.The president’s plan for the USto “take over” Gaza, dependent on the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, made it all the easier for Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, to say that it will “seize large areas” of the territory. The right has long wanted a land grab. Israel has already extended buffer zones dramatically since the murderous Hamas raids of October 2023 triggered this war.That Mr Katz’s warning came in a week where Mr Netanyahu testified again in his corruption trial, and gave evidence to police (though not as a suspect) over a separate scandal involving allegedlinks between his aides and Qatar, was striking. The prime minister’s political survival remains linked to an endless war, to the despair of the families of the remaining Israeli hostages, as well as Palestinians.The Israeli military says it is investigating the 23 March killings, but only an independent inquiry will suffice. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, described Gaza as the deadliest place on Earth for humanitarian workers and rightly said that those responsible must be held accountable. In an age where impunity flourishes, crimes will multiply. Those who believe in justice must redouble their support for the embattled international institutions seeking to uphold it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Publication of precise tariff rates, went a cheerful line of advance thinking, would at least allow investors to assess the probable trade effects on the basis of hard information. True optimists clung to the idea that Donald Trump would not wish to risk a truly severe market reaction.That narrative was blown apart when the president reached for his pub-style display of wares. This really was a case of going back to the tariffs rates of the 1920s or 1930s. Not even thepenguins of Heard Island and the McDonald Islandswere spared.TheS&P 500 index fell 4%in early trading and is down more than 10% from its high six weeks ago. The dollar fell sharply even though traditional logic says tariffs ought to be currency-positive if $600bn (£457.5bn) of extra revenue is on cards. On this occasion, the market simply adjusted to the higher likelihood of a US recession from higher prices and slower growth.Instead of clarity, there are just more questions. The first is a common one with Trump announcements: how much is designed to be permanent and how much is theatre to provoke a negotiation?On that score, analysts noted the simplistic – or plain perverse – formula behind the administration’s tariff arithmetic. It seems to have taken a country’s trade deficit in goods with US, divided it by its exports to the US and called the resulting number a trade barrier that deserves a “reciprocal” US tariff. The underlying logic, it would appear, is that every country should always have a perfect trade balance with the US – never mind the impossibility of achieving that outcome, and never mind that the tariffs don’t affect trade in services.“We worry this risks lowering the policy credibility of the administration on a forward-looking basis,” said George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank. “The market may question the extent to which a sufficiently structured planning process for major economic decisions is taking place. After all, this is the biggest trade policy shift from the US in a century.”At a push, one could argue that such an unserious methodology is intended to encourage negotiations. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, tried to hint along those lines: “As long as you don’t retaliate, this is the high end of the number.”Yet the opposite conclusion is also valid: it is hard to negotiate with a US partner that, seemingly, isn’t interested in nuances, won’t distinguish between tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade and is simply obsessed with a country’s overall trade balance in goods.That leads to the second question of retaliation, especially from the EU and China. The latter took a February tariff skirmish on the chin but surely can’t afford to ignore a 34% reciprocal tariff that takes its total to 54%.Option A for China is probably a currency devaluation to restore competitiveness (but risking even higher tariffs from the US). Option B would be retaliatory tariffs. Option C would be the longer haul of trying to stir domestic demand. A combination of all three might be the outcome, but all promise further disruption.For the EU, all eyes are on how hard it goes with counter-tariffs to a blanket 20%. The bluntness of Trump’s move almost guarantees a response if only to demonstrate strength before an eventual negotiation. A quick resolution is not the way to bet.The third question is the biggest: what will Trump do when, as virtually every economist predicts, the tariffs backfire? Snap estimates among economists suggested they would take as much as 2 percentage points off US growth this year and add 3 percentage points to inflation. How much pain is Trump prepared to take in pursuit of his signature policy?What Trump’s tariffs could mean for UK consumersRead moreThe view from bond specialist Pimco is that we should be wary. “He is certainly not entirely impervious to a market decline, nor is he unaffected by public sentiment, significant congressional pushback or concerns about a recession,” says Libby Cantrill, its head of US public policy.“So, there is likely a limit to how much pain he and his administration are willing to endure in order to rebalance the economy, but when that is or what that looks like remains to be seen. For now, we should assume that his pain tolerance is pretty high and that tariffs stick around for a while.”That seems a reasonable assumption. Within the internal logic of his trade policy, Trump needs to serve up a tax cut for US workers to parade the “winnings” from his approach; only then could he dial down the tariffs. We are a very long way from that point – if it ever arrives. The political test will come if recession arrives first.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsInternational tradeTariffsGlobal economyEconomicsDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

He might as well have been signposting the odds on a global recession.No country went untouched. The penguins, the sole inhabitants of Heard Island near Antarctica,are in for a hell of a shockthe next time they try to flog some frozen fish to the USA. Let’s hope they were watching on TV.“This is Liberation Day,” saidDonald Trump. “The single greatest day since …” Well, since The Donald’s last single greatest day. These single greatest days seem to creep up on us ever more frequently. But, hey, it was a great day for those currency traders who had bet on the value of the dollar falling. Who had bet that a trade war would bring higher prices across the world and that growth would slow down. Nice work if you can get it.US stock markets tumble as investors shaken by Trump tariffsRead moreNot that The Donald was that bothered. However much he protested otherwise, this wasn’t about Making America Wealthy Again. This was much more primal. Sticking it to all the people who had laughed at him over the years. His bankruptcies. His hair. His orangeness. His stupidity. Sticking it to all those who had taken him to court and won. Now he was the most powerful person in the world. He could do what he liked. He had the whole world watching as he messed it up. And he was doing it simply because he could. There was no one who could stop him. This was the best orgasm he had ever had.Meanwhile the world held its breath. Even though Trump had been elected on a promise to impose tariffs, even though he had sent out the invitations to his White House launch party days in advance, everyone was caught off guard. Almost as if no one had quite believed The Donald would go through with it. Surely there must have been someone in his team who could have persuaded him that this was an idiotic thing to do. For America as much as the rest of the world.Here in the UK, Keir Starmer and the business secretary,Jonathan Reynolds, tried to keep calm. Even though they felt anything but. Underneath what they hoped sounded like an immediate measured response – ‘We are taking a pragmatic approach. Cool heads. No kneejerk retaliation. Blah, blah, blah’ – you could smell the panic.HELP! THE MAN IS A LUNATIC. WE HAVE NO BLOODY IDEA HOW THIS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT. Sure, 10% was better than 20%, but it’s still terrible. Not to mention cars, steel and aluminium. Everything was up in the air. The Orange Manchild was just as likely to increase the tariffs in a few weeks’ time as he was to reduce them. Then there was the effect on the UK of tariffs to other countries. Not forgetting the impact of any retaliatory tariffs that may be imposed on the US by the rest of the world. Bang goes the fiscal headroom. Again. Everywhere you looked was one giant unknown. A fever dream. A trip back to the 1930s.Come Thursday morning, Starmer and Reynolds were hardly in much better shape. So much for things looking rosier after a night’s sleep. But hopefully large doses of Valium and beta-blockers would do the trick. Get them through the media round, sounding as if they vaguely knew what they were doing. That the government was in control of the situation. Cue endless further repeats of “Steady as she goes. Careful consideration. No immediate retaliatory reaction.” Trying to accentuate the positives. Unaware there weren’t any.By the time Reynolds stood up to make a statement to the Commons in the late morning, he almost sounded as if he believed he knew what he was doing. Almost. The UK has a strong trading relationship with the US, he began. So strong, the US had decided to put a bomb under it. He then started singing: “Always look on the bright side of life.”“No county has escaped a tariff,” he went on, “but thanks to our pragmatic approach we have been placed on the lowest tier.” Hooray. Hang out the flags. Sucking up to an abusive president and promising a second state visit had paid off.Or had it? There were loads of other countries – Kosovo and Congo among them – that had also been hit with a 10% rate and they had made no efforts to offer Trump anything. It could just be that what swung it for the UK was that our trade with the US had been more or less balanced. Though don’t tell Starmer or Reynolds that. They would be mentally destroyed to find out their humiliating efforts had meant nothing.Reynolds went on. Slowly, slowly. The government would consult business on retaliatory tariffs over the next month. Wait to see whether other countries blinked first. Hope that the amazing trade deal with the US would emerge from somewhere. Meanwhile there would be a helpline for businesses. An automated voice. Thank you for ringing. Your call is important to us. The government is currently unavailable. Please hold.Earlier in the day, Kemi Badenoch had been surprisingly supportive of the government. Saying tariffs were in no one’s interest and even offering to join the team negotiating with the US. Thanks but no thanks. That’s one way to get the tariffs doubled. Kemi can fall out with anyone. But the leader of the opposition’s collegiality hadn’t reached Andrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary. He was adamant the tariffs were all Labour’s fault. Next up China, India and Japan will be blaming Starmer too.Griffith insisted that Labour ought to have already negotiated a free trade deal with the US and not to have done so was negligence. Someone should have reminded him that the Tories had had eight years to come up with something and failed. I guess amnesia is a coping strategy for him. He also wanted to congratulate himself on the rare sighting of a Brexit bonus. Somehow a 10% tariff was a huge success and a complete disaster. Make up your mind, guys.The rest of the debate passed off in respectful bemusement as no one really knows what’s going on. Emily Thornberry got a laugh by asking if Boris Johnson had any ideas on a trade deal, but otherwise Reynolds stuck to his holding pattern. A deal was there to be made. The only drawback is it’s with Trump. So everything is in the air. Situation Normal All Fucked Up.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe politics sketchInternational tradeGlobal economyKeir StarmerJonathan ReynoldsEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able.I rise tonight because I believe, sincerely, that our country is in crisis.And I believe that not in a partisan sense, because so many of the people that have been reaching out to my office – in pain, in fear, having their lives upended – so many of them identify themselves as Republicans.After months of surrender, the Democrats have finally stood up to Trump – thank you, Cory Booker | Emma BrockesRead moreIndeed, conversations from in this body, to in this building, to across my state – and recently in travel across the country – Republicans as well as Democrats are talking to me about what they feel as a sense of dread about a growing crisis, or what they point to about what is going wrong.The bedrock commitments in our country – that both sides rely on, that people from all backgrounds rely on – those bedrock commitments are being broken.Unnecessary hardships are being borne by Americans of all backgrounds. And institutions which are special in America, which are precious, which are unique in our country, are being recklessly – and I would say even unconstitutionally – affected, attacked, even shattered.In just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans’ safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy, and even our aspirations as a people. From our highest offices: a sense of common decency. These are not normal times in America, and they should not be treated as such.John Lewis – so many heroes before us – would say that this is the time to stand up, to speak up. This is the time to get in some good trouble, to get into necessary trouble. I can’t allow this body to continue without doing something different – speaking out. The threats to the American people and American democracy are grave and urgent. And we all must do more. We all must do more against them.But those 10 words: “If it is to be, it is up to me.” All of us have to think of those 10 words – 10 two-letter words: “If it is to be, it is up to me.” Because I believe generations from now will look back at this moment and have a single question: “Where were you? Where were you when our country was in crisis and when American people were asking for help? Help me. Help me.” Did we speak up?When 73 million American seniors, who rely on social security, were to have that promise mocked, attacked, and then to have the services undermined – to be told that there will be no one there to answer if you call for help – when our seniors became afraid and worried and panicked because of the menacing words of their president, of the most wealthy person in the world, of cabinet secretaries … Did we speak up?When the American economy, in 71 days – 71 days – has been upended, when prices at the grocery store were skyrocketing, and the stock market was plunging, when pension funds, 401(k)s, were going down, when Americans were hurting and looking up, where the resounding answer to this question was: “No.”Are you better off economically than you were 71 days ago? Where were you? Did you speak up?At a time when the president of the United States was launching trade wars against our closest allies, when he was firing regulators who investigate America’s biggest banks and biggest corporations – and stop them from taking advantage of the little guy, or the little gal, or my grandmother, or your grandfather – dismantling the agency that protects consumers from fraud, the only one whose sole purpose is to look out for them … Did you speak up?When the president of the United States, in a way that is so crass and craven, peddled his own meme coin and made millions upon millions upon millions of dollars for his own bank account – at a time so many are struggling economically – did you speak up?Did you speak up when the president of the United States did what amounts to a conman’s house – the White House – when the president tried to take healthcare away? Where were you? Did you speak up?Threatening a program called Medicaid, which helps people with disabilities, helps expectant mothers, helps millions upon millions of Americans – and why? Why? As part of a larger plan to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest among us, who’ve done the best over the last 20 years.For billionaires who seem so close to the president that they sat right on the dais at his inauguration and sit in his cabinet meetings at the White House.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It kept credible contenders out of the Democratic presidential primaries and prevented the selection of a nominee who had gained momentum in the winnowing process. Even after hisstunningly feeble debate performanceon 27 June last year, Biden tookseveral weeksbefore finally opting out of the race. That left Kamala Harris a mere 107 days between the launch of her campaign and election day.Ample evidence shows that the Biden team was riddled with obstinate denial and misrepresentation aimed at the public. But tales of tragic egomania in high places can take us only so far. What’s essential is to scrutinize how – and why – the Democratic party, its leaders and its prominent supporters enabled Biden and his inner circle to get away with such momentous stonewalling for so long.Democrats in Congress, with few exceptions, refused to jump off the Biden 2024 bandwagon until the debate disaster. Similar enabling also came from state party chairs and Democratic governors. Likewise, a wide range of party-allied organizations toed the Biden party line. Meanwhile, many activists took on the role of spectators, if not cheerleaders for another Biden campaign, in an unfolding tragedy of vast proportions.A common denominator was fear. Fear of being accused of disloyalty to the Democratic president. Fear of being ostracized by fellow Democrats or denounced by anti-Trump commentators. Fear of being accused of weakening the party by pointing out Biden’s evident frailty. Fear of damaging personal ambitions or future access to halls of power. And on and on.The silence and compliance helped Biden to coast toward renomination. Yet by midway through his term,polling numbersand increasingly shaky public behavior were clear signals that he would be a weak candidate. Support fromworking-class voters,the young, andpeople of colordrastically eroded.Notably, leading progressives in Congress assisted Biden in fending off a serious primary challenge. Representative Pramila Jayapal, then chair of the congressional Progressive caucus, made a very early endorsement. “I never thought I would say this, but I believe he should run for another term and finish this agenda we laid out,” shesaidin November 2022. Senator Bernie SandersendorsedBiden in April 2023. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezendorsedhim three months later.Bernie Sanders and AOC’s anti-oligarchy rallies show us how to defeat Trump | Eric BlancRead morePollsroutinelyshowedthat most Democratic voters did not want Biden to run again. But party leaders were on autopilot, choosing discretion over valor, benefitting their relations with the White House but undermining the party’s prospects of retaining it – as is now painfully and undeniably clear.A few weeks ago,speakingat a Harvard Kennedy School forum, Jayapalsaid: “I do think had the president just served one term, he would have gone out a hero, he would have passed the torch, he would have been celebrated for his accomplishments, we would have had a really strong Democratic primary with a lot of good candidates, and then we would have had the full election season to fight it out and to actually get somebody who could win.”Now, an open question is whether crucial lessons have been learned and will be heeded. At stake is the capacity of the Democratic party to defeat Trumpist forces in the midterm elections next year and in 2028.The outlook is not good. A grim reality is that the Democratic party and its loyalists have developed an enduring corrosive culture – which had everything to do with the insistence on continuing to fuel the faulty Biden 2024 locomotive as it dragged the party toward a calamitous defeat.I am not writing from a vantage point of hindsight alone. In November 2022, days after the midterm elections, my colleagues and I at the progressive non-profit RootsAction launched the Don’t Run Joe campaign (renamedStep Aside Joewhen Biden announced his candidacy the following spring). During the next 20 months, not one other sizable national organization was willing to push for Biden to forego a re-election bid.Webegan in New Hampshire, the longtime first-in-the-country presidential primary state. (Biden had finished fifth with only8.4%of the vote in the 2020 Democratic primary there. For 2024, hedemotedNew Hampshire to make South Carolina first.) On 9 November 2022, our kickoffdigital adsreached Democrats across New Hampshire. Within days, upwards of2,000 Democratic votersin the state had signed a Don’t Run Joe petition, conveying this message: “We cannot risk losing in 2024. We shouldn’t gamble on Joe Biden’s low approval rating.”That was the gist of our messaging that continued for more than a year and a half via online advertising, email blasts, social media,news releases, media interviews, mass texting to Democratic voters, leafleting at state party conventions andTV adsinseveral key statesand Washington DC. Amobile Don’t Run Joe billboardcircled the Capitol and White House as well as the site of a Democratic National Committeemeeting.Don’t Run Joe placed full-page print advertisements in the Hill, aimed at congressional Democrats. One ad included a picture of men in suits with their heads in the sand. Presented asAn Open Letter to Democrats in the House and Senate, the ad declared that “evasion is no solution” and concluded: “Conformity and fear of a White House rebuke have never served Democrats or the nation well. It is time to stop muffling genuine concerns and start being honest about the pivotal downsides of a prospective Biden ’24 candidacy. The future of the Democratic Party – and the country – is at stake.”For the sake of US democracy, it’s time for Chuck Schumer to step down | Leah Greenberg and Ezra LevinRead moreToday, conformity and fear are still contagions afflicting the Democratic party, now impairing its capacity to roll back Donald Trump’s autocratic rule and effectively fight for a progressive agenda. Therebellionagainst Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, while encouraging, has not shaken the party’s underlying power structure. And habitual deference to uninspiring party leadership does not bode well.The day after the president’s recent demagogic speech to Congress, the new Democratic National Committee chair, Ken Martin, and the House minority leader,Hakeem Jeffries, were the featured speakers for “a virtual National Update and Call to Action”. The next morning, I received a text from a progressive Democratic party activist, who summarized the event as “sad and weak,” adding: “Jeffries and Martin’s delivery was anemic, content essentially pablum.” The activist signed off with the words “Really frightened”.I asked if it would be OK to use the activist’s name while quoting from the text in an article. The reply was both understandable and symptomatic of how fear prevents the kind of open debate that the Democratic party desperately needs: “No, I am working inside the party … ”Norman Solomon is the director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

We need you to shape dreams for kids everywhereJeff YangMaga is coming after the House of Mouse with a cynical attack on its diversity policies. Disney can – and should – fight backThu 3 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 13.04 EDTShareI remember the moment I truly recognized the power Disney has to move young hearts and minds.It was when I attended a sneak preview of Disney’s adaptation of the Chinese legend of Mulan, about a young woman who disguises herself as a man and takes up her wounded father’s sword to defend her nation.I enjoyed the movie, with its combination of swashbuckling, slapstick and show tunes. But as I filed out of the theater, what I saw hit me like a fire-dragon rocket: two blond, apple-cheeked siblings, probably under the age of eight, leaping and sparring and loudly arguing over the right to pretend to be the movie’s main character, Mulan. A boy and a girl, neither of them Asian, both so enthralled by the film’s Chinese protagonist that they each aspired to be her.Creating art under Trump will become harder but it will remain vital | Seph RodneyRead moreIt reminded me that Disney doesn’t just tell stories; it shapes dreams, creating heroes iconic enough to inspire young kids to imagine and be more, and providing empowering figures that enable people from different backgrounds to see themselves – and one another.It’s still staggering for me to think that Mulan, a story from China with a gender-blurred title role, was greenlit, made and released in 1998 and is now broadly accepted alongside Bambi as a timeless animated classic – especially now that Maga has announced it’s coming after the House of Mouse, with the apparent objective to make sure that nothing like it is ever made again.On 27 March, the Trump-appointed Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair, Brendan Carr – a dead ringer for Who Framed Roger Rabbit’s mirthless toon-terrorizer Judge Doom – sent a letter to Disney’s CEO, Bob Iger, informing him that he had directed the agency’s enforcement bureau to begin an investigation into Disney’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies.Carr stated that he wanted to ensure that Disney had not been “promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination”, calling out as examples the company’s employee affinity groups, its “Reimagine Tomorrow” multicultural showcase and especially the company’s “inclusion standards”, a set of goals that aim to increase the number of characters from underrepresented groups to half of the regular and recurring roles on its TV network, ABC.It’s hard to explain why any of these are “discriminatory” or “invidious”; voluntary employee-led clubs – which have no restrictions or requirements for membership – are discriminatory? A website featuring remixes of Disney songs sung by artists of color and explanations of how to sign “Mickey Mouse” in ASL is invidious? Even the “inclusion standards” are just broadly aspirational objectives, which could be met in any number of ways: Disney’s definition of “underrepresented groups” includes women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people, disabled persons and military veterans.But the mere threat of the investigation has triggered Disney to begin a cautious reframing of some of these initiatives. The Reimagine Tomorrow site is gone, and now points to a generic inclusion page headed by the message: “At Disney, we want everyone to belong and thrive.” The company’s business employee resource groups have been redubbed “belonging” employee resource groups.Carr’s letter makes it clear that mere semantic shifts won’t be enough, demanding that Disney’s policies be “changed in a fundamental manner”. And while Carr cites “equal opportunity rules” and the need to ensure “fair and equal treatment under the law”, it’s obvious that he won’t be satisfied until Disney changes the one thing that the FCC is restricted from regulating by the US constitution: its content.View image in fullscreen‘Whatever Trump’s mandate may be, Disney’s demographic mandate should be stronger.’Photograph: Gary Hershorn/Getty ImagesOf course, the first amendment prevents the government from infringing on freedom of expression, except in very narrowly delimited ways. Where the FCC is concerned, the only way it can impose its will on a creative company’s storytelling choices is if they are obscene, indecent or profane or contain dangerous disinformation. So the agency can’t just demand that Disney stop making shows about Asian princesses or Black superheroes or Latina anthropomorphic automobiles.Yet that’s just what Carr is doing – using the back door of equal employment opportunity to claim that by casting people who aren’t straight or white or male in its movies and TV programs, Disney is unfairly withholding employment from straight white males. And unless Disney is ready to announce Timothée Chalamet as the new Black Panther, which, thank God, it isn’t, targeting the studio’s ability to hire diverse talent is a deliberate attempt to force it away from making diverse stories.That would spell business disaster for Disney.Yes, the studio has had its share of flops, which the Maga mob has blamed on multicultural casting – including, most recently, its unfairly pilloried live-action remake of the 1937 animated masterpiece Snow White, starring Rachel Zegler, whose mother is Colombian. The film, made on a $240m budget, has so far earned just $142m at the box office, its prospects poisoned bycontroversyover Zegler’s advocacy on behalf of Palestine and racist backlash over her Latina heritage from online creeps.The positive manifestation of Disney’s profit motive has been that kids growing up today know what it feels like to be mirrored in the media they consumeBut similar attacks were also levied against Disney’s The Little Mermaid remake, starring the African American actor Halle Bailey as Ariel, and that film was a box-office success and global streaming blockbuster. It also made the storyline relevant in new ways to young women – which makes sense, given that Disney’s goal with its remakes isn’t simply to photocopy the past, but to extend and refresh it, reaching untapped audiences of the present and emerging markets of the future.If that means they sometimes swing and miss in the short term, in the long run it all evens out, because Disney doesn’t actually plan their business by quarter or year – they blueprint it by age bracket. Their franchises are designed to be evergreen and intentionally aligned to “graduate” kids up a ladder of content: girls go from Muppets to Disney Fairies to Disney princesses to Disney’s Descendants. Boys go from Cars to Pirates to Star Wars to Marvel superheroes. The ultimate goal is to ensure that there’s something for every stage of growing up until young adulthood arrives and their fans become parents themselves, allowing Disney to earn money across the consumer life cycle, generation after generation.And every generation of Americans ismore diverse. Baby boomers were 29% people of color. Gen X, 41%. Millennials, 46%, gen Z, 50%. The youngest rising cohort – those born after 2012, and currently squarely in Disney’s prime target demo – is officially the first to be “majority minority”, with kids of color making up a full 52% of gen Alpha.Whatever Trump’s mandate may be, Disney’s demographic mandate should be stronger. The company defiantly and successfully resisted attempts by Ron DeSantis to strong-arm it into ending its diversity practices in Florida. While Trump’s flying assault is coming from a higher top rope, the Mouse should still be mighty enough to fend it off and roar back.Disney’s incentive will be what it always has been: making money. But for diverse communities, the positive manifestation of Disney’s profit motive has been that kids growing up today know what it feels like to be mirrored in the media they consume, with all of the psychological and emotional benefits that confers.I’ve seen this first-hand, as someone who grew up in an era nearly devoid of Asian representation in Hollywood, and who went through the bizarre experience of having my elder son, Hudson Yang, star in the first hit TV series focused on an Asian American family. To this day, Hudson still receives surprise hugs from people who grew up tuning into Fresh Off the Boat once a week, and wide-eyed stares from kids who have discovered it years later through TikTok clips and streaming reruns.The network that aired the show for six seasons, beginning in 2014? Disney’s ABC, a decade before inclusion standards existed and before Maga was around to protest them. And that gives me optimism that Disney will keep doing what it has done so well for generations, regardless: give children from a wide array of backgrounds an answer – “now and here” – to the question in Mulan’s signature ballad: “When will my reflection show who I am inside?”Explore more on these topicsWalt Disney CompanyOpinionTrump administrationDonald TrumpRaceSnow WhiteUS politicsRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

I’d sell it now, but prices have droppedThu 3 Apr 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 11.13 EDTShareAfter our children left home, my wife and I decided to treat ourselves and buy a new car for a driving holiday in Europe. We’d been driving a family estate car for years, loading it up with kids and making trips to and from universities, but we wanted something for ourselves.As a surprise, she booked a test drive for the Tesla Model S for my birthday. It was unlike any car I’d been in before. I thought “Wow, this is amazing.” It felt like the future: a computer on wheels that was constantly updating with new features. I can’t say I feel that way now – and many people seem to share that view. Tesla sales figuresdeclined by 13% in the first few months of this year. Others feel even more uneasy:more than 200 demonstrations happened last weekendoutside company facilities around the world to protest against Elon Musk and the wrecking ball he has taken to the federal government.I had no complaints about the car itself: it was quiet. It was large. And, importantly for us, as an electric vehicle it was environmentally friendly. Some people go for the sports car when they gain a new sense of freedom in later life, but I had done a bit of research and wanted to move away from diesel and petrol.Despite people voicing concerns about a lack of charging infrastructure, I found Tesla’s network to be wonderful. We drove all over Europe – driving to Switzerland one year, Italy another, and last summer to the south of France. At one point we even packed in five adults and all their suitcases after an airport pickup.I would consider myself left-leaning, but buying an electric car wasn’t a huge political statement for us at the time, but rather an acknowledgment of the way things are going to be in the future. Little did I know how our choice would be politicised for us six years down the line.In the early years of owning the car I remember a neighbour saying: “What is it like to own a car built by a madman?” But I brushed it off. I had watched videos of Musk at Tesla events, and he seemed like a poor man’s Steve Jobs. Much like the Apple CEO, I saw Musk as a frontman rather than the designer and didn’t take much notice of the business owner.Soon it was impossible to ignore him. My wife and I were horrified as he publicly adopted rightwing positions – with his endorsement of Donald Trump for US president and then for thefar-right AfDin Germany, as well as his support forTommy Robinson. It seemed so odd to us that a man who would champion electric vehicles would also hold such reactionary views.I started to notice a shift in the Tesla owners’ group on Facebook. Having not owned an electric car before, the group was a useful resource. People were very helpful and even recommended places to stop off during our European holiday. When Musk’s politics began to grow more extreme, members began to post that they no longer felt comfortable owning a Tesla. And then others would respond: ““We’re not interested in your politics.” I saw someone giving stick to the Guardian and even calling the BBC “BBC Stalin”, which was funny for me as I always personally felt it went too far the other way.View image in fullscreenProtesters demonstrate against Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, during a nationwide Tesla Takedown rally outside a dealership in Pasadena, California.Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesI started to reflect on owning a Tesla and it was my daughter who made the case for selling it. But judging by people posting secondhand cars in the Facebook group, prices have been dropping. I feel trapped. I cycled to meet a friend recently, and he took one look at my reasonably nice bike and said “It’s probably worth more than your Tesla now.” Someone else said to me he was interested in buying a Tesla, but he was going to wait until they were virtually worthless.It’s a shame as in every other way the car is a perfect match for our lifestyle. It’s cheap to run, easy to service and Tesla has a mobile repair service that dispatches a “ranger” to your house to fix any issues.If I was buying a car from scratch I would boycott the company, but we are where we are. For now I am going to have to keep hold of it. Next time, maybe I’ll get a European electric vehicle.

It’s time for Congress to return to the seed businessThu 3 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 08.32 EDTShareFrom 1862 until 1923, US senators and members of Congress provided vast numbers of seeds to constituents. At its peak, the congressional seed distribution program deliveredover 60m seed packetsdirectly to farmers and market gardeners every year, helping introduce new varieties of everything from wheat and corn to oats, soybeans, flowers and vegetables. A century later, far fewer Americans till the soil for a living, but seeds remain central to our lives.To understand the importance of seeds, try to imagine a morning without them. It would begin naked on a bare mattress, with no cozy sheets or pajamas, and there would be no fluffy towel to wrap up in after your shower. All of those things come from the seeds of the cotton plant. Stumbling wet into the kitchen, you would find no coffee, and no toast or bagel to go with it. There would be no eggs, no bacon, no cereal, no milk. All of those staples come from seeds or from livestock raised on seed crops. And if you thought you might console yourself with a chocolate bar, you can forget it. Cocoa powder, and the cocoa butter that makes it melt in your mouth, are both derived from seeds.Logging is quietly ravaging US forests. Trump is taking an axe to protectionsRead moreMaintaining the seed diversity and abundance we rely on requires constant development of new varieties to combat disease, increase production and adapt to changing conditions. Seed advances are particularly urgent now, as farmers confront the fickle weather of a warming planet while working to meet a projected50-60% rise in global food demand by 2050. Although elected officials no longer send out seeds through the mail, federal support for these efforts remains vital.In the era of Doge, that support has been flipped on its head.The US Department of Agriculture employs many plant breeders directly and funds many more through grants and partnerships, but the crown jewel of its seed program resides in a bunker-like building in Fort Collins, Colorado. The national seed bank housesmore than 2bncarefully preserved specimens in a facility designed to withstand floods, fires, earthquakes, power outages and tornadoes. With over620,000 varieties from nearly 17,000 different species, it is one of the world’s largest seed collections and a major supplier to the global seed vault in Svalbard, Norway.Plants don’t wait on politics. Any seed varieties lost now will simply be unavailable to improve crops and address challenges in the futureIt is also at risk.While words like “vault” and “bank” imply simply turning the key and walking away, managing a seed collection demands constant activity. Even in cold storage, the specimens steadily degrade and must be tested regularly to make sure they’re still viable. When germination rates drop for any particular sample, those seeds must be planted and grown to maturity – in the right conditions – to produce a fresh supply. That activity takes place atover 20 research stationsin locations (and climates) as diverse as North Dakota, Texas, California, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.Known officially as theUS National Plant Germplasm System, the seed bank and its network of regional facilities recentlylost 10% of their workforcein the Doge firings, including farm managers, research scientists, lab technicians, IT specialists, orchardists and more. Some have since beenrehired, at least temporarily, but the program remains in turmoil. Projects interrupted or suspended range from germination trials to seed regeneration, research lending and many longterm breeding programs, weakening the entire enterprise.Plants don’t wait on politics. Any seed varieties lost now will simply be unavailable to improve crops and address challenges in the future. The importance of a robust and diverse seed bank cannot be overstated. To combat the invasive Russian wheat aphid, for example, plant breeders screenedover 54,000 wheat and barley samplesto find a handful of precious strains with natural resistance.It’s time for Congress to return to the seed business. Without its intervention, backed by the courts, additional firings appear imminent. Undermining the nation’s seed security undermines its food security and embodies the definition of reckless: “utterly unconcerned about consequences”.For those in the seed world, that attitude is hard to fathom. After all, planting a seed is always about what comes next, a conscious act of forethought and optimism. In other words, an act of hope.Thor Hanson is a biologist and author whose books include The Triumph of Seeds and Close to Home.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentOpinionAgricultureFarmingTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

This is foolishness gone wildThu 3 Apr 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 07.03 EDTShareWhen Iwrote an opinion piecefor the Guardian a few months ago, anticipating Donald Trump’s foreign policy regarding the Middle East, I made a big mistake.I thought that there would be diplomacy involved, even if it was ill-conceived. Instead, the complete lack of diplomatic rendering in this administration’s foreign policy is already pointing in dangerous directions, especially regardingIsrael, the Palestinians, Jordan and Egypt. Saudi Arabia, the sleeping giant that’s in a key position to provide a roadmap to a fair resolution for both Israelis and Palestinians, seems to be sitting on the sidelines now.The fact that the Trump team has proposed no realistic diplomatic settlement (alas, condos in Gaza along with depopulation hardly counts) means that there is a void being filled by Benjamin Netanyahu. While there was frustration among some progressives regarding Joe Biden’s diplomatic efforts, the reality is that he and his experienced team were trying to create change on the ground that could benefit both Israelis and Palestinians and, at the same time, fulfill what had been a decades-long professed American interest in two states and against terrorist groups.Israel executes unarmed Red Crescent paramedics with the west’s blessing | Ahmed MoorRead moreTo abandon an idea of diplomacy, as this administration has done, will lead to more deaths and destruction. The Middle East – and especially civil society inside Israel, the Palestinians, Egyptians and Jordanians – has also been a huge recipient of US soft aid. This aid, now completely disappeared overnight, helped to promote partnerships among people, frayed though they were in the last years. USAID’s dissolution cancelled decades of American financial support to create more equality between Jewish and Arab citizens inside Israel, to support Palestinian women and grassroots efforts within the occupied Palestinian territories, to enhance democracy-building apparatuses within the occupied Palestinian territories and inside of Israel itself, and so much more.Meanwhile, unschooled in history or diplomacy, this administration is now quickly emptying out its experienced foreign service officers and diplomats. The career diplomat Hans Wechsel, the head of the state department’s office of Palestinian affairs in Jerusalem, announced his early retirement because hereportedly“didn’t like the direction the ship was heading”.This loss of career diplomats leaves an open road for an energetic ideologue like the incoming US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, a fanatical believer in the right of Israeli Jewish settlers (and an Israeli government that supports the settlers) to take over the West Bank, because God gave the land to the Jewish people – notwithstanding the millions of Palestinians who live there.As frustrated as American progressives were about the Biden strategy for Israel-Palestine, it can’t be overstated how much the professionalism of the state department and the embassies in the region aimed to temper rightwing fundamentalism on all sides, aided progressive civil society organizations and simply saved lives. This is all gone now.As I write this, Trump is threateningIranwith bombs and his new favorite toy, tariffs.It’s critical to understand that threatening Iran (which also provides financial and military support to Hamas and other Islamic actors in the region) could have overwhelming consequences for the safety of Israelis and Palestinians alike.To discount a real diplomatic track is foolishness gone wild when considering how to deal with, and respond to, Iran. It was only a few months ago, after all, that Israelis witnessed massiveair attacks from Iranthat also threatened Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the entire West Bank. What stopped the missiles? Extraordinary diplomatic efforts from countries, named and unnamed, from Europe and the Middle East, assembled and coordinated by the Biden administration.Instead, the only US diplomacy under way right now appears to be by the president’s golfing buddy, Steven Witkoff, who has no foreign policy experience. Case in point: Witkoff was included on thenow infamous Signal chain– led by the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and including the Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg – while in Moscow, where Iranian intelligence officers abound, not to mention the Russians themselves (although the White House saysWitkoff did not actually use Signalduring the trip). According toPolitico, it was one of many Signal chats led by the national security team for discussing global crises.View image in fullscreen‘Ramallah, where the Palestinian Authority offices are located, feels like an isolated city-state.’Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesWitkoff’s extraordinarily ill-advised interview with Tucker Carlson a week ago included all sorts of nuggets that have further complicated any efforts in the region to either halt the Gaza war or save the remaining live Israeli hostages. In at least one case, he recited incorrect information about the domestic Egyptian economy, and according toZvi Bar’el, a reporter for Haaretz, his off-the-cuff remarks infuriated the Egyptian leadership. (They are already unhappy because they proposed a diplomatic plan to end the war between Hamas and Israel that was ignored by both the US and Israel.)Witkoff has earned the support of some of the Israeli hostage families since his personal outreach to them touched families whose own government scorns them. But in his statements this week, Witkoff offered Israelis only endless war by allowing the Israeli prime minister to continue down that path.The Israeli people are exhausted. More reservists arenot showing up for dutyto fight the renewed war in Gaza, despite the tacit agreement between the society and the state that calls on soldiers to serve when they receive a notice of call for duty. This shortfall can be attributed to the significant numbers of Israelis who see the renewed Israeli offensive as nothing but a ploy by Bibi, enmeshed in a serious legal battle to stay out of prison for corruption charges. A poll this week by Channel 12, one of Israel’s top TV news outlets, shows that70% of Israelisdon’t trust Netanyahu and 69% want a ceasefire, fearing that renewed war will further harm the hostages. Yet these numbers and sentiments are being ignored by a US administration that appears increasingly to rely on Netanyahu and his small set of very loyal rightwing advisers who share one overriding goal: to stay in power.I was recently in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. Ramallah, where the Palestinian Authority offices are located, feels like an isolated city-state, filled with politicians unable to govern, partly due to their being ignored by the Israeli government and the US government, and workers unable to get paid, due to massive financial shortfalls.After riding in a taxi through the Qalandia refugee camp, I crossed the Qalandia checkpoint on foot. On a public bus back to my hotel in East Jerusalem, I meandered through Palestinian villages and neighborhoods under Israeli occupation. Aside from the Palestinian friend by my side, I was the only adult on the bus, which was filled with schoolchildren on their way home from school, playing games on their mobile phones and eating snacks stuffed into their backpacks. One young girl sat across from me, her eyes expanding and a shy smile on her face, as she heard us talking in English.

On 2 April, the defence minister, Israel Katz,announced plansto seize large areas of Gaza with the aim of eliminating Hamas’s remaining infrastructure and establishing new security zones that will split Gaza in two. This escalation, which began in mid-March with intensified airstrikes, is intended to encourage a mass exodus of the local population, and has led to substantial civilian casualties. ​Despite the international outcry over more than 50,000 deaths, 110,000civilian injuriesand significant displacement of Palestinians, the Israeli government rationalises and justifies these moves as necessary for security against an undefeated Hamas. Ultimately, though, Israel’s actions imperil the fragile ceasefire negotiations, its broader credibility and wider hopes for a political process to end the conflict. In reality, this would be the only viable path to stability and security.As it stands today, the ceasefire brokered in January 2025 with mediation from the US, Egypt and Qatar has in effect collapsed. The deal that was presented as a three-part process was always seen as being tenuous. The prisoner exchange and hostage release alongside a phased Israel military withdrawal proceeded with fits and starts, leading to the completion of the first stage in early March. During that period, 33 of the hostages werereleasedto a traumatised Israeli public. Hamas made a display of the release of Israelis as part of a grotesque propaganda campaign to showcase their continued survival.Buoyed up by President Trump’s statements of support for Israel – including the outlandish proposal tocreate a riveria in the Middle Eastthrough the displacement of Palestinians – Benjamin Netanyahu, as expected, proved unwilling to move to the next phase of the ceasefire, which would have seen negotiations over a permanent cessation of hostilities. Instead, the government is using harsh military tactics to press Hamas toreleasethe remaining 59 captives, 24 of whom arebelieved to be alive.View image in fullscreenIsraeli security forces try to disperse an anti-government demonstration calling for an end to the war in Gaza and the return of all the hostages held by Hamas, Jerusalem, 31 March.Photograph: Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty ImagesNetanyahu also has a number of personal and political motivations driving the military campaign. He remains under pressure from far-right factions in his cabinet that oppose moving to the second phase of the ceasefire and instead seek to expand Israel’s security through the creation of buffer zones and land grabs. Indeed, the government has recently approved the expansion of more settlements in theWest Bank. With Netanyahu facing wider domestic criticism and legal pressures, the war provides a rallying narrative and a distraction from the scandal and corruption within his office.Israelreturning to Gazato “get the job done” delays any political reckoning for its own security failures. The creation of a permanent corridor inside Gaza’s northern and eastern edges is officially intended to prevent future cross-border attacks. While Israel maintains that it does not seek permanent governance over Gaza, its operations indicate a significant shift toward long-term control over security in the territory.The Gaza paramedic killings: a visual timelineRead moreThe physical occupation of certain zones is said to be the only way to ensure that Hamas can’t regroup. But it is also clear that the Israeli governmentaims to stymieany reconciliation process between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. By focusing on eradicating Hamas and refusing to deal with it politically, Israel has clear ambitions of reordering the fractured Palestinian leadership.The broader and bigger challenge is that Israel refuses to articulate or engage over a clear postwar governance plan. In March, Arab statespresented a plan for reconstruction and redevelopment of Gazain which Hamas would cede power to a transitional technocratic government while the Palestinian Authority was reformed. However, this plan was immediatelyrejectedby Israel and the Trump administration as unrealistic.Amid this military escalation and political stalemate, strained negotiations continue to be led by Egypt and Qatar, which are trying to revive discussions with a new proposal involving a full hostage release in exchange for a permanent ceasefire. Rebuffing this proposal,Israelhas presented a counter offer under which Hamas would release about half of the hostages who are still alive and some of the dead hostages in exchange for a 40-day ceasefire. By refusing to commit to a formal end of the conflict, let alone discuss what comes next, Israel clearly intends to use military pressure to force its unknown endgame. As of now, it appears to be the permanent reoccupation of the Gaza Strip. In the absence of serious and persistent regional and international attention and pressure, this outcome will not result in a ceasefire, or pave the way towards a meaningful political process.Sanam Vakil is a senior research fellow in the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham HouseDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is an artefact of its time, before newfangled technology like laptops and having the internet in other places besides one room of your school. It’s also an artefact of its time in another important way: it is completely covered in images of hot guys of the time.Looking at it, you would assume that I was a regular horny straight teen girl, cutting out photos of Leonardo DiCaprio and Will Smith and Hanson to plaster all over my diary so the world could see my very-normal-don’t-look-too-closely-ha-ha desire for men. Well, it may shock you to learn that I wasn’t a normal straight teenage girl. I was a deeply closeted and sad teenage lesbian. I knew that something was different about me from about 11, even though at the time I hadn’t met any gay people, there were no gay people in pop culture, and there was no Google to ask “why am I weird”.How tired we all are, having worked this hard to get this far, only to see our progress backsliding againIt took me a long, long time to figure it all out, and even longer to feel safe telling anyone. Six or seven years after realising I was queer, I was still carefully choosing photos of men to pretend to be into, spending hours figuring out ways to remain undiscovered. I would continue this charade until I was about 22, when I finally came out. This is an effect of marginalisation, of discrimination and hate that doesn’t get spoken about enough. The amount of time, the amount of brain space, the amount of ENERGY it takes to livenot as yourselfis remarkable, and draining.View image in fullscreenRebecca Shaw’s teenage diary.Photograph: Rebecca ShawI also visited my home town last week for the first time in over a decade. Even though I am now 42 years old, have lived an extremely loud gay Sydney life for years, and was there holding hands with my girlfriend, I felt a heaviness in my chest. Remembering that time means acknowledging the years that I lost because society didn’t or wouldn’t understand me. It means thinking about what I could have done or been if I hadn’t used so much of my brain space on trying to hide myself, change myself, be anything but the real me. Instead of thinking about school and my real crushes and my future, I had to shut myself down, focusing on my differences and how to minimise them.Trump singled me out for ruining women’s sport. This is my response to him |  Austin KillipsRead moreI thought about all of the energy that the LGBTQI community has had to expend over decades; so much fighting to move forward inch by grudging inch. How tired we all are, having worked this hard to get this far, only to see our progress backsliding again in the face of rising anti-LGBTQI hate, pushed by politicians all over the world. I thought about the energy levels of the people in my community who have to fight even harder, like those who aren’t white and those who aren’t cisgender.While on a break from writing this (scrolling on another screen), I saw anInstagram postfrom comedian Mae Martin about their journey, and this bit struck me: “Transitioning unlocked a whole new part of my brain, and freed up a lot of mental space that had previously been occupied by anguish.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided by Instagram.

When I think about how much of my brain space has been taken up by the stress of being gay in a homophobic world, and I compare that to what my trans friends have to go through, to deal with and stay safe in the rampant transphobia of society in whatever ways they can – I can’t even imagine.Thinking about how much energy we all use up just trying to exist, I couldn’t help but consider the flipside. The energy that is usedagainstus, to push back our rights, or attack us. The energy politicians are expendingboth overseasandat homeon fighting queer and trans people is a disgraceful waste and a distraction. In Australia, where people are struggling to pay bills and buy groceries and insure their homes against climate change events, the Coalition is using its energy to talk about the “woke” agenda in schools ahead of the election. In the US, the Trump administration is spending its energy on a similarly misguided scourge of “wokeness”. But where young queer people often have no choice but to spend most of their energy on keeping themselves safe – these governments and people in powerdohave a choice.I have unlimited energy to keep fighting for our community, we are not going anywhere – I would just rather we all got to use our energy for living true and good lives instead.Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in SydneyIn Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

This is a chilling new stepHanno HauensteinThe country’s so-called political centre has licensed a new era of authoritarianism – to the AfD’s delightThu 3 Apr 2025 07.11 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 07.29 EDTShareAcrackdown on political dissent is well under way in Germany. Over the past two years, institutions and authorities have cancelled events, exhibitions and awards over statements about Palestine or Israel. There are many examples: the Frankfurt book fairindefinitely postponingan award ceremony for Adania Shibli; the Heinrich Böll Foundationwithdrawing the Hannah Arendt prizefrom Masha Gessen; the University of Colognerescinding a professorshipfor Nancy Fraser; the No Other Land directors Basel Adra and Yuval Abrahambeing defamedby German ministers. And, most recently, the philosopher Omri Boehmbeing disinvitedfrom speaking at this month’s anniversary of the liberation of Buchenwald.In nearly all of these cases, accusations of antisemitism loom large – even though Jews are often among those being targeted. More often than not, it is liberals driving or tacitly accepting these cancellations, while conservatives and the far right lean back and cheer them on. While vigilance against rising antisemitism is no doubt warranted – especially inGermany– that concern is increasingly weaponised as a political tool to silence the left.Germany has recently taken a chilling new step, signalling its willingness to use political views as grounds to curb migration. Authorities are now moving to deport foreign nationals for participating in pro-Palestine actions. As Ireported this weekin the Intercept, four people in Berlin – three EU citizens and one US citizen – are set to be deported over their involvement in demonstrations against Israel’s war on Gaza. None of the four have been convicted of a crime, and yet the authorities are seeking to simply throw them out of the country.The accusations against them include aggravated breach of the peace and obstruction of a police arrest. Reports from last year suggest that one of the actions they were alleged to have been involved in included breaking into a university building and threatening people with objects that could have been used as potential weapons.But the deportation orders go further. They cite a broader list of alleged behaviours: chanting slogans such as “Free Gaza” and “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, joining road blockades (a tactic frequently used by climate activists), and calling a police officer a “fascist”. Read closely, the real charge appears to be something more basic: protest itself.All four are also accused – without evidence – of supporting Hamas and of chanting antisemitic or anti-Israel slogans. Three of the deportation orders explicitly cite Germany’s national commitment to defend Israel, its so-calledStaatsräson, or reason of state, as justification.Legal experts told me that invokingStaatsräsonin deportation proceedings is legally dubious. A recent parliamentary review reached a similar conclusion, noting thatStaatsräson– often cited to justify Germany’s foreign policy toward Israel, including the plan of the incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz, toinvite Benjamin Netanyahudespite an active international criminal court arrest warrant – carries no legally enforceable weight.This kind of repression isn’t new in Germany. The lawyer Alexander Gorski told me he has handled similar cases where migration law was used against people of Arab or Palestinian descent – often triggered by a social media post, comment or even a “like”.Today, politicians across Germany’s political spectrum routinely invoke the country’s history to silence criticism of Israeli policy – backing a state accused ofenforcing apartheidin the West Bank and, as a growing consensus among human rights experts argues,committing genocidein Gaza.Using immigration law to police political protest sends a clear message to non-citizens in Germany: speak out and you may risk losing your status – or being deported. The extent to which this plays into the hands of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) seems lost on much of Germany’s so-called political centre. For the AfD,Staatsräsonhas become a convenient shield: a way to stoke resentment against migrants allegedly “importing” antisemitism and push back against a broader, more inclusive culture of remembrance, often reductively dismissed as “postcolonialism”. All of it is cloaked in the language of unwavering support for Israel.The AfD recently securedabout 20%of the vote in Germany’s federal elections. Just weeks before the election, Elon Musk expressed his support for the party during a live discussion with its leader, Alice Weidel. At one point, Weidel absurdly called Adolf Hitler “a communist” and claimed that “leftish Palestinians” in Germany are antisemitic. As outrageous as these remarks were, they reflect a broader trend that the liberal centre unwillingly helped to normalise – a drift that exploits anti-Palestinian sentiment to fuel far-right revisionism.The US government is effectively kidnapping people for opposing genocide | Moira DoneganRead moreWhile Germany’s established parties still formally reject cooperation with the AfD, their growing accommodation of AfD-style rhetoric – especially on migration – tells a different story. In the runup to the election, parties across the spectrum, from the Greens to the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), spoke about migration as a security threat, and promised deportations and tighter controls. In this climate, Palestine has turned into somewhat of a litmus test for asylum policy.Last year, Merz declared that Germany would not accept refugees from Gaza, stating: “We already have enough antisemitic young men in the country.” After the newly elected Die Linke MP Cansın Köktürk recently appeared in parliament wearing a scarf resembling a keffiyeh, members of the conservative CDU pushed to ban such symbols in parliament. No such objection was raised when the AfD MP Torben Bragawore a blue cornflower– asymbol usedby Austrian Nazis in the 1930s – in the same chamber. Braga said it was not a cornflower and called the accusation “absurd”.With a new conservative government in power, the crackdown on Palestinians and migrants – already well under way with the so-called traffic-light coalition – is set to escalate even further. Germany is at a crossroads: it can choose to uphold the principles it claims to stand for, or continue down a path of authoritarianism. For now, the direction seems unmistakably clear.Hanno Hauenstein is a Berlin-based journalist and author.

Here’s why that’s a huge problemThu 3 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 08.45 EDTShareEveryone is talking aboutAdolescence, the television drama focused on toxic masculinity that has triggered a continuing social and political debate. But only a handful of people are talking about what the hit drama says about the real-time crisis unfolding in the British television industry – and that needs discussion too.Adolescence is everything public service broadcasting should be: hard-hitting programming featuring the kind of people often ignored in TV drama – in this case, white working-class families in the north – discussed at the school gate andin parliament.After its British writer, Jack Thorne, met Keir Starmer in Downing Street, it was revealed that Adolescence was to be rolled outfor freeacross all UK secondary schools.The free bit needs emphasising because, unlike traditional public service broadcasters behind classic hits fromCathy Come HometoMr Bates vs the Post Office, Adolescence was commissioned by Netflix, one of the US-based streamers whose subscription models have appeared like missile-loaded drones landing on cash-strapped British broadcasters.View image in fullscreenRay Brooks and Carol White star in the 1966 BBC drama Cathy Come Home.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyFor many of the 66 million viewers who helped make Adolescence themost-watched UK title on Netflix ever, such a statement will come across as typical through-a-glass-darkly Britishness, when such brilliant TV should only be a cause for celebration. Using British talent to tell universal stories to a global audience should be win-win. Netflix also deserves huge credit for trusting the brilliant Stephen Graham, as well as Thorne (who also wrote the platform’s recent hitToxic Town).But Adolescence is still a rarity for US giants like Netflix. Far more common a phenomenon is streamers such as Netflix, Amazon, Apple and Disney ratcheting up production prices for domestic broadcasters such as the BBC and ITV, which are already struggling with declining revenues. In their bid to produce more and more content to keep their global users happy, streamersspent £2.82bn on British-made contentin 2024, up £600m in a year. Such investment has driven up production and talent costs, with the total spent on high-end TV produced in the UK up 11% last year, despite more than 40 fewer premium projects being undertaken. So more money has to be spent making fewer shows.Faced with real-terms funding cuts ofmore than a thirdsince 2010, the BBC announced on Monday that it would cut spending oncontent by almost £150min the next financial year. It blamed this “unprecedented content funding challenge” on the fact that, as well as driving up prices, streamers such as Netflix no longer agreed to share costs and revenues with UK broadcasters in so-called co-production deals. Latest figures from the British Film Institute suggest that total spending by all domestic broadcasters last year fell to thelowest level of investment since 2019, ( once you have stripped out the anomaly of 2020, when Covid shut down all film and TV production).View image in fullscreenMark Rylance and Damian Lewis in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light.Photograph: Nick Briggs/BBC/Playground EntertainmentDoes any of this matter, given the glories of current British television and the fact that when savings are made on screen, it is often only insiders who notice? Of course it matters. Thorne indicated that one scene on Adolescence which used 300 extras – the school fire drill – would have been too expensive for a public service broadcaster. Peter Kosminsky, the much-garlanded director of Wolf Hall, admitted that on the BBC expensiveoutdoor sceneshad to be axed and the most highly paid people behind the award-winning drama, including himself and lead actor, Mark Rylance,had to take significant pay cutsto get it made. Kosminsky warned that, without intervention, the British TV industry would get squeezed out of the big TV drama market because of “the inflated cost environmentcreated here by the streamers”.TheProducers Alliance for Cinema and Television(Pact) – the lobby group for the whole industry – reveals that15 TV dramasgreenlit by UK public service broadcasters were then mothballed because of escalating costs. We hear about the impact on drama, but no less affected is factual entertainment, and series such asDavid Attenborough’s Planet Earth. They too are feeling the squeeze because of the death of production deals.So what can be done? Kosminsky has lobbied MPs fora 5% levyon all UK subscription streaming revenues, with the proceeds collected for a British cultural fund to spend on television content. This system would not only bring in more money than the existing, slightlycomplicated tax creditsystem for so-called high-end TV, but would help end the argument that everything should be done to encourage global streamers and their ilk to invest in UK talent.Politicians must also do their bit. Although keen to have tea with Thorne and theAdolescencecreators, Starmer and his government have so far done absolutely nothing to address the issue facing British television, or to harness its soft power potential.Because if not now, when? We stand at one of those moments when a TV show reminds us why television matters: television that is more than entertainment, television that makes us think and reflect on ourselves, television that moves the dial. That never came cheap, it never will – but it’s hard to overestimate its value.Jane Martinson is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTelevision industryOpinionAdolescenceNetflixBBCITVTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

A Labour party led by “sensible moderates” may not be your first choice, but it is the only hope for the most vulnerable.As Labour imposes poverty on up to 400,000 people through cuts to disability benefits,according to estimatesby the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, this argument is submerged under a tidal wave of misery. The government has already robbed many pensioners of their winter fuel payments, and not only voted to keep a Tory two-child benefit cap thatimposes squalor on hundreds of thousands of children, butsuspended those Labour MPs who opposed it. A Labour party that knowingly imposes hardship on disabled people, pensioners and children has filed for moral and political bankruptcy.Yet there is a vast appetite for something different.Most voters thinkBritain is returning to austerity or never left it.Seven in 10 do not expectLabour to “improve the lives of people like me”, andmore than half think that the governmentis either not trying to limit hitting “vulnerable groups”, or is actively choosing to target them. The Labour chancellor, Rachel Reeves,has similar ratingsas Kwasi Kwarteng secured after administering Liz Truss’s mini-budget.Polls showoverwhelming support for public ownershipof services and utilities and that78% of the publicback a wealth tax.Most Britonsback rent controls – including Tory voters, witheven landlordsevenly split – and two-thirds advocate expanding social housing so it’s not just available for “the most vulnerable”.Some continue supporting Labour in lieu of an alternative: according to YouGov, more Labour voters than not now disapprove of the government, an astonishing statistic given the party’ssupport has plummetedto less than a quarter of the electorate. Some stop voting.Some may optfor the Greens, but its four MPs have failed to offer any cut-through leadership, despiteuniquelyfertile circumstances. Others defect toindependent candidates, but their success is based on ad hoc local initiatives. And, bleakly, others may opt for Reform UK, which fills the vacuum as the ultimate protest vote, even though the party backs cutting benefits for disabled people, increasing privatisation of the NHS andslashing taxes for the rich.The obvious question, then, is: why is the left failing to profit from this mass appeal? A media ecosystem rigged in favour of the right hardly helps, but witness how Citibanker-turned-equality guru Gary Stevenson is reaching millions through YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. Despite the likes of Elon Musk gaming algorithms in favour of the Trumpian right, it is easier for the left to reach the wider electorate than ever. The left has just failed badly to harness social media platforms for its own advantage.The main hurdle is obvious: an absence of leadership. The left has a theory of change that centres collective struggle. It needs a leader that can bridge a divide. Crudely, that means appealing to older, overwhelmingly white voters who live in towns and hold more socially conservative views, and younger, more diverse citizens in urban communities who tend to be more socially progressive. This can be done: at his best, Bernie Sanders appeals to Trump sympathisers in the rust belt and Brooklyn graduates in precarious jobs who march for Palestine. Jeremy Corbyn, too, won 40% of the vote in 2017 by appealing to these different constituencies.An obvious candidate is Mick Lynch, the retired general secretary of the RMT union, whose effortless slapdowns of obtuse TV presenters showed his promise as the anti-Farage. His appeal is a combination of working-class experience, authenticity, composure and an ability to make political arguments accessible to the average punter. But he shows no signs of desiring a mantle that, admittedly, involves being hounded by a thuggish media. Yet someone with his qualities could be a focal point for otherwise disparate disillusionment. It would mean striking an arrangement with the Greens, who rode the wave of pre-election distaste with Starmerism to come second in dozens of constituencies, despite their abysmal failure to capitalise since.Any leader would have to shift the debate from the “culture wars” to economic justice. The former is intended to drive the left into defensive territory and, as Ronald Reagan astutely observed, in politics, “if you’re explaining, you’re losing”. But if the left drew attention to inequality and disintegrating public services, and made the case for taxing the rich, the right would be forced to explain itself instead. This does not mean throwing minorities under a publicly owned bus. It simply means that issues that emphasise the shared, common interests of the majority should be at the forefront.The left desperately needs to resolve this question of leadership. Living standards are set to fall, not least for the poorest. That disillusionment must go somewhere, and combined with growing apathy, Nigel Farage may well triumph by default. His success is a damning indictment of the predictable – and predicted – catastrophe of Starmerism. But a left that runs at full pelt away from an open goal has major questions to answer, too.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerRachel ReevesEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Keir Starmer’s team might not look or sound like Donald Trump’s, but its policies on protest and dissent are chillingly similar. So is the reason: coordinated global lobbying by the rich and powerful, fronted by rightwing junktanks.Last week, six young women were having tea and biscuits in the Quaker meeting house in Westminster. Twenty police officers forced open the doorand arrested themon conspiracy charges. Had the police discovered a plot to blow up parliament or to poison the water supply? No. It was an openly advertised, routine meeting of a protest group called Youth Demand, discussing climate breakdown and the assault on Gaza.I spoke to one of the arrested women, Jennifer Kennedy. She says she is not an activist, but a student journalist who was covering the meeting. Her phone, camera and laptop were confiscated. She was held incommunicado for 16 hours: in other words, like the others arrested, she was not allowed to make a phone call, so family and friends had no idea where she was. This is atacticthat is used for serious organised crime, terrorism or espionage, to prevent suspects from disposing of evidence, intimidating witnesses or alerting other spies. While she was held, she says that the police searched her flat, looking through her books and frightened her flatmate.The police justified the raid by claiming that Youth Demand plan to “shut down London”. What this has meant previously is 10-minuteblockages of individual roads: “shut downs” of the kind YD has carried outmany times before.Police forces claim to be under-resourced. But they spend vast sums and launch huge deployments against unthreatening protests. Last year they sent over1,000 officersfrom 39 forces, spending £3m, to shut down a climate camp and arrest 24 people, on the grounds that they might have been planning to occupy a road outside a power station. At the same time, theyfail even to investigateserious organised crime, citing insufficient resources.The police, governments and the media have sought to conflate peaceful protest with extremism and terrorism.Protestmethods used for centuries, such as blocking roads, have been recast as the end of civilisation.We are told that banning such tactics, as recent laws have done, is necessary to prevent ambulances from being obstructed or commuters delayed. GB News claimed that ambulances were being blocked by groups such as Insulate Britain, but no video evidence or otherwise was provided. When Josiah Mortimer of Byline Times covereda farmers’ protest in central London, in which roads were blocked by tractors, he filmed real ambulances struggling to get through. But neither the police nor other media were remotely interested.As far as I can tell, no one has been arrested on a farmers’ protest so far this century, though some have caused far greater disruption than any environmental or Gaza actions, even, on a recent occasion,forcing the prime minister to flee. In 2000, farmers and truckersblockaded oil refineries, fuel depots and motorways, effectivelyshutting down the country. The leader of the protests,Brynle Williams, was treated by the media as a national treasure, and used his fame to become a Conservative member of the Senedd. Every year since his death, the Welsh government has presented theBrynle Williams Memorial Awardat theRoyal Welsh Show.Similarly, the police have turned a blind eye to much of the far-right organising in this country, dismissing the risk that it would cause public disorder as “minimal”, despite abundantevidence to the contrary. This could be why they were so badly prepared for the racist riots last summer.What explains these blatant double standards? Lobbying. Oligarchs and corporations on both sides of the Atlantic want to stamp out any threat to their interests. In the US, this effort has been led by theHeritage Foundation’s Project 2025. In the UK, the commissioner for countering extremism,Robin Simcox, appointed by the Conservative government, but whoremains in post until July, previously worked at …the Heritage Foundation.The extreme new laws in the 2022 Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act and 2023 Public Order Actwere drafted in part,on Rishi Sunak’s admission, by another corporate junktank, Policy Exchange. It has been funded, among other interests,by fossil fuel companies. The outgoing independent adviser on political violence, John Woodcock, was previously paid by lobby groupsrepresenting weapons and fossil fuel companies. To general gasps of surprise, he demanded“protective buffer zones”, where no protest is allowed, around “defence companies and energy providers”.The junktanks and their collaborators in the media havevilified protestsagainst the genocide in Gaza, associated them with terrorism and antisemitism, and described them as “hate marches”. In reality, these marches and assemblies have been overwhelmingly respectful. Speaking for the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the former Lincolnshire chief constable,Chris Haward, told parliament, “Overall, we have seen very peaceful protests, given the numbers that have turned out.” But facts and evidence count for nothing. When people have been successfully demonised, you can do what you like to them.The Labour party was built on protest, but now seeks only to harden oppressive laws. Last week, itannounced new measuresallowing police to prevent or divert protests “where the effect of the protest is to intimidate those attending a place of worship”. Note that it doesn’t say theintentof the protest, but the “effect”. Already thepolice widely abusetheir powers undersections 12 and 14 of the Public Order Actto impede marches and assemblies. Now the government wants to strengthen these powers in areas close to a place of worship. While I agree that no one should ever be intimidated, there is no urban area in the UK that’s not close to a place of worship. At the same time, the government seems intensely relaxed about the intimidation of places of worship by the police, including forcing open their doors and sending in 20 officers.Whatever charges the people gathering in the Quaker meeting house may face, it seems to me that their fundamental crime is dissent. That their offence is to subscribe to what Trump calls “improper ideology”: a challenge to money and power. Every right and freedom we possess came about with the help of protest. Shutting it down presents a far greater threat to national life than anything those women taking tea and biscuits might have wanted to discuss.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistThe Invisible Doctrine: The Secret History of Neoliberalism, by George Monbiot and Peter Hutchison, was published in paperback last weekDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There is speculation that Trump is open to deals that will lower some of the reciprocal tariffs he just announced. There is also speculation of further tariffs on specific sectors. What does this mean for pharmaceuticals in Australia, for example?Donald Trump hits Australian exporters with 10% tariffs in ‘liberation day’ speechRead moreThe tariffs on China come on top of other recently announced levies. This also has flow-on effects for trading partners such as Australia. A slowdown in global trade and investment is a downside risk as global business digests possible changes to location and supply chains. The US could face higher costs (the tariff is paid by American consumers and downstream businesses) and a further fall in consumer sentiment and demand.These are choppy waters for Australia. While issues like the cost of living dominate election narratives, the Trump ascendancy is now looming larger over the federal election. Questions abound – what about Australia’s grand geopolitical strategy; and which party leader is best placed to navigate the next few years?2:27Trump announces sweeping new tariffs, upending decades of US trade policy – videoAt a recent meeting of the Australia-Canada Economic Leadership Forum, with 220 Canadians in the room, a constant theme was that Canada felt more vulnerable in dealing with the US because of the state of its economy and defence preparedness. Their dander is up as they contemplate how to change the policies of generations to deal with the first “America First” administration in our lifetime.Keeping our heads down is not an option. But neither is shooting ourselves in the foot by economic retaliation or threatening the alliance and Aukus. Both party leaders have sensibly disavowed rash responses.We must pivot to a stronger, more resilient economy and enhanced partnerships with like-minded democracies in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.

Washington has given up on traditional trade remedies in favour of more interventionist approaches, although each side of politics favours different instruments. Trump is replacing the Biden era policies of subsidised intervention, the Chips Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, with what he terms the “negative incentive” of higher tariffs – pay the tariff or produce in the US.America is leading the way, but the Europeans are now redoubling their efforts. Outsourcing sovereign capabilities through globalisation boosts our long-term dependence on hostile state actors who would not hesitate to use that leverage.While Australia lacks the scale of the US or the EU, we can double down on sovereign capabilities and lock in the benefits of changes to export controls that give us greater access to the defence markets in the US and UK.The best remedy for global uncertainty remains greater economic strength and resilience at home. We may also see more diversification as our exporters pivot to new markets.

The results are starkGideon Meyerowitz-KatzI’ve become addicted to the show. But as a scientist I wonder: how many couples actually stay together?Wed 2 Apr 2025 20.21 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 01.45 EDTShareIt has finally happened. After a decade of avoiding the show, my wife and I decided that we would try out the new season of Married at First Sight. We consume quite a bit of reality TV, so it’s not that we avoided itprecisely, but something about the idea of watching people struggle to build a healthy relationship amid a storm of cameras and manufactured drama just never drew us in. At least until we watched Married at First Sight and realised it was actually kind of fun.Relationship drama makes for addictive viewing. But after watching most of a season of weird “marriages”, screaming matches and couch quizzes accompanied bydeepandmeaningfulmusic, one part of the show has struck me as really weird. Everyone keeps referring to the saga as an “experiment”. From the narrator to the experts who counsel the hapless couples on their relationship dramas, the entire show seems to be calling the experience a social experiment for which we don’t know the outcome.As a scientist, I found this strange. We’ve had 11 seasons of the show with more than 100 couples getting thrust together over nearly a decade. There’s plenty of data there to analyse and see what “the experiment” shows.So I did. I collected the data from the Mafs Wikipedia pages – which are wonderfully comprehensive – as well as a bit of Googling. I asked three main questions:How many couples stay together until the end of filming?How many couples stay together after filming is completed?How many couples are still together and is it fewer than we’d expect?I limited my data collection to 2015-24 to ensure I had enough information on all the show’s participants. I also considered staying together after filming as at least one year of relationship post-show, because it was hard to figure out exactly when people broke up in the months after filming completed. For breaking up before the end of filming, I only counted couples who had left or otherwise stopped being part of the show before the final decision – if one or both of the people said no at the final ceremony, I think we can say they at least completed the experiment.From Naked Attraction to Love Is Blind: The couples who found lasting love on wild TV dating showsRead moreWhen you look at the numbers, the results are … stark. Of the 107 couples paired off in the eight years, 56 (52%) broke up before the show ended. The most likely result for two people who meet at their Mafs wedding is to call it quits within the 10-week period of filming.Of the 51 remaining couples who made it to the final decision, the outcomes are a little bit better. There were 11 successful marriages in the bunch – the husband and wife managed to make it to at least one full year of bliss. Of these, seven couples are still together today, which sounds OK on the face of it.In context, however, these statistics are still pretty abysmal. The average length of an Australian marriage is eight to nine years, according to theAustralian Bureau of Statistics. I compared the length of Mafs marriages against the 2021 divorce statistics from the ABS to get an idea of how unlikely this was, using a statistical test called a chi-squared test. This resulted in a probability value – or p-value – of 0.00000000001. Interpreting p-values can be a bit complex but we can say that Mafs couples fall apart drastically more commonly than your average Aussie marriage.Why are Mafs relationships failing so often? It’s hard to be sure. It could be that marrying someone you’ve just met is a ridiculous idea that rarely works. Perhaps it’s because the people who sign up for the show aren’t that great at relationships by default. Maybe the producers, in their quest for good TV, make the “experiment” just a bit too tumultuous for most couples to survive.Or maybe there’s something in the marriages themselves. In the US version of the show, couplessign a marriage certificatewhen they walk down the aisle, which is impossible in Australia due to regulations. In the US,16% of the couples are still togethercompared with 7% in Australia, a statistically significant difference with a p-value of 0.037 on that same chi-squared test. Given that the two shows are otherwise pretty similar, we could reasonably say that having a real wedding with a legally binding contract probably helps quite a bit in making the marriages last.‘Viewers enjoy seeing people suffer’: reality TV’s desperate struggle to be more ethicalRead moreOf course, 16% is still also low. The show has only been on since 2014 in the US, which means that most of the real marriages they’re filming end far sooner than they should.We can draw a few conclusions from the Mafs “experiment”. It rarely works. It’s much less effective than marrying someone you already know and presumably like, although this might also be influenced by the cameras and producer-generated drama. It’s rare you get to choose another partner partway through your marriage in real life, for example, something that was a big new twist in this year’s season of the show. The experiment is probably particularly ineffective in Australia because the couples aren’t legally married.All that being said, there are two things going for the whole idea. One is the current nightmare of the dating scene. Marrying someone you’ve never met probably won’t work but it might at least be more fun than trying to meet a partner on Hinge amid the fake profiles and pictures of men holding fish.Also, it makes great TV. Even if we all know the conclusion from the start – and at this point, we kind of do – the drama makes for compelling viewing.Dr Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz is an epidemiologist and science communicator currently working in chronic and infectious disease epidemiology.

The 44-year-old historian Karina Longworth has other ideas. The former LA Weekly film critic launched her podcast, You Must Remember This, in 2014, setting out to tell “the secret and/or forgotten histories of Hollywood’s first century”, as she puts it in the show’s introduction. Its title is lifted from the jazz standard As Time Goes By (“You must remember this / A kiss is still a kiss …”) as featured in Casablanca. Hearing that wistful, timeworn lyric, it is easy to overlook the imperative hiding in plain sight. With each fastidiously researched and gloriously entertaining episode, Longworth seems to be telling us: youmustremember this. To not do so, or to allow fact to curdle into legend, would be unconscionable.View image in fullscreenKarina Longworth with her director husband, Rian Johnson, at the Hollywood Critics Association’s 2023 awards.Photograph: Jeffrey Mayer/Alamy“I don’t want to be a schoolmarm scolding people for forgetting,” she says from a sunny upstairs room in the Los Angeles home she shares with her husband, Rian Johnson, director of the Knives Out whodunnits and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. “But I think we can only understand where we are at and where we’re going if we look to where we’ve been.”One reason she steers clear of modern topics on the podcast is the possible conflict of interest with her husband’s career. Jamie Lee Curtis’s appearance in the original Knives Out, for instance, precluded Longworth from ever making an episode about that actor’s parents, Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, even though they would be ideal subjects. As if further evidence were needed of her passion for the past, a framed poster of Marcel Pagnol’s 1936 melodrama César dominates the wall behind her today. Later, she will dismiss several questions about modern Hollywood with the same bored riposte: “I don’t care about new movies.”She gives us the Hitchcock not of Vertigo and Psycho but of the astringent Frenzy and the meandering Family PlotThat was one of the reasons she hung up her pen at the LA Weekly in 2012. Shortly before quitting, she mocked James Bond’s backstory in Skyfall as his “formative sads” and wrote the film off as “Downton Abbey with cybercrime and shower sex”. She dismissed Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris as “a Bill and Ted sequel for cultural studies majors”, and said Joss Whedon was “crippled by his short-term need to please the crowd” in the first Avengers movie.Film criticism’s loss is cinema history’s gain. Over 11 years of You Must Remember This, Longworth has covered in granular, invigorating detail everything from the anti-communist blacklist to the influence of Charles Manson and the Hollywood phenomenon of the dead blonde. She is a factchecker par excellence – a full 19 episodes were devoted to clearing up the scurrilous, spiteful untruths in Kenneth Anger’s gossip bible Hollywood Babylon. She is also the ally any neglected genius would want on their side, as proved by her season on the late Polly Platt, a largely unsung figure in the careers of Peter Bogdanovich and Wes Anderson.View image in fullscreen‘It feels proto-psychedelic’ … Ingrid Thulin and Glenn Ford in The Four Horsemen Of The Apocalypse by Vincente Minnelli (1962).Photograph: BFIThe latest series, The Old Man Is Still Alive, addresses the declining years of 14 cinematic titans, among them Vincente Minnelli, whose visually groundbreaking The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse sparked the idea for the season after Longworth saw it in Paris on a rainy Saturday evening in 2023. “It’s from the early 1960s but it feels proto-psychedelic. Seeing it reminded me why I started the podcast: to talk about things that have been forgotten.”Even with Scorsese, there’s this sense of: ‘Aw, the old man is trying to do something else before he dies!’With that in mind, she gives us theHitchcocknot of Vertigo and Psycho but of the astringent Frenzy and the meandering Family Plot; theJohn Fordof Cheyenne Autumn, a well-meaning if not wholly effective critique of the western’s values; and theBilly Wilderdrawn back to the mournful territory of Sunset Boulevard in Fedora.It’s fascinating to hear Longworth charting the corkscrew turns these film-makers took as they twisted themselves out of shape trying to keep up with the times. But there’s no escaping the fact that she has taken on a supremely unfashionable topic: dead white men. A deliberate provocation? “No, it’s what I’m legitimately interested in,” she scoffs. “My podcast isreallyhard to make. I can only do it if I care about the subject. Sure, in the world right now there is anger at specific older white men. Part of it is an impulse to say: ‘We should just burn it all down and start again.’ But history makes us who we are today.”View image in fullscreenAlfred Hitchcock directing Family Plot (1976).Photograph: Universal/AllstarAs a student, she was taught the importance of DW Griffith, the director ofThe Birth of a Nation. “There was only a cursory conversation around whether the film was racist,” she recalls.“It was primarily all about the technique. I don’t think that’s the way to do it either, but nor do I think we should burn all copies of The Birth of a Nation. That sets a dangerous precedent.”The phrase “institutional memory” crops up in the new series, and it is this, along with the nuance of considered investigation over kneejerk reaction, that Longworth is fighting to defend. That said, people today are time-poor and inundated with viewing options. With the BFI Southbank hosting a month-long series of the movies covered in the podcast, some of which Longworth will be introducing in person, how does she think potential audiences will respond to the invitation to sample, say, The Only Game in Town, starring Warren Beatty and Elizabeth Taylor? By her own admission, it is “the least successful of the George Stevens films I’ve seen, [though] aesthetically it has its moments”. Hardly a ringing endorsement. “I don’t care,” she shrugs. “I’m not trying to change the paradigm. I’m just reacting to movies the way I react to them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The negative one is: ‘Why won’t he just make shorter movies?’”The podcast is the only way I can be free to do any kind of performance because nobody’s watchingAlong with erudition and tireless research, listeners of You Must Remember This get Longworth’s shimmering writing (on William Wyler’s How to Steal a Million: “Dressed in a slip, a car coat and rain boots, Audrey Hepburn invents grunge”) and plenty of shade (to anyone defending Otto Preminger’s last film, The Human Factor, she says: “You do you, babe”). It’s all delivered in her alluring conspiratorial tones, which suggest a film noir schemer. Or, as one online fan put it, “a sexy ghost”.When I ask how this exaggerated vocal style evolved from the chattier early episodes, she looks unimpressed. “I’m not trying to do anything differently,” she says. One indisputable change in the new season is that, to adapt TS Eliot and Charles Dickens, she do the directors in different voices. Whereas she once hired actors, even enlisting her husband to play John Huston, she now takes on every role herself, including an amusing Hitchcock with a severe case of irritable vowel syndrome.‘Never fails to make my day’: readers on their feelgood moviesRead moreDoes this have anything to do with her own background as a would-be child actor in LA? “I’m not acting,” she says firmly. “I’m doing what I would do if I were telling these stories at a cocktail party.” It was her mother who steered her into auditions as a child. “She wanted to be an artist and a model. When she had me, she stopped pursuing work outside of the house. That was not the right decision for her, and she killed herself when I was 11. She was in a situation common to many people of her generation: they had been told to want something and then, when they got it, it wasn’t fulfilling and they didn’t know what to do about that.”Longworth’s acting career was short-lived. “I had trouble controlling my body and my face. A lot of that came from nervousness at being looked at. I still don’t like it. The podcast is the only way I can be free to do any kind of performance because nobody’s watching.” Channelling Greta Garbo and providing our conversation with a natural end, she says: “I want to be alone.”You Must Remember This Presents … The Old Man is Still Alive is at BFI Southbank, London SE1, until 30 AprilExplore more on these topicsFilmPodcastsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My group, the Crystallettes, graced many a nightclub stage in competitions, and every time either us or [fellow Chicago girl group] the Emotions would win. But I remember singing some Aretha Franklin songs and people in the audience were throwing money on the stage, and they started calling me “little Aretha”. That’s when I connected the dots: “Oh, I see what this is all about.” I realised I didn’t have to become a teacher or a whatever I wanted to be when I grew up back then – I could be a singer!You have so much confidence and you just knew you and [the band] Rufus were going to make it big. Where does that confidence come from?stifwhiffWhen I was with Rufus, I knewIloved what we were doing, and I could only hope and pray everyone else loved it like I did. That’s all you can ask for. And that’s still how I am about the music I make. I have confidence in everything I do – all the time. And that is a necessary thing to have if you want success – if you’ve created something and you want everyone to love it,youhave to love it first. And that’s applicable to everything in life, not just music.View image in fullscreenThis is her night … Chaka Khan performing at the Auditorium theatre in Chicago, April 1980.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesYour coverofJoni Mitchell’s Hejirawas unbelievable. I’ve read about your plannedMitchell album for a long time. Are you still planning to release it?Jroel72I love Joni – she’s helped me out of a lot of rough spots, just with her music. We’re great friends, and have been for many, many years. I first met her when I did a little ad-lib on her songDreamland. She knows how to get a good collaboration going, and she always has a great rhythm section – my all-time favourite songs of hers are the ones where Jaco [Pastorius] is playing bass, God bless his soul. I am indeed working on a CD of some of my favourite songs by her, and it’ll be out … soon.View image in fullscreenI’m every woman … Chaka Khan circa 1970.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesI saw you in [stage musical]Mama, I Want To Sing!many years ago (which you were very good in). Do you have any ambitions to return to the stage?jaelliottNo. I’m glad you saw it and enjoyed it, but I got zonked out from doing that. [Acting on stage] is just too much hard work; I don’t need to do it and it’s just not my favourite thing to do – music is. I never get bored with songs and music and melody. I’m lucky to be doing something that feeds me and nurtures me and makes me feel good.How often do you play the drums now?KnobtwidllerIloveplaying drums. I just don’t often get the chance to play, unless I’m jamming at the club with somebody – and I don’t go out clubbing much these days. I love any drummer who’s in the pocket. Buddy Miles was my favourite, growing up, and my dad turned me on to Max Roach when I was a kid. My dad inspired me to play drums; he used to play congas. When I was a little girl, my sister and I used to go with him to the park, where they’d have a drum circle going, and we’d join in and have a great time. I can also play a little bass, and I took flute and violin in school for hot minutes. But I’m really a drummer. I’m going to just start doing some drums, some beats, on my recordings.Like Sugar [from 2019] is an absolute banger. Any plans to release more music soon?snak3spanI’m working on it right now! Sia and I are working on an amazing project, and I hope the first single will come out some time this summer. I’malwaysworking on music. And Sia is amazing – she’s my goddaughter! This is something we’ve been working on for a year now, and it’s killing us, because we keep coming up with more great music to do! We can’t finish, because we’ve got so much to give. It’s beautiful.I once heard you write poetry in your spare time. Have you given thought to compiling itand releasing a poetry book?JulesTheDreamerI’ve talked about doing a poetry book; I just can’t find all the scrap paper I’ve been writing my poems on! When I’m in creative mode, I need somebody to snatch those papers up before I go on to the next sheet! But I’ve got to start putting all that junk together and see if it inspires anybody, because sometimes the most disorganised stuff can be the best you’ve written. Life is inspiration to me – it’s like a bag of chips and popcorn, a major mix. I’m never at a loss of stuff to write about.View image in fullscreenOn stage with Sia in 2023, when Khan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Photograph: Kevin Kane/Getty Images for The Rock and Roll Hall of FameI lovedyour versionofA Night in Tunisia.Would you take such an innovative approach to other jazz standards?And when did you startloving jazz music?User28I’ve done plenty of jazz standards. I’ve loved jazz since I was a toddler – my mother and father were jazz fanatics. I heard everything from the Art Ensemble of Chicago – which was, you know,out there– to Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis. And I worked with Miles. He and Prince were very similar – big thinkers. Miles was always looking to grow. Prince was, too. The three of us collaborated onSticky Wicked, on my CK album in 1988, and it was a beautiful combination.What’s your favourite Stevie Wonder song? What was he like to work with?EddieChorepostI Was Made to Love Her. That song just wipes me out.I covered it as well[as I Was Made to Love Him]. Another genius.Youperformed once at Gay Pride in London inKennington Park. My first Pride – I was a young lesbian, 19 or 20. The power of your voice blasting across the field was incredible. Firstly, thank you. It felt like the gays were being blessed by you. Do you remember being there? Andhave you always been a champion of the LGBTQ+ community?FoolishBoyI’vealwaysbeen a champion. I’m so sorry, I don’t remember that day; it sounds remarkable. I’m so glad you were able to bathe in that wonderful feeling. I’m a champion of anyone who is having a problem getting their point across, of living their life, their love, the way they want or need to. If they are struggling to be heard, to be loved, to be understood, I’m behind them.View image in fullscreenKhan on stage with Prince in 2006.Photograph: Michael Caulfield Archive/WireImageWhat was performing with Prince like?GeeSNZ64It was like working with myself, more than anyone else I’ve worked with. Sia’s bringing up a close third, behind Prince and Miles Davis. Quincy Jones, too: he oozed inspiration and shared it. Prince just grabbed ideas out of the air and left you wondering: “Where did you get that?” He was a really deep and beautiful thinker. We worked on a lot of songs, and they’re all going to be on a CD I’m soon to release – there’s a lot of red tape that’s been in the way, but we’ve cleared it. It’s him and me and Larry Graham, together.Chaka Khan: ‘Someone said there were too many black people in our band. He put some white guys on stage with us’Read moreWay back in 1995, yousang with Princeat hisWembley Arena aftershow party atthe Astoria. I remember that he came out at around 4am and youandGeorge Bensonjoined him, and it was a great night. Other than that my memory is hazy. What do you remember of that night?WhistlebumpMy memory is at least as hazy as yours, I bet – probably more. Four o’clock in the morning? No one’s doing anything but craziness at four in the morning! So I’m sure it was like a wild, wonderful night. And don’t look for the little details; just remember the big feeling you had. That’s how I handlemymemories. I don’t remember a lot of what I did. And thank God! I’m a “next!” person. Life is about what’s happening now, what’s coming next. I’ve done a lot in my life, and over half of it I don’t remember. Did I ever keep a diary? Oh, hell no. That takes a special kind of patience.Does the fact that music is a universal language prove we all have a lot more in common than we realise?Twist27Absolutely. Music is the language of the angels – when I sing, I feel oneness with all creation, oneness with God, with everything. It’s a remarkable thing. And maybe it sounds a bit cuckoo, but it’s the truth. When everything comes together – the instruments, the vocal – that’s the sound of angels speaking.Chaka Khan will perform at theHampton Court Palace festivalon 18 June.

It’s quite the gambit for a standup known for his boy-next-door approachability to dedicate half an hour to this tale of red-carpet excess. Happy to say, Gilligan pulls it off with humility intact; his modesty, indeed, is the joke. Less happy to say, the story, which finds Mo and his London “mandem” given the VIP treatment in an LA nightclub, isn’t remarkable or variegated enough to justify its excessive length.I began to think that routine might constitute the whole show. But it doesn’t. There’s a fun opening number about black Britons on holiday. Later, the 37-year-old ranges across singledom and coupledom, drawing him into territory he has always effortlessly commanded – where boys do this and girls do that, on the dancefloor, in front of the telly, in the bedroom. “Men, we’re not good at apologising.” Women always know where the remote control is. Is any of it true? Gilligan is so skilled at bringing these everyday scenarios to life, so gifted at animating the telling detail, we’re happy to indulge a generalisation or three.It’s all done so big-heartedly, too. No one is mean or malign in Mo-world; we’re all making lovable fools of ourselves, trying to get by. See Gilligan’s pals, suddenly “becoming architects”, feigning an interest in the fixtures and fittings when the drinks bill needs to be paid. Or his thirtysomething Lothario, too arthritic for fingering. Or his generic Everyboyfriend, furtively clicking “Next episode” while spooning his snoozing sweetheart on the sofa.One of the flaws of that show-hogging central anecdote is that it trails a punchline (whohasGilligan been mistaken for?) that never arrives. I guess we have to accept he really is that big a deal now. This latest show isn’t perfect, but it proves he has not lost what makes him special, a gold-plated relatability – where the common touch meets the Midas touch – underpinned by standup craftsmanship as effortless as it is meticulous.AtPlymouth Pavilionson 3 April.Then touringuntil 31 MayExplore more on these topicsStageComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Mo GilliganreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Pope of Greenwich Village (1984)Looking as though she has strayed from another genre, Hannah plays Mickey Rourke’s girlfriend, a leggy aerobics instructor who keeps getting undressed. At least she’s more fun than Rourke and an insanely posturing Eric Roberts as deadbeat cousins ripping off the mob: roles originally written for Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.View image in fullscreenMickey Rourke, Daryl Hannah and Eric Roberts.Photograph: Mgm/Ua/Kobal/Shutterstock9. At Play in the Fields of the Lord (1991)Hannah acquits herself well as one of a group of American missionaries who cross paths with mercenary Tom Berenger while attempting to convert an Amazonian tribe. Of course it all ends in tears in this plodding epic-length adaptation of Peter Matthiessen’s novel, directed by Héctor Babenco.8. Steel Magnolias (1989)As a timid hairdresser in a fearsome, mostly female ensemble cast wielding Louisiana accents, Hannah holds her own against the likes of Sally Field and Shirley MacLaine, helped by unflattering specs, droopy cardigans and the film’s most diverting character arc, involving pregnancy and unsuitable men. Off-screen, meanwhile, Hannah would shortly be moving on from her nine-year relationship with Jackson Browne to a romantic entanglement with John F Kennedy Jr.View image in fullscreenSouthern belle … as Annelle Dupuy Desoto.Photograph: Tristar Pictures/Allstar7. The Clan of the Cave Bear (1986)In the Paleolithic era, Hannah plays a tall, blond Cro-Magnon woman raised by a Neanderthal tribe. John Sayles’ proto-feminist screenplay, adapted from Jean M Auel’s bestseller, is of course preposterous, but its star looks stunning in pelts, and also emerges intact from a gory fight with Bart the Bear and non-consensual sex with the actor who played Windows in The Thing.View image in fullscreenProto-feminist … Hannah in The Clan of the Cave Bear.Photograph: Warner Bros/Allstar6. Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992)Embodying the sort of tall, blond stunner of every schlub’s dreams, Hannah fleshes out what could have been a boring girlfriend role in a sci-fi thriller more fun than its reputation suggests, adapted from HF Saint’s terrific novel. Chevy Chase mercifully dials down the smarm in the title role, Sam Neill enjoys himself channelling James Mason in North By Northwest, and the early digital effects still look astonishing.5. The Real Blonde (1997)Hannah has a ball playing a soap-opera diva who gleefully belittles her preening male co-star in Tom DiCillo’s charming but underseen satire about the spiritual superficiality of Manhattan’s arts and media. Meanwhile, the marvellous Catherine Keener, as a makeup artist, ensures the film itself isn’t as shallow as its milieu.View image in fullscreenIn Roxanne with Steve Martin.Photograph: Columbia/Allstar4. Roxanne (1987)Hannah beefs up her blond-girlfriend persona with rocket-scientist smarts (she’s an astronomer) and impeccable comic timing opposite Steve Martin in this adorable reworking of Cyrano de Bergerac, transposed to small-town America. She thinks she prefers handsome but dim Rick Rossovich. But no, she and the fire chief with the enormous proboscis are made for each other.3. Splash (1984)Always a bit ethereal and otherworldly, Hannah is perfectly cast in Ron Howard’s fairytale romcom about a New Yorker (Tom Hanks) who falls in love with a mermaid who calls herself Madison, after the avenue. It’s darker than you might remember, and John Candy is downright skeezy as Hanks’ brother, but Hannah’s sense of innocent wonder is infectious.View image in fullscreenInfectious innocent wonder …Hannah as Madison in Splash.Photograph: Disney/Allstar2. Blade Runner (1982)In only a handful of scenes, Hannah makes an indelible mark on sci-fi cinema as Pris, the “basic pleasure model” who comes to a deeply upsetting end when she takes on Harrison Ford’s replicant-hunter. With her shock of hair, spray-on punk eye makeup and sex-doll athleticism, she’s a vital part of Ridley Scott’s groundbreaking vision.View image in fullscreenMakes an indelible mark … Hannah as Pris in Blade Runner.Photograph: THA/Shutterstock1. Kill Bill: Vol 1 (2003) and 2 (2004)Hannah serves up a delicious double-helping of pure malice in Quentin Tarantino’s martial arts pastiche as one-eyed Elle Driver, member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Whetherwhistling the theme from Twisted Nerveor clobbering Uma Thurman, she is mean and magnificent. We can only lament it didn’t lead to a career renaissance as an action star, though she has since kept busy with TV work, going public withher autism, environmental activism – and Neil Young,whom she marriedin 2018.Explore more on these topicsRankedDaryl Hannahbest ofShareReuse this content"

In works that sing with colour and texture, he crafted wibbly-wobbly fables in which eyes and noses slide around faces, animals tower over mountains and dreaming, desiring, questing men are rendered poignantly goofy. Looking to modernist greats such as Klee and Miró, Kiff made colour a defining principle, mixing abstraction with recurring symbols culled from a private mythology that included birds, salamanders, mountains, water, goddess-like women and the “Little Man”, a diminutive chap with a bendy body vulnerable as plasticine, who walks a lonely path. His was a bombast-free take on life’s agony and ecstasy, as idiosyncratic as it is relatable and human.When Kiff died aged 65 in 2001, his reputation was that of a bygone artist’s artist, whose heartfelt dedication to his medium and the creative process was far removed from the arch, brash conceptual output of the then-dominant YBAs. Now, though, appreciation of his prolifically produced, personal work is growing afresh. “He speaks to a younger generation, partly in terms of his mix of abstraction and figuration,” says Ella-Rose Harrison, the director of Hales Gallery, where a new exhibition looks back to his 18 months from 1992 to 1993 as “associate artist” in residence at London’sNational Gallery. “There’s also a different engagement with his themes,” she adds, “bringing the mythical into the everyday, or psychologically charged space.”Kiff was the second artist the National Gallery invited to respond to its art historical giants and it was a prestigious gig. Paula Rego was the first and Kiff was followed by Peter Blake. Yet he had reservations. “He wasn’t pro-institutions,” says Kiff’s daughter, Anna. “He was acutely aware it was a very masculine environment. He was from a working-class background and it wasn’t his comfort zone.” For an artist who gloried in colour, the National Gallery’s collection was also very brown.Working on site in a basement studio with his huge collection of cassettes playing everything from baroque harpsichord to jazz, Kiff went in search of what he called “the essence” of paintings. He didn’t make many sketches there, but rather “looked intensely at paintings over and over and over”, Anna explains. What drew him to work by artists including Rubens, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Pisanello or Giovanni di Paolo is always fresh and surprising. He had a particular thing for Rubens’ trees. He paid attention to art’s physicality, be it the wood something was painted on or a touch of gold pigment. A splash of colour from a muddy Renaissance landscape might inspire the dominant element in his own work.At times, his paintings adhere closely to the originals, adapting themes and figures that chimed with his own mythologies. John the Baptist, the hunter Saint Eustace or the hermit Saint Jerome might be loftier cousins of Kiff’s lonely traveller. At others, his paintings seem to upend the assumptions of the past, as with Woman Watching a Murder, inspired by Bellini’s brutal all-male scene The Assassination of Saint Peter Martyr. Kiff takes the blue from a scrap of sky in Bellini’s otherwise washed-out woodland setting to create an azure vision, where a tiny tussling couple are watched by a giant woman, sad and resigned.Kiff later wrote that he approached the National Gallery project as he did all his work, as “many interlocking thoughts” which were visual not verbal. “A painting doesn’t become a painting because it conforms to rules of what a painting should be,” he continued, “but because the ‘thought’ or ‘understanding’ has happened.”Ken Kiff: The National Gallery Project is at Hales Gallery, London, to 24 MayDriven to abstraction: five works from the exhibitionView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Damian Griffiths/Ken Kiff/Hales London and New York/DACSWhite Tree, Large Face, 1990-1996Kiff has left the hardboard he painted on visible here. Anna recalls that he found it in keeping with “the quality of darkness, the browns you find in a lot of old master painting”. The tree was inspired by Rubens but the face – literally falling apart – belongs to the modern world.Woman Watching a Murder, 1996 (pictured at top of article)This meditation in blue shows how Kiff used colour as a structuring principle, with its echoing forms and aqua shades. It also underlines his interest in the bleed between representation and abstraction, with the inky midnight morass in the background suggesting a cave or intangible dark thoughts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Its elements are close to those he was already exploring in his work, from the giant flowers or huge mountains dwarfing the isolated traveller to jarring shifts in scale.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Damian Griffiths/Ken Kiff/Hales London and New York/DACSMaster of St Giles, 1994In addition to paintings, Kiff also produced prints inspired by his time at the National Gallery, such as this woodcut teeming with earthy life that looked to works by an anonymous 16th-century artist known for depicting Saint Giles’s friendship with a deer. “This print encompasses so many things he found important,” says Anna, “including our relationship to the environment.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Damian Griffiths/Ken Kiff/Hales London and New York/DACSCastle Rising from the Sea, 1993This etching showcases Kiff’s renowned vivid palette, and speaks to the creative process, with its castle born from the waters of the sea. The sun is a recurring symbol in his work with connotations of enlightenment or inspiration. This one’s no Apollo, though; it crawls along recalling one of Kiff’s other favourite tropes: the salamander.Explore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsNational GalleryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maybe take a holiday, learn to juggle, work on their chess openings … or anything,anything, that doesn’t involve writing an entire novel in a month.I am, of course, referring to the sad news that theonline writing community NaNoWriMo is calling it a dayafter more than 20 years in existence. The organisation, which has existed officially as a nonprofit since 2006, has been a source of inspiration to many amateur (and professional) writers who’ve needed the requisite kick up the bum to actually get stuff down on the page. Because although NaNoWriMo – short for National Novel Writing Month – existed all year round as a support group for writers, it was known chiefly for its November writing marathon – could you write 50,000 words in that month alone? Or, to put it another way, could you average 1,667 words a day over a 30-day period? Or, to put itanotherway, were you willing to go stark-raving crackers for a month?I was once willing. Back in 2021, without any preplanning whatsoever,I tried to bash out my own bestselling novel in a month, and wrote about it for the Guardian. It was a revealing experience – the only way to really hit the deadline was to write without ever looking back, without editing, without even reading what had gone before. The result was both a success and a failure. A success because I did indeed manage 50,000 words. Not only that, but I staggered on for another fortnight until my tome had an ending and clocked in at a whopping 69,803 words. That’s no mean feat for six weeks’ work! Even if I did have to write some of it while having a pint of blood removed at the Macmillan cancer centre in order to hit the deadline.So why was it a failure? Well, largely because the resulting novel was bobbins. It seemed destined to be bobbins before I started writing it. It felt like utter bobbinswhileI was writing it. And then, whenI read it back and reviewed it a year later, its status as complete and utter nonsense-level bobbins was confirmed.A friend of mine insists that the whole thing ruined my confidence in writing fiction, and I do like the idea that if it wasn’t for taking on this near-impossible challenge I would currently be swanning around the London literary circuit with a couple of Booker prizes hanging out of my back pocket. But the truth is that NaNoWriMo had little effect on me either way. If someone ever asks me if I have ever written a novel, I instinctively say no, before remembering that actually, technically, I have. It just doesn’t really feel like it. It isn’t something that I consider a proper novel. In fact, I’ve just had a horrible vision of my kids discovering the book after I’ve died and reading through it, thinking, “ah man, Dad really was deluded, wasn’t he?”. Or worse – trying to honour me by getting it published. Must burn it tonight.NaNoWriModidprove that I could knuckle down and do the grunt work if necessary, which is perhaps a nice thing to have in the back of your mind. But it didn’t make me into a writer. I didn’t have a good enough idea of what I wanted to say – and without the 1% inspiration, the 99% perspiration doesn’t really amount to much.But different people write in very different ways and I can see how, for a writer with a plan and a voice raring to go, NaNoWriMo could have been a gamechanger. The fact that it is having to shut down, in a world where the arts are under attack from the far right and artificial intelligence, is pretty depressing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

These were exacerbated by various controversies: an equivocating stance on AI and an alleged failure to investigate a serious accusation against a moderator among them. To me, the project seems rather like parkrun, someone’s sweet idea that became unimaginably big (over 400,000 participants were reported to have taken in 2022, up from 21 in its first year). Suddenly there are all these unanticipated problems and voices to deal with and the original spirit needed a serious structure behind it to continue thriving. Parkrun has risen to the challenge but NaNoWriMo evidently struggled.But if the organisation is no more, there’s no need for the idea itself to die. The internet is a very different place to what it was in 1999, and no doubt there will be people well placed to step into the gap it leaves, either by continuing the original idea (as Bluesky did with X) or reshaping it as something similar but different. Maybe even better.So perhaps budding writers will still be cranking out 50,000 words this November after all. Not me, though. I’ll be doing something much more beneficial for the world of literature, like working on my Nimzowitsch defence.Explore more on these topicsBooksCreative writingFictioncommentShareReuse this content"

The internet’s ablaze with TikTok dance homages, Reddit threads – and tons of hate watchersAnya RyanThu 3 Apr 2025 04.38 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 12.36 EDTShareThe year is 2009, and Glee has hit like a cultural earthquake. Every week, millions of people around the world tune in to watch a group of American high school misfits belt out musical theatre and pop hits, turning show choir into mainstream entertainment. The cast’s cover of Journey’s Don’t Stop Believin’ becomes an anthem, spending37 weeks in the UK charts, catapulting its young stars to overnight fame. Glee clubs start in schools across the US and beyond, and Ryan Murphy’s show develops a devoted fanbase – myself included – who proudly call ourselves Gleeks. Online, we dissect every episode on Tumblr, trade theories and wear our fandom, plus the merch we bought to prove it, as a badge of honour.But by the time Glee came to a close in 2015, all its magic had faded.The Guardian reported that “few will mourn its passing”as the show’s last season premiered. A string of increasingly absurd storylines and poor song choices left a dwindling viewership and even the most diehard fans drifting away. Or so we thought – because 10 years after its finale, the show is back with a vengeance.Glee is going viral, mainly because of gen Z – who watch the show on Disney+ and Hulu, or buy it on Amazon. On TikTok, clips of the show’s most outrageous moments repeatedly resurface in an endless stream of nostalgia, while newReddit threadsconstantly pop up. Last year,the show’s version of Rose’s Turnfrom the Broadway musical Gypsy debuted at No 3 in the US Top 50 chart, while more recently, the“Glee dance”to Say a Little Prayer has seen thousands of people learn the choreography and upload videos of them performing it. And that’s not all. On YouTube,Mike’s Mic Glee recap videoshave been watched by millions. Even some of the original stars have begun to capitalise on Glee’s renewed popularity. The 2022 podcastAnd That’s What You REALLY Missed, hosted by actors Jenna Ushkowitz and Kevin McHale (who played Tina Cohen-Chang and Artie Abrams), recapped every episode from the show’s six seasons. But why, in 2025, are we still so hungry for Glee?Much of the conversation aboutGleetoday pivots around one question: “How did this ever get made?” Parts of it have not aged well. How could we forget the musical episode inspired by the mass school shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut in 2012? Or when Kurt dismissed Blaine’s bisexuality by telling him “it didn’t exist”? And that’s before we’ve even got to Mr Schue – a teacher whose inappropriate behaviour included blackmailing Finn into joining the glee club by planting marijuana on him, teaching his students to twerk and suspending Marley for not wanting to wear a revealing costume.Unsurprisingly, the response to TikTok recaps ofMr Schue’sworst bits often have several comments like “I just couldn’t watch it” underneath. But Glee’s cringeworthy nature is also precisely why many new and old fans find the series so enticing. Not only does an episode have all the nostalgia of the 2010s –an era gen Z are romanticising– but it also provides endless“WTF” momentsthat keep us talking.The modern-day consensus is that Glee is actually so bad, it’s good, with manyhate-watchingthe series. But, it is easy to forget that when it first hit our screens in 2009, it was groundbreaking. Murphy and his co-writers took us inside a normal school: William McKinley high school in Ohio, which was ruled by jocks and cheerleaders. However, the themes, people and stories the show covered were anything but bog-standard. Christopher Baffa, the director of photography on the first three seasons, recalls feeling as if they were making something “boundary-pushing”. At a time when58% of Americans did not support gay marriage, Glee put queer stories front and centre.As its final series aired, one reviewsaid it “did more to normalise homosexuality than any other show in TV history, perhaps more than any other mainstream work of art”. Baffa certainly feels that it had a positive impact: “I’ve had a lot of people tell me both now and then that watching Glee was helpful for whatever they were going through in their own lives.”View image in fullscreenGlee’s cringeworthy nature is precisely why many new and old fans find the series so enticing.Photograph: TikTokAli Adler, a writer on Glee, remembers that every episode, whatever the subject matter, had comedy at its core: “We knew the topics we were dealing with were serious, but we were always approaching them in a way that was funny.” The characters, she explains, each “had their own point of view” about whatever the episode’s theme was – whether that be homophobia, religion or mental health – “and their opinions were so specific” to give the show a range of different, real-life perspectives.Adler describes the whole experience of working on Glee as like getting “a golden ticket”. And for viewers, too, the show was revolutionary. Elis Shotten, 29, who ran a Glee fan account on Twitter dedicated to Darren Criss, the actor who played Blaine, remembers the series as his “big sexual awakening”. “It quickly became a whole world in which I was able to exist away from the real world – where I didn’t feel like I was able to express my queer identity openly,” he says of Glee fandom. “The character of Kurt was a revelation, and it can’t be understated how much good he did for so many people like me.”Dominic McGovern, a comedian who uses Glee as the basis for many of his sets, even calls the show “an education”. “We talk about Glee being funny and silly and campy, but it was also rooted in an appreciation for popular culture,” he says. Shotten adds: “It will always find a way to resonate with people who are high school-aged. Even if its politics have become incredibly dated, the struggles of adolescence will always be the same.”But the thing about Glee is that it wasn’t another American high-school drama; the music was essential. Unlike recent screen musicals such as Wicked or Wonka, which removed all songs from their trailers, Glee always revelled in its camp and flamboyant numbers. Still, Baffa is certain that its focus was always on its stories: “The songs were intrinsically linked to the emotional levels of one, if not all of the characters … they were just another device we used to tell stories,” he says. Musical TV shows that came after, such as Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, never quite reached Glee’s levels of outlandish comedy or over-the-top performance.Of course, the tragedy that surrounds Glee is now inextricable from its legacy, specifically the deaths of three prominent cast members; Cory Monteith whose deathwas caused by an accidental drug and alcohol overdose, Mark Salling, who died by suicide, and Naya Rivera, who drowned in 2020, as well as several crew who died during production, including assistant director Jim Fuller, who had a heart attack. “Statistically, to have three cast members and crew members have the deaths that we’ve experienced is odd,” says Baffa. On TikTok, they’re often remembered incompilation videos, while And That’s What You REALLY Missed dedicated a special episode to memorialising Monteith. A series of accusations from cast membersthat Lea Michele’s behaviour made working on the show a “living hell”now haunt Glee too – with videosresurfacing month after monthaiming to both prove and disprove the claims and stars still being askedabout what really happened on set, 10 years after the show ended. But, although the drama of Glee continues to fuel headlines, Baffa likes to believe “it isn’t the focus of the new fanbase I don’t want the legacy of Glee to be that – I hope that people can see the positive side.”Adler is confident that nothing like the programme has been made since. “Glee was the ultimate in terms of representation – I think kids are still drawn to that.” Does she think they’d do things differently if Glee was being made today? “Maybe different choices would have been made,” she says. “But I don’t think you can ever apologise for history because history is what creates the future.” And by the looks of things, the future for Glee is still bright – because now, fans just won’t stop believin’.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Or perhaps a B-boy headspinning to the song of a button accordion. In fact there are a lot of things you didn’t know you needed in this show, Wake, by the Dublin-based theatre company Thisispopbaby, which joyfully explodes expectations of the traditional Irish wake, but captures some of the culture’s soul alongside the high camp and shiny Lycra.The ingredients are mind-bogglingly myriad: cabaret, character comedy and Irish stepdance, trad folk music and 80s, 90s, 00s bangers, aerial circus skills and audience participation. It’s also an invitation to imagine life’s seismic moments as a catalyst for reinvention, spurred by the coming together of bodies and hearts in the same room.View image in fullscreenHaving a blast … Wake at Peacock theatre.Photograph: Ruth MedjberDirectors Jennifer Jennings and Phillip McMahon have gathered a talented cast who are clearly having a blast, among them Michael Roberson, a competitive Irish dancer from the US with barnstorming energy and slick technique. They’ve been calling him “the Paul Mescal of Irish dance”, possibly because of his Gladiator physique, except Lucius Verus didn’t have gold briefs and a glitter ball. Many are international artists based in Ireland: world champion pole dancer Lisette Krol (originally from Venezuela) is the most powerful person on stage and proves herself a hardcore athlete in a G-string; charismatic B-boy Cristian Emmanuel Dirocie (Dominican Republic) has a catalogue of power moves and gyrates his pipe-cleaner-bendy limbs in superfast time; while Irish-Nigerian spoken word artist Felispeaks is the sage of the show. The onstage band are tight, with accordionist Darren Roche of the band Moxie, and fiddle player Lucia Mac Partlin on great form.The ability to ride a tonal rollercoaster that swerves way off the rails, from tongue-in-cheek burlesque to moving a cappella folk, is mightily impressive. Wake is rude, raucous, silly and then suddenly poignant, celebrating all that you can stuff into life, with earnestness thrown out the window. It has late-night festival hit written all over it (if they’re not going up to Edinburgh this summer, they should be), and would be even better in the round, which is how it was staged in Dublin, because what it’s all about is togetherness, gathering; death as a prompt for really living.AtPeacock theatre, London,until 5 April.

The Magician’s Nephew centres on two children, Digory Kirke and Polly Plummer, who discover the magical world through Digory’s uncle Andrew. Daniel Craig is also in talks for the film, withspeculation rising that he will play the uncle. Charli XCX is also in line for a role, rumoured to be Jadis, the White Witch.The film will be Gerwig’s first since megahit Barbie, which earned over $1.4bn at the global box office. She signed on as part of Netflix’s 2018 optioning of Lewis’s series in 2020; the film will be screened globally in Imax in Thanksgiving 2026 before moving to streaming.Streep previously appeared in in another of Gerwig’s takes on a classic of children’s literature: the 2019 version of Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women. The actor has not appeared on the big screen since her role in 2021’s Don’t Look Up, but is rumoured to be returning to make a sequel to The Devil Wears Prada later this year.Ronald Pickup and David Suchet are among the actors who have voiced Aslan in celebrated BBC TV and radio productions of The Chronicles of Narnia, while Liam Neeson took the role in the three Narnia films made between 2005 and 2010.Other films which have reimagined deities as female include Dogma (Alanis Morrissette), The Shack (Octavia Spencer) and the upcoming Jesus Christ Superstar movie (Cynthia Erivo).

Orlando Bloom, who played Legolas,said in 2019that he had been paid $175,000 for all three films, while Sean Astin (Samwise Gamgee) said he got $250,000.Released between 2001 and 2003, Jackson’s three-film series grossed $2.96bnat the worldwide box office, with a reported budget of $281m.Explore more on these topicsFilmLord of the RingsScience fiction and fantasy filmsFilm adaptationsJRR TolkienCate BlanchettnewsShareReuse this content"

Its value has not been revealed, although a smaller work by Mitchellsold for $29min 2023. Pérez described it as “priceless”.The work will hang next to the museum’s Rothko room, wherefive of his muralsare displayed. Pérez said the two artists’ paintings “form an incredible partnership. They just talk to each other.”Like the art of many female artists of the period, Mitchell’s work had been underestimated in her lifetime, Balshaw said, and the museum had “missed the boat” by not acquiring more of her works – it previously owned only some prints and a smaller, late painting – when they were more affordable.“By the time we realised the importance of the work, they were too expensive for a UK public institution to buy,” she said.View image in fullscreenDarlene and Jorge M Pérez.Photograph: Sodiq Adelakun/Reuters“This [gift] has changed the British national collection permanently,” she said. “It’s such a significant rebalancing – it’s not just filling a gap, it is taking us into a new representation of work of that period.”An acquisition of this scale would not be possible without “an act of truly extraordinary generosity” by philanthropist donors, Balshaw acknowledged. About 30% of Tate’s funding comes from government grants, but it is still struggling with a post-pandemic financial squeeze andrecently announced job cutsin an effort to tackle its funding deficit.She had been in discussions with the philanthropist couple – who have also given donations worth more than $100m to Miami’sPérez Art Museum, now named in their honour – since they visited aninstallation by the Ghanaian sculptor El Anatsuiin Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in 2023, she said.“I can tell you that the conversation about gifting this important work focused on the millions of people that will see this work here in London,” said Balshaw. “You have given the British public and all our visitors from around the world a truly extraordinary thing, and I am deeply grateful.”Having extended their bedroom to accommodate the work, parting with it had been “a very difficult decision in many ways”, said Pérez. He added: “We’ve always collected with the intent that art should be exposed to the most people that they can possibly be exposed to.View image in fullscreenMaria Balshaw, the Tate director, spent two years talking to the couple about the gift.Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images“Because I think art changes people’s lives. It’s changed our life for the better. It helps us understand the world better in different ways. It makes us part of the creative process that the artists go through, once you deeply get into them. So having the public feel the same thing that we feel is very important.”When asked for his interpretation of the work’s connection to the painter’s German shepherd, Pérez said: “Actually, I think it’s got much more connection to landscape than to a dog. These are just her expressions of a mood, a landscape.”The real-estate magnate was born in Argentina to Cuban-exile parents, before moving to Miami and making his fortune developing apartment blocks. Although previously a friend of Donald Trump before he ran for the US presidency, he is a longtime Democratic party supporter and fundraiser, and has been an outspoken critic of Trump’s policies, saying in December that his proposals for mass deportationsrisked leading to a “police state”.A previous request by the president to help him build his Mexico border wall was similarly rebuffed, withPérez calling it “idiotic”.As well as the painting, the couple have also made a “multimillion-pound” donation to endow a curatorial post at Tate dedicated to African art, and have promised to make further donations of works in their collection by African and Latin American artists.Pérez hopes the couple’s gifts will inspire other wealthy individuals to make donations. “The public sector is swamped with ever growing needs, and it all can’t be solved by the government,” he said. “People who have been very fortunate, like Darlene and I have been, have an obligation to give back to that community that is giving you so much. So we really hope that gifts like this get other people to think about giving.”Explore more on these topicsTate ModernArtPhilanthropynewsShareReuse this content"

I hope you enjoy them.”Fans will be able to hear the 75-year-old rock star developing from the spartan tenor of Nebraska towards the sound of Born in the USA on a record titled LA Garage Sessions 83. Streets of Philadelphia Sessions, meanwhile, expands on the sound of the song Springsteen made for Jonathan Demme’s 1993 film Philadelphia, dabbling in drum loops and synthesisers and the influence of hip-hop. Fearing a disconnect with his audience, his next album was instead The Ghost of Tom Joad in 1995.Other discs include Faithless, the soundtrack for a film that was never made, pedal steel-inflected country on Somewhere North of Nashville, the noirish Twilight Hours and what a press release describes as the “richly woven border tales” of Inyo. The evolution of home recording technology, Springsteen said in a statement, “allowed me to go into a wide variety of different musical directions”.Bruce Springsteen: Tracks II: The Lost Albums trailer – videoIn a trailer for the release, he decried the popular opinion that he had a “lost period” in the 90s. “Really I was working the whole time,” he said.Rain in the River, from the album Perfect World, is out now.The physical release includes a 100-page book featuring rare archival photos and liner notes for each record. A 20-song selection from across the seven albums will also be released. The original Tracks collection was released in 1998, drawing on B-sides, outtakes and demos.Springsteen returns to the UK for the third summer in a row this year, performing in Manchester and Liverpool. His most recent original album was Only the Strong Survive, released in 2022. On Record Store Day (12 April), Springsteen and the Killers will release the Encore at the Garden EP, documenting the New Jersey musician’s surprise appearance with the Vegas indie band at Madison Square Garden in 2022.Tracks II: The Lost Albums will be released on 27 June.Explore more on these topicsBruce SpringsteenPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

You know, that I would go, ‘That’s a big idea, but I’m not sure I want to put that idea out there, frankly.’ I do think about that.”Soderbergh was speaking toOne Decision, a podcast whose co-hosts includeSir Richard Dearlove, a former head of the British intelligence service MI6, the former CIA directorLeon Panettaand nowKate McCann, a Times Radio presenter. True to Dearlove and Panetta’s background, Soderbergh was there to discuss his new film,Black Bag, an espionage thriller starring Michael Fassbender and Cate Blanchett.View image in fullscreen‘I have my own standard of what I think is being deeply irresponsible’ … Steven Soderbergh in 2018.Photograph: Max Bertani/action press/REX/ShutterstockBut conversation also turned to Contagion. Staring Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet and Marion Cotillard, the filmsurged backto prominence in early 2020, as Covid emerged from China and much of the world locked down. In the UK, thanks to then health secretary Matt Hancock, Soderbergh’s movie eveninformed vaccine policy.At the time, Scott Z Burns, who wroteContagion,told NPRhe and Soderbergh wanted to depict a “plausible” outbreak, “not a Hollywood exaggeration”.“We were trying to tell a story that was credible within the boundaries of scientific understanding, but also illuminate how our world might respond – that is why the poster of the movie says ‘Nothing spreads like fear’,” Burns said.Soderbergh told One Decision: “They found a vaccine in the movie faster than you would have been able to then. In the interim, a couple of years before Covid, new technology allowed us to get to a vaccine in a shockingly short period of time.“I mean, the scientific community was aware of what was happening in Wuhan in November and by January, they had a working vaccine [US authorities sayCovid was detected in December 2019, with the first human vaccine trials in March 2020]. That’s insane how fast that happened and how many lives were saved. This typically when we made Contagion would have been three to four years.”Responding toDearlove’sdescription of his belief that Covid-19 escaped from a laboratory, a theory at first downplayed butincreasingly taken seriouslyinstead of the position that the virus spread from a food market, Soderbergh said “the people I’m talking to” about pandemics believed Covid came from a lab but had “a zoonotic origin”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s what I’ve heard.”Returning to the espionage theme – and his dislike of James Bond films – Dearlove said: “There’s a real design flaw in the Bond villain plan to engineer a virus [Ernst Stavro Blofeld,On Her Majesty’s Secret Service] which is the virus doesn’t respect any boundary and will go everywhere including back into your house.”McCann asked if Soderbergh was considering a sequel to Contagion. Soderbergh mentioned his “terrifying” ideas, and said: “It’s [about] being responsible and understanding how people take things in … I have my own standard of what I think is being deeply irresponsible and exciting.“I think about that whenever I’m about to unleash something to the public, whether that’s a post or a movie or a TV show or an article, I think it’s important to run through the potential consequences of what you’re saying. And first of all, I would hope that whatever you’re saying is true and that it’s defensible and that you can lay out the logic of what you’re saying.“But secondly, I don’t want to contribute to what I consider to be noise. I want to be signal. I don’t want to be noise. And noise to me is just things that are insincere, ultimately.

The old banger of a Mini in the garage is what triggers the drama: Dennis (Tom Richardson) is trying to sell it, and Neil (Joseph Clowser), callow and dyspeptic, turns up for a viewing, hoping to buy it for his dissatisfied, heavy drinker of a wife, Pam (Helen Phillips). Dennis is every bit the shifty secondhand car salesman in this opening scene, while his nervy wife, Vera (Holly Smith), and battleaxe mother, Marjorie (Connie Walker), make cups of tea around the men.They seem like recognisable characters from TV sitcoms of their day (from Till Death Us Do Part to George and Mildred) but slowly take on darker shades as if Ayckbourn is skewering stock types. Dennis is a proto-mansplainer, unable to express emotion or support his unravelling wife. Neil is something of a proto new man in the early throes of masculine crisis – he has a wife that wants independence while he feels pressure to be the breadwinner. Both marriages are built on agonising compromises, yet the register is ostensibly light and clearly in imitation of the era’s TV comedies.View image in fullscreenDarker shades … Tom Richardson as Dennis and Joseph Clowser as Neil.Photograph: Will GreenUnder the direction of Michael Cabot, the tone wavers uncertainly, awkward and undercharged, and the drama plays out like Abigail’s Party but without the savage laughs. Pam is the most rounded character and compassionately drawn in her itch to be something in the world. It is a shame the others feel so flimsy: Vera’s breakdown looks like an overdone cliche, Marjorie is a comic monster and Dennis remains emotionally impenetrable. At least Neil is made vulnerable but little is tied up or carried through, from the hasty resolution around his marital woes to the money-losing scheme suggested to him by Dennis.A kitchen sink drama in a garage, it may well have been revelatory to 1970s audiences in dramatising the trap of marriage for women and the trap of masculinity for men – under the cover of comedy. But the blend of domestic light and dark does not pack the punch it should here. It has also been long since finessed by TV soap operas. Ayckbourn might have been a forerunner to EastEnders, and maybe that is this play’s accomplishment but it looks and sounds rather too much like a museum piece now.AtTheatre Royal Windsoruntil 5 April.Then touringuntil 12 July.Explore more on these topicsTheatreAlan AyckbournreviewsShareReuse this content"

Title after title is devoted to clay and stone, trees and flowers, the riverine and the botanical, gardens and allotments. Some volumes are philosophical, others urgent calls for climate justice. They share a vocabulary: care, tending, grounding, rootedness, nourishment, regeneration. Nature, however battered, is held up as an antidote to morbid modernity, its alienations, its amnesia.The Possibility of Tenderness is also about nature, its setting Coffee Grove in the May Day Mountains of Jamaica. During Jason Allen-Paisant’s early childhood there, it had no electricity or piped water. Neither beach idyll nor Trenchtown ghetto, its personality was shaped in large part by “grung” – the local name for small plots cultivated by peasant farmers. Apples, guava, mangoes: here, for all the sweat and toil, was succulence. And memories of feeling connected – to the ground, to the past, to kinfolk. “In ‘soil’,” Jennifer Kabat has written, “I hear other words: soul and social.”Education was Allen-Paisant’s passport. He moved away – to the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. Later Oxford. He didn’t shed his past entirely, though: a study of Martiniquais poet Aimé Césaire was subtitled Thinking With Spirits; a volume of his own poems was called Thinking With Trees. Returning to Jamaica from Leeds where he lives, his new book attempts to think with Coffee Grove. This involves deep time: it emerged from the ocean, a bed of limestone, more than 15m years ago. Slavery, understood in environmental terms, sculpts and embeds itself in the landscape, too.If there’s a dominant figure it’s Keturah, the author’s grandmother, who converted to the Church of God, married a man much older than her and, when their relationship fell apart, moved to the Grove with her young daughter. She was upright, a “de facto administrator for the village, a sort of mayor”. She looked after Allen-Paisant when he was young, carrying him up the hill to the Mount Pleasant postal agency she ran. It was a modest shack, but to the knee-high boy it seemed much more solid and grand than that. His grown-up self, back to plant his own daughters’ umbilical cords in the earth, wants to know and tell us more about her.He talks to locals, goes on mini-treks with herbalist Rastas, pores over old maps in local archives. No clear story emerges. In its absence are riffs – on the difference between a vision and a dream, the ubiquity of tombs, the frequency with which hillside people speak about the dead, what he claims is the absence of the term “forest” in the local vernacular. Walking especially fascinates him as it allows him to smell and to hear the countryside with an almost tactile acuteness. He even remembers how his grandmother, like many who lived in the Grove, “would walk with one arm gripping the other behind her back”.By his own telling, Allen-Paisant hasn’t spent a lot of time in Jamaica in recent decades. One of the things about grung life that he now responds to – its smallness, so different from industrial-scale agriculture – is what led him to leave in the first place. It would take longer than the few weeks he’s able to spend in Coffee Grove to be able to offer more than skin-deep insights into its present stateFor a poet his prose can be surprisingly slack. (A house has “a kind of aliveness”; subterranean stories exert “a special kind of fascination” on him). It combines wellness-platform peppiness (endless swooning about “beauty” and “joy”) with lurches into grandiosity (trying to evoke the time that has passed since slavery, he declares, “I am reminded of some lines I wrote in a prose poem”).A fondness for lectern-isms leads to silly overstatements such as “Europeans have all sorts of marble structures, columns, statues, monuments, temples to the glory of their history”. Allen-Paisant’s heart is in the right place, and there are passages that prickle and sing, but The Possibility of Tenderness is too self-conscious, groomed and full of box-ticking invocations of grace/embodiment/connection to fully realise that possibility.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A teenage orphan from coastal Kent, where she grew up swimming with seals and dolphins, she’s escaped a half-starved life as a factory worker by dressing as a boy to go to sea. Now she finds herself in a crew captained by a morose, reclusive, peg-legged man, who is monomaniacally obsessed with finding and killing the great white whale which maimed him. As many readers will already have guessed, the unlucky Ishmaelle has landed herself in a retelling of Moby-Dick.While names and other details are changed,Call Me Ishmaelle hews to the original more closely than most such books. For instance, in the whaling town of New Bedford, Ishmaelle is compelled to share a bed at an inn with a Polynesian harpooner who has spent his day hawking a shrunken head around town; while he terrifies her at first with his tattooed face and tomahawk, the two are soon smoking a pipe together and swearing eternal friendship. Every fan of Moby-Dick will recognise the character Queequeg, and though Guo renames him Kauri and pares away some of the broad comedy and exoticising detail, she otherwise recapitulates every move. More generally, she sticks to the outlines of Herman Melville’s plot; we are heading to the same doom by the same route.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Moby-Dick is notoriously prolix, incorporating sermons, soliloquies and chapter-long digressions about marine biology. Call Me Ishmaelle is tightly plotted and roughly 300 pages shorter. Guo’s language, while often lyrical, is also comparatively plain, with Melville’s page-long descriptions, dripping with biblical quotations, replaced by sentences such as “One morning we sighted some whales and lowered our boats.”In another innovation, Guo’s Ahab – here Captain Seneca – is half-Black and half-Native American, so his obsession with killing the great white monster is tinged with the trauma of racist violence. This is made explicit by sections in Seneca’s voice, which pour out in a pain-maddened, unpunctuated flood. “O how many times [my father] told me about his sea voyage from Africa and how he had come to the new land with whipped bleeding back and starved like a dying ostrich and sold from one farm to another … hear me whale this is the world of us men not the mindless life of fish … Fish what would you know of rage …”In 19th-century Massachusetts, there really were many Black whaling captains, whaling being a despised but highly skilled profession in which ability alone could win advancement. There were also many cases of women who disguised themselves as men to go to sea, some of whom – like Ishmaelle – must have been gender-nonconforming for reasons other than expediency. Guo’s premise is entirely historically accurate. However, she is not concerned with reconstructing the details of these lives, or even with explicating the institutional violence that shaped them. This is not historical but gothic fiction, where political crimes are not a social reality but a nightmare half-glimpsed and repressed, which returns in monstrous form to destroy the guilty and the innocent. The depiction of sexuality also follows a gothic logic. There is no innocent erotic pleasure in this world, and romantic love can only end in an untimely death. When Ishmaelle wakes to a furtive sex act in a neighbouring hammock, she is transfixed by horror. “I was the mute witness, compelled to hear, and to see darkly … The two next to me had become one with their pressing and pulsing and their jagged pumping … Would the Lord strike them down, and me too, just as He wasted Sodom … ?”Xiaolu Guo: ‘Write less, in order to write stronger’Read moreI often wished Guo had struck off more boldly in her own direction. The plot of Melville’s masterpiece is an ungainly, picaresque thing, designed to bear a great freight of Old Testament symbolism, arcane whaling lore and philosophical sublimities. Denuded of all this, some episodes land wrong. The joins between the two narratives are also a little rough. Guo’s whales are not symbols but mammals with a subjectivity of their own. That’s great, but hard to square with the great white whale as mythical nemesis. She also doesn’t seem to be taking any position with regard to Melville; her novel uses his text as a template, but doesn’t challenge its premises, as, for instance, Percival Everett’sJamesdoes with Huckleberry Finn, so her fidelity to his plot lacked a clear rationale.I think I won’t be alone in finding the book disappointing as a response to Moby-Dick. Still, it is surprising and often beautiful, and I came to love Ishmaelle’s odd, thoughtful voice.Call Me Ishmaelle by Xiaolu Guo is published by Chatto & Windus (£18.99).

This compelling depiction of life at a crossroads is a male counterpart to Miranda July’s All FoursMarcel TherouxThu 3 Apr 2025 02.30 EDTShareBen Markovits’s quietly excellent new novel begins with the most mundane of middle-class crises. The book’s narrator, 55-year-old law professor Tom Layward, is taking his youngest child to university. For Tom and his wife Amy, the major tasks of parenting are about to vanish in the rear view mirror. The question is: what’s next?It’s a moment of change and re-evaluation for any couple. But within Tom and Amy’s marriage an unexploded bomb is ticking. Tom tells us in the first paragraph that, 12 years earlier, Amy had an affair. He managed his heartbreak by making a deal with himself that he would leave when his youngest went to college.Dropping his daughter Miri in Pittsburgh, Tom doesn’t head back to Amy in New York. He drives west, stopping to see old friends and family members, weighing his next move and reflecting on his past. As he confides in the reader, telling us about his background and upbringing, his marriage and career, he comes gradually into focus: an intriguing blend of frankness and reserve, bemusement, disappointment, fatherliness and compassion. Though it seems to promise no fireworks, there’s something compelling about the story he tells and the dramatic question that shapes it: will Tom make good on his promise to himself and leave the marriage?“What we obviously had,” he tells us, “even when things smoothed over, was a C-minus marriage, which makes it pretty hard to score much higher than a B overall on the rest of your life.” Here and throughout, Tom addresses us in a voice that appears disarmingly plain-speaking. Yet it would be a mistake to take what he says at face value. What gives his dilemma poignancy is the reader’s sense that Tom and Amy’s marriage is complicated and many-sided. Alongside the layers of bitterness and disappointment, there’s also love and understanding.The relaxed precision of the writing is one of the novel’s pleasures, along with the gradual unpacking of Tom’s mindSleeping in unfamiliar beds along his journey, Tom finds himself talking to Amy in his head, but he refrains from ringing her. He tells himself: “If you call Amy now the person you talk to will not be the person in your head, for whom you have these warm and simple feelings. It will be another person, who doesn’t like you much these days, with whom you get into stupid arguments.”One of the publishing highlights of last year wasAll Fours, Miranda July’s unsettling account of a middle-aged woman who feels compelled to upend the certainties of her marriage. The novel continues to rumble through the lives of readers who were touched by it; for some it was an invitation to emulate the drastic upheavals of the central character.I thought about July’s novel a lot as I was reading The Rest of Our Lives; it felt like a quieter male counterpart. While some readers seem to have approached All Fours as a self-help book or a guide to perimenopause, it is really a unique narrative understanding of a human life in all its particularity. And this is what The Rest of Our Lives is too. Like All Fours, it focuses on the difficult middle passage in the life of its protagonist, as he tries to figure out who he has been, what parts of himself he has surrendered, and who he might yet become.We learn as much from Tom’s encounters with other people as from what he tells us himself: we see that he’s decent, trustworthy and can bond with strangers, but that he’s also reticent, closed and disappointed. “I forgot what you’re like,” says an ex-girlfriend he looks up on his way across America. “You don’t really care about anything.” Like all the summary judgments in the book, this is not accurate, but you understand how Tom gives this impression. And you sense how frustrating it would be to be in a relationship with him – a feeling that at any given time he’s holding a great deal back.While this might make him an annoying spouse, as a prose stylist, it makes him exemplary. This is a literary novel whose great literary qualities are understatement and self-effacement. Here’s Tom reflecting on his daughter’s boyfriend: “I liked him, but I also thought, in high school there’s no way I’m friends with this kid.” Or, staying in a room that overlooks a river: “Funny how the eye is drawn to water – it’s just a very flat part of the view. But it shifts a little, slowly.” Or visiting a family friend: “I was aware of being a dim presence in the background of the more vivid lives of children.” Or just waiting to go home at the end of an evening with his son: “We were outside the restaurant now, standing on Sixth Street in the rough warm traffic-flavoured air.” Tom’s usual restraint makes “rough warm traffic-flavoured” shine like a jewel in a plain setting.The relaxed precision of the writing is one of the novel’s pleasures. Another is the gradual unpacking of Tom’s mind as we travel alongside him. And though the novel doesn’t apparently offer much in the way of plot, it deploys its revelations very cleverly, with little sleights of hand that throw the story forward to its crisis and remind us that its ruminations and incidents are not random.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Playing alongside an old friend, they turn up the heat on their opponents and Tom feels his powers return for a brief moment. “You forget what it’s like to play with somebody who really knows what he’s doing,” he reflects. “The world just opens up.”Markovits, too, really knows what he’s doing. And it would be nice to think that the brilliant and unflashy naturalism of his novel will win many readers.The Rest of Our Lives by Ben Markovits is published by Faber (£16.99).

His singingThis bizarre drama stars the Hollywood actor as a dead bounty hunter brought back to life by the devil to do his bidding. Sadly, it also includes horrifying country musicLucy ManganThu 3 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 3 Apr 2025 00.06 EDTShareThere is nothing very new to see in The Bondsman. How much you enjoy it will depend on how much you enjoy Kevin Bacon (laconic, hard-bitten Kevin Bacon, notTremors Kevin Baconand not Footloose Kevin Bacon), how much you enjoy tales of demonic possession in a small town in southern America and how much you enjoy the sound of partly severed heads, blown-out tracheas and bloodied fingers. I am seven degrees of separation from liking this last aspect.But Bacon is Bacon, and if he is slightly sleepwalking through his role here as Hub Halloran, tracker of ne’er-do-wells with warrants against their names, well, it is hardly inappropriate given that, for most of the eight episodes, Hub is dead. He is killed by local heavies hired by Lucky Callahan (Damon Herriman – you’ll know him when you see him), the new boyfriend of Hub’s ex-wife Maryanne (Jennifer Nettles), seeking to eliminate the competition.But the devil is down in Georgia – or at least several of his minions are – and Hub is resurrected to round them up and send them back to hell. The Pot of Gold corporation represents Satan here on Earth and Midge (Jolene Purdy) is the company’s rep. She explains to Hub and his loving mama Kitty (Beth Grant, who after a career of playing this part is at last being given a little more to do here) that this is his get-out-of-hell free card. As long as he keeps sending demons home, he will stay on Earth. The moment he misses, back to the eternal lake of fire he goes. Kitty is bemused. What has her son done to deserve eternal damnation? Hub is damned – metaphorically speaking – if he knows, he assures her. The viewer is not so certain.Did I mention there are posters up all around town about a woman who has gone missing? No? There are. I’m just telling you. Apropos of absolutely nothing.Hub’s posthumous status means that he can recognise the demons who are now skin walking in li’l ol’ Landry town and dispatches at least one per episode, beginning with the possessed pastor whose crucifixes and holy water did not have the repellent effect he surely hoped.As we go along, bodies levitate, faces peel off, water burns, bodies spontaneously combust, mean teens die. All basic demoniacal tradition is here, plus light comic touches to throw the horrors into relief (like the job manual Midge leaves with him, but which hasn’t been updated since 1973, so she advises him to go online instead). Eventually, Hub works out that there may be more to this “Just vanquish these demons-of-the-week, would ya!” story from Midge and the devil than he initially thought (why are they all descending on Landry? Why are they taking time out to sacrifice victims rather than simply skipping from host to host as he pursues them?). To thicken the plot, we also have the continuing human villainy of Lucky and his attempts to oust Hub from Maryanne’s affections and from what he still believes to be his life on Earth. Plus, there’s the gradual entanglement of Hub’s entire family – including 15-year-old son Cade (Maxwell Jenkins) – in his attempts to clean house and keep himself out of hell.There is also a subplot that is enough to strike true fear in the heart of even the most robust horror fan: back in the day, Hub and Maryanne were a successful country singing duo. And deep down, they yearn to be so again. She still plays at local nightclub The Boxcar. He still has videotapes of the glory days. And yes, the viewer’s heart rightly fills with terror as the suspicion rises that what drew Bacon, one half of country- and folk-rock duo The Bacon Brothers, to this project was not his love of Stephen King-inflected southern gothic, but the chance to sing and play guitar on stage. I cannot speak to the truth of this. I can only say that it does happen and that, while death does not seem quite the preferable option, the gap between it and those others does narrow. The number of the beast is 4/4 time.The Bondsman is on Prime Video now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewKevin BaconreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’m left alone and in near total silence as I look along the train tracks that disappear in either direction. It feels as if I’m in the heart of the countryside, but actually, the Boulevard Périphérique, the traffic-choked ring road that encircles Paris, is just a stone’s throw away. This disused rail route, the Petite Ceinture, offers wildlife and quiet solitude just moments from the roaring motorway, thanks to a plan that is turning parts of the line into walkable green spaces – the French capital’s less manicured (and less central) alternative toManhattan’s High Lineor north London’s Parkland Walk, a rewilded railway line that’s part of the Capital Ring walk.Paris mapBuilt on the site of the Thiers wall, the last defensive wall of Paris, and its surrounding shantytown, the eight-lane Boulevard Périphérique (known as the Périph) is used by more than a million cars a day. The 20-mile (32km) railway line just inside the ring road was created to supply the Thiers wall, carrying goods and then passengers as the city’s first metropolitan railway service.But, as the Métro we know today developed, la Petite Ceinture’s popularity declined, with much of it becoming derelict. Together with the city of Paris, the line’s owner, SNCF Réseau (part of the state-owned railway company), have worked to regreen 4.5 miles of the track in small sections around the city since 2006 – and by 2026 a further 2.5 miles will be opened (the rest is inaccessible to the public).View image in fullscreenMuch of the Petite Ceinture stopped being used in the 1930s, and it was finally closed as a working railway in the late 1980s.Photograph: Michel Rubinel/AFP/Getty ImagesLike the city’s different arrondissements, each section of walkable track has its own personality and has been approached differently. In some places, paths, nature trails and shared gardens have been created, while others have been left to rewild. In residential Bel-Air in the 12th, the Ceinture is calm and well maintained, with trees and greenery on either side. I walk along the railway tracks behind an elderly couple strolling arm in arm, while a man rakes the soil in an allotment at the edge of the line. Mid-morning in the northern reaches of the 19th, I pass a man sweeping glass from around the entrance of La Gare-Le Gore, a club in an old Ceinture station that hosts experimental jazz until midnight and techno until 6am.In summer, tree canopies obscure the peripheries to give the impression that you’re enveloped in natureThe Ceinture is generally far less polished than New York’s High Line, but the most similar section – and the busiest and neatest – is in the 15th arrondissement, between the Pont du Garigliano and Parc Georges Brassens. Here, I take a lift down to the line from street level and walk past elaborate graffiti next to the fenced-off tunnel, and alongside the courts and clubhouses of the Vaugirard Tennis Club. I stop atVoie 15, a trendy restaurant, coffee shop and coworking space in a converted station building, full of young professionals on their laptops, while joggers run past along the tracks. Further on, I even snatch a view of the (top of the) Eiffel Tower framed by apartment buildings. One of the main aims of the repurposed Ceinture is to encourage wildlife to the city, with different areas feeling more or less “wild”. The sunken section between Avenue du Général Leclerc and Rue Didot in the 14th arrondissement, with its high, tree-studded banks, supports almost 250 different species of plants and animals. In winter, a colony of pipistrelle bats hibernate inside the tunnel at the western end, and along with the rest of the Ceinture, it’s an important habitat for hedgehogs and foxes. In spring and summer, vegetation crowds the tracks and tree canopies obscure the peripheries here to give the impression that you’re enveloped in nature. In the well-heeled 16th, the line has been taken over by a strip of woodland and 200 plant species have been recorded here, including hazel and blackthorn, gooseberries, viburnum and buddleia. Amid Paris’s neatly manicured parkland, it’s a rare opportunity to get my boots caked in mud.View image in fullscreenPeople stroll along the disused lines from the Villa du Bel-Air to Avenue du Général-Michel-Bizot in the 12th arrondissement.Photograph: Michel Rubinel/AFP/Getty ImagesSeveral grassroots, community-focused projects and venues thrive on the Ceinture’s undeveloped land and abandoned infrastructure. I head toLa REcyclerie, an urban farm and eco-centre focusing on repairs and recycling, which crams a lot into its stretch by the Porte de Clignancourt. The canteen in the old station building is buzzing with people finishing a late lunch or enjoying an early aperitif. A pop-up market focuses on vintage clothes, and on the 1,000sq-metre (10,700sq ft) urban farm, volunteers tend to the chickens. The events programme features everything from French language sessions for refugees to DIY courses. “In a very dense neighbourhood with few green spaces, it seems important to let nature reclaim its rights and help agriculture in the city,” says Marie-Eugénie Chanvillard, La REcyclerie’s eco-cultural project manager.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In each area, it has taken on a role – a place for people, a place for nature, a place for community.
