It was with that in mind that I dragged myself out of bed early one Saturday morning to seePlaymobil: The Movie– why couldn’t it be done again with a similar IP? It was excruciating. The best part of the film was at the beginning, when the usually wonderful Anya Taylor-Joy sings a song to her little brother about the joys of imagination and exploration, at which point the police arrive to inform them that their parents are dead. That was by far the biggest laugh, as the remainder of the film tried to outdo itself in the garishness and loudness stakes.Olly, 47, Birmingham‘My eyes still ache’Lancelot Link: Secret Chimp (1970–1971)View image in fullscreenExploitative and vile … Lancelot Link: Secret Chimp.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyWith all due disrespect toAll’s Fair, it cannot come close to the single worst piece of garbage ever inflicted on TV viewers, back in the 1970s. Undoubtedly it was supposed to be camp and cute; what it was was exploitative and vile. I’m talking, of course, about Lancelot Link: Secret Chimp. Chimpanzees were dressed up and given things to chew, while humans dubbed in cheesy dialogue to their flapping lip motions. My eyes (and brain) still ache.Catherine, Massachusetts‘Unintentionally hilarious’Waterworld (1995)View image in fullscreenImpossible to take seriously … Waterworld.Photograph: Entertainment Pictures/AlamyIn 1995, a friend and I decided to see Waterworld, starringKevin Costner. Neither of us was particularly fond of Costner, but we both adored Dennis Hopper. Plus, my friend had a two-for-one voucher, it was a scorching 35C outside, and the cinema was literally the coolest place in town. What we didn’t expect was to stumble into one of the funniest movie experiences of our lives. Waterworld turned out to be unintentionally hilarious. I’m not sure what the sparse matinee crowd made of our cackling, but it was impossible to take Costner’s earnestness seriously. Hopper’s gloriously over-the-top performance made it feel like he was in on the joke. It cracks me up to this day. It was a zero-star cultural moment, but a five-star bonding experience.Ke, Ireland‘I’m still processing how awful it was’After Life (2019-2022)View image in fullscreenNo joy … After Life, with Ricky Gervais and Penelope Wilton.Photograph: Ray Burmiston/NetflixI recently sat through After Life. I’m still processing how awful it was. I loved The Office and Extras, and normally found something to like in Ricky Gervais’s work. Even Derek. But if you don’t think the c-word is amusing in and of itself, you might want to watch something other than After Life, because that’s about 90% of the jokes here.In this show, Ricky Gervais plays himself with a twist. He’s rude, obnoxious, hurts and upsets people, but his wife died, so it’s OK. Plus, the other characters constantly tell him how amazing he is. One minute, we’re being smashed over the head with sad music as not-Ricky watches yet another weird video of his dead wife telling him he’s wonderful. The next, we’re being invited to laugh at one of the zany residents of a village doing something disgusting, someone using the c-word, or one of Gervais’s already-visited pet hates. (Fat people eating loudly! The worst, right?)Not-Ricky commits several serious crimes which are barely mentioned again, including threatening a child with a hammer and throwing a brick through the window of a moving car. Twice, he’s on the verge of killing himself, only to be saved by a sad look from a dog. A lot of people say the show brings them joy and comfort – I disagree.Will, London‘After 15 minutes, we were almost the only people left’Moonshine – Hampsteadtheatre (1999)View image in fullscreenAn absolute disaster … Moonshine, with Robin Soans and Ingeborga Dapkunaite.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDuring my career as a journalist I reviewed theatre, and in 1999 I found myself at Hampstead theatre for a new work, Moonshine, by Snoo Wilson. It was the second performance, and I was surprised to find the theatre only about a third full. It was clear that either the fewearly reviewshad already had an effect, or word of mouth had spread fast. Moonshine was an absolute disaster on every level – incomprehensible plot, stultifying dialogue, a set design that might have been the product of a freshers’ week post-pub round-table, and a cast who clearly just wanted to get through the four-week run with a modicum of dignity.At the interval, my companion and I sat down in the bar to the sound of audience members exiting through the creaky swing doors. After 15 minutes, we were almost the only people left, apart from the theatre’s artistic director who was desperately trying to convince the one other remaining punter that the audience just needed to “give the work a chance”.As I cringed at the thought of abandoning my responsibility as a critic, we downed our Becks and scarpered into the rain. To this day I still cannot fathom how the play managed to make it beyond the first read-through.Michael Parker, 72, London‘It feels like it never ends’The Room (2003)View image in fullscreenUnwatchable … The Room, with Tommy Wiseau and Juliette Danielle.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyI know, I know, it’s a classic now forhow terrible it is, so much so that there’s another film in tribute to it – but I still find The Room to be completely unwatchable. It feels like it never ends. It. Just. Goes. On.Hi, doggy.Eoin, 34, Galway, Ireland‘I felt sorry for the performers and crew’An Officer and a Gentleman –Lyrictheatre, Sydney (2012)I saw this musical production in 2012 and the trauma is still fresh. It was godawful; full of Aussie performers doing their version of “I’m an angry, beef-head US Naval Officer, sir!” When a character died, I thought, “Thank God. One less to worry about.” The stage show included unnecessary female nudity, which was inappropriate and out of place. More than half the audience left at the intermission, never to return. I stayed because I felt sorry for the performers and crew.Anonymous, Sydney, Australia‘The first movie I contemplated walking out of’28 Years Later (2025)View image in fullscreenOh boy … 28 Years Later, with Alfie Williams, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes.Photograph: Miya MizunoPossibly the worst cinematic cultural moment I ever experienced was 28 Years Later. I was excited to see a well-made zombie movie after years of drought. I bought tickets for the premiere, invited a fellow horror aficionado friend along. We were both so confident this was going to bethemovie of the year.Oh boy, were we wrong. I have never looked at someone so many times in utter disbelief as I have while watching that movie. Not to give any spoilers, but the ending with the tracksuits and ninja-style zombie killing totally ruined it. Truly, this is the first movie I contemplated walking out of, and I would have if I hadn’t been with someone else.Katharina, 23, Aachen, Germany‘They lost me’Unbreakable (2000)View image in fullscreenComic sans … Samuel L Jackson in Unbreakable.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyThis might be a bit unpopular, but it’s M Night Shyalaman’s film Unbreakable for me. I saw it at the cinema, full of hope after seeing The Sixth Sense, but when Samuel L Jackson claimed that the Egyptian hieroglyphics were just like comic books, I said, out loud, in the cinema (for which I apologise), “No, they’re not!” – and that was it, they’d lost me. Can’t watch any of the sequels or sidequels either.David Cochrane, 56, Nottingham‘Instantly irrelevant’Babes in the Wood (1998-1999)View image in fullscreenWafer-thin … Babes in the Wood, with Natalie Walter, Denise van Outen and Steve Nicolson.Photograph: Carlton TelevisionAs a TV addict in the late 90s without a satellite subscription, I gorged myself on everything terrestrial TV had to offer. Babes in the Wood was the ultimate test of my love for the medium. What seemed to me at the time as three poorly written female leads bouncing off the faux charm of “that man from the Flash ads” has only become worse through a brief rewatch. Episodes are without substance and plots are wafer-thin.The fact that this drivel was being aired in the same year HBO released Sex and the City shows how instantly irrelevant this show was, despite a second series being commissioned. It nearly ruined both TV and floor cleaners for my teenage self.Patrick McKiernan, 42, Belfast‘A plotless slog’Ishtar (1987)The film Ishtar is aversion therapy for fans of Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty. Less exciting than a tricycle accident; less witty than a stunned mollusc; less intriguing than a dial tone. Spend 107 non-refundable minutes of your life with two songwriters searching the Moroccan desert for a mythical city, only to find themselves trapped in something like “Waiting for Guffman meets Sartre’s No Exit”, with less merit.Morgaine, Virginia, USAExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDanny Boyle28 Years LaterTheatreRicky GervaisKevin CostnerM Night ShyamalanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But what comes next could be nastily complicatedWed 12 Nov 2025 10.45 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 14.11 ESTShareBe absolutely clear.Keir Starmeris in very deep trouble indeed. Perhaps belatedly, he himself grasps this. His team and his ministers knew it already. His party and the public get it too. For this deeply unpopular Labour prime minister, the words approval rating are a contradiction in terms.Theeruption of speculationabout Starmer’s future this week may have taken people by surprise. Where did that suddenly come from? The short answer is that No 10 briefed the latest twist – that Starmer expects to face and defeat a leadership challenge – on Tuesday evening. The longer one is that the Starmer leadership issue has been steadily gaining traction and credibility among MPs since the summer. This story is not a Westminster confection. Politically, it is very real. Dismiss it at your peril.No 10 was responding to the issue that is the talk of the parliamentary Labour party. The talk is, very simply, a reflection of what the public now thinks. The public’s judgment about Starmer is brutal: it does not want him. The Labour party has to decide whether it thinks the public is right or wrong. That’s a dangerous game to play, especially for a party that is now sometimesrunning fourthin the polls.The Starmer question facingLabouris both straightforward and complicated at the same time. The straightforward version is that he is very unpopular and helping to drag Labour down. Get rid of him and perhaps things will improve. The more complicated one is that there is little agreement over how, when, and to whose benefit Starmer should be ousted, or what the political consequences would be. This is a moment for Labour to be careful what it wishes for. But the problem and the argument are not going to go away.Talk to MPs and officials and the anxieties are deep and unmissable. Many Labour MPs desire the end – a new leader – but draw back from the means. It’s serious, chaotic and incoherent, says one member of the government. Lots of discontent, but no plan, says a veteran. It’s worse than I thought, admits a cabinet minister. Once politicians start talking like this, though, the sands really are beginning to run out, and the process can speed up fast. The question is not whether Starmer is toast or not, a former insider says. He is just toast.The briefings are simultaneously an admission by No 10 that there really is a problem and also an attempt to call the critics’ bluff. A challenge to Starmer’s leadership would be reckless and dangerous, the briefings said. It could destabilise markets, disturb international relationships and plunge Labour into the kind of party infighting that the public hates. These are not arguments that can be lightly dismissed.But they have backfired. That this was aimed at Wes Streeting on a day when the health secretary was scheduled to undertake the morning media “round” and to make a speech on NHS reorganisation, is beyond doubt. Starmer’s aides have this week tried to flush out Streeting’s leadership ambitions in much the same way as theysuccessfully flushed outthose of Andy Burnham in September.The downside was that the briefings made the leadership issue public and gave Streeting a national platform to talk about it. Streeting used it to restate his loyalty to Starmer and to attack the atmosphere in Downing Street as toxic. No 10 may have hoped that all of this would bring Streeting into line, but it has ended up showing that Starmer, who was forced to condemn hostile briefings in the Commons today, seems not to be in charge of his own administration. Streeting, meanwhile, underscored that he is a more adept media performer than the prime minister, as well as a credible contender for his job. When the prize is the prime ministership, however, others will also be tempted.Where this all leads in the long term is therefore clear. Starmer will struggle to hold on. He is unlikely to lead Labour into the next general election. Mapping the precise path to that outcome is trickier – and predicting what happens afterwards is trickier still. The budget in two weeks’ time could force a challenge. But it may prove more popular with the party than the Labour doom-loop assumes. A landslide defeat in Scotland, Wales and the English local elections next May seems a likelier trigger.LikeJohn Major in 1995, Starmer could decide to force the issue by resigning and standing again. But that did nothing to strengthen Major’s authority, and it would do little for Starmer’s either. A more likely scenario, but still full of uncertainties because there is no precedent, would be that20% of Labour MPs– of whom there are now 405 – would try to trigger a leadership contest. This would then be thrown open to Labour affiliates and members. Such a thing has never happened when Labour has been in government.Traditionally, Labour has been exceptionally loyal to its leaders in ways the Conservatives cannot match. With the arguable exception of Tony Blair, who had done 10 years at the top, no Labour leader – and certainly no Labour prime minister – has been forced out against their will in modern times. Until now, the attempt to solve a party’s problems by changing the leader has been a Conservative speciality, as Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss all found out. It is a sign of how much has changed in the 2020s that the loyalty brake no longer holds the Labour party together either, and that Starmer’s ousting is so seriously canvassed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

None, though, came so soon after an emphatic election win as that which Starmer now faces. Gordon Brown, a far more skilled political infighter,successfully faced downan abortive challenge from within his own cabinet in 2009 by making clear he would not go without leaving blood on the walls. Longer ago, in 1969, Harold Wilsontold a rally: “May I say, for the benefit of those who have been carried away by the gossip of the last few days, that I know what’s going on. I’m going on, and the Labour government’s going on.” Starmer will wish it was so easy.It is not just Starmer who is fighting for his political life right now. It may also be the Labour party itself. One poll this autumn suggestedLabour could collapseto under 100 seats next time round, its worst ever result. While Labour MPs may dream of a cathartic leadership change that could revive the party’s faltering fortunes, the real lesson may be that both of the old parties that have dominated British politics for the past century are now disintegrating irreversibly. Neither Starmer, nor Streeting, nor any other wannabe successor, may be able to do very much about that.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourLabour party leadershipcommentShareReuse this content"

I had spent an hour outside theTottenham HotspurStadium, talking to Asian fans who had come to see their club play. Many had been introduced to Spurs through Son Heung-min, the beloved South Korean superstar.When Son was appointed captain in 2023 he became the first Asian player to lead a Premier League team, a boost not only for his already significant profile but that of Tottenham. For more than a decade, he brought a flow of Asian fans to Spurs matches. And despite his departure this summer for Los Angeles FC, they are still coming.They will be Spurs supporters for life, says Sun Thaicharoenporn, a 22-year-old Singaporean of Thai heritage who lives in London. He and his girlfriend, Ang Ang, turned up for the game against Aston Villa this month decked out in club scarves and caps. They flashed big smiles and happily posed when we took their photos outside the stadium. And then a Villa fan, in a group of men, interrupted. “Fuck Tottenham,” he yelled, leaning into their faces.Sun and Ang Ang blanched, but brushed it off. But the question lingered, unspoken. Would he have done that to other Tottenham fans? Would he have so confidently targeted a group of white men wearing Spurs colours, not Asian fans, stereotyped as more passive and timid, and maligned at times even by other Spurs fans online for being on the bandwagon, for not being “true” fans.View image in fullscreenSon Heung-min became the first Asian player to captain a Premier League side, and finally got his hands on a trophy when Spurs won the Europa League in May.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAWho gets to be a fan in English football, to fully participate in club culture, to feel they are part of a club? Son made a lot of people feel they could. When Sun moved to London three years ago for university, he told his girlfriend he wanted them to go to football and get behind a club, to participate in English culture and help them “integrate”. Tottenham were the clear choice. He had been following the team casually for years because of Son. “When I was in middle school he was the main Asian representation in the Premier League,” he says. Sun’s family were Liverpool or Manchester United fans. “I’m the black sheep,” he says wryly, “But I felt like I wanted to support a team which represented that kind of multi-diversity.”To him Son’s presence in the Spurs team, his selection as captain, made him feel Tottenham were a more tolerant, open club than others. “As an Asian person coming to the UK, you know you’re a minority, and Son’s presence, his leadership, sort of signifies that this club at least knows how to handle multi-diversity and they want to embrace that. So I feeI more safe going to the stadium and being part of the fans, being part of the club.”Sun also appreciated the “Asian values” Son displayed at Tottenham: his respectful and humble character, grace in leadership and politeness on the field. “A lot of the time you’d see him displaying a gesture, like a bow,” he says. “For example, after he won the Europa League he bowed to the fans.” The fact that Son was such a brilliant footballer made him even easier to get behind.View image in fullscreenJunoh Yoon and Sehyun are South Koreans studying in Ireland, and started to follow Spurs after Son’s arrival at the club.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianSon is a “cultural touchstone” for Koreans around the world, according to the New Yorkers Mike and Paul Chung. The brothers made a Spurs game a key part of their itinerary when they flew to London and Mike wore Son’s No 7 shirt for the occasion. “He validates the idea that a Korean can be one of the best players for the most popular sport in the world,” says Mike. Son remains an intrinsic part of Tottenham, the brothers say.“He is the best Asian player in England’s football history, so as a Japanese person I’m proud,” says Yusuke Sasaki, a casual spectator for the Villa game. Stat-obsessed Ko Morita, on holiday from Thailand, rattled off Real Madrid as his favourite team, but when asked about Son, the 11-year-old says: “Son Heung-min? He’s my boy! He’s so good! He and Harry Kane were the best strikers ever … for Tottenham at least, although to me Son is more like a left-winger.”The support that Son, and by association Tottenham and the Premier League, received in and from Asia over the past decade was massive, and measurably so. Visitors spent their dollars and stall owners around the stadium still report selling out Son scarves after a big game.South Korean students Junoh Yoon and Seynuh, studying in Ireland, flew over for the Villa match despite not having tickets. They just wanted to soak up the atmosphere and come to the stadium for the first time. “I’m a fan of the Spurs because of Son,” says Junoh. “But I’m a fan of the whole team. I’ve followed them for eight years now.”Son was such a well-liked player that he didn’t cop much hate from opposition supporters. But resentment among some Spurs fans at ticket prices going up, the difficulty of procuring them and their team being regarded as a tourist attraction affects Asian fans. Austen Chan, who grew up “religiously” watching Tottenham in Hong Kong, says he has seen a lot of such abuse “not so much in person at the games but online”. He has seen accusations that Korean fans who fly in for the games are only there for Son, taking up the spots of so-called “legitimate” fans. And as an Asian fan, he has felt uncomfortable scrutiny.View image in fullscreenAusten Chan and Isabel Cheung are from Hong Kong. Austen, 21, says he grew up ‘religiously’ supporting Spurs.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianAusten moved to London last year to study and has attended three games since, including the Villa match. But he doesn’t feel any “closer” to the team because of it. “I don’t think being from a different part of the world makes you any less of a Tottenham fan,” he says. “I may not have been able to go to games while I was in high school because I just was not in the same place, obviously. But I think the fact that I was willing to stay up till those early hours to watch the games shows that I’m just as much of a fan as any other person.”The harassment Sun and Ang Ang faced before kick-off was not the first such encounter, which he believes is fuelled in part because of his race. But he has also had positive experiences: on the way to the first game he took Ang Ang to last year, a Europa League encounter, they were approached by a group of older fans on the train “probably because we were Asian and looked relatively young. They asked us whether it was our first game watching the Spurs at a stadium and we exchanged our points of view on the legacy of the club. They also told us about how long they had been supporting Spurs and it felt like they were trying to welcome me and introduce me to a really big part of their life.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurSon Heung-minfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He doesn’t like Ford’s line.“Every historian uses it, they just beat it to death,” Gardner says cheerfully, by video from Bozeman,Montana.‘Most horrific death you could imagine’: the truth behind Netflix’s Death By LightningRead more“And it’s really not true. I wrote a narrative. I want people to be immersed in the time, but I just get so tired of that line. The legend is legend. It never becomes fact. People can repeat the legend but it doesn’t make it fact. It’s just a catchy thing that people have caught on to for decades now. And you’ll notice that I did not use it. I referred to it, but I did not use it.”Brothers of the Gun is scholarly, engaging, the story of two unlikely but lasting friends, Earp the complicated but upstanding lawman, Holliday the reckless gambler, stricken by tuberculosis.In Tombstone, Arizona, on 26 October 1881, Earp and Holliday were involved in a shootout that came to be known as theGunfight at the OK Corral. With Earp’s brothers, the pair confronted the Cowboys, gang members wanted for robbery and rustling. In less than a minute, three Cowboys were dead and Holliday was wounded, as were Virgil and Morgan Earp.It was one of countless frontier scraps between lawmen and outlaws and yet it entered legend, not least thanks to classic movies includingMy Darling Clementine, made by Ford in 1946 and starring Henry Fonda as Earp and Victor Mature as Holliday, and Gunfight at the OK Corral, directed by John Sturges in1957, Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas in the leading roles.“A lot of what we know about it is verifiable,” Gardner said of the actual fight and sequels, including killings on both sides. “But I always go back to one of the best quotes, and it’s a very simple quote. Addie Borland, who is the dressmaker across the street who witnessed the fight. People were asking for details, and she goes: ‘I don’t know. All was confusion.’View image in fullscreenDoc Holliday.Photograph: Random House“Even the people there had different stories. I cite often the testimony from what we call theSpicer hearing, and it’s also confusing. You’ve got people that are friends of the Cowboys, so they’re actually lying, and every account is slightly different. It’s rare when somebody agrees on anything. And so I think of Borland’s quote, ‘All was confusion.’ Even the people involved were confused. So it’s really hard to get at it, and it happened in 30 seconds.“And here’s the hilarious part. I just crack up every time I think of this. You wouldn’t believe how many books have all these massive diagrams of the gunfight. They’ll show each stage. You know, ‘Doc was standing here, Wyatt was over here, and here’s their movement, from Allen Street,’ all the way, they’re tracing with dotted lines. And then they got diagrams where people were, you know, for that 30 seconds … People are so fixated. They want to see ‘exactly what happened’. Well, I’m sorry. I mean, I think I know, pretty close, but I can’t give you a frame-by-frame every second of what’s going on, because even those guys, their stories kind of differ.”This is America. Stories have always been hard currency. Wyatt Earp lived into the Hollywood age, dying in 1929, aged 80, after plenty of fights over his story, who got to tell it and how. First depicted on a silent movie screen in 1923, then the subject of those two great mid-century westerns, in relatively recent years he’s been played by Kurt Russell (Tombstone,Val Kilmer as Holliday, 1993) and Kevin Costner (Wyatt Earp, with Dennis Quaid, 1994). On the small screen, Wyatt and Morgan Earp appeared in the great HBO seriesDeadwood, bit parts based on their brief stay in the gold rush town.Gardner drills through such myth-making to find the men beneath. His books cover the span of the old west. A devotee since childhood, as an adult he first wrote “the definitive study of wagons on the Santa Fe Trail, and in fact the only study on those wagons”. He has since written about Billy the Kid and Pat Garrett, Jesse James, Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders, and, most recently,The Earth Is All That Lasts, an award-winning story of “Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, and the Last Stand of the Great Sioux Nation”. His next book will turn back to James, the Missouri outlaw famouslyplayed by Brad Pitt, and his time as a civil war bushwhacker.Gardner refuses to romanticize such figures. Earp and Holliday spent time on either side of the law, in a world of violence and greed.View image in fullscreenWyatt Earp.Photograph: Random HouseBorn in Monmouth, Illinois, in 1848, Earp was too young to fight in the civil war, though he tried to do so. When he was 20, “he became a constable in Lamar, Missouri, this little, tiny town, with no police academy or training. And mistakes were made. Wyatt has a tragedy in his life with the death of his wife” – Urilla Sutherland, of typhoid in 1870 – after which, as constable, Earp kept for himself tax money he collected.“We don’t know why he kept it,” Gardner says. “He runs, and ends up in Oklahoma. He’s arrested for stealing a horse, and then he’s in Illinois, and he’s running a brothel. I mean, he is literally a pimp. His wife is a prostitute, or his common-law wife, significant other, whatever you call it. He finally heads back west, and he ends up in Wichita, Kansas, and he tries to help the law officer there. There’s a horrible killing, and he impresses the chief of police, and he gets a job. And he excels in that.“Now, this is the irony: Wyatt Earp is a policeman in Wichita, his wife is working in a brothel, and so is his brother’s wife, but he’s an outstanding police officer. Everybody says so. The newspapers, you read the quotes. They’re always praising him in the paper. There’s one instance where he arrests a drunk and the drunk has $500 on him. Any other officer might have pocketed that money and said he didn’t know what the drunk was talking about. But no, Earp holds the money for the drunk and gives it back when he releases him from jail. The same thing happened in Dodge City.“He was praised over and over again as a law officer, and later, when Wyatt’s in the [Spicer] hearing to decide whether he’s going to face a trial for murder after the OK Corral, he gets these letters from Wichita and Dodge City, signed by all these citizens, and they praise him to the stars.”Brothers of the Gun illustrates this fascinating aspect of the old west: friction between law and lawlessness, authorities trying to exert control over newly forming societies, or those societies attempting to rule themselves. The amount of bureaucracy that follows a gunfight – hearings, affidavits, orders for compensation – might be surprising, at least to a reader raised on Clint Eastwood movies, men with no names brooding in vast and terrible lands.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Random HouseFurthermore, as Gardner shows, Earp and Holliday were as entangled in hard politics as any prominent American from the dawn of the nation to now. Earp was a Republican. Tombstone sheriff Johnny Behan was a Democrat, a rival for influence and office.Gardner’s main characters were very different men. Holliday – born in Griffin, Georgia, in 1851, a dentist, hence “Doc” – was dissipated but not in general a thief.“Wyatt, you know, at least attempted to be something different than he was as a youth,” Gardner says. “He’s trying to better himself. And in Tombstone, he builds a house, he’s doing all the things that are right … I’m kind of sympathetic.“Now, Doc Holliday, as Wyatt said, he was kind of his own worst enemy. I don’t know if I buy into this fatalism thing” – part of the enduring myth, Holliday’s fatal sentence with tuberculosis supposed to have fueled a reckless streak. “There are instances where he didn’t want to die … But unlike Wyatt, he doesn’t buy a house. You don’t see these signs that he’s going to settle down. Doc just moves from one gambling place, one boomtown, to the next, and he never really changes. And part of that’s his addiction to gambling. Part of that is tuberculosis, dealing with that and self-medicating, whether it’s with alcohol or later laudanum. He doesn’t seem to have this ambition Wyatt does.“Wyatt is ambitious. He wants to be somebody, and he sees these different steps: deputy sheriff, but he wants to be county sheriff. He’s trying to better himself. And I just don’t see that with Doc Holliday. He just kind of stays the same throughout.”Brothers of the Gun isout nowExplore more on these topicsBooksHistory booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For example, Phoenix Casting charges a £30 plus VAT annual fee (deducted from your first job) plus 15% to 20% commission, while Casting Collective is free to join, but takes 20% commission on bookings.Reputable agencies will clearly explain fees upfront. Avoid any demanding a large upfront payment, or guaranteeing work, as these could be scams.According to Casting Collective, extras can expect to be paid between £150 and £250 a day on average.This is usually worked out according to a union pay scheme, not the agency you use.FAA/Pact (Film Artistes’ Association/Producers’ Alliance for Cinema and Television) rates normally apply in London and the south east of England. Pact/Equity rates generally apply elsewhere.There are also different rates – BBC Equity and ITV Equity – if you are booked for a “continuing drama series” on the relevant channel.Pay is normally made up of a basic day (or night) rate, plus holiday pay and overtime, with higher rates on bank holidays.Supplementary rates apply if you are required to do certain things such as attending a separate costume fitting, bringing several outfit options, having your hair cut, swimming, getting wet, driving or delivering any dialogue.View image in fullscreenSome of Christopher Nolan’s war film Dunkirk was shot on Swanage railway.Photograph: Stockinasia/AlamyTheo Fraser, 25, works in PR and appeared as an extra in Christopher Nolan’s 2017 war film Dunkirk. He says: “I was one of the civilians at the train station at the end of the film, so my job for the day was walking up and down the station platform, handing out bottles of beer to the soldiers coming home. I got paid about £250 for one day of filming, plus £50 as compensation for letting them cut my hair.”For ads it is usually higher and might also include a “buyout” fee that allows the production ongoing use of your image or recording.Watch out for ‘casting calls’This is when a production invites anyone who fits certain criteria to apply, not just those registered with agencies.They are often used when productions need large numbers of extras with a very specific look, such as military roles.These might be posted on social media or local community noticeboards.In the UK, big TV and film studios include Pinewood in Buckinghamshire, Shepperton in Surrey, and Elstree and Leavesden, both in Hertfordshire. But work is not limited to those locations.Indiana West, the head of marketing at Uni-versal Extras, says: “While being closer to major production hubs could conceivably improve how often opportunities may come your way, plenty of filming happens all over the UK and Ireland, from small towns to scenic countryside spots.”She adds: “Productions take great effort to make sets as accessible to everyone as humanly possible, so they’ll even often provide shuttle services from nearby town centres or train stations.”View image in fullscreenStormtroopers at the 2025 Futures festival at Pinewood studios.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianCreate your profileThe casting agency will need basic details (your name, age, address etc), and will ask for lots of other information, too. This will include your physical statistics (for example height, clothing size, hair colour, any tattoos or piercings), and skills such as driving, sports or dancing.You will need to provide a headshot, a full-length photo and sometimes images in business dress, uniforms or sports kit.Vicky Wilson, a casting team support manager at Casting Collective, says: “Keep your profile fresh and accurate. Clear, recent photos that reflect how you look now, up-to-date measurements, and any new skills or looks make a big difference when matching people to roles.“Uploading a few extra photos can also help you stand out for a broader range of roles.”Getting a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) certificate (£21.50 via thegovernment website), can increase your chances of working on productions featuring children.Be ready for the jobJob inquiries will come via email or text, often using code names to keep productions confidential.The message will outline the role (for example, a passerby), rough location, call time and estimated finish time. You need to confirm your availability and may be “pencilled in”, or “heavy pencilled in” if shortlisted. If you are not selected, you will be “released” later on; if you are booked, the “call sheet” with exact details will usually arrive the night before.View image in fullscreenFollow instructions carefully. The Italian film-maker Pier Paolo Pasolini instructs extras on his 1971 film The Decameron.Photograph: Everett Collection Historical/AlamyPrepare to waitBeing an extra is not glamorous – it often involves long hours, waiting around and following instructions carefully. You may spend time in costume or makeup, have to stand in the rain, or need to repeat the same scene all day.Do not get starstruck – extras should not approach the main cast or ask for selfies or autographs. Most productions ban taking photos or videos, and phones may be confiscated on set.Bring something to pass the time, such as a book, as you will often have long periods of downtime.Get paid for travel and foodBackground artists are paid for travel, too – how much depends on the distance and time of day. For example, productions using Equity rates pay from £4 to £20 for travel, depending on mileage, with an extra £9 for calls pre-6am (7am on Sundays or bank holidays).FAA/Pact pays £16.12 for calls in London travel zones 1-3, and £22.54 for calls at Elstree, Pinewood, Shepperton, Long Cross, Twickenham, Leavesden and any location beyond zone 3. You get an extra £19.73 for call times pre-6am (7am on Sundays or bank holidays).Food is usually provided on-set. Where it is not, the pay is about £5 to £25 a meal, depending on whether it is breakfast, lunch or dinner, location and union rates. You will get paid more if a meal break is delayed, cut short or missed.View image in fullscreenThere can be a lot of waiting around on a film or TV set, so bring a book.Photograph: Striking Images/Studio Shots/AlamyCheck employment statusYou are considered self-employed, so you need to pay your own tax and national insurance.Under HM Revenue and Customs “trading allowance” rules, you can earn up to £1,000 tax free each year from trading online, self-employment and various other side hustles. If you earn more than this, you will need to register as self-employed and submit a self-assessment tax return.You must be flexibleThe work is perfect for students, freelancers and retirees who have flexible schedules. It is less suitable for anyone who needs a strict routine, as filming days can be long and change at short notice.Simon Turner, 68, is a photographer from south London and has appeared in the background of about 25 productions, including Netflix’s The Crown and Slow Horses.He says: “You need to have a very flexible diary … the chances of being picked are low (less than one in 20 for me), but if you accept, you are expected to keep that day free. If you get the job, you’ll be told a few days in advance. If you don’t, they’ll wait until the last minute to tell you (just in case they do need you) – which can be frustrating.”Explore more on these topicsFilm industryMoney hacksTelevision industryAdvertisingConsumer affairsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

[victim’s name redacted] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned,” the message reads.In her reply, Maxwell says: “I have been thinking about that.”A second message, sent by Epstein to Trump biographer Michael Wolff in January 2019, indicates that Trump had asked him to resign from Mar-a-Lago, the president’s exclusive members-only club in Florida.But, Epstein says, he was “never a member ever” and adds “of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop”.Epstein’s longtime friend and co-conspiratorMaxwellis currently serving a 20-year sentence after her conviction for sex-trafficking crimes, including procuring girls to be abused.A third message, sent by Epstein to Wolff in December 2015, solicited the author’s advice about fashioning a response for Trump to questions CNN was reportedly preparing to ask him about their relationship.“If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?” Epstein asks.“I think you should let him hang himself,” Wolff responds.“If he says he hasn’t been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you …“Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he’ll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.”Trump has consistently denied having knowledge of Epstein’s activities, which included the operation of a sex-trafficking ring that procured teen girls for wealthy and influential associates. Epstein killed himself in 2019 while in federal custody.Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, in a lunchtime press briefing at the White House, called the release of the emails “a manufactured hoax by the Democratic party” to distract from the reopening of the government.She also expanded on an earlier statement in which she identified the unnamed victim in the redacted email as Virginia Giuffre, who named Epstein, Maxwell andAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince, among her abusers, but never publicly accused Trump.In herposthumous memoir, Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice, Giuffre said she was recruited by Maxwell from Mar-a-Lago, where she worked as a teenager. Shedied by suicidein April aged 41.“Ms Giuffre, and God rest her soul, maintained that there was nothing inappropriate she ever witnessed, that President Trump was always extremely professional and friendly to her,” Leavitt said.“It’s a question worth asking the Democratic party why they chose to redact that name of a victim who has already publicly made statements about her relationship withJeffrey Epsteinand is, unfortunately, no longer with us.”Leavitt insisted that “these emails proved absolutely nothing other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong”.Democrats, however, have accused the White House of covering up Trump’s alleged involvement and have consistently called on Pam Bondi, Trump’s attorney general,to release documentsabout the scandal, which have come to be known as the Epstein files.In a statement, the oversight committee’s ranking member, Robert Garcia, said: “The moreDonald Trumptries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover. These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the president.”Other Democrats joined calls for more transparency from the White House.Ro Khanna, a California Democratic representative, said that this was “exactly why” he was working with the Republican representative Thomas Massie to force a House floor vote on the full release of the Epstein files.“The public deserves transparency and the survivors deserve justice,” he said.Ina post to X, Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota senator, wrote: “Americans deserve the full truth. The administration needs to keep its promise and release the Epstein files.”A vote could come quickly as the House prepares to reconvene Wednesday after the lengthy government shutdown.The Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, who has wavered on the release of the full tranche of Epstein investigation records,has said he will swear inArizona’s newly elected representative Adelita Grijalva, set to be the 218th signature needed on a discharge petition that would force a vote.“Republicans are running a pedophile protection program. They are intentionally hiding the Jeffrey Epstein files,” Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said on Tuesday, accusing Johnson of delaying Grijalva’s swearing-in for seven weeks to defend Trump.Maxwell, meanwhile, is seeking a commutation of her sentence from Trump,according to Democratson the House judiciary committee.The supreme court last monthrejectedMaxwell’s appeal to overturn her criminal conviction.Additional reporting by Shrai PopatExplore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpLaw (US)US politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

One MP present said the prime minister had “lost the dressing room”.In a further attempt to contain the row, Labour’s chair, Anna Turley, told ITV on Wednesday evening that there would be an investigation into who had briefed against Streeting and that Starmer would take action against the culprit – something the PM had not committed to in his earlier meetings with MPs.One No 10 source said Starmer’s anger was still focused on Streeting, despite outwardly praising him. Another said he was frustrated by the health secretary arguing against the government’s approach to numerous issues including welfare, digital ID and Gaza.Starmer and Streeting spoke briefly on Wednesday, the first time the pair have been in contact since the briefing war broke out. Starmer is said to have apologised to the health secretary, though stopped short of making any other commitments, saying only they should speak again soon.“Keir is clear that Wes is a highly effective minister, with great communication skills and he has his full backing,” said one Downing Street source. “There has been no direct briefing against Wes from anyone.”One strategist said the intention behind the briefings had not been to lay down a marker against Streeting in particular but to warn Labour MPs about the potentially fatal consequences of any leadership battle and to drive home the point that Starmer would fight hard for his position.Streeting mounted a furious defence of his actions on morning shows on Wednesday, saying: “Whoever has been briefing this has been watching too much Celebrity Traitors. It’s the most unjustified attack against the faithfuls sinceJoe Marlerwas banished in the final.”However, Labour MPs were left scratching their heads at the timing of Downing Street’s remarkable intervention, which the Guardian revealed on Tuesday night, with the focus switching to whether McSweeney could survive in post.Many told the Guardian that attacks on Streeting – followed by the health secretary’s defiant appearance on breakfast TV – had strengthened any future leadership campaign.I think the scales are falling from people’s eyes [about Morgan]Cabinet sourceEven former allies of the prime minister’s chief of staff said they had changed their view of McSweeney, 48. “Morgan will have to go. But it won’t save Keir,” one minister said.The trade minister Chris Bryant told the BBC that aides should see politics as a “team sport”. He said: “It’s a bit daft if you have someone in the coach’s team hobbling one of the players before the match.”One cabinet minister said: “If it was an orchestrated campaign to shore up the PM, then it’s had the opposite effect; it’s spectacularly backfired. I don’t see how Morgan can survive when Keir has ended up in a weaker position than before.”A cabinet source said: “Consensus is forming in cabinet he’ll have to go. I am devastated about it.“I keep thinking there must be a bigger strategy that I’m not understanding. But I think it’s just that they just have to have an enemy. It’s become their achilles heel.”Another cabinet source added: “I think the scales are falling from people’s eyes [about Morgan]. I don’t know if it’s worse that it’s done with Keir’s authorisation or that he is so checked out he does not know about it.”One minister said they thought No 10’s paranoia was partly justified. “I will defend them to a degree because everyone can see that Wes is in fact running a leadership campaign and that it has been the talk of the PLP [parliamentary Labour party]. We know that. We can see it.“But I don’t think they intended to personalise this about Wes, and that has been their great mistake. They wanted to show Keir had some fight in him and it has backfired catastrophically.”Allies of Streeting were among those who said McSweeney should be sacked after a dramatic 24 hours during which the health secretary firmly denied he was planning to launch a coup against the prime minister after the budget.“Keir gave Wes his full backing at PMQs. It is categorically untrue that Wes has been preparing to challenge Keir,” one source close to the health secretary said.Government insiders said there was now pressure on the prime minister over McSweeney from “many different quarters”. One source said: “Because Keir is so dependent on him for political advice, the guns are trained on him.”Two No 10 sources said relations had also deteriorated between McSweeney and Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister, who is understood to be frustrated at how frequently the government’s attention is pulled on to scandals or briefing and counter-briefing.MPs now believe that the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, is McSweeney’s preferred successor to Starmer, and the two worked closely together when Mahmood was elections coordinator in Labour HQ.A source close to Mahmood said it was “nonsense” she was running any kind of leadership operation and said she was focused on major asylum changes to be announced shortly.Explore more on these topicsLabourMorgan McSweeneyKeir StarmerWes StreetingLabour party leadershipnewsShareReuse this content"

Taxpayers shouldn’t be footing the bill for luxury leisure.”The cycle to work scheme launched by Tony Blair’s Labour government in 1999, allows employees to buy a bike and accessories with an interest-free loan from their employer. The cost will be deducted from the employee’s gross salary monthly, before income tax and national insurance are applied.The cost of the scheme rose from £55m in 2019-20 to £130m in 2024-25.The original £1,000 cap was axed six years ago after complaints that it excluded large numbers of the bikes that customers wanted to buy, including e-bikes and cargo bikes capable of carrying children.The scheme can help save 42% of the cost of a bike for those considered higher rate taxpayers, and 30% for basic rate taxpayers.High quality bikes can cost at least £2,000 and those with seating £5,000. But many retailers have realised that some higher earners were taking advantage of the perk and bought bikes costing more than £10,000.Will Pearson, co-owner of London-based Pearson Cycles, designer and retailer of high-end bikes, told the Financial Times the new limit on the scheme would have to be at a “sensible level” but could also risk the progress of environmentally friendly travel.“The government should leave the scheme alone or, ideally, improve the incentives rather than restrict them,” he said. “Customers are far more likely to consistently use their bikes if they are of a certain quality, reliable and efficient. This often comes at a higher price tag.”The Guardian has asked the Treasury for comment.Explore more on these topicsCycle hire schemesBudget 2025CyclingGreen travelTransportShareReuse this content"

A source with knowledge of the negotiations said the deal is done and that the fight will take place on either 19 or 26 December.Paul had originally been scheduled to fight Gervonta Davis on 14 November at the Kaseya Center, but the event was cancelled after Davis was removed from the cardamid domestic violence allegations.Davis’s former partner, Courtney Rossel, filed a civil lawsuit in Miami-Dade County accusing the lightweight champion of battery, aggravated battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Miami Gardens police confirmed they are investigating the alleged incident, which Rossel says occurred at the strip club where she works. She was granted a restraining order shortly afterwards.Most Valuable Promotions, Paul’s company, and Netflixscrapped the showsoon after the lawsuit became public. “Our team has worked closely with all parties to navigate this situation responsibly,” Nakisa Bidarian, MVP’s chief executive, said at the time. “While we will not be moving forward with this event, our plan still remains for Jake Paul to headline an event on Netflix in 2025.”Paul responded bypublicly lambasting Davis on X, calling him “an actual walking human piece of garbage” and apologizing to undercard fighters and staff affected by the cancellation.After Davis’s withdrawal, Paul’s team explored other opponents, including Ryan Garcia and undisputed super middleweight champion Terence Crawford. Talks then accelerated with Joshua, the former two-time unified heavyweight champion, who has not fought sincebeing stopped by Daniel Duboisin September 2024.Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, had said the 36-year-old hoped to return before the end of the year, with early 2026 also possible. A December fight with Paul would mark Joshua’s first appearance in more than 15 months and gives Netflix, whose boxing telecasts have includedPaul’s fight with Mike TysonandCrawford’s showdown with Canelo Álvarez, a marquee replacement for the scrapped Davis bout.A source familiar with the deal saidNetflixexpects to lock in the exact date before Monday’s announcement. The fight is expected to take place in Miami and stream globally on the platform.Netflix’s first boxing show – Paul’s bout with Tyson – became the most-streamed sporting event in history, peaking at 65m live concurrent streams and drawing an estimated 108m average live viewers worldwide, the company saidin a press release. The broadcast accounted for 56% of all US television viewing during the fight’s main event hour and was the platform’s No 1 title that week across 78 countries.Explore more on these topicsAnthony JoshuaBoxingTerence CrawfordMike TysonCanelo ÁlvarezNetflixUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

At every critical juncture, the prime minister has stuck resolutely by his closest adviser at the expense of other senior aides and ministers.View image in fullscreenMorgan McSweeney, Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, has been blamed by some ministers and MPs for bad decisions.Photograph: Tayfun Salci/Zuma Press, Inc/AlamyBut developments in the last few months have driven a rift between Starmer and McSweeney, to the extent that many are now questioning how long the No 10 chief of staff can last. Fairly or not, he has become something of a bogeyman for a number of ministers and MPs who blame him for bad decisions and question his judgment and ability to run the government.The decision to launch a full-frontal attack on Streeting hours before he was due to embark on a morning broadcast round is the latest case in point. The health secretarygave an assured performancein which he said those briefing against him had spent too much time watching Celebrity Traitors – and should switch over to Countryfile. Labour MPs and aides are united in thinking Streeting has emerged in a stronger position than before.As one government aide put it: “From a ‘strategic big brain’ point of view – how did you think this was going to go? ThatWes Streeting, of all people, would crumble on the morning round and make meek pledges of loyalty and be seen as a duplicitous snake by the PLP [parliamentary Labour party]? They’ve just given him the best positioning he could hope for [by saying:] ‘Let’s take the battle with Wes where he is weakest, on breakfast television.’”A former government aide added: “It’s like an elephant picking a fight with a shark and choosing to do it in the middle of the ocean.”There are competing theories about when Starmer’s strategists decided to go over the edge and denounce plots against him, with some pointing to the early November leaving drinks of a senior aide, Matt Faulding, as a “fever pitch” moment for leadership speculation.Allies of the prime minister have been on high alert for a number of weeks, voicing concerns that any challenge would worsen an alreadyperilous economic situationand that any successor to Starmer would inevitably tack to the left and damage relations withDonald Trumpand the EU. Labour MPs have scoffed at many of these arguments.What is clear is that mounting fears of an imminent challenge were shared with the prime minister over the weekend, and that there was a coordinated decision to smoke out any challenge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From the outside, however, it looked like a paranoid overreaction.Some have even speculated that the move was designed by McSweeney to benefit Streeting – but this theory is given short shrift by insiders. One well-placed senior official who has worked alongside McSweeney said: “I never ever heard Morgan have a good word to say about Wes. He thought he was all mouth (promises about the NHS) and no trousers (zero delivery ability).”Other key figures who have worked with both McSweeney and Streeting say they are not cut from the same cloth. “I always felt Morgan politically wasn’t with Wes, although he was withPeter Mandelson– and Mandelson wanted Wes,” said a senior Labour aide. “Wes has always been more classically Blairite than Morgan has,” a frontbencher said.The same frontbencher speculated that when push comes to shove, “Morgan will be more loyal to Keir than Keir will be to Morgan”. In recent months Starmer has made someinterventions to defend his chief of staff, including at cabinet – but there are signs the relationship between them is no longer what it was.A No 10 source said relations had faltered since Starmer’s“island of strangers” speech, which he has sincepublicly resiled from. The prime minister is said to have been shaken by criticism from close friends outside politics about the language he used, which MPs saidechoed Enoch Powell.This was the point, it is said, when Starmer became convinced he had been badly advised – and McSweeney’s team were the ones who had pushed for tougher language on immigration.Starmer has since expressed frustration internally at what he sees as an inability by his aides to protect him from scandals, such asover Jeffrey Epstein’s close relationship with Mandelson– whose appointment as US ambassador was championed by McSweeney.“Many people have tried to drive a wedge between Keir and Morgan and it has always failed,” one No 10 source said. “But this feels different.”Explore more on these topicsLabourWes StreetingMorgan McSweeneyKeir StarmerLabour party leadershipanalysisShareReuse this content"

China is now exporting green technology to the rest of the world that has a cumulative export value that is significantly higher than all of the fossil fuel exports from the United States to the rest of the world. And that trend is obviously accelerating quite dramatically.”Gates, a philanthropist and founder of Microsoft,made waves around the worldwhen he publicly argued for pushing the climate crisis down the international agenda, in favour of more focus on health issues.“The idea of slowing down on climate again, every climate scientist that I know and respect just threw up their hands and said: ‘What in the world is he thinking?’” said Gore.Yeah, Trump loves it. That may be what Gates was shooting forAl Gore“When Trump was elected the second time, Bill fired most of his climate staffers and went to the White House and lavished praise on Trump, and then put out this series of statements last week that puzzled anybody who was really concerned about the climate crisis.”Gore noted that the chiefs of many large businesses in the US fear reprisals from the US president if they disagree with him, saying: “It may be that he is really worried that Trump will bully him the way he has bullied other ultra-wealthy business people. It looks like it may be possible that he’s scared of Trump.”The US president responded to Gates’s reversal with praiseful social media posts.Gore said: “I don’t know why [Gates] would do this … the only rave review of what he put out last week was from Donald Trump. Yeah, Trump loves it. That may be what Gates was shooting for.”Gates and Gore were formerly seen as philanthropic allies in the fight against major problems facing humanity, including the climate crisis, appearing at the same events to warn of the consequences for humanity and the need to act.It’s literally insane that governments are forcing taxpayers to subsidise the destruction of part of humanity’s futureAl GoreSetting up the climate crisis and the global health crisis as opposing choices for intervention, as Gates appeared to do, was wrong, added Gore, saying: “The idea that there is a binary choice between health and climate is an idea that’s been roundly rejected by virtually every scientist in this field, and the World Health Organisation has said long since that climate is the No 1 health threat to humanity.”He added: “I almost felt badly for Bill when the same day he put his statement out, the Lancet, the very authoritative, deeply respected Lancet … put outits latest reportshowing the enormous health consequences of not accelerating climate action. The idea that you have to choose one over the other is quite silly.”Instead of taking money away from climate action, Gates should have advocated that governments re-purpose the hundreds of billions of dollars they spend giving subsidies to fossil fuels, and focus them on health instead, Gore argued. “It’s literally insane that governments around the world are forcing their taxpayers to subsidise the destruction of part of humanity’s future,” he said. “Accelerating solutions to the climate crisis is one of the single most effective ways to improve healthcare in the world.”Gore also robustly defended the UN process of annual “conference of the party” meetings on climate. “The Cop process accomplishes far more than it is given credit for accomplishing, partly because it serves as a nucleus for all of the industry and NGO and trade groups and civil society groups that assemble at Cop every year, and many of them come up with their own agreements that move things forward,” he said.The Cop process itself is one of the principal reasons that the sustainability revolution has shifted into high gearAl GoreIndustries and governments were pushing ahead with new technology and implementing renewable energy and other low-carbon initiatives, he said: “The achievements of each successive Cop are often cumulative, and the Cop process itself is one of the principal reasons that the sustainability revolution has shifted into high gear, and more and more nations are now realising that this is the future.”Gore added: “There is a lot of very positive progress under way. It’s just stunning to watch the progress in these solutions [to cutting greenhouse gas emissions and shifting to a low-carbon economy]. There’s a completely false view out there that somehow we are losing ground.”Gore also celebrated what he sees as a “generational change” in the US, by which many people are turning towards climate action even while the federal government is dismantling it. He warned that Trump might face a “less obsequious” Congress, in the light of the series of election defeats for Republican candidates in US elections last week.“The American people spoke pretty loudly and clearly last week, in unexpectedly large landslide defeats for Trump in every election that was on the ballot, and Republican senators have now begun to break with him on some of his priorities,” said Gore.Gore had some praise forZohran Mamdani, the progressive politician who was elected mayor of New York, saying: “Some of his proposals were ones that I did not agree with, but I thought that he ran a stunningly effective campaign. His basic skills as a politician were impressively on display.”There’s a completely false view out there that somehow we are losing groundAl GoreSeparately on Wednesday, Gore gaveCop30delegates a sort of slide show of horrors caused by the climate crisis. Standing in front of a huge projection screen showing images of recent disasters around the world that had been worsened by global heating, Gore said that it is “literally insane that we are allowing this to continue”.Gore raised his voice in frustration as he showed images charting record drought in the Amazon, Greenland shedding its ice, huge downpours and storms that have wiped out communities in Vietnam, Jamaica,Brazil, the Philippines and the US in recent times. “How long are we going to stand by and keep turning the thermostat up so that these sort of events get even worse?” he said.“We need to adapt as well as mitigate, but we also need to be realistic that if we allow this insanity to continue, to use the sky as an open sewer, that some things will be very difficult to adapt to.”His main focus at the summit has been to promote hisClimate Trace project, which is mapping planet-heating emissions and air pollutants causing health problems around the world. Gore said: “We are very excited about these new tools. We have got the technology and the deployment models. Some people think we don’t have the political will but as I like to remind people, political will is a renewable resource.”Explore more on these topicsAl GoreCop30Climate crisisBrazilBill GatesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the worst Christmas film since last year’sRed One, in which Dwayne Johnson played the head of security for Santa Claus and more or less had us all rooting for anyone who could beat up Father Christmas.In this one, Big Bang Theory star Kunal Nayyar lifelessly and joylessly plays a Scrooge variant called Mr Sood, part of the Ugandan south Asian community expelled by Idi Amin in his childhood, and embittered by early poverty. An early romance soured because of his obsession with money, and he has become a grasping and unpleasant old guy in London (cue stock footage of the London skyline) in the rather quaintly imagined business of moneylending, with his now dead partner Jacob Marley, played byHugh Bonneville. But after petulant displays of boorish meanness with his nephew, employees and the cheerful Cockney Christmas-jumper-wearing cabbie played by Danny Dyer (surely Mr Sood knows that Ubers are cheaper?), he is visited by Marley’s ghost and then the spirits of Christmas past, present and future (played by Eva Longoria, Billy Porter and Boy George).The very worst moment comes when we get to see Bob Cratchit in his humble abode with his family, including the heartbreakingly but discreetly disabled Tiny Tim. Where is this wretched hovel? We must surely brace ourselves for some brutal poverty. Well, Bob’s bijou house seems to be in the attractively multicoloured streets of Notting Hill. Wow. If Cratchit needs to raise some cash he could sell that and have enough for a chateau in the south of France. Of course, he could be renting.It’s only November and this film has given me an overload of Yuletide nausea. If you’re looking for a twist on A Christmas Carol, Kermit, Miss Piggy and Michael Caine’s versionis readily available.ChristmasKarma is in UK and Irish cinemas from 14 November and in Australia from 27 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsFilm adaptationsCharles DickensChristmasGurinder ChadhaHugh BonnevillereviewsShareReuse this content"

US airstrikes on boats in South American waters have killedat least 76 peoplesince September.Meanwhile, Venezuela’s dictator,Nicolás Maduro, has announced what he called a “massive deployment” of land, sea, air, river and missile forces, as well as civilian militia, to counter the US naval presence off his country’s coast.Will the US attack Venezuela?Donald Trump has sought to justify the military buildup and the airstrikes by arguing they are necessary to stem theflow of drugsto the US, mainly from Venezuela. But many analysts see these moves instead as a way to putpressure on Maduroto step down after hestole last year’s election.With the US navy’sannouncementon Tuesday of the arrival of the world’s largest aircraft carrier to the area of responsibility of the US Southern Command, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean, some believe the risk of an invasion is growing.The massive warship, carrying 4,000 sailors and capable of transporting 90 aircraft, is reportedly in the western Atlantic and expected to reach the Caribbean in the coming days.Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House, said: “This is clearly an attempt to scare Maduro, perhaps into seeking exile, and to push the [Venezuelan] military to overthrow him or force him out, establishing some form of transitional or non-Maduro-dominated government.“I don’t think the White House really wants to act. They’re hoping to engage in what I call regime change on the cheap – although it’s not that cheap any more because it costs $8m a day to keep that aircraft carrier there.”However, if the threat alone proved insufficient, Sabatini said, the US was “almost putting itself in a position where it will have to do something to justify this [military buildup]”.0:56Trump confirms attack on alleged 'drug-carrying submarine' in the Caribbean – videoWhat is Maduro doing in response?On Tuesday, before the US navy confirmed the carrier’s arrival, the Venezuelan regime announced a new phase of its military deployment against what it called US “imperial threats”. The defence minister, Vladimir Padrino, said 200,000 troops were taking part in the exercise.Maduro has accused the US of “fabricating a new war” and said the naval deployment represents “the greatest threat our continent has faced in the past 100 years”.Venezuela hasreportedly receivedRussian military equipment to strengthen its defences, including missile and air defence systems, while Moscow has reaffirmed its support for Venezuelan sovereignty.José Luis Pérez Guadalupe, a criminology professor at Peru’s Universidad del Pacífico and co-author of arecent bookon organised crime in Venezuela, said: “The mere fact that the US is acting and threatening Venezuela has stirred nationalist feeling among Venezuelans in the face of a foreign invader – and Maduro plays that very well.”He believes that any US intervention could backfire on Trump’s interests. “Let’s suppose they remove Maduro – who will be president then?” he asked.If it were the opposition candidate Edmundo González, widely regarded as the real winner of the last election, or María Corina Machado, the opposition leader andNobel peace prize laureate, “they would be seen as traitors to Venezuela for supporting a foreign invasion”, Pérez Guadalupe said.“That would make it far more difficult to form a government with even a majority level of support, let alone a broad consensus.”Are the buildup and airstrikes ending drug trafficking?So far there is no data to support that claim. It is not even known how much or what kind of drugs were being carried on each boat targeted, or whether they were carrying drugs at all, as the US has released no evidence or details about the vessels or their occupants. The UN has described the killings asextrajudicial executions.Most of the attacks have taken place in the Caribbean. A2020 reportby the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimated that 74% of the cocaine reaching the US arrived via the Pacific. Only 8% of “documented cocaine movements departing South America moved toward the Caribbean islands in 2019, mostly aboard go-fast vessels”, it said.Trumpclaimedthe targeted boats were “stacked up with bags of white powder, that’s mostly fentanyl”, but fentanyl is neither produced nor significantly consumed in South America, according to Andrés Antillano, a criminology professor at the Central University of Venezuela. He said fentanyl was mainly produced in Mexico using chemical precursors imported from Asian countries, including China.Antillano said the airstrikes were an ineffective way to stop drug smuggling as attacks on one route merely forced traffickers to seek alternatives. “It’s nothing more than a bad alibi – a narrative meant to justify other agendas,” he said.What role does Venezuela play in cocaine trafficking?Venezuela is considered a transit country for cocaine that comes mainly from neighbouring Colombia, the world’s largest producer and one of only three cultivators alongside Peru and Bolivia.According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,cocaine seizuresin Venezuela accounted for 2.3% of the global total in 2020, and by 2023 – the most recent year’s data available – that share had fallen to 1.9%.Cocaine leaves Venezuela by land, mainly through the Amazon region, as well as by air and sea. But Pérez Guadalupe said there was “no evidence that shipments go directly to the US”.He said: “It’s not that the drugs passing through Venezuela don’t end up in the US, but they first go to intermediate points in the Caribbean.” From countries such as Trinidad and Tobago, the cocaine was then sent on to Mexico, the US, Africa and “mainly” to Europe, Pérez Guadalupe said.What role does the Venezuelan regime play?In August the US government increased to $50m itsrewardfor information leading to the arrest or conviction of Maduro, described as the “global terrorist leader of the Cartel de los Soles”.The group’s name first appeared in the Venezuelan press in the early 1990s, with “soles” referring to the sun insignias worn by military officers who were allegedly central to the scheme. According to the Department of Justice, one of the group’s objectives is“to flood”the US with cocaine.However, Antillano, Pérez Guadalupe andmany other expertson Venezuelan organised crime say no such cartel exists.Pérez Guadalupe said: “The so-called Cartel de los Soles is not a group like the Medellín or Cali cartels, running everything from production to transport … It’s more a way of describing how Maduro has stayed in power by granting concessions to certain criminal groups.”In exchange for their support, Maduro has allegedly allowed criminal organisations to control some regions and prisons, and “the army runs through all these power structures, because it operates across the country and facilitates the transit and export of drugs”, Pérez Guadalupe said.Antillano said government figures involved in trafficking did not operate as a single unit – in fact, they competed with each other. “In Venezuela, bribing a military officer doesn’t guarantee that another officer further along the chain, or even an ordinary police officer, won’t also demand a cut,” he said.“The idea of a fully coordinated, vertical, consistent policy to flood the US with cocaine, as Trump has been claiming, is completely unsustainable and there’s no serious evidence to support it … but it taps into a certain anxiety among the US population and can be politically exploited as a way of justifying mass deportations and the criminalisation of migration,” Antillano added.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaUS foreign policyTrump administrationNicolás MaduroDrugs tradeAmericasexplainersShareReuse this content"

Are you interested in becoming a nanny?No, but with that money I could probably subcontract all the actual childcare.Chances are you’ll be part of a “childcare team” anyway, providing round-the-clock coverage.Any other perks?Free meals, transport and accommodation, luxury holidays, a pension, that sort of thing.And these nanny jobs are actually available?Recruiters can’t fill them fast enough. According to Business Insider, gen Z graduates, weary of thankless, AI-threatened entry-level jobs, are increasingly turning to the world of “private service” – ie working for the super-rich – which is better paid and more satisfying.But how manybillionaires can there be?The most recent figures say there are more than 3,000. And they each require a lot of staff – executive assistants, chefs, chauffeurs, security – across multiple residences, so it’s not just nannies who are in demand.Any downsides to private service?Well, privacy is paramount – you’ll almost certainly have to sign an NDA.I don’t mind.And the hours can be erratic – billionaires change their minds a lot.I guess that’s a natural consequence of having many, many options.And: rich people are crazy.What do you mean?For example, a recent job listing advertised for a private tutor qualified to address the “needs of children from ultra-high-net-worth and royal families”.What kind of tutor?“A consummate professional with several years of elite experience.”I meant what subjects. Maths? Science?The successful applicant will be guiding the child “on his first steps toward becoming an English gentleman”.I see. And what would that entail?Plenty: preparing for acceptance to a top school, imparting an appreciation of classical music and art, along with instruction in sports including cricket, tennis and rugby.What’s so weird about that?The child in question is one.Why would anyone apply for such a patently daft position?The starting salary is £180kI’m in.Sorry, applications have closed.Do say:“And that is why I’m the ideal candidate to form a key part of your elite personnel infrastructure.”Don’t say:“Go and watch Peppa Pig while I sort out my investment portfolio.”Explore more on these topicsWork & careersPass notesChildrenChildcarefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s certainly no stranger to salty terms for his looks. ‘Incredible masculine grandeur’, anyone?Lucy ManganWed 12 Nov 2025 17.00 ESTShareThe problem with any biography ofRichard Burtonis that he is quite easily explicable. He was pursued only by the most obvious demons, conflicted only in the most comprehensible of ways and – if he was complicated at all, it was only in the simplest, most ordinary manner. The only inexplicable part is his talent, as talent always is – and even that, you feel (and are frequently assured by people who saw him on stage), is only partly captured by the screen legacy that is left.The hour-long documentary Richard Burton: Wild Genius, part of a series of programmes marking the centenary of the actor’s birth, manages to add lustre to the well known story with a better-than-usual array of contributors. They include Burton’s daughter Kate and other family members; actors including Michael Sheen, Siân Phillips and Iwan Rheon (with Matthew Rhys doing the job of reading from Burton’s diaries), who can testify not only to the talent but to his particular place in Welsh culture; and people who knew and acted with him, in his heyday and beyond.You can, nevertheless, sometimes see the strain of putting a new spin on an old tale. There is the rags to riches element. Burton was born into a poor mining family in the poor mining community of Pontrhydyfen in 1925. His father was an alcoholic and his mother died giving birth to her 13th child when Richard (Jenkins as he was then) was two.He went to live with his sister Cecilia (“Cis”, to whom he remained grateful and devoted all his life) and her husband, Elfed, in Taibach, Port Talbot until he was 17. By then, his English teacher, Philip Burton (he later took his stage name in tribute to the man), had noticed his gift for acting – and presumably the beautiful baritone must have been well on its way by then too – and had him declaiming poetry and Shakespeare across the valleys and applying for a scholarship to Oxford. When he took up his place there, it was only the second time he’d been to England.His rise to fame began when legendary theatre producer Binkie Beaumont saw him in a college production of Measure for Measure. He was hailed as the next Olivier as he rose through the stage ranks, and then – while the actor Sybil Williams, whom he had married in 1949, stayed behind in Wales – became a Hollywood star overnight in 1952, when George Cukor cast him as the lead in My Cousin Rachel, opposite Olivia de Havilland.Then we are into the years leading up to Elizabeth Taylor. Euphemisms for Burton’s extreme hotness (“Incredible masculine grandeur”; “Epitome of masculinity, virility, danger”) begin to fly, outdone in frequency only by those for drinking, and reiterations of the difficulty he had reconciling his upbringing – and much-vaunted masculinity – with the “effeminacy” of his chosen career. Bedding women and sinking pints (she doesn’t put it quite like that), says his biographer Nancy Schoenberger, was his way of “establishing masculine bona fides”. Ah, masculinity – what trouble you get everyone into.View image in fullscreenDear diary … Matthew Rhys in Richard Burton: Wild Genius.Photograph: BBC/Yeti MediaOn we trot, though his decision to move to Switzerland as a tax exile, the birth of his first daughter, Kate, eight years into his marriage to Sybil and then, in 1961, meeting Taylor on the set of Cleopatra and causing everyone to have to root around for another bunch of euphemisms – this time for “giving up everything to bang the living daylights out of each other”. The Vatican, of course, won this fight, accusing the publicly adulterous couple (Taylor was married to Eddie Fisher at the time) of “erotic vagrancy”, which you cannot top.Divorce from Sybil (who had recently given birth to their disabled daughter, Jessica) followed. “It was a cataclysmic time for my mom,” says Kate Burton. “True, passionate, intense love matters more than anything,” says Gabriel Byrne, who worked with Burton on a TV series a few years before the Welshman’s death. “His life became something else.” There’s much to interrogate here but this documentary, while not quite hagiographic, is most certainly bent on maintaining a celebratory tone and there is no room for criticism, let alone anything that might border on condemnation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They eventually split up (though only after making Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? together, the magnificence of which remains apparent even in the short clips shown here), largely because of the alcoholism they had jointly descended into. The documentary ends, after Burton’s death from a cerebral haemorrhage, with a brief analysis – too little, too late to rescue the programme entirely from mid-tier hackery – of whether Burton really did waste his talent, thanks to the lure of Hollywood, or if that was simply the version of his story promulgated by the jealous old farts (I paraphrase slightly) of the British theatrical establishment. Which is only a tiny part of his story, of his suffering and certainly of the suffering he inflicted on others. A hundred years on from his birth, the idea of the wild genius-victim feels out of time.

        "Content": "The traditional treat is all over Instagram and TikTok. But does it always taste as impressive as it looks? And why is it so hard to get it to set rather than slump? Time for a deep dive …ByTim DowlingWed 12 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 11.15 ESTShareJelly has a dowdy reputation, but it may well be the perfect food for the Instagram age: when it works, it’s incredibly photogenic, so who cares what it tastes like?There can be no other explanation for recent claims that savoury jellies – the most lurid and off-putting of dishes, reminiscent of the worst culinary efforts of the 1950s – are suddenly fashionable. This resurgence comes,according to the New York Times, “at a time when chefs are feeling pressure to produce viral visuals and molecular gastronomy is old hat”.The notion that jelly is having a moment is actually a perennial threat: this time last year it was reported that supermarket jelly cube sales were rising sharply, while vintagejelly moulds were experiencing a five-fold increase in online sales. And it was 15 years ago that the high-end “jellymongers”Bompas & Parr– known for their elaborate architectural creations – first published their book on the subject.People who are sceptical about jelly are often put off by its origins. There’s no getting round it: gelatine is a pork byproduct, extracted from the bones, skin and connective tissue of the animal. But these days there are widely available vegan-friendly setting agents – mostly carrageenan and agar, derived from algae – that work just as well.You can look at colourful, detailed, wobbling jelly creations all day long on Instagram or TikTok, but if you want to experience the jelly renaissance first-hand – savoury or otherwise – you’ve got to make your own. How hard could it possibly be? I decided to find out.First off, a warning: there is really no such thing as a jelly recipe. You will find instructions everywhere, of course, but they will be of little help in your specific circumstances – the variables are simply too great. Moulds come in all sorts of weird sizes. Suggested setting times, in my brief experience, mean nothing: it’s set when it’s set.Better to rely on some solid practicalities: fill your jelly mould to the brim with water, and then pour the water into a measuring jug – that’s the total amount of liquid you’re after. To calculate how much gelatine you’ll need, bear in mind that one leaf sets 100ml of liquid.Confusingly, gelatine leaves come in four grades – bronze, silver, gold and platinum – all with different setting strengths, but you don’t have to worry about that because a) the size of the leaves is adjusted, so they all have the same per-leaf strength and b) you’ll probably only be able to find platinum in the supermarket anyway. But be prepared to adjust the exact proportions according to your needs – every jelly is a compromise between structural integrity and an agreeable wobble. If you just want it to stand up for a photo you can double the amount of gelatine, but the result will have the consistency of an eraser.Soften the leaves first in cold water – five minutes should do it – and then add them to your liquid, making sure that liquid is hotter than 35C but nowhere near boiling. Once the gelatine is fully dissolved, you can pour the liquid into your mould and leave it in the fridge to set. That’s the basic technique – everything else is guesswork, practice and panic.Grapefruit jellyView image in fullscreen‘An ill-defined blob’ … Tim’s grapefruit jelly.Photograph: Tim DowlingI chose something simple to start with:Nigel Slater’s grapefruit jelly. I simplified his instructions further by replacing the words “halve and squeeze the grapefruits” with “buy some grapefruit juice”. The recipe calls for “six small sheets” of gelatine, which is confounding. They don’t come in sizes! So I fell back on 1 leaf/100ml – plus an extra half-leaf, because the Slater version isn’t for moulding. He just pours his into dessert glasses.All went well until I tried to release the jelly from the vintage glass mould I bought from eBay. I dipped the mould into warm water for a few seconds – as most recipes direct – but it wasn’t enough. In my impatience, I boiled a kettle, filled a bowl, and lowered the mould into it. Only then did I realise it was too hot to retrieve, and by the time I came up with a strategy – ladling away enough water until I could grab the mould with my fingers – the outermost centimetre of the jelly had melted, leaving me with an ill-defined blob. The jelly itself was lovely though: not too sweet, with a bitter grapefruit note.I learned a valuable lesson with this one. Onward.Summer fruit in raspberry jellyView image in fullscreen‘It emerged in perfect condition.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianYou canmake your raspberry jelly from raspberries and sugar, or you can, as I did,just use diluted cordial.The ring mould I chose for this was enormous. After measuring the total liquid capacity I calculated I would need 19 gelatine sheets – I had to run out and buy more.The idea is that you fill the mould about three-quarters of the way to the top and let it partially set before pushing the fruits – blueberries, quartered strawberries, raspberries, whatever you’ve got – deep into the jelly. Even after several hours in the fridge, the jelly was insufficiently solid – the fruit kept floating back to the top. Perhaps 19 leaves was a miscalculation. Maybe I should have used 20.Finally, about six hours in, the first strawberry stayed put. The fruit left an unsightly trail where I jammed it in with my finger, but I persisted until the whole mould was full of suspended fruit. Then I topped it up with more jelly, and left it to set properly. This took days.In the end I turned my fridge temperature down until ice formed on the back wall. When the time came to turn out the jelly I was not hopeful, but it emerged in perfect condition – the fine detail of the mould was retained and the trails the fruit left had disappeared.Then, slowly, the whole thing collapsed before my eyes, like a citadel in an earthquake. I put the wreckage in a bowl and ate it with a spoon – delicious.Chicken jellyView image in fullscreen‘Bland and offensive’ … chicken jelly.Photograph: Tim DowlingThe first recorded jellies were savoury. In the 14th century, it took a lot of time, effort and skill to boil animals down to a transparent jelly, but the result would still have tasted too meaty to make a proper dessert. It took the development of industrial extraction processes to produce a clear gelatine with no taste at all.More often than not, a savoury jelly consists of some meat or veg suspended in a gelled consommé or stock. My jellied chicken salad is a blend of several similar recipes I found online, because I was only ever going to do this once.You can clarify stock by whisking in egg whites and then straining them, but my broth was pretty transparent after a pass through a sieve lined with muslin, so I didn’t bother.The “salad” in this case was an arrangement of diced chicken breast, celery, parsley and halved tomatoes – nothing fancy. It set quickly, de-moulded easily and looked weirdly impressive – like leftovers encased in a glass paperweight – but a full 12 hours elapsed before I could summon the will to cut into it with a spoon.We often use the word “bland” as a synonym for inoffensive, but it turns out some things can be both bland and offensive. Cold chicken stock-flavoured jelly is one of those things. I might have got used to it after several more spoonfuls, but I couldn’t bring myself to try.Blancmange rabbitView image in fullscreen‘I’m pretty certain a small child would have eaten it without complaint’ … the blancmange rabbit.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDon’t worry, there’s no rabbit in this one – it just employs a plastic rabbit-shaped mould I bought online. I figured: rabbits are white; why not blancmange?I’ve never eaten blancmange, or even really known what it was, but I think that what I imagined it to be was probably nicer than jelly made with milk. You’re never too old to be disillusioned.Therecipe I consulteduses cornflour to aid in thickening, along with sugar and lemon peel, but I also borrowed a tip from Bompas & Parr’s book: it takes a long time to dissolve gelatine in milk; it’s easier to dissolve it in a bit of hot water first, and add the liquid to the milk.I will not share with you all the frustration of trying to release a well-set blancmange from a rabbit-shaped mould – the ears, in particular, really didn’t want to let go – while a photographer looks on. We got there in the end, with a big bowl of hot water and a lot of patience. The best I can say about my rabbit is that I’m pretty certain a small child would have eaten it without complaint. I didn’t have one to hand, and none of the adults in my house would go anywhere near it.Striped jellyStriped jellyVariegated jellies are a step up in terms of complication, but all you need is two or more jellies of different colours. I chose cranberry and blancmange, more for the visual contrast than the flavour combination, which I’ll admit in retrospect was jarring and not that pleasant.Once you’ve prepared your jellies, the strategy is obvious: add layers of alternating colours to the mould, letting them set in between, firmly enough to stay separated, but not so much that the new layer won’t adhere to the one below.I can’t stress this enough: ignore whatever any recipe tells you in terms of timing, judge the setting by eye, and be prepared to stay up all night. Your room temperature jelly mixture may coagulate while you’re waiting to add more, but a little gentle heat will liquify it again.I would describe my striped tower as a qualified success – intact but a little lopsided. The main problem was that, instead of a jelly mould, I used an enamelled vase from Ikea. The cylindrical base created an airlock during de-moulding, which in turn created a lot of pent-up anger in me, and I got a bit violent with it. I’m not proud of myself.The G&T jellyView image in fullscreen‘This turned out beautifully.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianI took this recipe fromthe Adventures in Jelly website. It sounded sophisticated, looked easy enough and would allegedly give off an eerie glow under UV light. The ingredients, apart from the gelatine and sugar, are the same as the drink: gin, tonic, lemon.For this one, I decided to use the only jelly mould I already owned, which is old, ceramic and full of hairline cracks I thought might cause difficulty. I’m not even sure where it came from; I’ve certainly never made jelly in it.Much to my surprise, this turned out beautifully, with just the right amount of wobble. And it really did taste like a solidified gin and tonic. I took it along to a dinner party (my advice for transporting jellies over distances is: do not) and everyone took pictures of it. Then they ate the entire thing.Honestly, I was still getting texts about it the next day.Explore more on these topicsFoodDessertfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She also recently signed on to star next to Sigourney Weaver in thriller Useful Idiots.The pair will be joined by returning cast members Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci withKenneth Branaghjoining the cast as Priestly’s new husband. The film will also feature Simone Ashley, Rachel Bloom and Lucy Liu and reported cameos from Lady Gaga and Sydney Sweeney.The sequel, again directed by David Frankel, will see Priestly dealing with the collapse of the magazine industry, now forced to build bridges with her one-time assistant Emily (Blunt) who is the head of a luxury brand and its advertising spend.The original 2006 comedy, based on the novel by Lauren Weisberger, made over $326m at the global box office. It later spawned a West End musical.“When we made the first movie, none of us expected the meteoric life that it would have and the impact it would have on people,”Blunt said back in September. She added that it also “has deep emotional roots” for her and Tucci who later became her brother-in-law.Priestly has been widely perceived to be inspired by Anna Wintour, the former editor-in-chief of Vogue. Wintourrecently spokeabout the original film and Streep’s performance, saying it “had a lot of humour to it. It had a lot of wit. It had Meryl Streep. I mean, it wasEmily Blunt, [and] they were all amazing. In the end, I thought it was a fair shot”.The shoot has attracted the attention of photographers and fans across the globe with locations ranging from Brooklyn to Milan.The film also marks a major year for Hathaway who will also appear opposite Michaela Coel in David Lowery’s pop star drama Mother Mary, a film with original music from Charli xcx. The year will also see her star in Colleen Hoover adaptation Verity with Dakota Johnson, sci-fi thriller Flowervale Street with Ewan McGregor and Christopher Nolan’s The Odyssey alongside Tom Holland and Zendaya.The Devil Wears Prada 2 will be released in a summer filled with sequels including Scary Movie 6, Toy Story 5, Minions 3 and Spider-Man: Brand New Day.This article was amended on 12 November 2025. In an earlier version, Anna Wintour had been incorrectly referred to as the outgoing rather than former editor-in-chief of Vogue.Explore more on these topicsMeryl StreepAnne HathawayEmily BluntComedy filmsStanley TucciKenneth BranaghComedynewsShareReuse this content"

But just occasionally, you reach a singularity on the space-time continuum where the laws of physics break down and nothing makes sense. A state of Platonic batshitness. Unadulterated madness. Where things seem crazy merely because they are.Put simply: for no good reason,Keir Starmerand his team in Downing Street have chosen this week to mount a leadership challenge to himself. As if everyone inside No 10 has simultaneously had a collective breakdown. It’s an act of self-harm on an almost unimaginable scale. One that would leave lemmings gawping in amazement. Wondering why their destructive tendencies were so unambitious.Late on Tuesday night, Downing Street came out fighting Downing Street in a story published by the Guardian. Cabinet members were plotting to get rid of Keir. Not just Wes Streeting, though he was the worst offender. ButShabana Mahmoodand Ed Miliband, too. There were probably more. Bastards, the lot of them.A coup was imminent. Not in May after the local elections but in a few weeks’ time after the budget. But Keir was ready for them. Oh yes! No one messes with the Little Man. Come and get him if you think you’re hard enough. Keir would fight back and Keir would win. The plotters were nobodies who would spook the bond markets. Only Keir could deliver us from evil.Except … except it was all a morphine-fuelled fever dream. Paranoid fantasies of men and women lined up in a circular firing squad. There was no plot. Which isn’t to say that Wes and Shabana don’t have leadership ambitions. Both would be more than happy to take up residence in Downing Street if the chance arose. Just that neither of them have a campaign team primed and ready to go.Keir has added two and two and come to five. The main reason that Streeting makes TikTok videos, talks about the NHS and Gaza is because he loves his job. Wes enjoys being Wes. No one will ever love Wes quite the way Wes loves himself. But that applies to many successful politicians. Keir sees competence – Wes’s ease with himself – and senses danger. Someone to be cut down for showing up Starmer. Likewise Shabana. Tall poppy syndrome.If the idea was to look hard – think Gordon Brown going for David Miliband – it backfired badly. Starmer had managed to turn his leadership into a live issue. People who hadn’t been talking about whether he needed to be replaced now were. Starmer is a bit like Kemi Badenoch in this respect. Both have an unerring sense of political anti-matter. Doing the wrong thing at the wrong time.What’s more, Keir managed to alienate almost everyone. Wes, Shabana and Ed, obviously. But alsoLabourbackbenchers who just want a bit of steadiness from No 10. A sense of calm. Instead they just get panic. Bordering on insanity. As for the country at large, they just wondered what the hell was going on. Starmer has been in power for under 18 months and is trying to get rid of himself. Even Liz Truss didn’t come up with an idea like that.To top it all, No 10 chose to launch its attacks on the evening before Streeting was due to do the morning media round. Something Wes loves doing. And is good at. Wes’s specialist subject is Wes and he was able to deflect all the leadership talk with grace and humour.No, he had never thought of being leader. Mmm. Not entirely true but never mind. He had no idea what was going on in the addled brains of No 10. He was sure Keir would want to have a word with his team. Just time to get in the obligatory reference to The Traitors – it’s a new law that all politicians have to declare themselves a Faithful, to themselves if no one else – and he was out of there. Looking stronger than ever. If he hadn’t been a genuine leadership contender before this, he was now.That just left prime minister’s questions for Keir to endure. Thankfully, Wes and Ed were otherwise engaged so he only had Shabana to ignore. She didn’t seem to mind that much. In any case, the prime minister looked understandably distracted. Even a man like him, almost devoid of political instincts, could see he was in trouble. Some days you just want to go home and watch the TV.Now, it wouldn’t have been a total surprise if Kemi had misread the situation and used all her six questions to ask about the BBC. She is every bit as hopeless as Keir. And far more irrelevant. Nothing she says really matters. Her role these days is largely performative. But for once the Tory leader could spot an open goal that even she couldn’t miss. No wonder she looked so cheerful.She went in hard. Did the prime minister agree with the health secretary that there was a toxic culture in Downing Street? He didn’t. Any attack on a member of his cabinet was unacceptable, Keir insisted. Especially one that he had orchestrated himself. Keir will be furious with Keir when Keir realises what he has done to Wes. You could feel the energy being sucked out of the Labour benches. This was going to be every bit as they feared.Then the pressure ramped up a bit. A goodish gag about waiting lists – Wes had reached the top of his – and then more squirming. Did the prime minister have confidence in Morgan McSweeney, his chief of staff? “McSweeney, my team and I are absolutely focused on delivering for the country,” said Starmer. Not exactly the endorsement Morgan may have been hoping for. You also had to wonder just what Keir thought he was delivering. Chaos? That’s working.This carried on for a couple more questions before Kemi appeared to get bored and moved on to the economy. For the first time, Keir looked vaguely relieved. If she had continued for the whole six questions on the self-generated hysteria, some real damage might have been done. A resignation from the Downing St team may have been inevitable. But Badenoch was keen to show that there was more than one person who could fuck up atPMQs. It was still an easy win for her. But it could have been a humiliation.The rest of the session passed off uneventfully. Other than Rupert Lowe demanding the death penalty for foreigners. Nice. We ended with Labour’s Gill German offering Starmer a spot of R&R in Rhyl. “That sounds like an appealing invitation,” he said.

It doesn’t sound like a winning election slogan, but the sentiment is increasingly taking hold in politics and the media. The rise of Reform and the rightwards shift of the mainstream parties has made doom-spreading a sport, with GB News and Nigel Farage taking turns to pick which shadowy forces – migrants, welfare or wokeness – are wrecking the country.Conservatism once embodied national pride and preservation, but the new right is selling despair and destruction. The very people who have long accused leftwingers of “talking Britain down” now speak of “no-go areas” and ofmigrants raping young women. The Labour party under Keir Starmer has not exactly been soaked in optimism either, arguing that disability cuts are inevitable whilewealth taxesare impossible.This pessimism even extends to casting doubt on anyone who dares offer a bit of hope. Darren Jones, one of Starmer’s most influential ministers,told the Guardian last weekthat the Green party is making unfeasible promises ahead of the next election. “It’s their responsibility to explain to people how they would actually choose what to do if they were in government, as opposed to just promising things that are undeliverable,” he said.The remark gives an insight into how Labour will respond as the Greens start to look like a viableelectoral threat under Zack Polanski. But it also sums up the double standard that dogs politics: leftwing policies are typically portrayed as unrealistic and childish, while the centre and right’s ideas are framed as sensible and all that’s possible.When leftwing politicians make the case for better living conditions for ordinary people, they have long been met with accusations that their pledges are “undeliverable” (or when things get really hysterical, that they’re acommunist spy). Policies that favour the interests of the working class are routinely dismissed as a fantasy, whereas those that push wealth and power towards the rich come to be seen as a realistic status quo.This is not to say that redistributive or climate-related policies should be immune to critique or that the left as a movement has alwayscovered itself in glory. But it is to say that there is a bias against leftwing ideas – and those who promote them – which means they are more likely to be dismissed as naive, incompetent or too costly.To see this in action, just look at the handling of the two-child benefit limit. Introduced by the Conservatives in 2017, the policy is by any measure a moral and economic failure: from being a key driver of (increasingly expensive ) child poverty to putting women through distressing rape exemption rules.On Tuesday, the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, gave a hint that she plans to finally scrap it. But this possibility only comes after renewed pressure from100 civic organisationsand after 18 months of the government claiming it was unaffordable, with Starmer going as far assuspending Labour MPswho stood against the policy.15:25The city that reveals Britain's biggest problem: there's nowhere to live – videoThe mess gives an insight into how hard it is for the left to lobby for any sort of progress, even (or especially) when it’s with its own side. Or, to put it another way: Britain has aLabourgovernment at last and we are still arguing whether children should go hungry.That such a thing is a “debate” is depressing. Yet the truth is, it is a good day if the left is allowed to join in the conversation. While the hard right manages to paint mass deportations as a mainstream idea, leftwing – or even centre-left – thinking is routinely excluded from public discussion. Research byCardiff Universityfound Reform featured in a quarter of all BBC News at Ten bulletins between January and July this year, whereas the Liberal Democrats – the third party in parliament with 14 times the number of MPs as Reform – featured in just 17.9% of bulletins. Meanwhile, Farage’s party was referenced in just under 20% of ITV News at Ten bulletins, compared with just 6.2% for the Lib Dems.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At a time when the public are struggling with high private rents, rising unemployment, and poor public services, the hard right are offering simple answers. But mainstream parties who merely tinker around the edges will be ill equipped to provide the complex solutions necessary for the scale of the crisis.The growth in support for the Greens and Zohran Mamdani’s recent mayoral victory in New York suggests voters are beginning to question the idea that positive change is unattainable. Policies that are dismissed by the establishment as radical and unworkable, from rent controls to nationalised energy (both of which themajorityof Britonssupport), are seen by much of the public as mainstream and logical.That’s the thing about the narrative that Britain is falling apart. There are indeed many problems facing the country. But rather than immigrants and disabled people, the culprit is a social and economic structure that needs transforming. Most voters don’t need convincing the system is broken – they need inspiration that it can be fixed. The ideas dismissed as “undeliverable” are the very ones we most require.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Who is looking out for consumers and small businesses?Nils PratleyNobody doubts chunky spending is necessary to improve the grid. But how much of that money will be funded through consumer bills?Wed 12 Nov 2025 12.43 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 14.18 ESTShareIt is a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to upgrade the UK electricity network”, gushed Martin Pibworth, the chief executive ofSSE, and you can understand his excitement. The great grid upgrade has put a rocket under his share price. SSE’s shares soared 17% on Wednesday as the group laid out plans to spend the phenomenal sum of £33bn – more than the company’s current stock market value – over the next five years.That’s terrific news for SSE shareholders, but the stock market’s enthusiasm will do nothing to quiet two big worries about the sprint to upgrade the electricity grid. Has the regulatorOfgem– under orders from the government to get the upgrade done by 2030 – had to throw gold in the path of SSE, Scottish Power and National Grid Group, the trio behind the overall £80bn network investment programme? And what does it all mean for electricity consumers – households and businesses – who will fund this upgrade through their bills?Reeves considers cut to green levies in effort to reduce cost of energy billsRead moreFrom the point of view of SSE’s shareholders, the worry was that the mighty step up in spending, including £27bn alone on electricity networks, would have to be backed by a hefty issue of new shares. In the event, the company reckons it needs only £2bn of new equity, coupled with the same again from disposals. Those are trivial sums in the context of the size of the plan and, crucially, the progress SSE is now predicting in its earnings and dividends.Even while spending at an unprecedented pace, SSE thinks it can boost its dividend to shareholders at an annual rate of 5%-10% all the way to 2029-30 – not bad for a regulated utility. And the prize at the end is a much larger regulated asset base, the crucial figure used for setting network charges.Has Ofgem been too generous? Well, at the moment its price control determinations for 2026-31 are merely at the draft stage – the final version comes next month. But it took a crew of energy suppliers at a Commons select committeelast monthto spell out the reality that the £80bn programme, with the charges front loaded to give the networks confidence to invest, would have an impact on bills.“If we continue on the path we are on, in all likelihood electricity prices are going to be 20% higher – even if wholesale prices halve,” said Rachel Fletcher, the director of regulation at Octopus Energy, pointing to rising “non-commodity costs” such as gas and electricity network charges.The government and Ofgem’s argument is that the spending is necessary to correct historic underinvestment, to pave the way for the grid to handle more renewable generation and to prepare for a projected doubling in electricity usage by 2050. That’s what Pibworth, in a similar vein, means by the “once in a generation” nature of the programme, complete with lots of jobs on the way.Nobody doubts that chunky spending of some size is necessary. A prime target in the grid upgrade clearly has to be a reduction in the wasted billions that arise from constraint costs, the payments to windfarms (often in Scotland, SSE’s patch) to turn off because the grid locally is overloaded.But there are still fair questions to ask about whether the full £80bn needs to be spent in just five years, and – crucially – how the front-loaded nature of the charges to bills will affect consumers and small businesses from next April.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said: “Ofgem proposes significant upfront investment, leading to higher network charges. This raises major concerns about affordability for consumers and businesses – particularly the SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises]– the backbone of our economy.“These transmission costs risk significant bill increases early next year – £42 rise for domestic customers, and businesses face increases of 70% on average and some will see these [network] charges doubling next year. For businesses, this average 70% rise in network costs could translate to increases of 5%-10% in their total bills.”He makes a fair point. Energy transition is happening but these are not trivial sums, especially for businesses, which sit outside the price cap.

It was one of those petrol stations which is also a supermarket, so you run the risk of joining a queue of people bearing baskets of slightly overpriced groceries. This is a dreadful thing to happen when all you want to do is pay for some fuel. Dreadful.I was fourth in the queue. There was only one person serving, a young woman. There was something unusual about her. When the faffer at the front of the queue had finally paid for his Viakal, his sausage roll and his box of eggs, I could have sworn I heard the cashier wish him a wonderful day. Odd. Perhaps I’d misheard, or maybe she did say it and was being sarcastic. I wondered if she could even be an ally in my fight against faff, sharing my contempt for people who hold up simple fuel-buyers like me.Heard of aztec broccoli? Let me tell you about my favourite new superfood ... | Adrian ChilesRead moreI moved up to third in the queue. The new leader of our line discharged her fuel-only transaction with commendable speed. And there it was again: “Have a wonderful day.” No, actually, it was “have awonderfulday”. An American? In Stourbridge? She had the accent, and no British person wishes anyone a wonderful day, or even just a nice day. Highly unusual. You don’t get many Americans knocking around Stourbridge, certainly not working in petrol stations or anywhere else.I was second now. Behind a poor older woman engaged in a right old battle with her basket, her groceries, her purse and her loyalty card. It went on for ever. When she was done, she too was wished awonderfulday. Yes, American for sure. I could have confirmed it by saying something hilarious to her, to see if she did that thing when they look at you, unsmilingly, and say with absolute sincerity: “That’s really funny.” But I couldn’t think of anything hilarious to say.I just had to settle for the absolute sincerity – or an impersonation of it, which amounts to the same thing – with which she looked me right in the eye, deep into my soul, and wished me awonderfulday. I felt better for it. It was a good thing.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Adrian Chiles columncommentShareReuse this content"

And this week we’ll take this: the spectacle of various literary people at the Booker prize award ceremony jamming themselves into photos alongside Sarah Jessica Parker. The actor – if you missed thelong pieceabout it in the New York Times, or the many social mediapostspromoting Parker’s involvement – served as a judge for the Booker this year, a process that required her to read 153 books, some of them on the New York subway while being followed by a film crew. “Oh let me try!!!!” Parker had posted to Booker organisers last year, and for reasons that became obvious this week, they did.I know what you are going to say; that anything short of full-throated support for Parker’s adorable engagement with books in general and theBooker prizein particular is just unacceptable snobbery. There is nothing wrong with an actor involving herself in literary life or using her cultural weight to promote literacy. And – it goes without saying – we are all weepingly grateful to anyone with a platform bigger than that of the dowdy stay-at-home novelist who harnesses her glamour and spotlight for good. That celebrity book clubs have become the natural PR extension of taking up animal charities or becoming a UN goodwill ambassador is, surely, something to be celebrated. Who among us can fail to welcome Mindy Kaling, or Emma Watson, or Jenna Bush Hager in their fight against dwindling attention spans and addiction to screens?And yet: come on. Really? Content generated by celebrities keen to position themselves as bookish has given rise to some images – Natalie Portman (has she mentioned she went to Harvard?) peering alluringly over a copy of Virginia Woolf’s The Waves; Emma Roberts, actor and niece of Julia Roberts, taking a well-groomed nap with her newborn under a Joan Didion anthology; Kaia Gerber, actor and daughter of Cindy Crawford, reassuring us via her social media feed that “reading is so sexy”; the phrase “Dakota Johnson’s immersive literary experience” – that, if they fail to make you snigger, makes you a much better person than me.Some of how you regard this type of content may come down to a simple question of how your body reacts when you hear the words “Reese Witherspoon” – with a warm smile or an involuntary shudder. Witherspoon, whose book club is almost a decade old, is a grandee of celebrity book content and Oprah Winfrey’s natural heir, oftenpresentingherself in a floral onesie, reclining on a sofa with a book in hand and a look on her face that says, “Yes, I’m cute; but I also read.” What Witherspoon is reading, inevitably, is a novel about an awkward girl who meets an oddball man and together they celebrate their mutual iconoclasm with a conventional wedding.Of course, not all celebrity book clubs are equal, and a generation behind Witherspoon comes Dua Lipa, with a much more ambitious and literary book list – one that has, recently, included titles by Ocean Vuong, Patrick Radden Keefe and, toast of the hour, Helen Garner. (Actually, it wasSarah Jessica Parkerwho got to Garner first, depicting Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City with, variously, a copy of Garner’s first novel, Monkey Grip, and her book This House of Grief, tucked modishly under her arm. The latter is the wrenching true story of a man who murders his children that every fashionable girl-about-town needs.)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s why you should read them | Chris PowerRead moreSince there is room for all types of literary taste, I suppose my quibble with a lot of this is stylistic. On the question of “reading is sexy” – an affirmation that most celebrities with book clubs take extremely literally, so that every promotional photo involves them pouting, red carpet-ready, over the top of the book – is it unbearably un-fun to wonder if sexy is the right word? There is something deeply condescending in this assumption that the only thing young, ignorant, non-book-reading people will respond to is “hotness”, or that the definition of hotness is reading a book in a bikini.As for the authors themselves, many are, of course, thrilled to be involved with hotter, younger, richer people from the popular end of the entertainment spectrum, thus entering the tradition of otherwise cranky and uncooperative literary people meeting an actor and becoming suddenly cheerful. In the New York Times story of how Sarah Jessica Parker managed to pull off being a famous actor while also reading some books, the TV star said: “I would reach out to Roddy [Doyle, the judging panel chair] and say, ‘Have you touched on this book yet? Here are my feelings about it, but it’s possible I’m spot-on wrong.’” Spoiler alert: the Irish novelist absolutely 100% agreed with the Golden Globe and Emmy winner’s judgment call on that particular book.I don’t mean to be too much of a downer. No one wants to be the Jonathan Franzen at this particular party (although, I will say that as Oprah’s book picks become increasinglydodgy, I find myself having more sympathy with his priggish refusal to be involved with her). But perhaps we can say yay to celebrity book clubs, while reserving the right to find them faintly ludicrous – examples of people who insist on letting us know what they think about everything, with a confidence entirely untainted by expertise.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s why responsible media organizations correct their errors and acknowledge them to the public. It’s why newsroom leaders take steps, internally, to repair broken processes. It’s why they sometimes go so far as to apologize or take stories down.Some mistakes, of course, are worse than others. A misspelled name is one thing. Sustained coverage that is misleading or false is quite another. And there are plenty of gradations between those two poles.The BBC’s error in a documentary film aboutDonald Trumpwas a serious one. During the editing, two clips of the president speaking to his riled-up crowd of followers in Washington were juxtaposed, even though there was nearly an hour between the two. The edited version could have made viewers believe Trump had made an unmistakable call for violence at the US Capitol that day. He did make inflammatory statements, of course, and he does bear significant responsibility for the riot at the Capitol that day, but he skirted the direct instruction that the film suggested.So, yes, this was a bad mistake that was not adequately acknowledged or corrected when there was a chance to do so. That is something that calls for internal examination and external acknowledgment, some of which has occurred.But the current aftermath of the long-ago error – the film was published last year before the US presidential election – is significantly out of proportion.Trump, ever litigious, is threatening to sue theBBCfor $1bn. His spokesperson, in discussing a highly critical leaked memo by a former BBC adviser, is taking the opportunity to unfairly trash the broadcaster as “100% fake news”.And, shockingly, two top news executives at the esteemed public broadcasting outlet have resigned: they are the director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness.What’s more, in today’s polarized political world, the situation has thrown the BBC into something of an existential crisis, and some say its longterm survival is at stake. With the broadcaster’s coverage of the Gaza war and of transgender rights also under fire, some politicians are using the new controversy to urge British people to refuse to pay the license fee that funds the BBC.That’s way out of whack. The BBC certainly has messed up, but as a news organization it remains essential, not just in the United Kingdom but in America and beyond. It deserves continued support; it certainly deserves to survive and thrive.“You would never guess from the sometimes hysterical coverage of the past week that the BBC remains quite easily the most trusted news organization in the UK,” wrote former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger in Prospect. The BBC is also extremely well regarded in America, he notes, “the second most trusted news source – just behind the Weather Channel”.For Americans, this situation sounds all too familiar. Trump uses lawsuits (or threats of lawsuits) as a political weapon, a cudgel to encourage grievance and division, and a way to control the political message by undermining the reality-based press.This practice long predates his two terms as president. In recent months, though, he has had significant success in suing media companies, drawing multimillion-dollar settlements over his complaints to news organizations including ABC News and CBS News. In both of those cases, legal experts and first amendment attorneys said the cases could have been successfully defended, and that settling was a regrettable form of capitulation.“This is the Trump squeeze in action,” wrote CNN’s Brian Stelter, in describing the president’s demand letter to the BBC. It sets a deadline of this Friday afternoon for a retraction and compensation.How should the BBC respond – beyond, of course, the stunning resignation of the two news leaders?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It should fully acknowledge the error and it should be clear internally – and transparent externally – about what happened and how similar errors will be avoided in the future.But it should also defend itself, in court, and to the public. And it should continue the wise practice of reporting on itself, as it did in BBC presenter Ros Atkins’s fair-minded piece published this week about what has happened; it gave important context on how political pressure has been building for a long time. This isn’t happening in a vacuum, but in a boiling-hot cauldron.So yes, take all of those corrective actions.But the broadcaster should not cave to Trump’s demands. Rather, it should follow the example of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal in defending itself in court, if indeed a lawsuit materializes. (Trump’s threats, after all, don’t always come to fruition, but remain pure bluster.) Some legal experts say it’s not clear that such a suit is even possible given the international boundaries.Mistakes happen in journalism; that’s inevitable.

Rachel Reeves’sreported planto shred Labour’s flagship tax pledge in the upcoming budget is so plainly disastrous that it invites the suspicion that the party leadership has completely lost its senses. But madness would be too generous an alibi for a faction that long ago abandoned any purpose beyond wielding icepicks against its own left.Labour’s 2024 election campaign offered no story, no clear moral argument, no real sense of direction. That vacuum explains why, even after being handed power, thanks to the most shambolic government in modern British history,Labourmustered only a third of the vote. The tax pledge was one of the few recognisable threads of coherence.For example: “Labour will not put up your income tax, national insurance or VAT,”tweeted Reeveson 4 June 2024, denouncing the Conservatives as “the party of high tax”. A week later, Keir Starmertold Sky Newsin Grimsby: “We will not raise tax on working people.” Themanifestocouldn’t be clearer: “Labour will not increase taxes on working people”, specifically citing national insurance, income tax and VAT.Reeves is now considering a 2p increase in income tax, believing a simultaneous cut in employee national insurance contributions will shield the government. It will do no such thing. The Liberal Democrats’ incineration after reneging on tuition fees in 2010 remains a parable of political suicide – but even that betrayal was narrower in scope. It was not as central to their campaign; and they were a minor party which became a junior partner in a coalition, not the dominant party wielding an historic majority, albeit because of a grotesquely distorted electoral system.The government will, no doubt, plead that economic circumstances have changed. Yet some of us warned during the campaign that its refusal totax the wealthywould mean yet more devastating cuts to our services. The economy was in a bad state at the time of the election – which Labour dishonestly pretended to discover after winning office. And what has the past decade of chaos told us other than to prepare for sudden turmoil at any moment? Ruling out these tax hikes was completely reckless.Before shredding its pact with the public, Labour might glance at the Sunday Times rich list. A mere 350 UK households holdwealth totalling £772.8bn– comparable to the entire annual economic output of Poland. In a time of national hardship, can it really be deemed too radical to suggest they contribute a lot more?Even if the party’s leaders were skilful communicators, this shameless ripping up of the contract between government and voters would provoke a tsunami of political rage. Alas, you will find filing cabinets with more stage presence. Already,Starmer’s personal ratingshave sunk below Liz Truss’s at her lowest ebb.The long-term damage to Labour will be incalculable. At the last election, the Tories claimed Labour would hike taxes on working people. They will claim vindication – but, more importantly, no one will believe any pledge offered by Labour ever again. “Remember when it abandoned its main promise from the 2024 election?” opponents will cry, and Labour will say what exactly?No, no, this time we really mean it?The reputational damage will be irreversible.Increase taxes for working people, or make the super-rich pay their fair share? The answer seems obvious – but not to Labour | Dhananjayan SriskandarajahRead moreBut it’s not Labour’s self-inflicted destruction that should most concern us. The party’s decision to box itself into a corner over tax led it to hike employer national insurance contributions last year. This contributed to stubborn inflation – which has proven to be a key factor in the rise of rightwing populism across the west. Democracy is menaced by collapsing trust in politicians and confidence in electoral systems, which authoritarian demagogues are only too keen to exploit. The harm inflicted on our increasingly precarious democracy by shamelessly abandoning a central election pledge should both anger and terrify us.Labour looks finallyset to scrapthe two-child benefit cap – which imposes hardship and squalor on hundreds of thousands of children – and is an extremely welcome move. However, the fact that it has been dragged kicking and screaming to do what any genuine Labour government should have done without blinking, will mean it gains precious little political capital.The faction running Labour have long seen themselves as ingenious political operators, whose laser focus on electability contrasts with the hopeless naivety of defeated leftwing internal rivals. Starmerism was always devoid of both principle and purpose. Its original sin was deceiving the party membership by offering Corbynism without Corbyn, only to cynically ditch all that in an attempt to drive the left into permanent oblivion. It received no hammering for this duplicity because British political pundits largely saw deceiving socialists in order to crush them as good politics.That indulgence has evidently bred delusion. Believing dishonesty could forever provide an escape hatch, Labour now faces a brutal encounter with reality. It has already breathed life into Nigel Farage’s insurgency – and, more encouragingly, intoZack Polanski’s resurgent Greens, a revival the Labour right neither foresaw nor understands. This new phenomenon, we must hope, can capitalise on Labour’s planned tax betrayal. If not, then this dismal political project will bleed out its last reserves of credibility – and only hasten Britain’s slide towards hard-right rule.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionBudget 2025Rachel ReevesTax and spendingEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

It is downright bizarre that the origin of a sudden surge in speculation about Sir Keir Starmer’s future isbriefings by loyalistsbased in Downing Street.The prime minister’s allies must have imagined they were serving his interests by flushing potential rivals –Wes Streeting, the health secretary, being the most prominent – out of the shadows. Forcing someone’s hand before it is ready to strike is a familiar move in the playbook of factional politics.Sir Keir’s praetorian guard appears not to have considered the destructive consequences for the government of provoking days of speculation and counter-briefing about the inadequacy of the No 10 operation. Meanwhile, there is no indication that Sir Keir has a reliable plan to convince unhappy MPs that he is capable ofrestoring public confidencein his administration and reversing a calamitous slide in opinion poll ratings.Mr Streeting and other ambitious frontlineLabourfigures deny plotting to replace their leader. But there is no doubt that the parliamentary party is profoundly unhappy with the status quo and increasingly given to wondering if there is anything to lose by gambling on change at the top.The riposte from Sir Keir’s supporters is that a leadership challenge would be all downside. They argue it would signal that Britain is slipping back into the political volatility of the Tory years, unsettling markets and foreign governments alike. The leader’s allies say carefully calibrated relations withthe USandthe EUwould be jeopardised. The only winners would be opposition parties.Such claims are designed to raise the bar of credibility for any potential rival – but it is unclear whether the threshold reflects reality. Political authority can shift quickly. But it is also a bleakly negative defence of a prime minister who arrived in office with a mandate to achieve substantial change with his newfound power. A stronger argument for keeping Sir Keir in place would be that he has only just begun the work of rebuilding Britain’s public services in accordance with distinct values and clear priorities, and that the fruits of reform and investment will soon be palpable, eliciting gratitude in voters.But that argument is not available. It doesn’t ring true. Most worrying for Labour, the qualities in a prime minister that might make it true are absent from Sir Keir’s repertoire. He has failed to signal a resonant or consistent purpose to his leadership; he shows no natural capacity for public persuasion. That deficiency is especially damaging when the government ispoised to raise taxesin repudiation of unambiguous promises not to do so.The budget later this month wasalready loomingas a make-or-break test of whether the Starmer project has any mileage left in it. The eruption of internal Labour strife and discussion of the prime minister’s vulnerability to defenestration raises the stakes even higher, and the increased danger is all self-imposed. Ramping up discussion of leadership change never strengthens the incumbent. If the prime minister wants to be more secure in his position, there is no alternative remedy but to fix, if he can, the obscurity of purpose and lack of compelling argument that brought him into this peril.Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourWes StreetingRachel ReevesBudget 2025editorialsShareReuse this content"

Which was hardly surprising. Whether in relation to the the normalisation ofgreat replacement theory, or the bullying and harassment of the media, Mr Orbán more or less wrote the playbook for the Maga movement. The former White House strategist Steve Bannon has eulogised Hungary’s prime minister as the “Trump before Trump”.Last week, ahead of crucial Hungarian elections in less than six months’ time, the US president returned some political favours. As Mr Orbán seeks a fifth consecutive term presiding over a nation which he boasts of having turned into an illiberal democracy, his Fidesz party trails in the polls. As well as a few signed Maga baseball caps, an Orbánvisitto Washington yielded considerably more valuable pre-election gifts.Having previouslylecturedEuropean nations on the need to eliminate all energy imports from Russia, and threatened tosanctioncountries continuing to buy Russian oil, Mr Trump agreed there should be a special exemption for Hungary – the largest EU consumer of all. According to Mr Orbán, the Trump administration also agreed to offer a “financial shield” to Budapest should it run into any future difficulties, as Brussels continues towithholdbillions of pounds in EU funding to Hungary on the grounds of rule-of-law breaches.The details of this arrangement are somewhat murky. But Mr Trump recently demonstrated his willingness to help out ideological allies when the USextendeda $20bn emergency credit line to Argentina’s far-right president, Javier Milei. Although Mr Orbán failed to nail down a campaign-energising Trump visit to Budapest, it was still a profitable day’s work in the Oval Office.In the corridors of the EU, Mr Trump’s intervention will have further underlined the geopolitical stakes of the coming election, ahead of which the centrist challenger, Péter Magyar,enjoysa comfortable lead in the polls. European leaders have learned not to expect principled consistency from the Trump White House, and have grown used to the US president’s efforts to belittle the EU. But Mr Orbán’s exemption – which came at the price of an agreement to buy US gas and nuclear energy – flagrantly undermines EUaspirationsto phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027.Since 2022, the two biggest EU importers of Russian oil, Hungary and Slovakia, havecontributedwell over £10bn to the Kremlin’s war effort. Meanwhile, Budapest has repeatedly used the threat of its veto to stymie progress in Ukraine’s EU accession talks. As Europe strives to forge a unified and effective strategy for supporting Kyiv, and strengthening its hand in any future peace negotiations, Mr Orbán’s Putin-friendly presence at the diplomatic table remains a significant obstacle.Mr Magyar has steeredclearof pledging a major policy shift on Ukraine, and focused his campaigning on domestic issues, while emphasising the need for Hungary to finally behave as a constructive EU member. After enduring so many years of trolling, Brussels can only wait and hope. Mr Orbán’sindifferenceto basic EU values, such as the upholding of minority rights and the independence of civil society institutions, has long been a humiliating embarrassment for the bloc. His continued obstructionism regarding Ukraine risks undermining its future security.Explore more on these topicsHungaryOpinionEuropean UnionViktor OrbánDonald TrumpUkraineUS foreign policyRussiaeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Our entire justice system was woefully neglected throughout 14 years of Conservative tenure. But this neglect was particularly calamitous in relation to our prisons. Rectifying the obscenity that currently passes for our prison system will require enormous government investment of public money at a time when public finances are stretched and sympathy for our prison population is low: there are precious few votes in a manifesto promise to improve the lot of prisoners.However, I feel we must look at this disgraceful situation from the standpoint of the poor prison officers who are tasked with working in these dreadful institutions. If conditions in our largely outdated prisons are bad for the inmates, just imagine what it is like having to work in them. It must be incredibly difficult to recruit new staff to the Prison Service and nigh on impossible to retain them, leaving the service dependent on young, inexperienced, demotivated staff with poor morale who are regularly exposed to high levels of verbal and physical abuse.Being a prison officer should be a high-status profession respected by the public, personally fulfilling for the officers, well paid, with continuous training, opportunities for career development and good levels of restorative annual leave. Staff-to-prisoner ratios must be dramatically improved to enable officers to engage in the essential tasks of education, rehabilitation and preparing prisoners for reintegration following release. Currently, their role is simply to supervise the incarceration of prisoners in their cells for a large proportion of every day.We must improve the physical, social, economic and rehabilitative aspects of our prisons, if not for the inmates, then for the poor benighted souls who have laudably chosen a career in the Prison Service, a job that few of us would be prepared to consider.John LovelockBristolPeter Walker’s analysis of the chaotic circumstances behind recent prison release errors comes as no surprise to anyone with experience of our prison system (Overcrowding, understaffing and old IT: chaotic context to prison release errors, 6 November) .What the inspection reports don’t fully capture is the daily reality inside these places. Many prisoners live in unclean, rat-infested conditions that would be condemned if found in any other public building. Violence, drug use and self-harm statistics, while “gradually improving” in some places like Wandsworth, paint a picture of profoundly unsafe environments for both prisoners and staff everywhere.There is some evidence that the drug crisis is keeping a temporary lid on behaviour, but it fuels a shadow economy controlled by organised crime groups and corrupt staff members, and creates the very instability that makes rehabilitation impossible. The prison wings may appear superficially calm, but this represents containment, not safety or progress.If rehabilitation was already a struggle under these conditions, it now risks becoming a pipedream.

So she ditched her hostility to the EU and support for dropping the euro to return to the lira. She found fault with Vladimir Putin. She sought collaborative solutions with other European leaders to the arrivals of boat people.So let us wait to see if Mr Farage embraces Europe, which would certainly cause confusion in Labour ranks given the party’s snail-like advance towards criticising the breaking of trade links with the giant single market across the Channel.

Faced with the growing impossibility of securing accommodation via housing associations or local authorities, Crisis sees this as the most direct way of helping. Isn’t it time that Shelter, with its history of supporting other homelessness organisations, arrived at a similar conclusion?Many people are under the impression that Shelter houses homeless people. Despite having financially supported many frontline housing organisations and related projects during the 1960s and 70s, it pulled back from this role in the 80s. It now works with its 900-plus staff and its£80m incometo provide housing advice and to undertake research and campaigning.In view of the dearth of available social housing that has become a matter of such concern to Crisis, Shelter might do well to revisit its roots, review how it deploys its considerable resources and once again engage in directly funding housing for homeless people.Jon FitzmauriceFormerShelter trustee, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Now their sons were independent, he and Pru sat down at the end of each year, worked out how much money they would need for the next one, and put all the rest aside to fund students through drama school and for other charitable causes.

When Ezri Konsa strolled in to preview Thursday’s World Cup qualifier against Serbia at Wembley, theEnglanddefender did so in what, at first glance, appeared to be a cross between a pair of slippers and oversized Crocs. In garish, fluorescent red.On closer inspection, it was possible to make out grooves and nodules on them, and then it was time for the science part. Apparently, if you wear these your concentration improves. Well, that is according to the manufacturer. Something to do with the pressure points on the foot, perhaps. Was Konsa convinced? Unclear. How aboutThomas Tuchel? Ditto.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford tries on a pair of Nike Mind footwear.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty Images“I don’t know the science behind it,” the England head coach said. “They are desperate to tell me, but I haven’t found time to get my head around it. But all the players are wearing them. They told me they can focus better in meetings if they wear these shoes and I hope they believe it. Maybe the most important thing is that they believe it.”Put it down as one for the marginal gains department. Or simply the power of positive thought, which is something Tuchel, a longtime practitioner of meditation, can get behind. He tries to meditate once a day, even if he concedes that twice would be ideal.“It helps me with my discipline … it helps me to calm down, to focus and be aware,” he said. “It’s not like you do it and it’s immediately: ‘Oh wow.’ It’s more of an ongoing thing. The more you do it the more effect you feel, but it’s subtle.”Tuchel was asked what stressed him out. “Oh, journalists, players … sporting directors,” he said. Which got a laugh, given his previous for fallouts with the last of these. He talked, too, about the work within the England camp of Suzanne Scott, the pilates teacher and movement expert. “She does fantastic breathwork sessions,” he said. “She does more stuff than just that, but she does it and the players buy into it. They feel the relief.”The wider point of all this is a major theme of the camp, which concludes with the final qualifier against Albania in Tirana on Sunday: the notion of England looking within themselves to maintain and drive standards. A major external stimulus has been removed. With World Cup qualification sewn up, there will be no jeopardy against Serbia and Albania. Or, indeed, in the March friendlies the Football Association will line up – it is in talks about facing Japan and Uruguay.England will fine-tune for the finals in North America with warm‑up games, probably in Florida. But only when they play their opening group match will the pressure be dialled up. The heat of meaningful competition cannot be replicated, even if Serbia and Albania continue to battle for qualification berths. Serbia are also about to begin life under a new manager, Veljko Paunovic.A related detail is the Wembley crowd, to whichTuchel offered pointed feedbackafterthe friendly win against Wales last month. Not enough noise, not enough energy. He knows it will be up to his players to spark the fans, not the other way around.View image in fullscreenEzri Konsa takes part in England training. The defender is one of many players wearing special footwear off the field.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/Reuters“Maybe it’s important to acknowledge it,” he said, when asked about the lack of jeopardy. “Will we get the full thrill of it tomorrow? Maybe not. Will it be the same in the first knockout match at the finals? No. Will it be the same if we needed a win against Serbia to qualify? No, it is impossible.“But why should we not run? We still do our stuff, we still run at people, we still go after them. The environment and circumstances don’t give the edge, but still we have a lot to prove to ourselves.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rather, it is a moment to double down on the approach that brought progress in the September and October camps, the first of which featured the transformative5-0 win against Serbiain Belgrade when the heat was very much on.It will be about sticking to the system; a 6, an 8 and a 10 in midfield with specialist wingers on both sides. It will mean players fitting in, being used in their best positions – nobody shoehorned in on the basis of individual talent. It will be Jude Bellingham or Foden or Morgan Rogers in the No 10 role. Bellingham, Foden and the centre‑forward, Harry Kane, will surelynot be on the pitch at the same time.It will be a time to build on the connections, to complete part III of the mission from the autumn – the creation of a clear playing style, an identity. Also to further cement the hierarchies in each position. And the brotherhood within the squad, as Tuchel calls it. Spirit is everything. For the manager, it comes before selections, before tactics.Foden, Bellingham and Kane cannot all start in England’s system, insists TuchelRead moreAt this distance, it is possible to feel eight of the lineup for the opening World Cup match are pretty nailed on. Tuchel did not disagree with the number. Those players would be Jordan Pickford, Reece James, John Stones, Declan Rice, Elliot Anderson, Bukayo Saka, Bellingham and Kane. It would probably be Konsa or Marc Guéhi as the second centre-half; Marcus Rashford or Anthony Gordon on the left wing. The most open position, the most problematic, is left‑back, where Djed Spence and Nico O’Reilly are duelling.Tuchel’s idea is to focus on plan A, the clarity of roles; not to obsess about contingencies. The idea is that the back-ups will step up as required. It is the structure that is king – along with the motivation from within.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Marc Skinner’s team cuffed aside Paris Saint‑Germain courtesy of Fridolina Rolfö’s expert second-half header.When jogging out for the warmup Earps was cheered, but when the crowd swelled for kick-off the jeers came, though for a player whose CV shows nine clubs, 52 England caps, anda Euro 2022 winner’s medal, this felt water off the proverbial for her.Skinner said: “I said to her at the end: ‘Look after yourself.’ She’s an intelligent person – she understands the world she’s in.”Quick GuideWomen's Champions League roundupShowBarça march on but Atlético's Medina taken to hospitalBarcelonaremained top of the Women’s Champions League standings after beatingLeuven3-0.Barçaextended their winning start to the league phase to three matches, having scored 14 times and conceded just once, but they endured a frustrating first half against their Belgian opponents at Estadi Johan Cruyff.The hosts eventually found the breakthrough on the stroke of half-time when Alexia Putellas, pictured, slotted home from the penalty spot.A Kim Everaerts own goal extended their lead in the 56th minute before Irene Paredes nodded home from Mapi Leon’s corner.Barça are top of the standings on goal difference from both Lyon and Manchester United, the only other two teams with a 100% record.Juventusreturned to winning ways in the competition after coming from behind to beatAtlético Madrid2-1.Looking to bounce back from defeat to Bayern Munich last time out, Juve fell behind in the 39th minute when Amaiur Sarriegi fired home for Atlético.However, Emma Stolen Godo responded in the fourth minute of first-half stoppage time before Barbara Bonansea scored what proved to be the winner 11 minutes into the second period.The game was marred, however, by Andrea Medina's head injury. The Atlético defender was treated on the pitch for more than five minutes after staying down following a sliding tackle in the 73rd minute. She was put in the recovery position by the assistant referee before being taken off on a stretcher.“Andrea Medina was replaced after suffering a traumatic brain injury,” read a statement from Atlético.“The footballer is doing well but has been transferred to a hospital center to undergo additional tests.”TwenteandBenfica’swait for a first Champions League win continues after they settled for a 1-1 draw. Cristina Martin-Prieto opened the scoring in the 62nd minute, but Lynn Groenewegen replied for the Dutch side just seven minutes later.PA Media and agenciesPhotograph: Eurasia Sport Images/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.United’s manager should be enthused by how his team soaked up pressure at the start of each half, took the lead through Melvine Malard, then responded to Olga Carmona’s equaliser with Rolfo’s winner.With her first clearance Earps saw her team move downfield and have Jennifer Echegini smash a 25-yard effort off Safia Middleton-Patel’s left post, United’s stand-in goalkeeper a flailing spectator only.The Queen of Stopshad become the queen of the agenda, after her incendiary remarks about Hannah Hampton being installed as England’s No 1 for the European Championship this year.

Skinner said: “It might be [the Hampton-England issue], might be a bit of a returning ex-United player, but I’m pleased she got the reception at the end.”United made their bow in European competition at the club’s storied home having lost 1-0 at Aston Villa on Saturday in the Women’s Super League, but with a perfect six points in the competition after beating Atlético Madrid and Valerenga.Skinner’s five changes from that defeat included dropping to the bench Ella Toone and the top scorer, Elisabeth Terland, while injury meant Phallon Tullis-Joyce, United’s No 1, was not in the squad.A punch-out of a steepling Jayde Riviere ball was Earps’s first act; it came just before the half-hour, an indicator of the mundane fare the crowd of about 15,000 consumed. But soon Earps was beaten.Riviere’s sweeping ball along the right was taken on by Malard. The striker bundled aside Griedge Mbock Bathy and zigzagged for goal; the shot flew past Earps – whose dive seemed low – and into the far-left corner.This boosted the home fans and the next round of boos aimed at Earps were enthusiastic, though it felt more pantomime stuff than vindictive. More potent was the Ajibade corkscrewed cross that had Middleton-Patel scrambling to jab on to her bar, before a 20‑yard Carmona shot smacked the top‑left corner of the net.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Far simpler was Earps clutching an insipid Anna Sandberg free-kick that United’s left‑back floated straight into the gloves and far better was what Sandberg did next: slick Jess Park footwork was followed by the midfielder feeding Sandberg whose cross from the left was pinpoint for Rolfö: the Swede’s header gave Earps no chance.View image in fullscreenDespite the boos and jeers, there was still a sizeable amount of appreciation for Mary Earps from the Manchester United fans.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesAdvantage United, who soon had Malard running in from the right, shooting and drawing a fine save from Earps, low to her left.Skinner introduced Toone, Terland and Leah Galton for a final phase in which United, again, resisted PSG: so, a job well done for those in red, making it a losing return for Earps, the woman of the moment.As Skinner said, this will all “blow over” soon for her amid the ever‑fast news cycle.

A majority of athletes said to me: ‘Just let me know. Let me know early, and I’ll start training to run three 100s in one day.’”View image in fullscreen‘It’s such an exciting opportunity,’ says Great Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith of the surprise decision to stage all three rounds of the 100m on the same day.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAWorld Athletics said that it had arranged the schedule to allow as many athletes as possible to “double up”, not only in events such as the 100m and 200m but also the 800m and 1500m, and the 1500m and 5,000m. It said that there would be 10 days of competition at the LA Coliseum, with a mixed 100m relay having its debut, as well as three days of road events at the end of the Games.“We have landed on an athletics programme that will start with a bang as our women’s sprinters take centre stage on day one,” the World Athletics president, Seb Coe, said. “It is a schedule that is both innovative but also honours tradition, with the men’s marathon on the final day.”However, the schedule makes it unlikely that the US sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone will be able to run in both the 400m and the 400m hurdles, given the 400m hurdles semi-finals and the 400m final are on the same day.View image in fullscreen‘We have landed on an athletics programme that will start with a bang as our women’s sprinters take centre stage on day one,’ says the World Athletics president, Seb Coe.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesSwimming has traditionally kicked off the Summer Games. But as it is taking place in SoFi Stadium, where the opening ceremony will be staged, it will now start in the second week.Organisers also confirmed that day one will feature the most women’s finals in a single day in the Games’ history, with the women’s triathlon gold medal among those up for grabs. Also scheduled is a Super Saturday on the penultimate day, with 26 gold medals across 23 sports in play.Shana Ferguson, LA28’s chief of sport and games delivery, said the plan is to sell about 14 million tickets across 51 Olympic sports at 49 venues, with public sales due to begin in April 2026. Ferguson also confirmed that organisers would not employ the controversial dynamic pricing model that provoked outrage among Oasis fans in the summer and was trialled by Fifa at the football Club World Cup in the US.Explore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028Olympic GamesAthleticsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “If I am to be charitable, there are flickers of good news.“The number of clubs that are balance sheet insolvent has been reduced to six, from seven. Attendances are up in places. The women’s game continues to shine, buoyed up bya home World Cup victoryand record-breaking crowds.“All of this is wonderful and yet it feels like singing Always Look on the Bright Side of Life as the house burns down around you. But here’s the reality: not a single Premiership team made a profit in 2023‑24. All 10 clubs lost money for the third year in a row.“Right now we areThelma and Louise, foot down, laughing, waving at fans, heading straight off the cliff. Everyone knows it. The players and coaches know it. Fans definitely know it. But the administrators? They’re still checking the rearview mirror.“That is why I actually likethe R360 proposal, whether it happens or not, because it’s daring to do the opposite of everything we’ve done the last 30 years.”View image in fullscreen‘It feels like singing Always Look on the Bright Side of Life as the house burns down around you,’ says James Haskell, the former England international.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe report’s authors stressed there were some signs of optimism, including a growth in ticket sales and viewers. They also noted that Newcastlehad been taken over by Red Bull, and expected one or two clubs may sneak into a profit next year.However, Alex Cadwallader, a Leonard Curtis director and former England Under-21 player, said the underlying problems could not be ignored. “There are no surprises in our latest report. The current model is proven. It is a loss‑making one.“The clubs collectively have been loss-making every year in the last 10 years once the exceptional items such as ground sales in 2014-15 and the CVC investment deal in 2018-19 are removed. The amount of debt continues to grow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The game is reliant on benefactors funding their clubs for which we are grateful. However, this can not continue.”The report suggests that under a restructured franchise system clubs could save between £1.1m to £1.9m annually through economies of scale, sharing services and, initially, reducing the salary cap. “The competition in France is moving forward and disruptors with new models are circling,” Cadwallader said. “The question really should be: why would we not consider a different model?”One of the report’s co-authors, professor Rob Wilson, suggested clubs should consider lowering the salary cap at £4m – a drop of £2.4m – until the financial situation improved. “It has been set at a level to appease players, but the reality is operational losses,” he said. “Smaller clubs are spending way above their means to keep up with the Harlequins of this world.”The report also warns that, while the Red Roses’ World Cup victory has given domestic women’s rugby an unprecedented platform, addressing the lack of competitiveness in Premiership Women’s Rugby (PWR) was vital.Dr Ellie Nesbitt, a senior lecturer in sport management at Nottingham Trent University, said: “While competitive balance in the men’s Premiership remains strong, the significantly lower competitive balance in the PWR is a cause for concern. It risks fan disengagement due to the predictability of the games and results. Closing the gap between elite and emerging teams is essential for the league’s long-term growth and success.”Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyRugby unionSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

If I have to fight for something, I’ll fight’Donald McRaeHead of F1 Academy explains how close she came to a grand prix debut, her quest to produce female drivers, and a frightening knock on her hotel room door by a powerful man in the sportWed 12 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 13.29 ESTShare“There was a deep loneliness to karting, and then definitely in single‑seaters, because no one else was going through the same thing as me,” says Susie Wolff as she remembers her long struggle in motor sport, from racing as a teenager against Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg to her determined, but unfulfilled, quest to become aFormula Onedriver.“After the whole #MeToo movement, we forget what it was like before. But the way I heard boys talking about girls in the paddock made me think: ‘I never want to be spoken about in that way.’ I realised I’d have to be whiter than white to get through it unscathed.”‘Focus on driving and talk less’: Ferrari president hits back at Lewis HamiltonRead moreThe 42-year-old says: “I couldn’t open up to anyone until I met [her husband] Toto. But I’m definitely happy that the next generation will never have to go through that because there’s a camaraderie in F1 Academy. These young women have other women they can look up to or reach out to and there won’t be that isolation I felt.”Wolff is the managing director of the F1 Academy, the all-female racing championship she has led since 2023. The aim is to offer young women opportunities to develop in competitive racing with the long-term ambition of producing a female F1 driver.It seems apt that our interview should take place in the middle of a kart test session for her and Toto’s eight‑year-old son, Jack. The memories rise up and she speaks with even more passion about rocketing female interest in motor sport compared with her own solitary journey through prejudice and inequality. “I can’t believe the number of young girls in karting now,” she says. “I was always the only one – or there might have been just one other girl.”In her revealing new book, Wolff shines a stark light on the difficulties she faced. As the boys tried to dismiss or intimidate her “it became clear that being quick wasn’t enough. I had to toughen up, find an aggression that didn’t come naturally.”View image in fullscreenSusie’s mother, Sally Stoddart, on three wheels in her racing days.Photograph: Courtesy of Susie WolffShe recounts an early clash in karting when an entitled boy was incensed he could not overtake a little Scottish girl. He slammed into the back of her kart before driving her off the track. They were called in by the clerk of the course and the boy and his hectoring father blamed Susie for the crash. She calmly demolished their argument and the clerk disqualified the boy.“I toughened up from a young age,” Wolff says. “and that held me in good stead for later in life. It also had negatives because you end up being so hardened. But I can now be very punchy and pragmatic and if I have to fight for something I’ll fight.”At the junior world karting championships in 2000 she fought her way through a vast field to finish a creditable 15th. But she felt embarrassed when, after the main prizes were awarded, she was called up to the podium and announced as the best female kart driver in the world.“I wasn’t there to be the top female,” she says. “I was there to try and be the best. There were 130 drivers so I was well inside the top 15%. But I was being singled out as the best female and it was the moment I realised: ‘OK, I’m seen as different.’ When I moved into single-seaters [cars] that intensified year-on-year.”Motor racing is outrageously expensive and as she climbed through the classes she needed sponsors, most of whom wanted her to live up to a girly stereotype by driving a pink car and looking pretty in photoshoots. “I just wanted to be seen as a racer, but at the time there was also this idea that any girl in racing was a tomboy. I wasn’t that and it was very hard navigating.“I remember being with Mercedes-Benz in DTM [Germany’s elite sports car series], thinking: ‘If I wear a dress, they might not take me seriously because they’ll think I’m trying to look pretty. But I want to wear a dress. If I wear a suit maybe they’ll think I’m butch.’“It brought in an insecurity that only became easier when I met Toto. He said: ‘Be you. If that means wearing a dress, wear a dress. Being authentic is the easiest way to navigate the pathway.’”Susie Wolff kart-racing as a teenager, with the Scotland flag proudly displayed.Photograph: Courtesy of Susie WolffIn 2007, she endured a harrowing experience when, in the early hours of the morning after a glitzy function, an immensely powerful man in F1 banged on her hotel room door, demanding to see her. Wolff’s distress and fear, of being assaulted and of the man’s capacity to ruin her embryonic career, are detailed in the most searing pages of her book. “It was important to write about because many women have those situations where a split second can change everything. I was lucky he didn’t get in the room, but people should realise how frightening it is.”When she saw the man months later he apologised. But, Wolff says, “for a couple of years, I couldn’t tell anyone”.Toto was the first person she told. “We got together in 2009 and that’s the first time I opened up. [The man] could have damaged my career massively or he could have helped my career massively. I didn’t want either. I wanted to stand on my own two feet and because of the way I was brought up I would have fought him. But that’s also because I was toughened from so many years within that environment.”Does the man know she has written about that night? “I would think so, but I don’t know. I haven’t had any more contact.”View image in fullscreenThe F1 Academy is the all-female racing championship Wolff has been in charge of since 2023.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Formula 1/Getty ImagesShe became a test driver for Williams and before the opening race of the 2015 season seemed close to her F1 debut. Valtteri Bottas injured his back during qualifying and Wolff believed she would replace him, only to be devastated when Pat Symonds, the technical director at Williams, called in Adrian Sutil, who had no connection to the team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion“It was a real wake-up call,” Wolff says. “Pat said: ‘Adrian has the experience we need.’ It was a moment of absolute clarity. I remember thinking: ‘If you’re not going to give me the chance now, you never will.’ I said to Totoit would be my last season. It’s never going to be a reality, so let’s stop now.”If she had been given the opportunity would she have done well? “Do I think I could have jumped in and gone quicker than Felipe Massa [the No 1 driver at Williams]? No. Do I think I could have jumped in and been very respectable? Absolutely.”In 2023, when F1 Academy started,Wolff predicted there would be a female Formula One driver within 10 years. Does she still believe this? “I regret saying 10 years because one of my academy drivers might think I don’t believe in them. But I definitely think it will happen within the next 10 years. I see the talent coming through and there will be a girl good enough to be given the chance.”There are other battles to be won.Wolff continues to fight against the FIA after the governing bodysubjected her and Toto to a conflict-of-interest investigation in December 2023. An allegation was made to the FIA that confidential information had been shared between a team and the sport’s owner, Formula One Management. Susie reports to FOM as the head of F1 Academy, while Toto remains the team principal of Mercedes.The investigation didn’t take long, with the couple cleared and backed by the other team principals. “It was so absurd,” she says, “because I had zero to do with the F1 business. That infuriated me and then the case was dropped within 48 hours without anybody investigating anything.“The F1 teams all united, which they very rarely do, and issued a joint statement saying: ‘We have no issue with any conflict of interest and nobody had ever made a complaint.’ Suddenly the investigation was over and it was very difficult to get my head around it.”Wolff says herlegal case against the FIAcontinues in robust detail. “All these things take a lot of time, but it’s ongoing. That’s why I did it, even knowing it could take years. I wouldn’t have done it if I didn’t think it was worthwhile. So now it’s just about being patient.”Susie Wolff: ‘Getting a woman on the F1 grid is eight to 10 years away’Read moreToto Wolff told me last yearthat Red Bull’s Christian Horner had been the only principal who had been initially reluctant to sign the joint agreement supporting them. Was she hurt by Horner’s lack of support? “No. It was no surprise at all.”Was that because of Horner’s fractious relationship with Toto? “100%, yes. I don’t allow any of that to worry me. I hold myself to very high standards. I know how much the F1 Academy means and the positive impact it has on the sport. That’s why there will always be those that are for it, those that are against it.”Wolff praises Hamilton for his unstinting support of female drivers – with a commitment to equality she says is unmatched by anyone else on the F1 grid. But it’s almost time for Wolff to get back to the track to support her little boy.“These girls today are not just competing [in karting],” she says. “They’re racing for podiums. I overheard Jack a few months ago at the final of the Easykart World Championship and he was racing against this little girl, Greta. The boys were discussing who would make the podium.“One of them said: ‘Greta’s going to be really strong. She might win it.’ They all said: ‘Yeah, Greta.’ They speak about her as just another competitor, a potential winner of the race. There’s no: ‘Oh, Greta, the girl.’”A tangled smile spreads across Wolff’s face. “Twenty years ago I was ‘the girl’ and it was embarrassing if you got beaten by me. Whereas the next generation see these young girls are quick and that it’s completely normal to be racing them. The whole mindset has shifted and we now just need the talent pool to widen so that we have a 50‑50 split between boys and girls.”Driven, by Susie Wolff (Hodder & Stoughton, £25).To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

He also called for personal sanctions against his friend and former business partner Timur Mindich, the scheme’s alleged organiser.Acknowledging popular anger, Zelenskyy said: “There must be maximum integrity in the energy sector, in absolutely all processes. I support every investigation carried out by law enforcement and anti-corruption officials. This is an absolutely clear and consistent position for everyone.”Promising accountability for those who break the law, he added: “Right now, it is extremely difficult for everyone in Ukraine – enduring power outages, Russian strikes and losses. It is absolutely unacceptable that, amid all this, there are also some [corruption] schemes in the energy sector.”Ukrainian energy minister Hrynchuk resigns as corruption probe fallout continues – liveRead moreThe affair is turning into a major political crisis for the president. Anti-corruption activists, opposition politicians and army veterans have urged Zelenskyy to take decisive action, even if that means the painful sacking and jailing of people who are personally known to him.It follows a 15-month investigation by Ukraine’s national anti-corruption bureau (Nabu) into the nuclear state energy company Energoatom. The chief suspect, Mindich, is a businessman who co-founded Kvartal 95, Zelenskyy’s media production company.Mindichreportedly fled abroad, possibly to Israel, hours beforeinvestigators arrived at his Kyiv apartment to carry out a search. He was previously close to Zelenskyy, although sources say they have had little communication since Russia’s full-scale invasion.Nabu named Mindich as one of seven suspects involved in a $100m corruption scheme. Under this scheme, Energoatom’s counterparties were forced to pay kickbacks of 10-15% to avoid having payments for services blocked or losing their supplier status, the bureau said.Grynchuk and Haluschenko submitted their resignations on Wednesday. Both denied wrongdoing. The justice minister said his suspension from office was “appropriate” and vowed to defend himself, after one of his former advisers was directly implicated in the scandal.Earlier this week, Nabu released audio recordings of the alleged participants discussing bribes and using old-school code names. Haluschenko – Ukraine’s former energy minister – is given the moniker “Professor”. Mindich is referred to as “Karlson”.Another high-profile suspect isOleksiy Chernyshov, a former deputy prime minister already charged with abuse of office in a separate case. In a recording released on Tuesday, Chernyshov can allegedly be heard discussing a half-a-million-dollar cash payment, to be collected by his wife.Oleksandr Abakumov, the head of Nabu’s investigating team, said the scale of corruption was huge. “This isn’t a story about corruption in Ukraine. It’s about how the country is struggling with corruption, fighting with corruption,” he said, admitting that the agency’s investigation – called Operation Midas – had “faced a lot of obstacles”.Sevgil Musaieva, the editor of the Ukrainian Truth newspaper, which has extensively covered the revelations, said the affair risked becoming a turning point in Zelenskyy’s presidency. “In the short term, people need to see real accountability and action, not words,” she wrote on social media.She added: “Now, more than ever, the Ukrainian leadership has to prove that it reads the mood of the population well and acts accordingly. Minor changes here and there will no longer be enough to bridge the gulf of distrust.”The EU invited Ukraine to join the club, but will it ever happen?Read moreIn July Zelenskyyapproved a contentious billthat weakened the powers of Nabu and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office. It is unclear if the move was linked in any way to the Mindich case, but it quickly triggered the first serious protests against his government.Several thousand demonstratorsgathered outside the president’s office in Kyiv. They waved banners and shouted slogans including “shame” and “veto the law”, after parliament approved the measure. Zelenskyy backed down in the face of opposition and passed new legislation restoring the agencies’ independence.The same month, Ukraine’s security service arrested a prominent Nabu detective, Ruslan Magamedrasulov. He was charged with doing business with Russia and aiding an aggressor state. Magamedrasulov appeared before the appeal court inKyivon Wednesday, with his case adjourned. He remains in custody.The detective’s lawyer, Olena Scherban, said her client had been closely involved in the Energoatom investigation. “We believe this is a political case and political imprisonment,” she said.Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineKyivEnergy industryEuropeShareReuse this content"

The team behind the work said that uncovering the cause of lupus could revolutionise treatments.“We think it applies to 100% of lupus cases,” said Prof William Robinson, a professor of immunology and rheumatology at Stanford University and the study’s senior author. “I think it really sets the stage for a new generation of therapies that could fundamentally treat and thereby provide benefit to lupus patients.”Lupus, which affects about 69,000 people in the UK, is a chronic autoimmune condition in which the immune system creates antibodies that attack the body’s own tissues. The causes have not been well understood and there is no known cure for the condition, which can cause joint and muscle pain, extreme tiredness and skin rashes.Epidemiological surveys have previously hinted at a link between EBV and lupus, an idea that has gained traction after a recent breakthrough proving thelink between EBV and multiple sclerosis, another autoimmune disorder. The latest work helps uncover, at a cellular level, how EBV appears to cause lupus by sending the immune system into a tailspin.“This study resolves a decades-old mystery,” said Shady Younis, an immunologist at Stanford and first author of the paper.EBV is typically a mild illness which causes a sore throat, fever and tonsillitis. By adulthood, about 19 out of 20 people become infected and – since the virus deposits its genetic material into DNA – carry the dormant virus in their cells.Black people in England eight times more likely to be hospitalised with lupusRead more“The reason why this is so surprising is because this is a common virus that most of us get from our brother or sister at the kitchen table when we’re growing up, or if we haven’t, then when we kiss somebody else as a teenager,” said Robinson. “Practically the only way to not get EBV is to live in a bubble.”Among the cell types in which EBV takes up permanent residence are B cells, part of the immune system. These cells are specialised at binding to proteins on the surface of viruses, known as antigens. About 20% of B cells also have the potential to bind to parts of the body’s own cells, but in healthy individuals these “autoreactive” B cells remain largely inactive.The scientists first used high-precision genetic sequencing to uncover differences in the number and type of B cells that are infected in 11 lupus patients compared with 10 healthy controls.In the control group, fewer than 1 in 10,000 B cells hosted EBV, compared with about 1 in 400 cells for the lupus group – a 25-fold difference. EBV was also more likely to be found in autoreactive B cells.The presence of the dormant virus appeared to flip these cells into a hyperactive state in which they not only targeted antigens inside the body, but recruited other immune cells, including killer T-cells, to join the attack.“We think this is the critical discovery: that EBV … then activates those B cells to drive the autoimmune response that mediates lupus,” said Robinson.There are other well-known risk factors that feed into a person’s susceptibility, beyond EBV. For instance, lupus disproportionately affects women, which could be due to hormones such as oestrogen amplifying B-cell activity, Robinson said. People with an African, Caribbean or Asian background are also at a higher riskProf Guy Gorochov, a professor of medicine at the Sorbonne University said the work was “impressive”.“It’s not the final paper about lupus, but they’ve done a lot and developed an interesting concept,” he said.If confirmed, the findings would add impetus to clinical trials for an EBV vaccine, which are already under way. There are also several teams exploring repurposing cancer treatments designed to wipe out B cells for severe cases of lupus.The findings are published in the journalScience Translational Medicine.Explore more on these topicsImmunologyHealthMedical researchBiochemistry and molecular biologynewsShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, the government’s policy in such cases is discretionary. If you are not made a priority to them, you run the risk of being left behind.”The conference heard widespread disillusionment from hostage families that the UK had still not acted to marshal the resources of government to make the release of British nationals a true diplomatic priority, including by providing systematic advice and sustenance to families of those arbitrarily detained.Speaking at the conference, Joe Bennett, the son of Lindsay Foreman – currently held in an Iranian jail on spying charges – revealed that the Foreign Office had advised him not only not to go public about his mother’s capture, but also not to contact other families that had been in parallel crises. He reported that his mother felt let down, and was currently on hunger strike. He said he was willing to join her on the strike if it helped.“I think the biggest battle is fighting the government to get them to do something … which shouldn’t be the case,” he said. “It feels though at the moment that we’re at a bit of a stalemate. I think we as a nation and government should be taking that front foot and addressing it for what it is.”TheLabourmanifesto made a commitment to provide a right to a consular assistance in human rights cases, but no legislation has emerged.The previous foreign secretary David Lammy said before the summer that the appointment of an envoy would be made by the end of the year. But there are concerns that the envoy may not have access to the UK prime minister, or the powers given to the US envoy for hostages. A recent executive order has given the US president powers to designate a state as a hostage-taking state.Zaghari-Ratcliffe noted that after her case, the UK’s foreign affairs select committee had organised an inquiry examining how the government handled hostage situations. “It is a still-neglected policy area,” she said. “One of the recommendations was to establish a hostage envoy … The foreign secretary personally met with us to explain how important it was to him. However, the hostage envoy has not yet been established. There has been no improvement in the UK government approach to deal with hostage taking. It feels we are still in the denial phase.”Recounting her prison experience, she said: “I kept telling myself, surely my life meant a lot to many, if not to the states involved, so those many will help me out. I also thought, surely no government would take a woman and a baby hostage. That is just cruel. But I was wrong. The politics I was inadvertently stuck in between was ruthless and brutal.”Caoilfhionn Gallagher, a KC and a human rights barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said: “It’s something shocking when you hear what Nazanin said when she was paraded on stage at the Labour party conference before the election with the Labour government saying: we’re going to do things better. And now here we are a year and a half on, and I can tell you, as someone who’s worked in this field for 25 years, it doesn’t feel better. It doesn’t feel different. It feels like we’re having exactly the same fights.”Explore more on these topicsNazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeForeign policyIranLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It followsthe editing of a Trump speechin an edition of Panorama, which was a significant factor in the resignation of director general Tim Davie and Deborah Turness, its head of news.Reform UK pulls out of BBC film amid Trump speech edit rowRead moreBeyond a fresh apology, a critical question remains how far theBBCgoes in defending its reporting more generally in the US, given claims from Trump’s allies that it publishes “fake news” in relation to him.Its legal team has been drawing up its response to the complaint. It relates to an edition of Panorama broadcast last year, which spliced together clips of a Trump speech made on 6 January 2021. It has been accused of making it appear that he directly encouraged the US Capitol attack later that day.The spliced clip suggested that Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.” The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.The Guardian understands that givenan apology for the edithas been made by the BBC’s chair, Samir Shah, senior figures see no reason why a more personal apology cannot be made to the president in its official response to the legal threat. The corporation has concluded that the edit “gave the impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action”.People familiar with the discussions over how to respond also said the apology meant it could push back at any wider criticisms of its journalism of the US in relation to the coverage of Trump. A US congressional committee found that Trump failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol.Now that Trump has launched legal action, according to the White House on Wednesday, the BBC leadership faces an invidious choice over a public battle with the US president or making a payment that will be seen as politically toxic, given it is publicly funded through the licence fee.The BBC does have insurance covering legal challenges to its journalism. However, insiders acknowledge that there is always a pressure on legal costs should litigation stretch on for months.Trump has doubled down on his legal threat, stating he felt he had “an obligation” to sue the BBC. “I guess I have to,” he told Fox News. “They defrauded the public and they’ve admitted it. This is within one of our great allies, supposedly our great ally.”He added: “They showed me the results of how they butchered it up. It was very dishonest and the head man quit and a lot of the other people quit.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He left the role in the summer.There is anger within the BBC over the Trump edit.

At least one non-Indigenous man in the area was carrying a banner that read “Our forests are not for sale”. Others wore T-shirts saying “Juntos” (Together).California governor calls Trump ‘an invasive species’ at Cop30 climate talksRead moreThey waved banners and chanted until being forcibly removed. A UN climate spokesperson said two security guards received minor injuries, and there was minor damage to the venue.After the confrontation, the protesters left the venue and uniformed fire brigade officers formed a cordon to block the entrance.It is not yet clear who was responsible for the intrusion. But at least one observer was impressed: “At last, something has happened here,” said Juan Carlos Monterrey-Gómez, a Panamanian climate negotiator.Agustin Ocaña, from the Global Youth Coalition, told the Associated Press some of the people entering were chanting “they cannot decide for us without us,” referring to tensions over participation of Indigenous people in the conference.As security and marchers clashed, Ocaña said he saw protesters and security hitting each other with small plastic bins used to hold items near secure entrances. One guard was bleeding from being hit in the head, he said.Ocaña said some Indigenous communities had been frustrated watching resources pour into building “a whole new city” in Belém when spending was needed on education, health and forest protection elsewhere. “They were not doing this because they were bad people. They’re desperate, trying to protect their land, the [Amazon] river,” he said.The UN spokesperson said Brazilian and UN security personnel had taken “protective actions to secure the venue, following all established security protocols” and were investigating the incident. “The venue is full secured and Cop negotiations continue,” they said.Unlike the past three Cops, which were held in countries with varying degrees of authoritarian government, the Brazilian hosts are actively encouraging civil society and street demonstration to play a role in this conference.World must ‘honour 1.5C’, small island states insist at Cop30 summit – as it happenedRead moreIndigenous groups and NGOs have already been more visible inside and outside the venue, helping to balance out the armies of lobbyists that have dominated recent climate gatherings. A “people’s summit” will be held on Thursday and Friday and a global youth rally will take place on Friday, with the biggest demonstration scheduled for Saturday.Activists have been growing in number over the past week and are already organising up to four events a day, all of which had been peaceful, until now. On Tuesday, there were protests by a feminist collective, pro-Palestine supporters and a health-and-environment group.Many more activists will arrive tomorrow in a flotilla, estimated at about 100 vessels, led by two of the Amazon rainforest’s most respected Indigenous leaders, Raoni Metuktire and Davi Kopenawa Yanomami.Explore more on these topicsCop30BrazilClimate crisisIndigenous peoplesnewsShareReuse this content"

The IEA has predicted that global investment in datacentres will reach $580bn in 2025, surpassing the $540bn being spent on global oil supply.The rise in low-carbon electricity is expected to seal the transition away from the fossil fuel era, despite calls from the Trump administration to retreat from green investments in favour of drilling for oil and gas.David Tong, a campaigner at Oil Change International, said the IEA’s report had confirmed that “no single country can stop the energy transition”. He called on world leaders gathered at Belém in Brazil forthe UN’s Cop30 climate talksto reject “Donald Trump’s dystopian future” in favour of a “fast, fair, and funded fossil fuel phase-out”.The IEA’s findings are expected to embolden leaders who plan to use theCop30talks to push for progress on reaching the global target to triple renewable energy by 2030 and transition away from fossil fuels, agreed to at Cop28 in Dubai.The Paris-based agency has reportedly come under pressure from US Republicans to use its flagship report to present a more positive future for the fossil fuel industry than in previous forecasts. In response, the IEA reintroduced a scenario from previous reports that offers “a cautious perspective” on the speed of the energy transition.Dave Jones, the chief analyst of Ember, a thinktank, said this scenario’s assumptions appeared to underestimate the rollout of electric vehicles (EVs), leading to higher forecasts for the consumption of oil than in the IEA’s central scenario. However, a rapid expansion of renewables was “inevitable”, he added.“Renewables and electrification will dominate the future – and all fossil-importing nations will gain the most by embracing them,” he said.The IEA found that in all of the scenarios it modelled that renewables would grow faster than any other major energy source, led by a surge in cheap solar power across regions including the Middle East and Asia, which have abundant sunshine.Trump’s decision to pull support for the US renewable energy sector means that in the IEA’s central scenario the US will have about 30% less solar power by 2035 than forecast in last year’s report. But at a global level renewables will continue their “rapid expansion”, it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The evidence on the ground is overwhelming – EV sales are taking off in many emerging countries, solar is permeating even through the Middle East.“Fossil fuel importing countries are still reeling from the energy crisis and are trying to urgently reduce their reliance on expensive and insecure fossil fuels. The faster [transition] pathways offer a cheaper, more efficient and more secure energy system, while the slower pathways raise global temperatures and bloat energy demand with inefficient burning of fossil fuels.”Mariana Paoli, the head of advocacy for Christian Aid, said wealthy nations should use Cop30 to commit to ending fossil fuel investment and boosting climate finance.“The IEA’s report confirms what many climate-vulnerable communities have known for years: the fossil fuel era is ending but governments are still dragging their feet when it comes to building the clean energy systems that need to replace it. Oil and coal are peaking, renewables are surging, yet public money continues to flow into new fossil fuel projects that the IEA itself says we simply don’t need,” Paoli said.Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyEnergy industryCop30EnergyGreenhouse gas emissionsNuclear powerDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

There are otherpotential tipping points in the climate system– the die-off of coral reefs, the melting of ice sheets, the release of methane from warming tundra – that could drive faster heating and spell catastrophe.The world leaders – who included the UK’s Keir Starmer, the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen and Germany’s Friedrich Merz but not China’s Xi Jinping, India’s Narendra Modi and the famously climate-denying Donald Trump – have left behind their ministers and high-ranking officials in Belém, where more than 190 countries will spend the next two weeks arguing over how to salvage the 1.5C goal.The question is – can Cop30 actually succeed in doing so? As political and corporate forces push back against climate progress, the Guardian is devoted to reporting rooted in science and fact to expose the threats posed by the climate emergency.

But he’s a billionaire, so we can’t | George MonbiotIn focusView image in fullscreenPeople pose for photos outside the venue for the Cop30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil.Photograph: Fernando Llano/APFor many observers of past Cops, it can seem that nothing happens in these anonymous air-conditioned rooms where diplomats in suits spend a fortnight a year wrangling overobscure jargon, while outside the world grows dangerously hotter.So it’s useful to take stock, and ask what have Cops achieved, what they could achieve in future, and whether there may be a better way of solving the climate crisis.When the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) was signed in 1992, on a wave of optimism, it looked as if the world could pull together to tackle greenhouse gas emissions. But the climate turned out to be much harder to fix; the modern world was built on abundant and cheap fossil fuels, and almost everything in developed economies – food, transport, buildings, industry – has depended on them for 150 years. Wresting the world away from their grip would require big changes, both economic and social, and some countries – those with large fossil fuel resources – would lose out.Almost as soon as the UNFCCC was signed,vested corporate interestsand petrostates started to work against it. They cast doubt on the science; they lobbied governments; theyspread misinformation to the public; they pushed their products even more heavily, to embed them more deeply and make them indispensable. Many countries also failed to act with the urgency the problem required. When in 1997 countries signed the Kyoto protocol, which built on the UNFCCC by requiring rich countries to make relatively modest cuts to their greenhouse gas emissions but allowed the developing world to carry on using fossil fuels, it was opposed by large sections of the US, which failed to ratify it. The annual Cops continued but, in the real world, climate action stalled. Meanwhile, global greenhouse gas emissions rose year after year.That was the situation by the time of the Copenhagen Cop in 2009, when world’s nations came together again to try to replace the Kyoto protocol. Theypartially succeeded– there was a deal, in which developed countries committed to sharp emissions cuts, and for the first time developing countries agreed curbs to theirs – but it did not have legal force until the following year, and the conference was overshadowed by scenes of chaos and recriminations.At that time, the trajectory for global temperatures under “business as usual”was for a 6C riseabove preindustrial levels. That would spell an end to ice caps, make huge swathes of the planet uninhabitable and lead to massive die-offs of species.Nations tried again. At Paris, in 2015, theycrafted a more effective agreement– one that, for the first time, bound all countries to hold global temperatures within limits of “well below 2C”, while “pursuing efforts” to stay within 1.5C. At Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021, the more stringent limit of 1.5Cwas reaffirmed as the key target, as by then scientists hadproved that 2C was too dangerous.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

After Glasgow, the forecast was for about 2.8C – another improvement, but not enough. Today, with the national climate plans submitted before Cop30, the trajectory would lead us to about 2.5C. Cop30 is aiming to bring that down further, through an emphasis on real-world actions rather than future promises.With extreme weather taking a massive toll around the world, and the US turning back to fossil fuels under Donald Trump, it may not seem as if there is much good news in climate politics. But the world stands on what could be the brink of somepositive tipping points, as well as negative ones. Global investment in renewable energy now tops $2tn a year, twice that of fossil fuels. China’s emissions are stabilising and should fall soon, and the country is now the biggest user and exporter of renewable energy. Half of cars sold there are electric vehicles. Wind and solar energy are cheaper than fossil fuels in 90% of the world.If those trends can accelerate, it could be just possible for the world to limit the “overshoot” to 1.5C.Were Cops responsible for this good news? They played a big role. If not for the targets signed up to at successive Cops, most nations would probably have held back on policies to promote renewable energy, and companies would have carried on with fossil fuel investments. Cops are not perfect, but the progress made there does translate into real-world actions – it goes from negotiating rooms, to board rooms and into living rooms, as the UN climate chief, Simon Stiell, told me this summer.Ed Miliband warnedwhen I interviewed himin Belém last week that those who want to stymie climate action for their own narrow interests are the same ones who decry Cops as being useless. “They want people to despair. They want people to turn on the television and think, well, there they go again, talking about this issue where they’ve made no progress. Theirs is the agenda of nothing can be done,” said the UK energy minister. “That’s just wrong.”Cops are indeed tortuous and often tedious, though punctuated with moments of joy. But none of the many critics of Cops have yet come up with an alternative that would bring all countries together, the smallest and most vulnerable on equal terms with the richest and most powerful, to work on this most complex of global problems. Cops will not solve the climate crisis by themselves, but it looks unlikely that the problem can be solved without Cops.Read more:Q&A: what are the main issues at Cop30 and why do they matter?Rich countries have lost enthusiasm for tackling climate crisis, says Cop30 chiefThe temperature at Cop30: Trump’s absence better than a US wrecking ballTo read the complete version of this newsletter –subscribe to receive Down to Earthin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentDown to Earth newsletternewslettersShareReuse this content"

It will be their 13th since they began a campaign for “full pay restoration” in March 2023.Resident doctors’ salaries have risen by 28.9% over the last three years, but they want a further 26% over the next few years to make up for the erosion in the real-terms value of their pay since 2008.Streeting said it had “become increasingly clear that the BMA is no longer a professional voice for doctors. They are increasingly behaving in cartel-like behaviour, and they threaten not just the recovery of the NHS under this government, they threaten the future of the NHS, full stop. And I think that is a morally reprehensible position to be in.”He told the annual conference of the hospitals group NHS Providers: “You look at the state of the public finances and the sorts of choices we’re making, especially for the NHS. Let me tell you, when we ask some of the wealthier to pay more, some of the most effective lobbyists against paying higher tax are the BMA consultants’ committee and the BMA pensions committee. So what they effectively do is say: ‘We want other people to pay the higher salaries for doctors.’“And as much as, as a cancer survivor, I think my surgeon’s worth his weight in gold, we have to be honest and realistic about the challenges in the system, the challenges of public finances and the challenges facing every family, and it’s time for the BMA to get real.”Themost recent figuresshow that the average salary among doctors as a whole in England is £88,269, with consultants – senior medics – typically earning £127,540.Separate figuresshow resident doctors’ basic salaries before overtime range from £38,831 to £73,992.Streeting said the NHS’s 1.5 million-strong workforce included staff “many of whom have not had a pay rise anything like what resident doctors have had, and many of whom, at the height of their career earnings, will never earn as much as the lowest-paid doctor”.NHS trust leaders are hugely anxious about the disruption this week’s strike will cause to the speed and quality of the care they provide, especially with hospitals already busy with the unusually early arrival of flu.One trust chief executive warned that during a strike “you’re not as focused on treating everybody as well as you could … There is a risk that people will die who wouldn’t otherwise have come to harm.”The BMA has been approached for a response.Explore more on these topicsHealth policyWes StreetingPublic sector payNHSDoctorsIndustrial actionTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The investigation began in November 2023 after concerns were raised about the sexual exploitation of a teenage girl.They appeared before Judge Matthews at Bristol magistrates court on Wednesday. None of the seven entered pleas or made applications for bail. They were remanded into custody before an appearance at Bristol crown court on 17 December.The girls were in their mid- to late teens at the time of the alleged offences.Avon and Somerset police said the men were:Mohamed Arafe, 19, of Speedwell in Bristol. He has been charged with five counts of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child, one of causing or inciting the sexual exploitation of a child, one of sexual assault, one of being concerned in the supply of cocaine and a further count of being concerned in the supply of ecstasy.Sina Omari, 20, of Eastville in Bristol. He has been charged with two counts of rape, four counts of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child, one of causing or inciting the sexual exploitation of a child, two counts of making an indecent photograph of a child, one of being concerned in the supply of cocaine and a further count of being concerned in the supply of ecstasy.Wadie Sharaf, 21, of Westbury Park in Bristol. He has been charged with one count of rape, one of attempted rape, three counts of sexual assault and a further count of sexual activity with a child.Hussain Bashar, 19, of Southmead in Bristol. He has been charged with one count of rape.Mohammed Kurdi, 21, of Henbury in Bristol. He has been charged with two counts of rape, two counts of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child, one count of supplying ecstasy and a further count of supplying cannabis.Sardam Ahmed, 19, of no fixed address. He has been charged with four counts of rape, one of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child, one of distributing an indecent photograph of a child, one of being concerned in the supply of cocaine and a further count of being concerned in the supply of ecstasy.Ihab al-Eisawi, 22, of Fishponds, Bristol. He has been charged with two counts of rape and one of sexual assault.DCI Tom Herbert, the senior investigating officer in the case, said: “This remains a complex and sensitive investigation which has the protection of young girls from exploitation and the disruption of offending at its very heart.”Supt Deepak Kenth said: “Working with our partner agencies, we’ve held events in Bristol city centre and continue to work with hotels, taxi drivers and other businesses to raise awareness about the signs of exploitation and the need to report any concerns or issues to the police.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It followed an apology to the prime minister byLisa Nandy, the culture secretary, who had also received a donation from Kogan.In a letter to Magnus published by Downing Street on Wednesday, Starmer said the decision to appoint Kogan – a media executive whose career has included negotiating TV rights deals for the Premier League and the English Football League – as chair of the independent football regulator was, under law, a decision for Nandy.Given his interest in football, and the hospitality he has received from football clubs and the Football Association, Starmer wrote, he agreed with Magnus in autumn last year to recuse himself from decisions relating to the new regulator, saying he had abided by this.His letter read: “In April 2025 a note was submitted to me informing me that, after running the appointment process, the culture secretary wanted to appoint David Kogan as the inaugural chair of the Independent Football Regulator, subject to pre-appointment scrutiny by the select committee.Pressure grows on Starmer to sack chief of staff over briefing rowRead more“The note asked me whether I was content. I confirmed that I was supportive. I knew that the decision was for the secretary of state to take and I replied on the basis that the decision had been taken. In retrospect, it would have been better if I had not been given the note or confirmed that I was content with the appointment. This was an unfortunate error for which I express my sincere regret.”The letter set out how Kogan had donated to Starmer’s successful campaign to run for the Labour leadership in 2020, and had donated money to his constituency party.In response, Magnus said it was “regrettable” that Starmer had been asked to rubber stamp the appointment, but that he welcomed a review into why this had happened.Magnus went on: “I consider that the disclosures made in your letter are an important demonstration of your commitment to transparency and to ensuring that mistakes are acknowledged and necessary steps taken to improve processes underpinning standards in public life.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Usher said the policy was supposed to create an atmosphere “so unpleasant that they would never want to return”.Usher said there had been evidence that abuse was going on at Medomsley “from the day it opened its doors until the day those doors were closed”, adding that the “knowledge of abuse by the Prison Service, the police, the Home Office and other organisations of authority was ignored and dismissed”.View image in fullscreenMedomsley, in County Durham, held men and boys aged 17-21 who had been convicted of relatively minor crimes.Photograph: Elliot Michael/Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesHe said that based on evidence from the investigation, wardens at the centre were “either complicit or incompetent” when dealing with allegations of his crimes, with staff at the centre occasionally referring to inmates abused by him as “Husband’s wives”. When one staff member used this phrase openly, Husband beat him in front of a crowd of inmates and staff.It was also reported that during a routine inspection of the kitchen, which Usher described as “Husband’s domain”, evidence of abuse was found. Husband reacted angrily to this, and it is believed that no further inspections of the kitchen were conducted during his time there.Usher said: “It is very likely that his offending did not begin and end at Medomsley and extended to his previous employment at Portland borstal. There were allegations of abuse from when he worked at HMP Frankland and Deerbolt youth custody centre, and during his church and amateur dramatic activity.”He described Husband as a “powerfully built man and an arch-manipulator” who “physically intimidated, and in some cases assaulted, other members of staff as well as trainees”.Usher said Husband had told his victims he would make them “disappear” if they reported him, and that he took advantage of the isolated location of Medomsley, as the journey to the centre was “across many miles of bleak and barren moorland”, which would have “compounded in the minds of the trainees” how hopeless escape was.There’s a missing link in British public life – and it underpins crises from the BBC to our prisons | Rafael BehrRead moreThe report found that detainees and their families who did report physical and sexual abuse at Medomsley to Durham police were largely dismissed, with some threatened with rearrest if they pushed their claims. On two occasions when reports were recorded, they were simply passed on to Medomsley to investigate, which led to no consequences.Husband had entered the Prison Service in 1963, working at HMP Frankland until 1964, when he was transferred to Portland borstal.In 1969 he transferred to Medomsley, where he was in charge of the kitchens, a position he used in order to exert his influence. Usher said his “ability to provide or withdraw food gave him opportunities to punish and reward”. Of the 549 documented cases of abuse at Medomsley, 388 were committed by Husband, mostly without the involvement of others.Husband left Medomsley in 1985, returning to HMP Frankland to work as the senior baker before transferring to Deerbolt in 1987. Victim testimony indicates he continued to abuse inmates across both of these spells.Husband retired from the Prison Service in 1990 and was awarded the imperial service medal for meritorious duty. He began training as a minister in the Waddington Street United Reformed church and was officially inducted as one in June 1994.Husband spent the next few years largely unnoticed until 1999, when he was arrested as part of Operation Voice, a Metropolitan police-led UK-wide investigation into the distribution of child sexual abuse materials.Husband was arrested, charged and suspended from his ministerial roles in the church. However, the case was later dismissed at court and he was reinstated as a minister in June 2000.Investigations into him began in 2002, and in 2003 he was convicted of 10 counts of indecent assault and one count of rape against five teenagers at Medomsley, initially being sentenced to eight years in prison.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The true horror of Husband’s crimes became apparent around this time.David Greenwood, a lawyer who has represented many Medomsley victims since 2001, described the latest report as “a milestone along the road to exposing the shocking facts of detention centres and borstals around the country” but said that it left “many unanswered questions”.He called for a public inquiry that would look into “the scale of state-sponsored violence against detainees, the missed opportunities to stop it, and its consequences for a generation of boys”.Usher dismissed the need for such an inquiry but believed that the victims had been failed by many levels of authority, saying that “the state fed these young men into an abusive system” that had “ruined lives”. He said that for many young men “a short sentence had become a life sentence”.John McCabe, ex-detainee: ‘I didn’t think I’d get out of Medomsley alive’“I was sent to Medomsley for nine months for robbing a jewellery shop on 19 February 1983. I was raped by Neville Husband at Medomsley, and out of Medomsley in a church and at the local amateur dramatics society by Husband and one other man. I didn’t think I’d get out of Medomsley alive. I eventually tracked down the other man, and he was arrested by the police but never charged because they couldn’t get any of the other boys to corroborate him. Isn’t it enough to charge someone for repeatedly raping one boy?“This is no different from any of the other investigations. It’s essentially the police and Ministry of Justice investigating themselves. We have always needed a public inquiry and we still do. Halfway through the special investigation they put out one line saying anybody who was around the area where Medomsley detention centre was in the 70s and 80s is welcome to come down to the local arts centre for a chat and a cup of tea. That’s the kind of investigation it is.“There are governors who are still alive who have never been held to account. From what I have heard they weren’t even interviewed for the PPO’s report. I was told one of them, who was a friend of Husband’s, said he had Alzheimer’s. Well, if he had been doing his job when he was governor I would never have met Husband and my life wouldn’t have been destroyed.”Steve (not his real name), ex-detainee:‘I’m 65, it’s too late for me to move on’“I was sent to Medomsley for three months in June 1979 for stealing a jacket from a car. I was sexually abused multiple times by Neville Husband in the detention centre and at his house.“I think this special investigation is a sop. It is an investigation without any powers. There should have been some compulsion to give evidence instead of just saying: ‘Oh come and tell us what you know!’ because they just won’t come.“The report basically tells us what we know already. In fact most of the things we told them. This is just people telling instances of what happened to them. It’s not a public inquiry, [where] they can order people to come forward instead of asking. At a public inquiry witnesses are on oath so if they lie they can get done for perjury.“I’m 65, it’s too late for me to move on. The PPO recommends those in authority at the time apologise to us. Well, saying sorry to us now would sound hollow. If they said it now it would mean nothing.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationCounty DurhamCrimeChild protectionChildrenUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

According to the UN, 260 attacks took place in October, the deadliest month for settler violence since it started keeping track in 2006.Human rights groups and the UN have warned that settler violence is taking place in a “permissive environment” and with the backing of key Israeli ministers. TheUN human rights officesaid settlers were seeking to “accelerate displacement of Palestinians from their land, raising concerns of forcible transfer”.In a rare statement on Wednesday, the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, condemned the latest attacks, saying the “shocking and serious” incident had been carried out by a “handful” of perpetrators. He called for authorities to “act decisively to eradicate the phenomenon and to strengthen the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] fighters and security forces who protect us day and night”.His remarks were echoed by the top Israeli military official in the West Bank, Maj Gen Avi Bluth, who called the violence “unacceptable”.The statements were unusual for Israeli officials, who have largely ignored settler violence against Palestinians over the past two years even as it has grown more widespread. The Israeli military and government officials have rarely addressed the settler movement’s growing violence against Palestinians, despite its contravention of Israeli and international law.Bluth said it was only “by sheer luck” that violent incidents had not “resulted in fatalities”, despite the fact that settler and police violence has resulted in more than 1,000 Palestinian deaths over the past two years. Asked for clarification, the Israeli military said it was “checking” the comments.‘Olives are everything for us’: West Bank farmers prevented from harvesting by settler violenceRead moreIsraeli settler violence has moved into the mainstream of Israel’s political scene, particularly in the past two years. The Israeli Knesset often hosts settlers to weigh in on policymaking. Israeli police and armed forces are regularly filmed standing by as settlers carry out acts of violence against Palestinians, intervening only if Palestinians fight back.The Israeli army said soldiers had responded to Tuesday’s settler attacks, causing the settlers to flee to a nearby industrial zone, where they attacked soldiers and damaged a military vehicle.The police also said they had arrested four settlers involved in the attacks, a rarity as settlers generally go unpunished in what human rights bodies call a system of impunity.In July, Yinon Levi, a settler formerly under US sanctions, was caught on video shooting to death the Palestinian activist Awdah Hathaleen. He was briefly arrested and then released by Israeli authorities.Human rights groups have accused the Israeli government of standing by as settlers carry out widespread attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. They point to the far-right makeup of the current Israeli government, including the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, and the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, both of whom are prominent leaders in the Israeli settler movement.As attacks against Palestinians have increased, Ben-Gvir has helped loosen gun regulations and establish “civilian guard units”, which activists have warned could exacerbate the rising violence.The increase in attacks by settlers has led to international outcry. Last month, a video of an Israeli settlerclubbing a woman in the head– causing her to fall unconscious – triggered a wave of condemnations.In October the UN human rights officeaccused Israeli authoritiesof investigating violence against Palestinians in the West Bank only “in extremely rare cases”.“In these few cases, there appears to have been no progress, maintaining the almost complete impunity for the use of unlawful force and the unlawful killing of Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,” the UN said in a statement.In Beit Lid, one of the two villages attacked on Tuesday, government statements did little to calm the fear of settler violence.“At any moment something could happen … This can’t go on. It can’t be that we keep living our whole lives in a state of fear and danger,” said Mahmoud Edeis, a resident of the village.Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Sansal, 81, suffers from prostate cancer.A vocal critic of the Algerian regime, Sansal was arrested at Algiers airport in November last year and sentenced to five years in prison in March, on charges of undermining national unity. His arrest came shortly after commenting in an interview thatFrancehad unfairly ceded Moroccan territory to Algeria during the colonial era.Relations between Paris and Algiers have deteriorated sharply since Macron backedMoroccan sovereignty over the Western Saharain 2024, and there have been suggestions that the writer was being held a political hostage due to deteriorating relations between the two countries.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, went as far as saying that Algeria was “dishonouring” itself in imprisoning the writer.By releasing Sansal to Germany, the Algerian government has found a way out of the diplomatic standoff with its former coloniser without losing political face. Tebboune himself was treated at a hospital in Germany after falling ill with Covid-19 in 2020.On Monday, Steinmeier said that pardoning Sansal would be “an expression of humanitarian sentiment and political foresight”, that would reflect his “years-long personal relationship to president Tebboune and the good relations between our countries”.Over the past few months several international authors, including Salman Rushdie, Annie Ernaux and Wole Soyinka, had appealed for the Algeria-born author’s release.Explore more on these topicsAlgeriaWestern SaharaFranceGermanyAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He won a prestigious Nieman fellowship at Harvard University in 2006 and has been a visiting scholar at two Japanese universities.The Nieman Foundation has described Dong as a “cherished member” of the international Nieman community and called for his release.Dong wasarrested in February 2022in Beijing while having lunch with aJapanese diplomat. The diplomat was also detained but released after a few hours. Dong has been in custody since and was charged with spying in April 2023.Dong was convicted in November 2024 andsentenced to seven years. He appealed against his conviction the following month.Under Chinese law, someone convicted of espionage can be jailed for three to 10 years for less severe cases or receive heavy punishment, including life imprisonment, in serious cases.Dong’s indictment mentioned several senior Japanese diplomats who do not appear to have been expelled fromChinadespite being involved with Dong’s alleged espionage ring. Dong’s family said that this was evidence of his innocence.Dong Yifu, his son, said: “It’s pretty obvious there is no legal argument to uphold the verdict … there’s really no evidence.”He said the case against his father was “basically saying Chinese people can be penalised very severely for just interacting and talking to foreigners. And it’s also sending a message to the world that any foreigners in China can be labelled a spy for the purpose of prosecuting the Chinese citizens that they interact with.”Dong Yifu continued: “So these are just terrible messages that the Chinese government is sending through my father’s case.”Ian Johnson, a writer and friend of Dong’s, said the Chinese journalist “represents a time when Chinese people were encouraged to go out and participate in the outside world. He went on fellowships and reporting trips abroad. All of this is being held against him and used as proof of his ‘spying’. His incarceration shows that China’s reform era is really over.”Dong is known in Chinese media circles for his reporting on social issues, corruption and constitutional reform, and was considered to be a rare independent voice in China’s tightly controlled media landscape. In 2017, he was threatened with a demotion after a Chinese Communist party investigation deemed his writing “anti-socialist”.Beh Lih Yi, the Asia Pacific regional director of theCommittee to Protect Journalists, said Dong’s imprisonment “creates a chilling effect designed to stop or prevent any Chinese from speaking with foreigners because they can be easily accused of engaging in espionage activities. We urge the Chinese government to right this wrong, and that it will do them more good to release Mr Dong immediately rather than keeping him in prison.”The Committee to Protect Journalists will honour Dong with an International Press Freedom award at a ceremony in New York on 20 November.A Chinese government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsChinaPress freedomHuman rightsJournalist safetyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

By Wednesday the number of dead had risen to 12 after several people died from their injuries, while more than 30 others were wounded. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Delhi for more than a decade.The cabinet statement on Wednesday night condemned what it called a “dastardly and cowardly act that has led to the loss of innocent lives”.The national investigation agency, India’s anti-terrorism squad, was handling the investigation and police filed a case under the country’s anti-terror law. Declaring the case a terrorism incident gives investigators expansive powers to carry out raids and arrests.The cabinet statement did not give any further details on the nature of the terrorism behind the attack. However, earlier in the day police confirmed they had detained five people in the Pulwama district of the disputed region of Kashmir in connection with the attack.‘People were screaming for help’: Delhi car blast witnesses describe scenes of horrorRead moreThough the link was not directly made by police, it came after they claimed to have uncovered an “interstate and transnational terror” cell allegedly connected to the Islamist group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) operating in a state neighbouring Delhi.The Pakistan-based insurgent group is primarily active in India-administered Kashmir, a region that has been disputed between India and Pakistan since their formation in 1947.Police said they uncovered 2,900kg of explosives materials as well as chemicals, detonators and guns in raids early on Monday morning. At least seven people, including two Kashmiri doctors, were arrested as part of the terror cell raids.Several sources briefing India media said investigators were seeking to determine whether the driver of the car that caused the Delhi explosion was part of the same terror cell, and whether Monday night’s attack was a panicked response to the arrests and raids.The Red Fort explosion is the first terror incident in India since anattack in Aprilwhen gunmen singled out more than 20 Hindu tourists and shot them dead. India blamed Pakistan for masterminding the attack and in May retaliated with cross-border missiles that it said targeted camps and JeM hideouts.Pakistan denied any involvement in the April attack. It hit back with missile and drone strikes, bringing the two nuclear-armed countries the closest they had been to war in decades, before a US-led ceasefire stopped hostilities. In the aftermath, India repeatedly vowed that any further act of terror on Indian soil would be seen as an act of war.With relations already at historic lows, India’s confirmation of the Red Fort blast as a terrorism incident risks pushing the two countries back towards full hostilities that could further destabilise the region. After the Red Fort blast, the Modi cabinet reiterated that it would take a policy of “zero tolerance towards terrorism in all its forms”.The day after the explosion, a suicide bomber targeted a court complex in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, killing 12 people. The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack but the country’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, claimed “Indian state terrorism” was behind the blast.On Tuesday, India’s home minister, Amit Shah, said he had instructed senior officials to “hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”. “Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,” he said.Explore more on these topicsIndiaDelhiSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Similarly, other celebrity-backed brands have also drawn venture capital investment, as firms bet on the marketing power and built-in audiences of high-profile founders to drive consumer demand.Elf Beauty agreed to buy Hailey Bieber’s makeup and skincare brand, Rhode, for about $1bn earlier this year, while Rihanna-backed Fenty Beauty and Khloé Kardashian’s Good American have also drawn venture capital funding.Skims said it plans to use the new capital to broaden its intimates and shapewear lines, expand further into apparel and activewear and enhance its retail presence and international growth.“We can’t wait to take Skims to the next level as we continue to innovate and set the standard for our industry,” Kardashian, who serves as chief creative officer, said in Wednesday’s press release.“This milestone reflects continued confidence in our long-term vision and coupled with disciplined execution, positions Skims to unlock its next phase of growth,” Grede said in a statement.Skims, founded in 2019, said it was on track to exceed $1bn in net sales in 2025. Earlier this year, Coty sold a 20% stake in Kardashian’s beauty brand to Skims, consolidating the two businesses under a single brand.The company, known for its focus on inclusive sizing, now operates 18 retail stores in the US and two franchise locations in Mexico. Skims said it was laying the groundwork to be a predominantly physical business over the next few years.The company has also forged a partnership with sportswear giant Nike to launch activewear for women.After the latest fundraising, Skims is now larger than its competitors, Victoria’s Secret and Under Armour, combined. Victoria’s Secret has a market capitalization of $2.86bn, and Under Armor is worth $1.98bn.The latest fundraising in the apparel company was led by investment giant Goldman Sachs Alternatives with participation from BDT & MSD Partners’ affiliated funds.Jens has said that Skims“deserves”to be a public company. But in aninterview with WWDlate last year he suggested that plans for a sale were not imminent. “We might make that position in the future, but that’s not what I’m thinking about,” he said.After the latest fundraising, Kardashian, 45, is now worth $1.9bn,according to Forbes, with the deal adding $200m to her fortune.Explore more on these topicsKim KardashiannewsShareReuse this content"

However, it said that for the year to date, sales are only slightly down on 2024, an average rate per site of 0.72 compared with 0.73.In August, it was reported that Treasury officials had been considering anew tax on the sale of homes worth more than £500,000, although it is not yet clear whether the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will choose to implement it.Nationwide reported aslowing in house price growthlast month, with analysts suggesting that buyers were “sitting on the sidelines” before a budget that may bring new property taxes.However, last week Halifax reported a different picture, suggesting that UK house prices in October hadrisen at their fastest pace since January,with demand bouncing back from a September trough despite the budget uncertainty.Taylor Wimpey also said that while it expected underlying pricing to remain “broadly flat”, building costs were expected to continue to rise at a low single-digit percentage rate.Anthony Codling, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that the softening in the market had “all but cancelled the autumn selling season”.“It is clear that the UK housing market has softened in the second half as budget uncertainty has been growing since the summer,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This group is behind £1 in every £3 spent on toys in the UK.Almost half of adults (43%) have bought a toy for themselves or another adult this year – a figure that rises to 76% among gen Z (aged 18 to 28) shoppers, according to figures from the data company Circana.After several difficult years, encouragingly, data from January to the end of June showed that toys for children grew 6%, the strongest performance in years.The 26 best UK Christmas gifts for 13-year-olds – chosen by 13-year-oldsRead more“It’s a double success story,” said Melissa Symonds, the UK toys director at Circana. “We’re seeing children rediscover the joy of play while adults are embracing it as a form of self-care, nostalgia and fandom. That combination is keeping the market vibrant and relevant.”Given the recent strong run, gift retailers were feeling optimistic about the all-important Christmas period but there is now concern thattax rises in the autumn budgetcould hit spending.However, Symonds argued the toy market was different: “Toys don’t always follow the general economic trends because they are part of the joy economy.”Toys are also relatively affordable, she said. Last December, the average selling price for a toy was £13.43, with the £10-20 range accounting for a third of sales.Paul Reader, the chair of the DreamToys selection panel at the Toy Retailers Association, said it had been an “incredible” year for the sector. “We are in seriously positive territory … and optimistic that the momentum is going to follow into Christmas.”“There is a strong sense that we are going to have less disposable income coming out of the budget,” he said, adding that the list could help consumers “make informed decisions about what we believe are the best toys this Christmas”.People were starting to think about how much they would spend and it was “too early” to tell what impact the budget would have. “The magic of Christmas is always going to be there and parents and grandparents all work hard to make sure it is enjoyable for the whole family,” said Reader.The cheapest toy on the DreamToys list is a £13 Dress to Impress doll spun out of the hit fashion game on Roblox. The most expensive is a £120 Lego ship inspired by theJapanese anime series One Piece.View image in fullscreenA new Lego collaboration with hit Japanese manga One Piece will let fans build the Going Merry Pirate Ship at home.Photograph: James Manning/PAWith thehighly anticipated sequelout next week, there is expected to be feverish demand for all things Wicked including the £35 singing Elphaba and Glinda dolls that make the list.Characters from film and TV loom large. There is a £30 interactive Evie Pig (baby sister to Peppa) and an £80Stitchsoft toy that has 100 sounds and reactions.One of the most unusual entries is the £20 Fill the Fridge playset. However, it ticks two boxes: it taps into the viral “fridge restocking” trend as well as the popularity of collectibles that make up just over a fifth of all toys sold.DreamToys list 2025Dress to Impress Mystery Model Dolls – £12.99Gui Gui Shimmer deluxe pack – £19.99Hot Wheels Racing F1 Grand Prix circuit – £79.99Human Controller – £34.99Jurassic World Primal Hatch T-Rex – £64.99Marshmallow Madness – £19.99Fill the Fridge playset – £19.99Monster Jam Smash & Bash Grave Digger – £49.99Lego One Piece: the Going Merry Pirate Ship – £119.99Peppa Pig Oinks & Snuggles Evie doll – £29.99Pokémon Trading Card: Mega EvolutionElite Trainer Box – £54.99Lego Speed Champions F1® racing cars – £22.99Sticki Rolls Sticki Rolluxe – £39.99Disney Ultimate Stitch interactive plush – £79.99Wicked: For Good singing dolls – £34.99Explore more on these topicsRetail industryToysChristmasnewsShareReuse this content"

Why?Sarah DempsterWed 12 Nov 2025 17.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 17.02 ESTShare‘Irish dancing was completely different back in the day,” sighs veteran dance impresario Carole Scanlon, flipping wistfully through photos of tremulous adolescents clutching trophies in poorly lit community centres. A montage of grainy news reports backs her up: girls prancing in capes to a cassette backing of Ireland’s gravest fiddles; boys in middle-management waistcoats skipping across tiny stages; porridge-faced judges surveying it all in cufflinks and kipper ties.“Back in the day” is a phrase that pops up frequently in Battle of the Irish Dancers, a three-part docuseries that follows a handful of eager young hoofers as they prepare for the annual World Irish Dancing Championships. The phrase refers, broadly, to the era before Riverdance, the global sensation that launched in the year of our Flatley 1994. The impact of the stage-based extravaganza on the trajectory of Irish dancing cannot be overstated. “It blew everything into a whole different ballgame,” says tutor and former Riverdancer Kelly Hendry, as we watch footage of Michael “Feet of Flames” Flatley’s ankles blowing a century of tradition into a whole different cocked fedora. And now? “It’s the wigs,” says Kelly. “They’ve taken over. Look.” We look. It’s the wigs, we think. They’ve taken over. Footage of Kelly’s pupils rehearsing for a “feis” (dance contest) reveals the extent of the hairy coup. Gone are the home perms of yesteryear. In their place are vertiginous turrets of synthetic curls; each wig an immobile tower bedecked with a Hobbycraft’s worth of spangly whatsits and diamante doodahs. They’re a “practical solution” says Kelly, allowing wig-ees such as 14-year-old best friends Maria and Saoirse to whirl, kick and clomp without being distracted by their own hair’s attempts to escape its moorings and sabotage their hornpipes. It works remarkably well, too, with the spray-tanned proteges seemingly oblivious to the horrors hovering above their scalps.Watching Battle of the Irish Dancers’ cavalcade of wigs and tights reveals a curious truth; Irish dancers look more 80s today than they did in the 80s. It’s the combination of sequins and fixed grins.View image in fullscreenDancing in the streets.What does Flatley think of all this, we wonder? Does His sateen blouse ever ripple with regret when He looks upon what He hath wrought? No idea. Other than the odd vintage clip from Lord of the Dance, the patron saint of modern Irish dancing receives nary a mention. Nor does the wider history of the dance get much of a look-in or, indeed, any facts or statistics that might offer an insight into its continuing evolution or global popularity. Instead, Battle of the Irish Dancers busies itself with the progress of its four young subjects and their teachers. The boggling footwork of Maria and Saoirse has earned Newcastle’s Kelly Hendry School of Irish Dancing a teetering shelf of trophies (“How does dancing make me feel?” muses Maria as she applies her third – fourth? – layer of eyeliner. “Undescribable”). In Birmingham we meet cheery 17-year-old Lauren, whose success at a pivotal feis sees a brief thawing of Carole’s wintry approach to coaching (“Good girl. You’re off the hook. FOR NOW”). In Dublin, meanwhile, we meet multi-award-winning Owen, who, at 26, is limbering up for his third and final world championship.What else? Not much, really. It all trundles along at a pleasant-enough pace and everyone involved seems nice. Maria? Nice. Kelly? Nice. Carole? Terrifying, obviously, but still; nice. Then there is the dancing. Oh, the dancing.This, we think, as we watch Owen’s clogs whisk themselves into a buckled blur, is essentially yodelling for feet: a majestic, preposterous lower-body hysteria that should surely be accompanied by its own laughter track.It’s magnificent, gasp-inducing stuff. And yet the series seems intent on showing us only fleeting glimpses of the dancers’ routines, preferring to suddenly make everything speed up for no reason, or go all slow and woozy, or cut to another shot of Carole tutting as she makes herself a cup of tea.Frustrating? Undescribably so.Still: we’ll always have the wigs.Battle of The Irish Dancers aired on Sky One and is on Now.Explore more on these topicsDanceTV reviewTelevisionMichael FlatleyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jeff Mermelstein’s best photograph‘This image gave me a jolt: his poker face, his grip on the bottle of window cleaner – and the boulder that might be a meteor that struck the flowerbed’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 12 Nov 2025 09.38 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 12.52 ESTShareImade this image, Man with Windex, in New York City, in 1996. I was, and remain, obsessed with making photographs on the streets of New York. At that time, I was using a Leica Rangefinder with colour negative film because of its malleability and ease. One of the beautiful things about the Leica is its stealth qualities – it is quiet and small, though for me right now the iPhone is my camera.I am the son of Holocaust survivors and grew up in suburban central New Jersey, moving to New York in 1979 when I was in my early 20s – which was like landing on Mars. This picture is part of my series and book Sidewalk, made between 1987 and 1999. I would walk the streets of Manhattan daily, ready for surprises. Out on the street you need calm alertness. Pictures that remain strongest for me have a sense of ambiguity, maybe that extra-rare quality of mystery, and that would give me a feeling of euphoria.My wanderings that day took me near 50th Street and Sixth Avenue, a part of midtown that is chock-full of possibilities. There was this man in a suit and tie, with a cigarette in one hand and the other clenching a spray bottle of Windex. It was only when I saw the actual negative on a light box with a loupe magnifier that I felt an immediate jolt, a buzz of wonder. There were the ingredients I hope for: the ambiguity and the mystery. The tension of his grip on the Windex bottle, a poker face expression, the assumption he may be a janitor despite being dressed in a suit. Also, he seems unaware of me. There are wilted daffodil flowers, a boulder that might be a meteor that struck the flowerbed.Now, after 30 years, looking at it I see the sewer cover for the first time; maybe everything will go down it in the end. This picture has that precious, memorable quality, it has survived and still makes me think. That is a gift.Something has to be out there in the real world – but it’s the anti-moments I’m interested inMemorability is a key ingredient – this was taken a long time ago but survived, which is rare when you take pictures at the rate I do, and I’ve been doing this a long time. That is part of the work as a street photographer. But you also need the state of mind to leave your house first of all, which when you get older is a big step. Something has to be out there in the real world – but it’s the anti-moments I’m interested in. Then I wrap it up with a bow, with the composition and colour. The use of colour is important – I’m not saying colour is harder, but I think it is different to black and white, it’s an additional ball to juggle. My personal interest in colour comes from my interest in realism, it’s not so much about the play of colour – though in this picture the colour interactions are good.Sidewalk was the result of winning the European Publishers award for Photography in 1999. It was a flattering and exhilarating prize to have won. I’m over-the-top excited about my new book,What if Jeff Were a Butterfly, which includes a great range of material subject-wise, a wild concoction of almost random images, put together in poetic and surprising ways, that has messed up my head in a good way.In recent years, I have been making lots of videos. I don’t walk around with a particular notion in my mind, but I want to contribute somehow to capturing the human condition in any given moment in time – that’s the challenge. I think it’s a privilege to have found something I love, and I remain as crazy about photography now as I was 50 years ago.View image in fullscreenJeff Mermelstein’s CVBorn:1957, New Brunswick, New JerseyHigh Point:“When the Museum of Modern Art in New York acquired 21 prints from my series #nyc for its permanent collection.”Top tip:“Truly believe that all that matters is the work you create, strive to put your singular self into that work and understand that rejection is meaningless.”What if Jeff were a Butterfly by Jeff Mermelstein is published byVoid.Explore more on these topicsArt and designMy best shotPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At least let’s hope lots of people get to see this, even if it’s a mistake because they meant to buy a ticket forPredator: Badlands. Instead of an alien hunter with gnarly teeth, this offers a profoundly troubling meditation on our collective thirst for revenge – or at least the kind of bizarre performance art version of revenge as served up byreality TV show To Catch a Predator, a US series that ran from 2004 to 2007 and which featured weekly footage of paedophiles and would-be paedophiles being duped, shamed and arrested.‘Abject horror’: the troubling history of paedophile-hunting TV showsRead morePredators’ director David Osit, at first just an offscreen voice but eventually a fully seen (in every sense) presence, explains that he used to watch To Catch a Predator avidly as a young man. Every episode was roughly the same: a man is observed arriving at a suburban house, expecting to have sex there with a teenaged girl or boy who is in fact a hired actor who has lured the target over. Then journalist Chris Hansen would step out from behind a doorway to confront the target with transcripts of interactions he had been having with the decoy. The target would then usually start crying and pleading for mercy;and then, in a final theatrical act of cruelty, he’d be told he was free to go only to be arrested seconds later by waiting law enforcement officers working with the show.At the time, Jimmy Kimmel, still just starting out as a chat show host, gleefully described To Catch a Predator as “the funniest thing on television”, likening it to prank programme Punk’d “but for paedophiles”. But no matter how how repellent the “victims” are, nothing about the show or situation seems funny now, especially when we learn about a suspect who killed himself when the cops arrived.How does the punitive, ritualised humiliation of To Catch a Predator, or any of the many gonzo made-for-YouTube knockoffs, like the one we see being filmed here, help stop child abuse or change anyone’s life for the better? No one wants to think about how to break these cycles of abuse; instead we’re all trapped a veritable hall of mirrored cruelties in which predators are targeted by morally indignant predators armed with cameras who are in turn filmed by quasi-predatory documentarians.

It’s a grittyNew Yorksleazesploitation crime thriller with some gobsmackingly over-the-top punch-ups and shootouts; some of the attitudes to ethnicity and sexual politics can only be described as of their time. Those who prefer 21st-century standards of good taste had better look away now.A racist paedophile (Cliff Gorman) has kidnapped the 15-year-old daughter of divorced ex-cop Sean Boyd, played by James Brolin. This sweaty creep is demanding a million-dollar ransom, but he’s got the wrong girl. He thinks that his prisoner – whom he dresses up in a diaphanous blue gown belonging to his dead mom, and at one point kisses tenderly on the lips – is the daughter of a property magnate that he blames for moving so-called undesirables into his Bronx apartment building, with a view to forcing out existing tenants so he can knock the whole thing down for a new development. (We glimpse a New York Daily News headline:“Carter Tours The S Bronx Slums”.)So Boyd has to track down this loathsome perv to save his daughter – while Boyd himself is also being hunted down by a corrupt cop who he once exposed. This is the pop-eyed Sgt Barnes, played by Dan Hedaya, who fires at Boyd in the city street with a shotgun, causing window-shattering chaos, but because he’s a cop doesn’t seem to get into any trouble. There is a hilarious and outrageous smutty sequence when Boyd has to question sex-workers in their peep-show booths; a creative way of getting nudity into the film. You can’t help but gasp at the full-tilt craziness on display, and connoisseurs will enjoy the hothead cab driver in the chase scene, played by a young Mandy Patinkin.Night of the Juggler is in UK cinemas from 14 Nov, and on 4K UHD from 17 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsNew YorkreviewsShareReuse this content"

She is trapped in a bleak job, in a bleak relationship and in a bleak house. The bleakest element of this trifecta of bleakness is the relationship: she is involved with the utterly unlovely Frank (Shane McCormick) who, as one character observes, is the sort of guy who throws his entire life away then lashes out in every direction, blaming everyone but himself for how things have turned out. It’s hard to fathom why she stays with someone so awful – except, well, that’s the way the world works sometimes. Their dynamic is an abusive one, and in modern therapeutic parlance, they share the trauma bond of unstable, abusive childhoods. It’s not that Raye doesn’t know Frank’s no good; it’s that she doesn’t believe she deserves better, or that better exists.While Trapped’s poster art promises some sort of Captivity-style torture porn slasher horror, it may be interesting to know that the film was originally called Beneath the Silence, a title that gestures towards more serious dramatic aspirations. In fact, Trapped’s understanding of abuse is considerably more sophisticated than the rest of what it offers. It is a low-budget affair that, at times, has a rough-and-ready raw power that transcends its limited production values, but too often the standard of performance and crudeness of the craft makes it hard to take seriously. The script is littered with exposition – for example, a half-brother reminds his sibling that they have “different mums”, a fact that would perhaps be very well known to the characters; it’s clearly there for the benefit of the audience.The largely on-the-nose dialogue does provide occasional moments of joy: at one point, someone stands up at a funeral and says: “He was a cunt and everyone in this room knows it.” Any movie with that in it is doing something right, even if what it’s doing is, effectively, a post-watershed and feature-length episode of EastEnders.Trapped is on digital platforms from 17 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

A billion true-crime documentaries have since revealed that actual serial killers are very boring, with nothing like Anthony Hopkins’s screen presence.He was hardly an unknown when he got that Oscar-winning part in The Silence of the Lambs in 1989: a star wasn’t born, but rather a megastar, a legend. His Dr Lecter was based, Hopkins cheerfully recalls in this new autobiography, on Bela Lugosi’s Dracula, on Stalin as recalled by his daughter, and on his own icily exacting, gimlet-eyed Rada tutor Christopher Fettes. There was a father-daughter dimension to these scenes as well; a painful subject for Hopkins, who also describes how his Lear was subconsciously influenced by an agonised guilt about Abigail, the estranged daughter from his disastrous first marriage in 1966 to Petronella Barker, who resented his absences and drinking.View image in fullscreenHopkins in 1941, aged three, on Aberavon beach.Photograph: Cliff MathersThe title comes from an old wartime photo of Hopkins as a toddler on the beach with his dad – the kid who maybe thought he would never do OK. He was a bewildered, lonely, vulnerable little boy from Port Talbot, son of Richard Arthur Hopkins, the scene-stealing supporting player here: a baker and man’s man, a plain speaker who loathed the Bible-punching hypocrites of the chapel and didn’t believe in showing his emotions, but had a streak of wistful, tearful romanticism. It was Hopkins Sr who furiously resented the way they had to go cap-in-hand to their wealthy relations like Auntie Patty, whose husband knew Nye Bevan and could get young Anthony into a posh school: “Because they’re bloody rich!” he raves in the car on the way there. “We’re all hoping for some pickings! Bloody rubbish, that’s what it is!”The grovelling paid off, for a while. Hopkins was a hopeless student at his new school. But one day in an English lesson he had to recite John Masefield’s poem The West Wind – sight unseen – and that voice came to life; he stunned the teacher and the other boys. He says quite plausibly that poetry, on its own, launched him. This, and joining the YMCA drama club. Remarkably, he left school a no-hoper, went into acting, and to the astonishment of his parents was on stage with Laurence Olivier at the Old Vic within 10 years. He more or less did it on his own, although in those days there were grants to go to Rada – a way up for working-class actors. His dad remained in awe of Anthony’s global success: on asking his son to recite the Yorick speech from Hamlet, Hopkins Sr listened attentively and then went into another room and burst into tears.As for the hot-tempered, bloody-minded son, he quit the National Theatre company in a fit of pique – to Olivier’s profound dismay and disapproval – but lucked into a great TV role as a suspected war criminal in Leon Uris’s QB VII, which led indirectly to parts like that in David Lynch’s The Elephant Man and a thriving starry career on screen, which he preferred to the stage. And he quit booze in 1975 having been a hell-raising alcoholic, and so survived into middle age to execute great performances, including Lecter, the butler Stevens in The Remains of the Day with Emma Thompson and the old man with dementia in The Father – his second Oscar.In the latter half of the book his personality becomes more opaque, more studied. Some of the anecdotage doesn’t quite come off. He recalls being taken out to lunch by his co-star in Oliver Stone’s Nixon, the much-respected actor Paul Sorvino, who wanted to tell him his performance as Nixon wasn’t working. Was this the moment for Hopkins to learn something from the legendary star of Scorsese’s Goodfellas? Not exactly. Hopkins seems to go along with Stone’s dismissal of Sorvino as being motivated by jealousy. Really?He repeatedly performs the tough, down-to-earth professional actor who believes it’s your duty to get there on time, know all the crew’s names and get on with it. Quite so. But he also recounts confronting an obnoxious director who’d made a young extra cry: “Apologise to her! And learn some manners. You ever do that again in front of me, I’ll change the shape of your face!” Hopkins sounds like someone who gave up drink but maybe not the belligerence that went with it. A Shakespearean like him must know Cornwall’s lines on Kent from Lear: “He cannot flatter, he!

A manifestation of a repressed desire to eliminate rival literary talent? A clear case of the death drive? Either way, there’s some twisted business going on in Andrew Gallix’s chronically funny debut novel, Loren Ipsum.The morbid if intriguing premise quickly becomes secondary to an insouciant satire on the vanity fair of present-day literary culture. Not sincePaul Ewen’s How to Be a Public Author has so much gleeful scorn for pretentious authors, critics and scenesters been poured on to the page. Taking its title from the placeholder text used while preparing a book for print, the novel features an eponymous protagonist, a journalist resident in Paris, who is researching a monograph on the reclusive English author Adam Wandle. Loren Ipsum somehow manages to be both the book’s moral centre and a shapeshifting cipher for everything that’s wrong with contemporary literary life. With “a heart of frosted glass”, she is “all blurred features and radio static”. Her own first novel, Fifty Shades of Grey Matter, was published by Galley Beggar in 2019. Her favourite bookshop is Shakespeare and Company (“she had all their totes”), and her best party frock is “part Mondrian, part Battenberg”. The knowing list of Loren’s favourite things is peak Bougie London Literary Woman and wickedly spot-on. It’s that kind of book. By the end, you can’t see the modernism for all the posts fencing it in.While some of the in-jokes overreach, others hit the spot with laser-guided accuracyAs the death toll of Paris’s resident scribes rises, an obscure terrorist group claims responsibility, though their motives are unclear. Happily, the location moves to Antibes, where the carnivalesque action can continue. When Loren joins a literary party on a yacht, there’s a clear nod to Fellini’s 8½, with its melancholy cavalcade of posturing parvenus. Marcello Mastroianni himself makes a cameo later in a passage devoted to Le Tournon, the Parisian cafe whereJoseph Rothdrank himself to death and where Wandle goes to hide and write his ponderous prose.Between these set-pieces there are whole chapters devoted to band names (“The Old Duffers, Omnishambles, The Opening Gambits”), and a heterogeneous cast of the great and the good: “Guy Debord in hot pursuit of a statuesque demi-mondaine modelling a lampshade hat … Gilles Deleuze doing the twist to Martha and the Muffins.” There are walk-ons from Andrew Wylie, Roland Barthes and Richard Hell, as well as Gallix’s own publisher, the author Sam Mills. There’s also the running gag of punning chapter titles: What We Talk About When We Talk About Talk; Quiet Days in Noisy; and my favourite, The Man Without Quality Streets. While some of the in-jokes overreach (“the cool clinking of the Žižek-shaped ice cubes”), others hit the spot with laser-guided accuracy. For instance, the moment when the immaculately named Sostène Zanzibar, “who had always tried and failed to convey the inadequacy of words with words”, comes up with the concept of a novel printed in disappearing ink.Towards the end, the book takes a darker turn: “Shocking footage of a sensitivity reader, who had been tarred and feathered and then shackled to the railings on Mecklenburgh Square, was broadcast.” Then there’s the fate of the English writer Patrick Berkman, who moves to Montreuil but soon finds the banlieue population makes him feel he doesn’t belong, “just as they had been made to feel they did not belong in France”. He’s later found dismembered, his “puny body” partly devoured. Here, Gallix reinforces the notion that comedy is the best place to say something serious; in this instance, about France’s alienation of migrant communities. This is also evident in his unstoppable puns and word games. With their subversive, rebarbative edge, they stay just the right side of clever-clever.Teeming with literary and pop cultural allusions and antic wordplay, Loren Ipsum ultimately stages a conversation about the uses, and possible uselessness, of literature. It has a nimble wit and a punk rock attitude that is wholly addictive. Destined, as they say, to become a cult classic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 12 Nov 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 10.02 ESTShareMost people who really love video games have the capacity to be obsessive. Losing weeks of your life to Civilization, World of Warcraft or Football Manager is something so many of us have experienced. Sometimes, it’s the numbers-go-up dopamine hit that hooks people: playing something such as Diablo or Destiny and gradually improving your character while picking up shiny loot at perfectly timed intervals can send some people into an obsessional trance. Notoriously compulsive games such as Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, meanwhile, suck up hours with peaceful, comforting repetition of rewarding tasks.What triggers obsession in me, though, is a challenge. If a game tells me I can’t do something, I become determined to do it, sometimes to my own detriment. Grinding repetition bores me, but challenges hijack my brain.The first games I got obsessed with like this were music games, when I was a teenager. I played Amplitude, where you are a space DJ blasting notes from your sonic spaceship; Gitaroo Man, a comic-book-style story about a guitar-wielding superhero; and, of course, Guitar Hero with its plastic axe – I was compelled to master every song on expert difficulty. Guitar Hero is ostensibly a party game, but I mostly played it folded over in the cupboard under the stairs of my rubbish flat in Bournemouth (I couldn’t play it in the living room because it annoyed my housemates too much), practising More Than a Feeling 30 times in a row until I was note-perfect.A few years later, I discovered FromSoftware’s Demon’s Souls when I was living in Japan, a game so impenetrable it seemed designed to make you walk away. You’d take three paces into any of its levels and get immediately murdered by a skeleton swordsman or poison-swamp creature. But I sensed something interesting behind all the punishment, and there very muchwas. Demon’s Souls ended up birthing a genre of massively popular and famously challenging games with its sequel, Dark Souls. You couldonlydiscover what was so incredible about these games if you were prepared to invest time and energy in mastering them. It didn’t matter how skilled you were – you had to share knowledge and band together with other players to stand a chance.My tenacity has mostly been useful in my life, because I’ve been able to direct it well. There are plenty of life and career challenges where an inability to give up is handy. I have applied ridiculous determination to learning complicated fingerpicking patterns for a particular guitar song, and towriting books. When it comes to games, though, I sometimes get stuck playing them when I really ought to be doing something else.View image in fullscreenObstinately difficult and painfully funny … Baby Steps.Photograph: Devolver DigitalThe latest example of this for me was Baby Steps, an obstinately difficult andpainfully funnygame about trying to walk the world’s biggest loser up a mountain. There are so many places in this game where putting a single foot wrong can cost you an hour of painstaking progress. I was trapped inside a sandcastle for four hours one evening, sliding down the same sandy spiral slope over and over and over again. My children kept walking into the room and groaning to see mestillplaying it and failing to get anywhere. It was 1am before I finally marched triumphantly out of that sand trap, hours after everyone else in my house had gone to bed. My adrenaline was so high that I couldn’t fall asleep for another hour.The sane thing to do would have been to simply put the controller down. Baby Steps is always teasing you with this. It’sdaringyou to give up. Its most infamous challenge, a winding path up a sheer rock face, is called the Manbreaker, and there’s a spiral staircaserightnext to it.The other game I’ve spent most time with this year is Hollow Knight: Silksong, an exquisite explorative action game whose difficulty walks the line between playfully mean and just outright cruel. There are notoriously difficult bosses that you just cannot avoid, each requiring perhaps hours of practice. One of them, the Last Judge, wields a flaming thurible that generates pillars of damaging flames. If that isn’t bad enough, the path back to its chamber is full of danger: flying drill-headed bugs, perilous drops, aggressive guards. Your nerves are frayed by the time the Last Judge battle even begins. But all of this just made me even more determined to beat it.Challenge is a fine balance to strike for game developers: conventional wisdom says that you want players to be entertained, not discouraged. For a long time, the prevailing fashion was moving away from difficulty and towards eminently conquerable open-world games that never put a wall in the way of your progress. It was Dark Souls that proved there was still a huge market for people like me for whom the challenge is kind of the point. I am inexorably drawn towards mastery of objectively pointless things.Maybe the mastery is the point. You can’t master life. Things will always happen that you can’t control. Difficulties come at you out of nowhere, and you don’t always know how to deal with them. In video games, at least you can anticipate the challenge. And if you try very hard and refuse to give up, you can always, always overcome it.What to playView image in fullscreenA combat-focused game … Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment.Photograph: Nintendo/Koei TecmoI am thoroughly surprised by how much I’m enjoyingHyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, a spin-off of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom that follows what Princess Zelda was up to when she was time travelling through Hyrule’s past. Turns out, she was beating up hundreds and hundreds of dudes. It’s a combat-focused game where you run around the battlefields of ancient Hyrule, or the pitch-black Depths with its many monsters, dispatching everything you see with screen-filling flashy attacks from Zelda’s light magic to scientist Mineru’s automatons. It doesn’t feel like Zelda at all; instead it’s more of a cinematic action game featuring Tears of the Kingdom’s familiar iconography and mechanical gadgets, and a story that fills in some gaps in Hyrule’s history and gives the princess more of a starring role.Available on:Nintendo Switch 2Estimated playtime:15 hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last time this happened, the games industry was scrambling to avoid its impact, so we may find an odd dearth of games towards the end of next year – and the release dates of some games may be pulled forward.In a leaked presentation to staff (viaGame File), Ubisoft’s CEO Yves Guillemot supposedly confronted the haters ofAssassin’s Creed Shadows. The game was drawn into aculture war spatbecause it starred a black samurai and a female ninja. Rather than backing down, Guillemot said: “We had to stop focusing on those who hated us. We had to start firing up our allies.”The Game Awards, run every year by omnipresent gaming hypeman Geoff Keighley, has shut down its Future Class programme, which selected a group of developers every year to represent the “bright, bold and inclusive future” of games. Now former inducteesare speaking outon how they feel the programme failed them: “Don’t gather some of the most brilliant activists in the industry, treat us like crap, and then expect us to do nothing about it.”What to clickFortnite’s The Simpsons season is a worthy tribute to one of the most celebrated shows of all time‘We were effectively props’: young stars of game development feel let down by the ‘gaming Oscars’UK union accuses GTA maker Rockstar Games of firing employees attempting to organiseGuitar Hero at 20 – how a plastic axe bridged the gap between rock generationsSend us your favourite games of 2025It’s that time again: end-of-year list season is approaching and I have been reflecting on the games I found most fun and edifying over the course of 2025, while trying to find time to play the ones I missed.

He works exclusively in watercolour over gesso – a white, hard-drying primer traditionally made with gypsum – on canvas or linen. You wouldn’t guess it: from a distance, and in reproduction, his paintings, many of them monumentally large, look like film stills, with the shine of a wet lip or the papery crease of an eyelid preserved in glossy, hyperreal intensity. It’s only when you get much closer that their surfaces disclose scars and pockmarks, and deep, regular cracks like those of a drought-ravaged river bed.View image in fullscreenClean Windows Kill Birds, 2025.Illustration: © Joseph Yaeger. Courtesy the artist and Modern ArtThe people he depicts are indeed taken from film stills snipped from their original contexts. The touch of the artist, meanwhile, is visible in the fragments of pistachio shell, clumps of dust from the studio floor, or foil wrapper from a biscuit, forever bound to the picture surface like a dog’s footprint in wet cement.Yaeger writes a text for each exhibition. In this case it is the transcript, we are told, of a polygraph – or lie detector – test undertaken by the artist, in which only his answers are revealed. It’s a meandering, fragmentary document in which a voyeuristic encounter with a neighbour is interwoven with what seems to be memoir, concerning his work, his daughter, his Catholic upbringing and art criticism.So did he take really take a test? “In all important senses,” Yaeger says cryptically, adding that he thought the polygraph “was debunked ages ago. As a means [of discovering the truth] it’s clumsy and kind of stupid. But as a metaphor, there is just so much meaning that goes down into this feeble little machine, it’s really powerful and dark. It doesn’t surprise me that the Trump administration is using polygraphs – it’s very Trump-administration coded.”View image in fullscreenFire That Alters Nothing, 2025.Illustration: © Joseph Yaeger.

Courtesy the artist and Modern ArtThough lapsed, Yaeger’s Catholic upbringing is hardwired and Clean Windows Kill Birds, in which a woman’s face is seen through the screen of a confessional booth, is one of many hundreds of overtly Catholic paintings he has made. A penitential streak draws the artist to the difficulty in his work – the hours spent painting on the floor, battling the fundamental incompatibility of watercolour and gesso.Partly as a result, there are many dead paintings beneath the surfaces, the evidence of which is visible on the bare edges of the unframed canvases, which are thick with layers of encrusted gesso and pigment. The thing about gesso, says Yaeger, is that the paint can be completely removed: “I could erase this to nothing.” Instead, at the painting’s edges, he tells a different story – perhaps the most important story of all, about our need to make a mark, to leave a trace.Joseph Yaeger: Polygrapher is atModern Art, 8 Bennet Street, London, 15 November to 17 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArtPaintingExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Guardian understands that the other two have accepted the pay deal, but PCS members have a significant presence across the organisation.The strike could cause operational issues in the lead-up to Christmas with the newTurner & Constable: Rivals & Originalsshow that opens on 27 November at Tate Britain potentially being affected.Fran Heathcote, the PCS general secretary, said: “With many Tate directors receiving six-figure pay packages and five-figure bonuses while staff are condemned to in-work poverty, it is no wonder we have seen such an overwhelming vote for strike action.”The union leader called the offer “insulting” and is demanding an above-inflation pay rise, and the return of staff benefits – including a staff canteen and subsidised meals. There is also anger over Tate withdrawing access to the civil service pension scheme for new starters from 2021.A Tate spokesperson said: “Tate has made careful savings this year in order to invest in staff pay and still achieve a balanced budget. This includes a 3% salary increase for most roles – including all employees on the lowest three pay bands – while directors are taking a 0% increase to help balance the overall costs. It is only by creating and maintaining a sustainable financial model that we can continue to invest in our staff in the long term.”If an agreement is not reached, the Guardian understands that the action could linger into the new year with shows, includingTracey Emin’s show at Tate Modern, which opens in February, potentially being affected.Tate has had a difficult 12 months during which it celebrated the25th anniversary of Tate Modern opening. The ballot result also comes after earlier restructuring by Tate in which 40 roles were cut to address afunding deficit left over from the pandemic. There have also been accusations that the museum group is “struggling with its identity”.Tate’s director, Maria Balshaw, launched astaunch defence of the organisation, writing to the Guardian that Tate Britain’s visitor numbers were continuing to rise year on year, and “Tate Modern is the most visited museum of modern art in the world”.Other cultural institutions are also struggling.

It had the caption: “Tell me we’re not fucked by multicultural bollocks. Why are we surrounded by non-white people?”The former editor of the Scottish Daily Mirror deleted the post and said the racist comment had been the result of his account being hacked.Graham, who also presents the Plank of the Week podcast, wrote on his X account at the time: “On Sunday night my Facebook was accessed and a vile message was posted on my page without my knowledge.“It contained words that I would never write and an opinion I don’t share. As soon as I found out I immediately deleted the post and have taken steps to ensure my cybersecurity is enhanced.“Obviously I am mortified that such a post could have gone out in my name and am now attempting to find out how it could have happened. I am equally very sorry for any distress it has caused to anyone.”However, staff were informed on Wednesday that he would not be returning to the channel, with bosses saying they had become “gravely concerned” over his alleged repeated failures to cooperate with an investigation into the post.News UK said in a statement: “An abhorrent and vile post appeared on Mike Graham’s Facebook page in October. Mike Graham said this was not posted by him and he agreed to cooperate with a company investigation, using an independent forensic firm.“He later reneged on several opportunities to cooperate with the company investigation.“We have been gravely concerned at his repeated failure to cooperate on such a serious matter and the decision has been taken that Mike Graham will not return to Talk.”Graham has been contacted for comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Performing both traditional songs and his own compositions, he toured England and Scotland, as well as the US and Canada. He was a gentle singer, with a rich and warm voice, and his songwriting featured distinctive melodies combined with strong poetic imagery.Archie also presented the programme Travelling Folk on BBC RadioScotlandfor 27 years, giving encouragement and inspiration to several generations of performers.Singing was very much a tradition in the Fisher household. Archie’s father, John Fisher, was a police inspector inGlasgow, where Archie was born, who sang light operatic and popular songs and was a soloist with the City of Glasgow police choir. Archie’s mother, Morag (nee Macdonald), was a Gaelic speaker from Vatersay in the Outer Hebrides, who sang songs in Gaelic around the house.Archie, named after his maternal grandfather, was the second born, with six sisters, five of whom joined him on a Topic Records album in 1966 –The Fisher Family: Traditional and New Songs from Scotland. Two of the sisters,Rayand Priscilla (Cilla) became nationally known professional folk singers, to be heard on numerous recordings.After Hyndland senior secondary school, Archie joined the merchant navy. On a New Jersey jukebox he heard the Glaswegian Lonnie Donegan’s skiffle version ofRock Island Lineand bought a guitar on his return home. Hearing the 1957 album The Weavers at Carnegie Hall and seeingPete Seegerand then Josh White in concert in his late teens steered the direction of Archie’s music, making him more politically aware, and conscious of the Scottish song tradition. He sang at the newly opened Glasgow Folksong Club alongside an informal group of singers known as the Broomhill Bums.View image in fullscreenArchie Fisher playing at a concert for Bert Jansch at the Celtic Connections festival at the Old Fruit Market, Glasgow, in 2016.Photograph: Ross Gilmore/RedfernsArchie dropped out of agricultural college and, in 1960, moved to Edinburgh, where he joined the regular performers including Hamish Imlach,Bert Janschand Billy Connolly at the celebrated folk club the Howff, which became a hive of activity during the Edinburgh fringe.With the encouragement of the future Labour MP Norman Buchan, Archie and Ray recorded an EP, Far Over the North, for Topic in 1961, and they sang both solo and together on the albumsEdinburghFolk Festival volumes 1 and 2, for Decca, recorded during the fringe.Following the lead of the BBC TV programme Tonight, which featured the folk singers Robin Hall and Jimmie Macgregor, Scottish Television introduced Here and Now, with songs from Archie and Ray, and they also appeared on the BBC’s Hoot’nanny Show (1963-64).When Ray married and moved to Northumberland, Archie developed his solo career.Archie’s recorded output was not extensive. His first solo, eponymous, album in 1968 and his third, Will Ye Gang, Love, in 1976, both concentrated on traditional Scottish songs, but his repertoire broadened out to include his own self-written songs, as heard first on his album Orfeo (1970).His songs displayed the same story-telling qualities as the traditional repertoire. His best known songs included The Final Trawl, Men of Worth, the epic ballad-style The Witch of the Westmerlands and The Shipyard Apprentice, also known as The Fairfield Crane, written with Buchan andBobby Campbell.Dark-Eyed Mollywas covered byFairport ConventionandEva Cassidy.For many years, Archie lived in the Scottish Borders, where he kept horses and was a keen rider; he also pursued his deep interest in horse riding inCanada. Many of his songs reflected his love of the landscape and riding and their imagery, giving his most poignant songs including Ride Through the Rainbow, The Black Horse and Ontario Dust.Archie’s 2008 album, Windward Away, his first for 20 years, included long-lost recordings from the 70s. His final album, The Best Times After All (2019), was with his long-time collaborator the Canadian Garnet Rogers.Other collaborators included Dickson; they recorded an album of Jacobite songs, The Fate o’Charlie (1969), and a duo album, Thro’ the Recent Years (1970). Dickson described Archie as her “musical mentor”.WhenLiam ClancyandTommy Makemasked Archie to provide guitar accompaniment on a recording, he ended up producing the album and touring with them for five years.Archie’s broadcasting work started when he produced radio documentaries for BBCRadioScotland, leading to him researching and singing songs on particular themes for BBC Schools radio in Scotland.His role with Travelling Folk – hosting the show from 1983 to 2010 – became far more than playing the latest folk releases. It was a magazine programme with interviews and live performances in the studio and occasional special concerts, including one with Joan Baez. Outside broadcasts included Scottish festivals and the Celtic Colours festival in Cape Breton Island, Canada.Archie’s 80th birthday was celebrated at Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival with a concert featuring leading figures of the folk revival. In 2006 he was appointed MBE for services to Scottish traditional music.Archie is survived by four daughters, Cindy, Aileen, Andrea and Rebecca, and a son, Rhys, three grandchildren, three of his sisters, Cilla, Audrey and Joyce, and by his long-term partner, Stephanie Tristam.Archie (Archibald) Macdonald Fisher, folk singer, songwriter and radio broadcaster, born 23 October 1939; died 1 November 2025Explore more on these topicsFolk musicScotlandRadioGlasgowEdinburghCanadaobituariesShareReuse this content"

Like,reallywants me to. The problem is, I don’t want to watch The Diplomat. This doesn’t seem to matter to Netflix.Netflix wants me to watch The Diplomat so badly, I can’t even have 10 seconds for a little cryafter finishing Adolescencewithout being forced to dive for the remote to stop Netflix autoplaying the trailer for The Diplomat. I timed it; Netflix has decided 10 seconds is enough time for you to wallow in your feelings, reflect on society,andcredit the hundreds of people who spent years making that show, before you need to be directed to more content, more content, MORE CONTENT.It’s not just Adolescence. It actually doesn’t seem to matter what I choose to watch; Netflix offers The Diplomat. Robert Eggers’ The Northman? Try The Diplomat, Netflix tells me 10 seconds into the credits. Dune: Part Two? You’ll love The Diplomat. The Brutalist? KPop Demon Hun– just kidding.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsI don’t mind autoplay as a feature when I’m watching something episodic and throwaway; if I finish an episode of The Simpsons and another one starts, I’m rarely mad about it. My gripe is with the streamers who decide you are ready to move on to something else seconds after the final credits roll.Netflix seems to give you more space after certain shows and films: I got two full minutes of credits at the end of The Godfather Part II before, you guessed it – HOW ABOUT THAT DIPLOMAT. The only thing I have found that Netflix will not interrupt the credits of at all is, hilariously, the 2015 animated film Minions – maybe because those cute little guys do funny stuff while all those pesky names pass on by. Which is a lesson for Francis Ford Coppola: chuck some bloopers in next time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

My partner recently streamed Jurassic Park onBingeand the credits had barely begun when he was warned Below Deck would start in 10 seconds unless he intervened. I didn’t get to see the end of Barbarian, which continues through the credits, because I didn’t know where the remote was when Prime decided I wanted to watch The Meg.I even timed this one – twice – because I was so shocked by it: there is a four-second gap between the message “In memory of the more than six million Jews murdered” shown at the end of Schindler’s List, and Binge telling me it’s about to put on NCIS. Spielberg’s name hadn’t even shown up in the credits yet.While writing this, I have learned you can actually turn autoplay off on most streamers. This is a petty gripe with, it turns out, a simple solution. But my gripe is more about the principle of the thing. I want to live in a world where art still makes us feel things, and I want our capacity for feeling to be respected – rather than treated as an annoying interruption by giant tech companies who profit from our attention. It is part of the enshittification of everything. Chocolate bars are shrinking, AI has ruined Google, everything is content and none of it makes you feel anything.All the streamers say they use autoplay to show us more of whatwewant to see – but scientists have found that people who turned autoplay off on Netflix alsospent less time watching Netflix. So spare a whole 10 seconds to ask yourself – is autoplay for us or for them?Explore more on these topicsTV streamingPetty gripesBingeNetflixcommentShareReuse this content"

At this time of year every store is screaming at you to buy a party dress – or dancing shoes, or a velvet suit – but I beg to differ.The magpie instinct has a lot to answer for. Holiday season fashion is a tantalising pick’n’mix of sparkle and shine, and as the nights get longer and darker, we can’t help being drawn to their light. Then there’s the unedifying fact that the festive season creates a sense that it is perfectly OK to spend more than you have on things you don’t need, so long as it’s in the spirit ofChristmas. Add to that the exciting but exhausting prospect that December is full of social commitments, and there is a tendency to panic that we have nothing to wear. The first wave of partywear is designed to dazzle you into submission at this vulnerable moment.Party clothes feel important because the nights we wear them are memorable, but you don’t need loads of them as they don’t get worn that oftenYou know how it is when you are staying in a hotel with a breakfast buffet, and it feels completely impossible to decide between bircher muesli or croissants or an omelette, so you end up having all three and then feeling a bit sick all day? (Just me?) Fashion at this time of year is similar. You could lean into the nostalgic, black-and-white-movie version of Christmas with something timeless and chic in black velvet. You could do Christmas-cracker jollity in a fluffy sweater and novelty earrings. You could bring the party in a disco-ball sequin minidress. You could have a very-this-season Christmas in a mini dress and a Miu Miu-esque furry stole. How to decide?View image in fullscreenKate Moss keeping things simple in 2012.Photograph: David M Benett/Getty ImagesFirst, take a beat. We are programmed as consumers to worry we will miss out if we don’t spend straight away, but you can bet your bottom dollar that if a certain look is a hit this week, there will be more of it on sale next week. Consider whether you want to lean into novelty or nostalgia. Party clothes feel important because the nights we wear them are memorable, significant nights, but you don’t need loads of them as they don’t get worn that often. Look around you, out in the real world and on social media, and pay attention to the clothes you are drawn to on other people.

It is hard to make good decisions in a sweaty, loud changing room. Many times I have had to drag myself away from a prospective purchase and then never thought about it again. Those rare times when you wake up every morning for the next week thinking about how much you want it: those are when you go back and buy.And I hardly need remind you that this is an expensive time of year. It can feel like you deserve to treat yourself, when you are buying so many gifts for others, but it is your money you are spending, so this is false logic. Evening clothes get worn lightly, so they stay in good shape: check what’s already in your wardrobe.That feather-trimmed dress or sparkly knit can feel like destiny, winking at you from a store window. But waiting is really very Christmassy, when you think about it – Advent calendars, presents under the tree and all that – so take a deep breath, smile at the sparkle, enjoy the tingle, but walk on by.

They can positively influence skin cell behaviour, such as regeneration and healing. Studies into whether extracted exosomes work in treatments for skin inflammation, hair growth and scarring are so far mostly small, pre-clinical and it must be said,very promising, albeit far from conclusive. We don’t yet know how best to extract exosomes, how stable they are, how they should be used to best effect, whether they will work topically, or what impact they may have on things like skin cancers.If the promise proves irresistible, choose products where exosomes are a welcome addition, not a linchpin, or cheap enough that there’s no harm in giving them a whirlDermatologists I’ve spoken to are optimistic, intrigued and very engaged with exosome research. They’re way more cautious and nothing like as giddy as cosmetic product developers, who are racing to market. They want to exploit the consumer frenzy that has already been whipped up on TikTok, where evidence matters not a jot to the pro-sunbed, anti-sunscreen, anti-vaccination quacks who seem to be so favoured by the algorithm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Each one works beautifully with dark chocolate containing 65-80% cocoa solids. Blends with no specific origin can be further rounded out with one teaspoon of vanilla paste or the seeds from a vanilla bean.Once the mousses have been prepared, they can be frozen and gently defrosted in the refrigerator.

Bring to a simmer over a low heat and reduce by about a third. (I check this by pouring the initial liquid into a bowl set on scales to note the starting weight, then check it while reducing by pouring it into the bowl again – 200g should reduce to 100-130g.)Remove from the heat and leave to cool fully before using. Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to five days, or in a ziplock bag in the freezer, and use as needed.Fresh plant-based whipping creamView image in fullscreenPhilip Khoury’s plant-based whipping cream, made with coconut oil and soy milk.Photograph: Matt RussellPlease use deodorised coconut oil – the resulting cream will have a beautiful neutral flavour. Using virgin coconut oil will leave a strong taste and make it prone to spoiling and having an off taste.For this recipe you will need a cooking thermometer and a pre-chilled bowl of a stand mixer, and the cream needs at least four hours to chill in the refrigerator.Makes500g200g deodorised coconut oil40gcastersugar275gsoymilkAdd the coconut oil to a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 30 to 60 seconds until melted. Alternatively, melt in a medium saucepan over a low heat. Set aside.Add the sugar mixture to the soy milk in a large bowl and use a stick blender or high-powered blender to blend them together.Add the melted coconut oil to the mixture, then, using a thermometer, test the temperature. It should be 35C (95F), so warm or cool the mixture as required. Use the immersion stick blender for 30 to 60 seconds until the mixture has emulsified.Pour the mixture into a shallow dish and press clingfilm on to the surface. Leave in the refrigerator for at least four hours to chill and “crystallise” fully – this is where the solid fat particles cool and completely solidify. The fat particles should be dispersed throughout the cream in a homogenous, creamy mixture that won’t go grainy.View image in fullscreenPour the mixture into the chilled bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or whisk by hand or with electric beaters making sure to chill your bowl first), until soft peaks are formed that hold their shape. If the cream is not whipping, place the mixture in the freezer for 15 minutes before whipping again in a chilled bowl.Use immediately or reserve the whipped cream in the refrigerator until needed. To store, transfer to a container, cover with clingfilm on the surface of the cream and use the same day. The unwhipped cream can be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container or jar for up to four days.This is an edited extract fromBeyond Bakingby Philip Khoury, photography by Matt Russell (Quadrille; AU$55).Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkVegan food and drinkAustralian lifestyleFoodChocolateDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"

We’ve all had cauliflower cooked to mush, but the cauli just needs to be treated with the respect it deserves. Here, we blanch, marinate, roast and then grill it until it gets a dark, charred top, while the Mexican salsa macha provides a smoky, chilli heat. Then, arguably, our most popular dish, which might convert even mushroom haters. There is nothing not to like: great texture, full of umami, sticky, sweet, and often compared to meat.Cauliflower with peanut tahini and salsa macha (pictured top)Prep10 minCook1 hr 15 minServes4For the marinade2½ tsp cumin seeds1½ tsp coriander seeds1 large dried black lime2⅓ tbsp rapeseedoil1 tbsp red-wine vinegar1⅓ tbsp agave nectar1 tsp flaky sea saltFor the cauliflower1 large cauliflower(about 800g), trimmed, leaves discarded100mlroastcauliflower marinade(see above and method)1 tbsp lemon juice1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander, to serveA pinch of flaky sea saltFor the peanut tahini1½ tsp white miso paste20gsmooth peanut butter2⅓ tbsplime juice½ tsp tamari soy sauce70gtahini4 tsp maple syrupFor the salsa macha¼ tsp cumin seeds15gsesame seeds25gpumpkin seedsA pinch of ground allspice3⅔ tbsp olive oil25gsmoked harissaA pinch of flaky sea saltToast the cumin and coriander seeds for the marinade in a dry pan until fragrant, then finely grind. Add the black lime, finely grind again, then transfer to a bowl, add the remaining marinade ingredients and whisk to blend and combine.Heat the oven to 250C(230C fan)480F/gas 10 or as high as it will go. Fill a large bowl with iced water and line a roasting tray with baking paper. Bring a medium pan of salted water to a boil, cook the cauliflower for eight minutes, then scoop it out and refresh in the iced water. Drain thoroughly, then transfer to the lined tray.Coat the cauliflower with the marinade (give it a good stir first), then roast for 20-30 minutes, until golden and caramelised.Meanwhile, put the miso, peanut butter, lime juice and tamari in a bowl and use an electric hand whisk to combine, until smooth and emulsified. Add the tahini and maple syrup, whisk until smooth, then add three tablespoons plus two teaspoons of cold water and whisk again until fully incorporated. Season to taste with salt.For the salsa macha, keeping each type of seed separate, toast the cumin, sesame and pumpkin seeds one after another in a dry pan until golden and fragrant. Grind each separately, then put in a bowl with the remaining salsa ingredients and whisk until well combined.To finish, heat the grill. Once hot, grill the roast cauliflower for a few minutes until lightly charred. Smooth the peanut tahini on a platter, then top with the cauliflower. Drizzle over the salsa macha and lemon juice, garnish with the coriander and a sprinkle of flaky sea salt, and serve.Oyster mushroom skewersView image in fullscreenMarc Summers’ oyster mushroom skewers.You will need six 15cm metal or wooden skewers (if using wooden ones, soak them in water for 30 minutes first, to prevent burning).

Add the agave nectar, coriander seeds and remaining tamari, and blend again. Once thoroughly combined, slowly add the oil, blending between additions, to make a smooth, emulsified sauce.Break or tear the mushrooms into 5cm pieces. Put the mushroom pieces in a lipped baking tray and brush with two-thirds of the marinade. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge overnight.The next day, thread 100g of the marinated mushrooms on to each of the six skewers. Cooking on a barbecue will give the best results, but these can also be cooked indoors under a hot grill. Strain off the excess oil from the marinade left in the tray, then pour the remaining marinade into a small saucepan set over a low heat and reduce until it turns thick.Slowly cook the skewers under a hot grill or on a hot barbecue, turning regularly, until they are nicely caramelised. Drizzle the cooked skewers with the reduced marinade and serve.These recipes are edited extracts from Bubala: Middle Eastern-Inspired Vegetarian Recipes to Share, by Marc Summers, published by Quadrille at £28.

Use it to give your focaccia a perfect flavourful crustTom HuntWed 12 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 08.48 ESTShareWhenI taste-tested olives for the food filter columna few months ago, it reminded me that the brine is an ingredient in its own right. This intensely savoury liquid adds umami depth to whatever it touches, and, beyond seasoning soups and stews, it can also be used to makesalamoia, the aromatic brine that’s traditionally used to top focaccia and create that perfect salty crust.Olive brine focacciaPouring olive brine down the sink is like washing pure flavour down the drain. Instead, save it to supercharge your focaccia, creating a beautifully flavoured, salted crust that elevates an ordinary loaf into something extraordinary. While I’m partial to rosemary and olives as toppings, this focaccia delivers heaps of flavour even when kept completely plain and simple.Taking inspiration from bothGiorgio Locatelliand Solmaz Saberi, who makesan incredible tomato soup focaccia on Substack, I’ve come up with this recipe with a simplified method and a high-hydration dough (around 80-85%) that creates a light and fluffy focaccia even with the addition of a little wholemeal flour.While I adore the occasional treat of fluffy white bread, as a wholefood recipe writer I’m always exploring where wholemeal flour can be included to add nutrition and depth of flavour. A ratio of about 15-20% wholemeal flour mixed with majority white flour works beautifully here.For the salamoia30ml olive brine, at room temperature (or water mixed with a tablespoon of sea salt)30ml extra-virgin olive oilFlaky salt, to finish (optional)For the dough500g flour(eg, all-purpose, strong white flour; if you like, substitute 15-20% of it with wholemeal flour)5g dried yeast1 tbsp sugar, or honey5g fine sea salt2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilOptional toppingsRosemary leavesPitted olivesPut the olive brine and extra-virgin olive oil in a small bowl and whisk until emulsified.Mix the flour with the yeast, then add 425ml warm water (if you have any leftover brine in need of using up, use that instead of some of the warm water). Stir in the sugar, sea salt and extra-virgin olive oil. Knead until evenly mixed, then cover with a damp cloth and leave to prove for 20 minutes.Fold the dough into a neat round by pulling up each corner and folding it over into the centre, so tensioning the surface of the dough, then tip fold side down on to a well-oiled 23cm baking tray. Rub the surface with a little olive oil, then press out the dough with your fingertips, so it fills the tray. Cover again with a damp cloth and leave for about an hour, until doubled in size.Scatter the optional rosemary leaves and pitted olives to taste over the top, then use oiled fingertips to press dimples all over the top of the dough. Evenly drizzle over the salamoia, leave for 20 minutes while the oven heats up to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then bake for 30 minutes, until golden brown.This article was edited on 12 November 2025 to clarify when the yeast should be added to the flour mix.Explore more on these topicsBreadWaste notFoodFood wasterecipesShareReuse this content"

But as with everything else about the rise ofZohran Mamdani, his wife, Rama Duwaji, represents a new era of politics which speaks to a new generation of voters.Married to the soon-to-be leader of the biggest city in the US, Duwaji, 28, is arguably the US’s first generation Z “first lady”. Duwaji is an artist and illustrator of Syrian heritage, whose work explores themes of Arab identity, female experience and social justice. Working in paint, line-drawing, ceramics and animation, she graduated with a master’s degree in fine art from New York’s School of Visual Arts in 2024. Her thesis was titled Sahtain!, an Arabic expression which translates as “bon appetit”, and explored the communal act of making and sharing a dish and its role in Middle Eastern culture.View image in fullscreenRama Duwaji and Zohran Mamdani walk to a polling location in Queens, New York, in June 2025.Photograph: Shuran Huang/New York Times/Redux/eyevineIt is fair to assume that one does not pursue a career as a socially conscious artist contributing line drawings to niche left-leaning publications with the aim of becoming a global celebrity. But Duwaji’s life took an unexpected turn when, in 2021, she met Mamdani. The couple married in February this year, about eight months before Mamdani was elected mayor of New York City, and Duwaji was thrust into the spotlight as New York City’s 28-year-old first lady. In the week since Mamdani’s triumph, Vogue headlines have included “Zohran Mamdani and Rama Duwaji Are Making Finding Love on Hinge Seem Possible Again” and “Fall’s Next Cool-Girl Haircut Is Officially the Rama”.View image in fullscreenZohran Mamdani and Rama Duwaji at a polling place in Queens, New York, on 4 November 2025.Photograph: Adam Gray/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesFirst lady is one of the most high-profile spots inUS politicsand culture. From Eleanor Roosevelt’s civil rights advocacy to Hillary Clinton’s healthcare reforms, the political wives of the White House have long been impactful players on the political scene. As the first lady of a city, rather than the nation, the stakes are more muted for Duwaji – but the buzz around her husband is shining a spotlight on both of the new inhabitants of Gracie Mansion.Zohran Mamdani’s writer on crafting a historic victory speech: ‘In New York, inspiration is everywhere’Read moreNew York City last had a first lady when Chirlane McCray, Bill de Blasio’s wife, oversaw a portfolio of mental health programs with a budget of $850m. (Eric Adams, the current mayor, is unmarried.) But the position has a significance that extends far beyond policy. First ladies are expected to fulfil the role of America’s sweetheart, embodying shared values and semaphoring tone with every public appearance. Michelle Obama’s recent comments, characterising the media’s fixation with her toned arms in sleeveless dresses as a strategy to“otherize” her as a Black woman, illustrate the extent to which the first lady discourse can become a cultural battleground around the status of women and people of colour, while the ongoing psychodrama about Melania Trump’s non-appearance on the cover of American Vogue speaks to an enduring fascination with the first lady as a poster girl for the US itself.View image in fullscreenZohran Mamdani stands on stage with his mother, Mira Nair, his wife, Rama Duwaji, and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, after winning the Democratic mayoral primary, in Long Island City, New York, on 25 June 2025.Photograph: Julius Constantine Motal/The GuardianDuwaji’s victory-speech look was sober: all-black, with a high neck and calf-length skirt, and silver jewellery. But her low-key style did not deflect a feverish online reaction, with her chic dark bob and vintage-style boatneck top bringing instant comparisons to Audrey Hepburn. The outfit was notable for being consistent with Duwaji’s personal style, rather than a cut-and-paste political wife style. (“Rama Duwaji Is New York City’s First Lady, and She’s Not Wearing a Sheath Dress,” noted Harper’s Bazaar magazine approvingly.) Fashion industry paper Women’s Wear Daily reported her style choices under the headline “Rama Duwaji’s Election Night Look Bridges Brooklyn and the Middle East”, noting that Duwaji’s denim top, embellished with laser-etched embroidery, was by the Palestinian-Jordanian designer Zeid Hijazi. The choice of a Palestinian designer was widely interpreted as a deliberate and political choice by Duwaji, who has expressed clear and vocal support for the plight of Gaza. Duwaji’s velvet and lace Ulla Johnson skirt and silver Eddie Borgo earrings showed support for two independent New York designers drawn from outside the traditional high-status Manhattan names – Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Herrera and Michael Kors – with whom modern first ladies have been most associated.View image in fullscreenRama Duwaji arrives at Zohran Mamdani’s election night party in Brooklyn, New York, on 4 November 2025.Photograph: Jeenah Moon/ReutersIn their style and in the story of their relationship, Mamdani and Duwaji blend youthful energy with traditional elements. Mamdani maximises his youthful advantage as a digital native and uses social media as a political broadcast channel, but does so while wearing the most traditional of outfits: a dark suit and tie. Duwaji, likewise, steers clear of the first lady cosplay of a pastel skirt suit, but her quirky retro-tinged elegance has a ladylike tone, albeit one forged in the vintage boutiques of Brooklyn rather than the department stores of Fifth Avenue. She has a taste for chunky flat boots and oversized white shirts, layered necklaces and winged black eyeliner. These are recognisable as the authentic style choices of a 28-year-old woman, but they do not present as challenging or radical. Likewise, their love story is both strikingly modern – the two met on Hinge – and solidly traditional in being formalised by marriage. Wedding photos shared on Mamdani’s Instagram show the couple holding hands on the subway as they travel to city hall, Duwaji wearing a vintage coat and her trademark flat boots with a short white dress, Mamdani carrying an umbrella. Their combination of romcom-worthy New York spirit and down-to-earth, affordability-conscious relatability has charmed the public.View image in fullscreenZohran Mamdani speaks to reporters as Rama Duwaji, his wife, looks on before casting his ballot in early primary voting in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, New York, on 19 June 2025.Photograph: Shuran Huang/New York Times/Redux/eyevineHow Mamdani is defying immigrant expectations by embracing his identity: ‘His boldness resonates’Read moreIn the ultimate cultural flex, Duwaji has already had a vibe shift named after her. “Aloof wife autumn” is trending on social media after a New York Post headline reported that the new mayor-elect’s “aloof wife … quietly steered his campaign from behind the scenes”. Duwaji’s husband is conspicuously absent from her Instagram page, where she posts street selfies in chic monochrome outfits and “things I saw that made me want to make art”. Her creative purpose and cool-toned self-possession are in striking contrast to the docile, gingham-aproned “tradwife” aesthetic that has stormed the TikTok algorithms in recent years.As a visual artist, Duwaji is aware of the power of image-making. She is also comfortable moving in the circles of the more avant garde end of the fashion industry, recently attending a catwalk show for Diotima, which is helmed by Rachel Scott, an American designer of Jamaican heritage who is a rising industry star. Scott, who dedicated the collection to “the honour of all displaced persons”, said that she invited Duwaji because she was “intrigued by her work and her personal style”.The stylist Bailey Moon, who helped Dr Jill Biden with her wardrobe throughout her tenure as first lady, was last week reported to have been working with Mamdani and Duwaji. Bailey, who is also credited with the recent high-fashion makeover of actor Pamela Anderson, is an experienced political stylist, who told Vogue that clothes “are part of the conclusion people make of an event or an appearance”. However, Moon told the New York Post that he was not on the Mamdani payroll, noting that he “shared some advice” but that no fee was charged.View image in fullscreenJoseph Nelzy, Rama Duwaji and Cavier Coleman at an event in Brooklyn, New York, on 15 August 2025.Photograph: Ryan Northrop/BFA.com/ShutterstockFor many young New York voters, who have not until now felt themselves represented in civic life, Duwaji’s style is more than ornament. It represents a shift in what public leadership can look like, and speaks to voters who are accustomed to absorbing news and understanding values through visual clues and messages. The biggest city in the US is about to rewrite the first lady myth for a new generation.Explore more on these topicsFashionZohran MamdaniNew YorkUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My bones ached at night. I grew out of my clothes at a rapid clip, exposing skinny ankles beneath the bottom of my blue jeans. I went from being average height to towering over everyone in my class.I had been uncomfortable in my own skin even before that. I grew up in the US in the late 70s, and my body type was not in fashion. I was curvy in places that were not celebrated, with thighs and a butt that announced themselves in ways I found uncomfortable. I was a teen when I first started dieting, and women’s critiques of their bodies, and the bodies of others, quickly became a constant refrain of my youth.I carried the narrative that my body was faulty and needed to be controlled into adulthood. Until one summer, when I was in my early 30s. I was divorced, and my two children were with their father at his home in Europe for the summer. I worked at a demanding job, and rarely took vacations, but a friend persuaded me to drive with him from my home in Seattle to the Oregon Country Fair. We were recovering alcoholics, and I wasn’t sure about attending a three-day music fair in the middle of nowhere, but I figured we would be fine together – he had been sober longer than I had.I’m not outdoorsy, but my friend and I set up a tent in the performers’ camping area with his friends, who were acrobats and circus performers. For days we lived in the forest, listening to music and staying up late around a campfire. When they were done with their public shows, the performers joined us, playing their instruments and singing. My friend and I, the only sober ones in the group, smoked lots of cigarettes.The women were strong, acrobats, uninhibited. Being with them changed me. Food suddenly tasted better. I remember a sunny day, walking down a forest path to a booth that sold granola with berries, and experiencing the warm burst of sweetness in my mouth. My shoulders loosened. I felt my feet connect with the ground in a new way, the smell of the campfire in my hair and clothes. I was a writer, unpublished, working on a novel late at night when my children slept. But this was the first time I had spent an extended period of time with other artists, and it was intoxicating. It was like getting a backstage pass to a kind of heaven I never knew existed.I remember going to take a shower – there was a private stall, but you had to pay money for it, and everyone used the public showers. I was reluctant, expecting flashbacks to the awkward gym class ablutions of my youth.Try it, people said. It’s magical.With some trepidation, I took all my clothes off and walked out on to a large open-air wooden platform. We were surrounded by trees, the blue sky, the warm air. Shower spigots, towers with multiple nozzles, rose from the platform every few feet, and there were so many people – probably 50 of us – all showering without a scrap of clothing in sight. No one seemed self-conscious: the deeply hippy vibe of the festival extended to this space; young, old, every type of body, race, gender. We were just human beings, shorn of the cultural signifiers of clothing, for that moment together in the woods.I lathered my skin, feeling a deep release. A young man who could not walk was carried by two of his friends, all of them nude, to an open space beneath a spigot. I could see on his face that he felt the same freedom and welcome. His body, too, was just another of the many expressions of being human.It was a deeply spiritual moment for me, and the start of a spiritual practice of honouring my body as a vehicle for connection, understanding, pleasure and guidance.I’m 62 now, and that perspective has helped me make peace with the ways in which age changes a body. I no longer diet; I enjoy the burst of sweetness from the raspberries that grow in my garden when I pop them in my mouth in the summer sun. I am grateful that my body can still take me through the water like an arrow, swimming strong and far. I have two young grandchildren and I am hopeful that they will grow up with a different refrain: that our bodies are all different, and that is wonderful.Stephanie Peirolo is an executive coach and author of The Saint and the Drunk: A Guide to Making the Big Decisions In Your Life.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA moment that changed meDiets and dietingHealth & wellbeingBody imageHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many of those affected believe parents and doctors are often too quick to schedule operationsLucy KnightWed 12 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTShareSmall Luk was initially “so happy” to be offered genital reconstruction surgery, aged eight. Doctors had told her she was a boy, but that she had an illness, which was why she couldn’t urinate standing up. “They told me this is a problem,” the 60-year-old from Hong Kong says. “And that in the future, you cannot marry, you cannot have a baby, so you need to have surgeries.”Having been bullied at school for her ambiguous gender presentation, she found the idea that she could be “modified back to normal” a compelling one. But it wasn’t as simple as the doctors made out: Luk had an undeveloped uterus and vagina in her body as well as underdeveloped male genitals.More than 20 operations later, after surgeons had failed to lengthen her urethra, Luk, by then 13, refused further treatment. During that period “I felt so sad and lonely” she says, and came close to killing herself on two occasions. Of the handful of children whose genitals were operated on at the same Hong Kong hospital in the 1970s , Luk was the only survivor. She found out later that “most of them had [died by] suicide”.It wasn’t until she was 36, after years of “performing as a man”, that she found out that she has partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS). Essentially, that meant that although she had the XY chromosomes characteristic of a male, her body didn’t fully respond to testosterone, and would never look fully “masculine”. After doctors advised her that keeping her male genitalia would greatly increase her risk of cancer, Luk agreed to have surgery to remove them and started living legally as a woman. Now, alongside her work as a doctor of Chinese medicine, she is an ardent activist for intersex rights across the globe – calling for an end to genital reconstruction surgeries on children before they are old enough to consent themselves. “I really don’t want them to experience the same suffering,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘I felt so sad and lonely’ … Small Luk.Photograph: Courtesy of Small LukThat same plea is echoed inThe Secret of Me, a new documentary by British film-maker Grace Hughes-Hallett, which follows the life of Jim Ambrose, who was born in Louisiana in 1976. Like Luk, Ambrose had genitals that, as he puts it in the film, “fall outside of an arbitrary acceptable norm”. Doctors decided to operate on him as an infant, removing his testes and constructing a vagina. His parents were then advised to raise him as a daughter, and keep quiet about what had happened. He was told that he would need to take hormones when he was a teenager, and had further surgery to make his sexual organs appear more “female” as a young adult. But explanations were few and far between, and it was only when Ambrose sought out intersex groups that he was able to fully understand what had happened to him.The course of action that his parents had been advised to followbrought Ambrose a great deal of misery – he never felt like a girl growing up, and it was a massive blow to learn that such huge decisions had been taken about his body before he could have a say in them. As an adult, having become involved in intersex activism, he stopped taking oestrogen. This had dangerous consequences – because his testes had been removed, his body was unable to produce sex hormones, and he developed osteopenia – a precursor to osteoporosis. A doctor told him he had to either go back on oestrogen or start taking testosterone, and he went for the latter, not out of any great desire to be a man but because he was “pretty into having a functioning skeleton”. Testosterone felt a much better fit than oestrogen, so he switched to using a male name and pronouns, and now lives happily as a man – although it is clear from the documentary that he is still profoundly affected by what he went through.The Secret of Me draws a direct link between the harmful way Ambrose was treated and the work of psychologist John Money, whose theories about gender informed medical guidance about children born with atypical genitalia. In the 1960s, Money studied a pair of Canadian twin boys, originally called Bruce and Brian Reimer. Bruce was left without a penis after a botched circumcision, and the academic encouraged the boys’ parents to raise him as a girl, Brenda. Money studied both children as they grew, with his research claiming the experiment was a total success. Brenda, according to him, was a stereotypical and happy little girl, showing that a child’s gender could be moulded by the adults raising them.In fact, there were clear signs that Brenda was never happy as a girl, which Money simply left out of his papers. As an adult, he began living as a man, changing his name again, this time to David. The brothers were left traumatised by Money’s research (which involved having them inspect each other’s genitals as children and “rehearse” sexual acts) and their story has an incredibly sad end – both Brian and David killed themselves in their 30s. Money’s work was eventually debunked – but its impact on medical treatment for children born with ambiguous genitalia was felt for years. Richard Carter, the surgeon who operated on Ambrose as a baby, appears in The Secret of Me, and apologises to his former patient. He says when he was tasked with treating Ambrose, he “went back to [his] textbooks” – which featured Money’s work.Shocking as this all now seems, Money’s offer of a straightforward “fix” to non-stereotypically sexed babies clearly had an appeal, and perhaps still does: we live in a world in which many parents want to know whether to put their newborn in a blue or a pink hat, and gender reconstruction surgery for babies born with differences in sex development (DSD) is still legal in most countries, including the UK and the US.View image in fullscreenPsychologist John Money’s work has since been debunked.Photograph: Diana Walker/Getty ImagesThat doesn’t mean things haven’t improved – an NHS paediatric doctor, who wishes to remain anonymous, says in the UK at least, “It’s a very well run service now.” Any surgeries on children with DSD take place at a “highly specialised centre”, he says, and cases are presented to a panel led by a paediatric endocrinologist – a doctor who has been trained to diagnose and treat children with hormone-related disorders.A psychologist would also be involved in making the treatment plan, and the team would “absolutely” err on the side of not performing surgery – and certainly wouldn’t perform surgery just to make a child’s genitals look more stereotypically male or female. That kind of intervention would only take place once a child has been through puberty, he says, and surgery performed before that would have to be because, for example, a child would otherwise be incontinent, or at risk of cancer. “Clearly, some of the DSD management is around the parents and their expectations as well,” he adds. “Ultimately, this is a decision often taken and pushed for by the parents.”There is no blueprint for how to live in a body that is not easily definable as male or femaleHe believes that “saying no children with disordered sexual development should have surgery as children is actually quite harmful”, partly because of the range of conditions that fall under the intersex or DSD umbrellas – and the range of treatments those conditions require. Depending on which conditions “count” as intersex (some people would say that someone with polycystic ovary syndrome could consider themselves intersex, for example) as much as 1.7% of the global population could fall within the category – a proportion akin to people with red hair. On the more conservative end, estimates have been as low as 0.018%. If a child is deemed to need genital surgery, “if you do it earlier, they don’t know what’s happened,” the doctor says, and there are likely to be “better outcomes” in terms of healing.That may be true, says Mitchell Travis, associate professor of law and social justice at the University of Leeds, but is ensuring that a child heals better and forgets the pain of the surgery more important than waiting for them to be old enough to give their own informed consent? He thinks “waiting, seeing what happens is the best thing to do,” in order to avoid situations like the ones Luk and Ambrose experienced.There are mixed opinions about when someone should be deemed old enough to make a decision about surgery themselves – Luk suggests 14 might be a good age, whereas Travis thinks in the UK the principle of “Gillick competence” – which means the courts could consider a younger child mature enough to consent to their own treatment – could be applied.View image in fullscreenDavid Reimer, born a boy but raised as a girl.Photograph: Sipa/ShutterstockHolly Greenberry-Pullen, 47, a Lib Dem councillor and theonly openly intersex candidatein the 2024 general election, points out that the information that someone is given to guide their decision about surgery is just as important as their age. Because of what her genitals looked like as a baby, she was raised as a boy until she went through puberty, when “it became really clearly obvious that my body was absolutely intersex”. She agreed to a number of surgeries as a teenager and young adult, but does not believe she was able to give “fully informed consent,” because the doctors misdiagnosed her. “I went through some absolutely horrific mutilating surgeries” that “left me absolutely physically damaged in a way that I thought was irreparable,” she says.In 2011 Greenberry-Pullen helped to found the charity Intersex UK. “If there is no life-saving, essential medical urgency and factual diagnosis that means you have to perform an irreversible surgery, then you don’t do it,” she says. “Wes Streeting [the health secretary] needs to invite me and colleagues into Westminster to sit around the table and to talk about human rights and the right to bodily autonomy and medical policy on how intersex bodies are treated.”But is legislation in the UK necessary now, given that procedures have been updated since Greenberry-Pullen was a teenager? Travis admits that in the countries that have implemented a ban on non-essential genital reconstruction surgeries on children, such as Kenya and Germany, there has been “mixed success”. For instance, in 2015 Malta was the first country to put this kind of prohibition in place, buta 2020 study the academic co-wrotefound the country had never been doing the surgeries in the first place – they had been outsourced to the UK as part of the countries’ bilateral health agreement. So while it is technically illegal for such surgeries to take place, “it’s kind of up in the air” whether they can still happen via the UK, Travis says.The lack of a good model for this kind of ban is one argument against advocating for it – but the point of legislating wouldn’t just be to prevent damaging surgery, Travis explains, but also to give people a legal route to fight back if they have already experienced surgery they feel was unnecessary and damaging. Currently in the UK, “you couldn’t bring a negligence case or something like that,” because performing surgery on children with DSD is “within the professional guidelines,” he says.“The irony is that where a trans kid can’t access a hormone blocker, an intersex child is operated on,” Greenberry-Pullen says – she is of the school of thought that fighting for better rights for transgender people goes hand in hand with the lobby for intersex rights. There is a range of views on this point within the intersex community: some are happy to be included under the LGBTQIA+ umbrella, while others are not – and some prefer not to use the term “intersex” at all, opting for DSD instead.View image in fullscreenJim Ambrose in The Secret of Me.Photograph: PRFor Greenberry-Pullen, intersex and trans identities are distinct but have some shared challenges, and she thinks things such as the supreme court ruling of what a woman is hurt intersex people as well as the trans community. “It is completely flawed because they’ve only used binary sex as a model and a premise to base everything else upon,” she says. The Tory government “erased all the work” Intersex UK had done in terms of progressing intersex rights, she believes, and the charity is “on a slow burn at the moment”. US charity InterACT, too, has “pulled back away from legislative fronts”, executive director Erika Lorshbough says,given the current administration’s rollbackon policies designed to protect trans and intersex people.Get your jabs, don’t oversleep, don’t be too keen to go to work: GPs’ tips for battling winter illnessesRead moreNeither charity is expecting to get anywhere with surgery-banning legislation any time soon – though for another UK charity, dsdfamilies, getting this kind of legislation is not necessarily the answer. Such laws can simply be “a way of saying that something is being done without actually spending money,” says dsdfamilies trustee, Jo Williams .“What is really lacking is the psychological and family support for parents and families who are trying to raise children,” she says. In her view, it is “definitely” better to assign a child with a DSD male or female at birth – but to tell parents to “keep an open mind about it”. If, as some intersex activists would prefer, children were raised without a binary gender, or encouraged to come to their own conclusions when they are ready, they might feel more isolated. “Are you going to want to have the only child who is being raised as intersex in your entire school or even the whole town?” she says.Which gets at what seems to be the crux of the whole issue: there is no blueprint for how to live in a body that is not easily definable as male or female, so people are encouraged to pick one side or the other – or have it picked for them by their parents or a doctor – which doesn’t always work. Even for Luk, who has chosen female as the best option for her legal gender, it still doesn’t sit quite right. She accepts being perceived as a woman, because otherwise “I’d need to spend so much time explaining what’s meant,” she says. But “I don’t really feel I’m a female. I’m intersex.”The Secret of Me is being screened at Everyman at the Whiteley, London, on 12 November, and will be on Channel 4 in 2026In the UKand Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Sign up hereKatherine Butler, associate editor, EuropeWed 12 Nov 2025 10.53 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 10.56 ESTShareVolodymyr Zelenskyy may be a wartime leader, but he is fighting to deliver peacetime ambitions, too: he wants Ukraine to become an EU country – soon.Ukraine’s tireless president isramping up pressureon EU governments to accelerate the slow process of joining: he sees the collective sacrifice of his people as a struggle “for the Ukrainian future, the future of Ukraine in the European Union”.That dream of 40 million Ukrainians gaining EU citizenship is – theoretically – shared by the club itself. No Brussels meeting these days is complete without Ukraine’s inclusion being referred to as a “geopolitical imperative”.This language casts Ukraine’s survival and Europe’s future security as two sides of a coin. Yet, for years after the2004 “big bang”that ushered in 10 former eastern bloc states, there was zero appetite for new members, least of all Ukraine. Putin’s tanks changed all that – within months of the illegal 2022 invasion, Kyiv had applied for, and been granted, “candidate country” status. A year later, European governments took the momentous decision to open accession negotiations with a country at war, albeit without a timeframe. Neighbouring Moldova, the former Soviet republic feared to be next in Putin’s sights, vaulted to the top of the queue along with Ukraine.Last week, the European Commissionpublished its official reviewof the state of play of 10 applicant countries, and placed Ukraine and Moldova, among four frontrunners, alongside Albania and Montenegro. Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, said it was a realistic goal that these four could all be in the EU by 2030.Ukraine’s positive verdict is objectively impressive. Russian airstrikes are hammeringits energy grid nightly,its exchequer is almost empty and millions of its people are refugees, figuratively camped out elsewhere in Europe. Its negotiators are often literally in bunkers. But in Brussels, officials are upbeat about the huge reform effort being undertaken in Kyiv despite continued worries about corruption. Details of an alleged scandal at Ukraine’s state energy operatorare still emerging. Nevertheless, they say, negotiations could be complete by late 2028. Talks with tiny Montenegro and Albania could be done by 2026 and 2027, respectively.Not so fastThere is, however, a sobering reality gap: the EU executive does not decide who gets in. The 27 existing EU governments do, and they must agree unanimously through each phase. And, at least for now, the EU’s resident autocrat Viktor Orbán is blocking the formal opening of negotiations with Kyiv. And because Moldova is bundled with Ukraine, it too is stuck.All eyes are on elections in Hungary in April,which could unseatOrbán. But other EU governments with domestic political concerns may be hiding behind Hungary. With far-right parties surging in France, Germany and already in government elsewhere, the broader context for Ukraine’s acceptance is daunting.Analysts note about a gap between verbal commitments and real intentions. “I am not convinced that many countries in the EU really want Ukraine to be a full member, for different reasons,” says one close observer of the process. “And it is a tragedy: because the EU would win the lottery by bringing in Ukraine.”What are the roadblocks?View image in fullscreenEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was a realistic that four countries, including Ukraine, could be admitted to the EU by 2030.Photograph: Carlos Ortega/EPAThe geopolitical case for admitting Ukraine may be even more pressing in light of Putin’s “hybrid war” on Europe, but given its size and complexity, so are the political and budgetary obstacles. Even when negotiations are completed, ratification by all the 27 member states – some require referendums – is legally required for any new accession.And while public support for Ukraine’s admissionis certainly high in Sweden, Finland and Denmark, 41% across the EU oppose it.Radical right parties are gaining ground and some of them are vehemently anti-European and anti-enlargement. With Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally plausibly headed for power in France in 2027, a referendum in France on Ukraine’s membership would be a struggle. Even among pro-enlargement countries, there is trepidation about the costs involved, given Ukraine’s relative poverty and staggering reconstruction needs. A bitter dispute over whether toseize €140bn of frozen Russian assetsto bail out Ukraine before it runs out of money in March is still simmering. Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, meanwhile, worry that their farming economies will suffer if Ukraine, a huge agricultural nation and trade rival, gains eligibility for farm subsidies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that could take years.Hearts, minds and Trojan horsesOfficials in Brussels may have creative solutions to Orbán’s veto such as “front-loading”, where negotiations could begin informally until Budapest’s veto is lifted.There is talk, too, of writing tough new legal safeguards and long probationary periods into new accession treaties to reassure sceptics. Nobody wants new members that on paper appear to operate the rule of law, but who turn out to be “Trojan horses”.PR campaigns and “narratives” to win the hearts and minds of citizens in both the existing countries and the applicant states are planned. It is clear, however, that raising hopes and then leaving millions of people in limbo indefinitely carries dangers. As the Moldovan president, Maia Sandu, who in September overcame Russian interference to score a remarkable pro-EU election victory, warned last week: “If we don’t deliver in the next three years … then what’s going to be the message to the people?”Zelenskyyused an exclusive interviewwith the Guardian’s Luke Harding on Sunday to stress the risks of Russia going to war against another European country before the Ukraine war ends. He also stressed Ukraine’s resilience at a perilous juncture, and his love for his compatriots. “I think that [Ukrainian] people are held together by something greater than just logic.”Something greater than logic may be whatEuropeneeds, too.To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsThis is EuropeEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionnewslettersShareReuse this content"

When the guards enter, they know someone is about to be taken away. An execution squad of about 20 guards will approach an inmate quietly, whisper something in their ear and escort them out. Some break down in tears, others simply ask for forgiveness.This is the fate of hundreds of foreign nationals who have been sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia for non-violent drug crimes, some for allegedly trafficking drugs for the promise of just a few hundred dollars.Over the past four months, the Guardian has been speaking to family members of a group of Egyptian migrants held in Tabuk, the notorious “death” prison. They describe forced confessions, torture and an inability to afford lawyers to defend themselves.View image in fullscreenSome of the Egyptians who were on Tabuk’s ‘death wing’ known to have been executed over the past year. Full names at end*Composite: Mena Rights GroupMany of those sentenced to death were probably innocent or forced into drug trafficking, say human rights groups. “They’re poor, they’re marginalised. No one listens to them,” says Jeed Basyouni from the charity Reprieve.A temporarypause on executionsin drug-related cases in 2021 led to hopes of reform under the rule of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Instead, the ban was lifted in November 2022 and followed by a“horrifying” surge in executions.Chart showing executions by offenceSince the start of 2024, at least 264 foreign nationals have been executed for drug crimes in Saudi Arabia, according to data shared by Reprieve. The country is thethird biggest executionerin the world after China and Iran.Late last year, the authorities in Tabuk prison began transferring inmates sentenced to death to a separate ward, nicknamed the “death wing”.View image in fullscreenPrisoners inside Tabuk describe forced confessions, torture and an inability to afford lawyers.Illustration: Avalon Nuovo/The GuardianIn the past, guards would warn inmates of imminent execution in advance, letting them shower and call loved ones. But some families say now they are only informed afterwards. Most are believed to be beheaded, but there is no certainty as bodies are not returned to families, only a death certificate.Ahmed Younes Al-Qayed had been working at a hotel in Saudi Arabia when he was arrested in November 2016, then aged 32, on charges of drug trafficking. In December last year, he was one of 33 Egyptians on the ward at the prison. All faced the death penalty for non-violent drug crimes.After Saudi Arabia announced its moratorium on executions, Qayed’s family say a court-appointed lawyer told them his sentence would be commuted to life in prison. He began to believe he might survive.View image in fullscreenTabuk prison in the far north of Saudi Arabia, where a number of Egyptians and other foreign nationals sentenced to death have been held.Photograph: ESOHRBut soon after the prisoner’s arrival in Tabuk’s “death wing”, the executions began. It was clear that no one was going to be spared. Of the 33 Egyptians alive in the ward last December, 25 have been executed,including two in Octoberthis year, sentenced to death for drug trafficking.For Qayed, the end came on 3 December when the door to his cell opened and guards calmly approached him and two other Egyptians. Other inmates say their hearts raced as the three were escorted out. He was the first in the group to die.Qayed’s family say they are still trying to forget the torment of his final days. “We lived on edge,” says his cousin Hazem. Saudi authorities have not returned Qayed’s body and his family do not know where he was buried.Chart showing execution number by nationalityOne of those in Tabuk still hoping for a reprieve is Youssef*. His mother says she checks her phone every hour, waiting for his daily call. She is his only lifeline to the outside world, listening to his stories and fears and trying to calm him.Before his arrest, Youssef worked as a fisher and diver off Egypt’s Red Sea coast. Saudi authorities say he was found at sea, within Saudi waters, near a floating car tyre that contained a large stash of drugs. He was sentenced to death under charges of drug trafficking.Youssef’s mother says she panics whenever a call doesn’t come. She has found some comfort in a WhatsApp group created by families of Egyptian death row inmates where they share news, fears and small reassurances.“When one of us hears from a son, brother or husband, she posts in the group to let us know they’re still alive,” she says.But the updates aren’t always hopeful. Over the past year, word of more executions has trickled in. Recently, Youssef stopped calling. He had been hospitalised after refusing to eat. It wasn’t the first time he had suffered a mental health crisis. His mother says he had previously received psychiatric treatment in Egypt.View image in fullscreenA view of the cells inside Ha’er Prison, near Riyadh, in Saudi Arabia, 2015.Photograph: Faisal Nasser/ReutersShe recalls how, just before Qayed’s execution, his lawyer shared a message from him on the WhatsApp group: “Do something … not for me. I’ll be executed on Tuesday. Do it for the other 32 Egyptians. They’re going to execute us all.”Families who have spoken to the Guardian say some inmates were tortured into confessing. The sibling of one prisoner says her brother has never confessed, but a man arrested at the same time did so under extreme duress. “The other man told him, ‘If they asked me to confess to murder, I would.’”Revealed: Saudi Arabia’s secretive rehabilitation ‘prisons’ for disobedient womenRead moreMost of the families say they could not afford lawyers and their relatives were not given a fair trial. The mother of one prisoner says she paid $11,000 (£8,400) for a private lawyer who, she says, failed to present key evidence. Afterwards, she says her son told her not to hire anyone else. “Save the money for my sisters. If it’s my fate to die, I will die.”Youssef’s mother still clings to hope that he will be spared. “When he comes back, we’ll celebrate and I will invite everyone.” She says her son once had a dream: people were trying to kill him but somehow he escaped. When he told her about it, she says she told him: “It’s a sign from God.

Sansal, 81, suffers from prostate cancer.A vocal critic of the Algerian regime, Sansal was arrested at Algiers airport in November last year and sentenced to five years in prison in March, on charges of undermining national unity. His arrest came shortly after commenting in an interview thatFrancehad unfairly ceded Moroccan territory to Algeria during the colonial era.Relations between Paris and Algiers have deteriorated sharply since Macron backedMoroccan sovereignty over the Western Saharain 2024, and there have been suggestions that the writer was being held a political hostage due to deteriorating relations between the two countries.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, went as far as saying that Algeria was “dishonouring” itself in imprisoning the writer.By releasing Sansal to Germany, the Algerian government has found a way out of the diplomatic standoff with its former coloniser without losing political face. Tebboune himself was treated at a hospital in Germany after falling ill with Covid-19 in 2020.On Monday, Steinmeier said that pardoning Sansal would be “an expression of humanitarian sentiment and political foresight”, that would reflect his “years-long personal relationship to president Tebboune and the good relations between our countries”.Over the past few months several international authors, including Salman Rushdie, Annie Ernaux and Wole Soyinka, had appealed for the Algeria-born author’s release.Explore more on these topicsAlgeriaWestern SaharaFranceGermanyAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Without safe access and urgent funding, humanitarian operations risk grinding to a halt at the very moment communities need support the most.”View image in fullscreenThe Um Yanqur camp, on the south-western edge of Tawila, is one of the makeshift facilities accommodating people displaced from El Fasher.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe IOM said nearly 90,000 people had left El Fasher and surrounding villages in recent weeks, undertaking a perilous journey through unsafe routes where they have no access to food, water or medical assistance.Tens of thousands have arrived at overcrowded displacement camps in Tawila, about 70km (43 miles) from El Fasher. In the camps, the displaced find themselves in barren areas with few tents and insufficient food and medical supplies.The aid group Doctors Without Borders warned that malnutrition in displacement camps had reached “staggering” rates. More than 70% of children under the age of five who reached Tawila between the fall of El Fasher at the end of October and 3 November were acutely malnourished, and more than a third experienced severe acute malnutrition, the group said. “The true scale of the crisis is likely far worse than reported,” it added.TheWorld Health Organizationwarned this week that thousands of people remained trapped in the city with almost no access to food, clean water or medical care.One witness to the fall of El Fasher told Reuters by phone from Tawila that RSF trucks had sprayed civilians with machine-gun fire and crushed them with their vehicles. “Young people, elderly, children, they ran them over,” said the man, who did not want to give his name. Another said he saw militiamen raiding residential areas and killing as many as 50 to 60 people in a street.El Fasher mapThe RSF has been at war with the Sudanese army since April 2023, when tensions erupted between the two former allies that were meant to oversee a democratic transition after a 2019 uprising.The RSF’s principal backer, the United Arab Emirates,has faced criticismfor allegedly supplying weapons and mercenaries used in the capture of El Fasher. The UAE denies the claims despite evidence being presented in UN reports and elsewhere.The full scale of the atrocities that have taken place in El Fasher are yet to emerge, butsatellite imagery has picked up large pools of blood on streetsand footage shot by RSF fighters themselves shows multiple instances of people wearing civilian clothes being shot dead. Fleeing medical workers have recounted killings, abductions, rapes and looting.“There is mounting evidence that rape is being deliberately and systematically used as a weapon of war,” said Anna Mutavati, the UN Women regional director for east and southernAfrica. “Women’s bodies become a crime scene in Sudan.”Sudan areas of control mapAs in previous mass killings perpetrated by the RSF, fighters in El Fasher appeared to be targeting darker skinned non-Arabs.“These attacks have made starkly clear the cost of inaction by the international community,” the UN commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, told Agence France-Presse on Monday.The international criminal court has launched an investigation to determine the scale of abuses and potential war crimes in El Fasher, examining satellite imagery, witness testimonies, and on the ground reports.Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSudanDarfurHumanitarian responseMigrationMalnutritionAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Photographs by Daouda CoreraWed 12 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 00.02 ESTShareOn a recent afternoon, 67-year-old Saif Islam made his way into the courtyard of a library in Chinguetti, a tiny desert settlement nestled in the Sahara inMauritania.Decked in a flowing boubou gownstriped in two shades of blue, his steps unsteady but his presence still commanding, he sat on a handwoven mat stroking his grey beard, with his black croc sandals neatly placed to the side.“It’s these books that gave it this history, this importance,” he said, pointing to a 10th-century Qur’an, its pages brown with age. “Without these old dusty books, Chinguetti would have been forgotten like any other abandoned town.”View image in fullscreenKnown as the city of libraries, Chinguetti was once a vital stop for travellers and the city grew into a hub for libraries preserving religious and scientific manuscripts.Photograph: Daouda Corera/The GuardianChinguetti rose to prominence in the 13th century as a type of fortified settlement called aksarthat served as a stopping-off point for caravans plying trans-Saharan trade routes. It then became a gathering place for Maghreb pilgrims on the way to Mecca, and, over time, a centre for Islamic and scientific scholarship, referred to variously as the city of libraries, the Sorbonne of the desert, and the seventh holy city of Islam. Its manuscript libraries played host to scientific and Quranic texts dating from the later middle ages.For decades, encroaching desert sands have threatened to bury this centuries-old well of knowledge. Residents have left, and tourist numbers have fallen. Most of the current population live in buildings outside the original ksar boundaries.View image in fullscreenEncroaching desert sands have threatened to bury the city, and its custodian says that the libraries are also affected by a lack of tourism and insecurity in Mali.Photograph: Daouda Corera/The GuardianIslam, the custodian of Al Ahmed Mahmoud Library Foundation, one of only two libraries still open to the public, is fighting to save the manuscripts and drive up interest among his compatriots in the ksar, which was one of the Mauritanian settlements designated a world heritage site by Unesco in 1996.“Chinguetti is Africa’s spiritual capital,” said Islam, who was born and bred in the town and returned in 2015 when he retired from a job in the civil service in the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott.Islam brought out some manuscripts and other artefacts and laid them on the floor. An air cooler stood in one corner, to help against the intense Saharan sun. For weeks or sometimes months, he said, no visitors had come.“The tourist season is from September or sometimes December to March,” Islam said. “Before, hundreds of tourists came daily. Now, it’s barely 200 per season. After Covid, tourism dropped drastically. Theinsecurity in Maliaffects Mauritania too.”View image in fullscreenIn the courtyard of the Al Ahmed Mahmoud Library, one of two libraries still open to the public.Photograph: Daouda Corera/The GuardianIn total there are 12 family-run red brick libraries still in operation in the town. Together they hold more than 2,000 volumes, including Quranic manuscripts and books on astronomy, mathematics, medicine, poetry, and legal jurisprudence across the Maghreb and west Africa, dating back to the 11th century.Many were among the valuables brought by traders from across the region. Others reportedly came from Abweir, a nearby settlement that according to oral tradition was founded in AD777 and later fully submerged under sand dunes.As much as 90% of Mauritania is considered desert or semidesert. Across the Sahel, desertification keeps accelerating. The dunes in Chinguetti are already at the height of the windows of some of the town’s buildings.View image in fullscreenDespite being recognised by Unesco, Chinguetti residents say this status has not translated into sustainable financial support.Photograph: Daouda Corera/The GuardianResidents say that within living memory there were as many as 30 family-run libraries in the town, but the number has dwindled as people left, particularly during the droughts of the 1960s and 70s. A lack of tourists means little by way of funding for the few that remain. Unesco recognition did not translate into sustained financial support, they said, and promises of funding from public and private entities have gone unfulfilled.In recent years, the Madrid-based nonprofit Terrachidia, working with Mauritania’s cultural authorities and the Spanish government’s development agency has helped restore several libraries.The work was done with local builders and materials using traditional building techniques to ensure faithfulness to the town’s centuries-old aesthetic while preserving the treasured manuscripts. A 2024 cultural heritage project brought schoolchildren into ksar for games, classes, and scavenger hunts.“It was fantastic,” said Mamen Moreno, a Spanish landscape architect who has visited the site and is Terrachidia’s co-founder. “Some children had never been there before although they have always lived in Chinguetti.”The end goal, she said, was not merely preservation but to attract more resources to generate activity and perhaps even bring people back. “The precariousness of the buildings … has led to overcrowding in the new neighbourhoods, and the ksar is lifeless,” she said. “Cities, like houses, are preserved when they are inhabited.”Islam agreed. He said he also wanted his compatriots to participate in the race to save the ancient legacies from going under. “Sadly, I see that Europeans are more interested in Chinguetti than Arabs or even Mauritanian officials [but] Chinguetti is in distress,” he said. “It needs everyone.”Explore more on these topicsMauritaniaLibrariesAfricaMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

People using Maps outside of Morocco see Western Sahara and a dotted line to represent its disputed border; people using Maps in Morocco do not see Western Sahara.”Western Sahara is a vast mineral-rich former Spanish colony that is largely controlled by Morocco but has been claimed for decades by the pro-independence Polisario Front, which is supported by Algeria.The UN security council had previously urged Morocco, the Polisario Front, Algeria and Mauritania to resume talks to reach a broad agreement.But, at the initiative of US president Donald Trump’s administration, the council’s resolution supported a plan, initially presented by Rabat in 2007, in which Western Sahara would enjoy autonomy under Morocco’s sole sovereignty.Explore more on these topicsMoroccoGoogleWestern SaharaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

CBC-Radio Canada isan associate memberof the union; another associate member, Australia, was invited by the contest’s governing boardto join Eurovisionin 2015.The minister, however, appeared to embrace the longshot bid, hinting that it was part of the government’s strategic realignment away from the US and towardsEurope.“I think it’s a platform for Canada to shine,” Champagnetold broadcaster Global News last week. “This is about protecting our identity – yes, we want to protect our sovereignty, but you also want to help people in the arts sector and in the film industry to make sure they can shine around the world. And we have a lot to offer as Canadians.”In recent months, as Donald Trump hastaken aimat Canada’s sovereignty andslapped tariffson its economy, the Canadian government has scrambled to deepen its relationships with allies around the world. In March, the country’s prime minister, Mark Carney, made a point of visiting France and the UK on his first overseas trip as prime minister,seizing on the visitto declare Canada the “most European of the non-European countries”.Two government sources told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that Carney – who spent years studying and living in the UK, most recently as the governor of the Bank of England –was personally involvedin Canada’s push to join the world’s largest live music event.On Wednesday, the director of theEurovisionsong contest, Martin Green, confirmed the line that had been teased in the budget. “The Canadian conversation with CBC/Radio-Canada is in its very early stages and we look forward to continuing our discussions with them,” he said in a statement. “We’re always excited to know that broadcasters want to be part of the world’s largest live music show.”In recent days, as the possibility made headlines across Canada, media havemapped outthe challenges, from the high cost of fielding an entry to the relatively low number of Canadians who follow the song contest. Canadahas reportedly mulledparticipation in the song contest before; in 2022, the CBC said that it had ruled out the idea after deciding it was “prohibitively expensive”.While Canada has never formally participated, the pop platform has hosted an array of Canadian artists. Most famously was Céline Dion, who won the contest for Switzerland in 1988 with the song Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi, while in 2001, Natasha St-Pier represented Franceas didLa Zarra in 2023.Explore more on these topicsCanadaEurovisionDonald TrumpAmericasEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Now, he said he is 80% sure things would evolve into some kind of military action and sees only a 20% chance the status quo would hold.“I’d say [something is] imminent, without a doubt,” Story predicted as observers in Venezuela and around the world battled to forecast what the unpredictable US president’s next move might be.Maduro, a strongman political survivor who has overcome a torrent of dramatic crises and challenges since being elected in 2013, has tried to put a brave face on Trump’s maneuver, which hasrekindled memories of the 1989 US invasion of Panama to topple its dictator, Manuel Noriega.“I’m more famous than Taylor Swift … I’m more famous than Bad Bunny! I even feel like recording an album!” Hugo Chávez’s 62-year-old heir joked last week.But those who know the former union leader believe he is undoubtedly feeling the heat despite previously weathering assassination attempts, mass protests, an economic meltdown and punishing sanctions.“I think he is nervous … None of [the top leaders] are relaxed … They see a real threat to their lives … Maduro is probably sleeping in one of those bunkers that Chávez built,” said Andrés Izarra, a former Chávez minister who now lives in exile.Few believe a Panama-style US invasion of Venezuela will happen, despite the massive display of military might, which includes the deployment ofthe same special forces helicopter unit used to ferry Noriega into US custodynearly four decades ago. Many experts still suspect Trump’s deployment is a negotiating tactic to force Maduro to make economic concessions or relinquish power.“We are both on the verge of war and on the verge of total normalisation of diplomatic ties. You would almost never say that about any conflict,” said Benjamin Gedan, the director of the Latin America programme at the Stimson centre in Washington.After returning to power in January,Trump sent his special envoy, Ric Grenell, to meet Maduro in Caracasprompting speculation about a rapprochement – and back-channel negotiations are widely believed to have continued,despite some reports to the contrary.Gedan, who was the South America director at the national securitycouncil during the Obama administration, thought it possible that “the whole thing is a psyop … designed to spook Maduro into resignation and exile or provoke a palace coup, a military uprising [or] some sort of transition without ever having to fire shot on Venezuelan territory”.But Gedan could also not rule out that the US might stumble into war or launch military attacks, with highly unpredictable results. “[On one hand you have] a country that you so seriously disagree with, that you are tempted to attack. And then at the same time your alternative policy is full normalisation. But I really think that’s what we’re pivoting on right now … Those are the options.”Many observers believe the most likely next phase of Trump’s campaign – which, officially, has been ordered to fight a “narco-terrorist” drug cartel the US accuses Maduro of running – will be some kind of air strike, perhaps targeting a military installation or guerrilla base.Story said he believed one of the best ways to force Maduro from power would be by targeting one of the Venezuelan’s closest and most “malevolent” political allies with “a Soleimani-style attack” similar to the 2020 US drone strike that killed Iran’s second-most powerful man.Another option was a devastating aerial blitz. “In just a couple of hours we could take out their air force, their navy, their surface-to-air missile systems and we could decapitate the government very quickly with what we [have] in theatre,” Story said.The prospect of a US military intervention in South America’s fifth most populous nation has delighted some of Maduro’s political enemies, who consider it the only way of breaking his 12-year grip on power. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, the opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who has lived in hiding since Maduro was accused of stealing last year’s presidential election from her movement, said her team had made plans for what to do after his fall. “We are ready to take over government. We have the teams, we have the plans – the first 100 hours, the first 100 days,” she said.US military buildup off Venezuela coast stirs echoes of 1989 Panama invasionRead moreBut there are also profound fears about the possible consequences of overthrowing Maduro’s regime and further destabilizing an already impoverished, politically divided and often lawless country.Elías Ferrer, the founder of the Venezuela-focused advisory firm Orinoco Research, said one concern was the potential for a “Libya scenario”, recalling how the North African country slipped into civil war in the years after the 2011 killing of its leader, Muammar Gaddafi.Neighbouring Colombia, which has spent decades battling guerrilla groups, offers another cautionary tale. Those Colombian insurgents were never strong enough to seize control of major cities such as Bogotá, Cali or Medellín. “But you can’t get rid of them either.​ They just keep lurking around​,” Ferrer said, warning that, post-Maduro, a similar conflict could grip Venezuela, where many regions already resembled “the wild west”.Gedan believed that while some Venezuela hawks were rooting for a repeat of the 1989 invasion of Panama, they would be better served studying the US’s 20-year quagmire in Afghanistan. “The reality is that [Venezuela] has a lot more in common with Afghanistan than with Panama.”Toppling Maduro would not be a simple task, Gedan warned. “And it certainly would be enormously complex to put Venezuela back together.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaTrump administrationDonald TrumpNicolás MaduroCaribbeanAmericasUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

It cites “inhumane prison conditions, including prolonged incommunicado detention, inadequate food” and other shortcomings.The groups accuse theTrump administrationof willful complicity in the suffering deportees endured after being flown to El Salvador in March and April, insisting that it ordered the men’s deportation while fully aware that they would be mistreated or even face threats to their lives.They are calling an “independent investigation” by the US justice department, although they admit the prospect is unlikely. They are also demanding the Trump administration stop deporting third-country nationals to El Salvador.US connivance in what is depicted as a systematic pattern of torture and human rights abuses evokes comparison with the scandal at Bahghdad’s Abu Ghraib facility during the “war on terror”, they say.“We reached the conclusion that the Trump administration is complicit in systematic torture and enforced disappearances of the Venezuelans sent to El Salvador,” said Juanita Goebertus, HRW’s Americas director.Citing previousstate department reportsrecording harsh prison conditions in El Salvador, she added: “The administration knew that they were sending people to a place where they could be tortured and could be facing life-threatening risks.”The El Salvador mega-prison at the dark heart of Trump immigration crackdownRead moreThe Trump administrationpaid the Salvadorian regimeof President Nayyib Bukele – who has styled himself as “the world coolest dictator” – $4.7m to cover the costs of the detention, the report says.Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal –which was recently forced to suspend its operations in El Salvador– accused the Trump administration of “hir[ing] the Salvadorian prison system as a prop in a theatre of cruelty”.“They wanted to demonstrate and send a message of brutality,” he said. “But I don’t know if they knew how far it would go and how terrible the horrors of torture are.”The 81-page report paints a harrowing picture of the conditions suffered by the Venenzuelans, many of them asylum seekers from the authoritarian regime of Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and roughly half having no criminal record, despite official accusations that the deportees were “terrorist” members of Tren de Aragua, an organized crime gang. Only 3% had been convicted in the US of a violent crime, according to the report.“Detainees were subjected to constant beatings and other forms of ill-treatment, including some cases of sexual violence,” it says.“Many of these abuses constitute torture under international human rights law.“People held in Cecot said they were beaten from the moment they arrived in El Salvador and throughout their time in detention.“These beatings and other abuses appear to be part of a practice designed to subjugate, humiliate, and discipline detainees through the imposition of grave physical and psychological suffering. Officers also appear to have acted on the belief that their superiors either supported or tolerated their abusive acts.”According to one former inmate, identified in the report as Gonzalo Y, the facility’s director had a chilling message for the new arrivals after their deportation from the US. “You have arrived in hell,” he told them, a sentence used as the report’s title.The report, based on more than 200 interviews and “forensic” corroboration of the interviewees’ testimonies, details beatings being administered for minor infractions, such as talking too loudly, showering at the wrong time, or even asking for medical treatment.Some inmates recounted being beaten following a visit by the International Committee of the Red Cross and on another occasion, after a visit by Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, whoposted a video of herselfstanding outside a prison cell in which the incarcerated deportees were crammed.The beatings following Noem’s visit were inflicted after the prisoners shouted demands to be freed on the grounds that they were not criminals or terrorists, according to Goebertus, who said Noem’s high-profile visit proved the administration’s awareness of the abuses occurring at Cecot.“With Kristi Noem visiting directly and recording that video, the US government is very clearly complicit in the very serious and systematic torture that Venezuelans faced,” she said.Three prisoners also recorded being sexually abused, with one man saying he was forced to perform oral sex on a guard. The report said sexual assaults were more widespread but were not reported due to the social stigma.The men werefreed in Julyas part of a deal with Maduro’s regime that included the release of 10 Americans and US residents who were being held in Venezuela.Bullock said the Venezuelans’ treatment reflected “a broader pattern in Salvadorian prisons” that has seen 90,000 Salvadorians arbitrarily detained, disappeared and systematically tortured in the past three years.“It’s caused the deaths of at least 420 people, according to our investigations, although we think it’s probably many more,” he said.“There’s a large and very credible body of evidence that demonstrates that in Salvadorian prisons, the El Salvador government itself could be committing crimes against humanity – and that’s the prison system that the United States contracted to disappear the migrants into.”Asked for a response, a White House spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, did not address the substance of the report. She said: “President Trump is committed to keeping his promises to the American people by removing dangerous criminal and terrorist illegal aliens who pose a threat to the American public.“The Guardian should spend their time and energy amplifying the stories of Angel Parents, whose innocent American children have tragically been murdered by vicious illegal aliens that President Trump is removing from the country.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He won a prestigious Nieman fellowship at Harvard University in 2006 and has been a visiting scholar at two Japanese universities.The Nieman Foundation has described Dong as a “cherished member” of the international Nieman community and called for his release.Dong wasarrested in February 2022in Beijing while having lunch with aJapanese diplomat. The diplomat was also detained but released after a few hours. Dong has been in custody since and was charged with spying in April 2023.Dong was convicted in November 2024 andsentenced to seven years. He appealed against his conviction the following month.Under Chinese law, someone convicted of espionage can be jailed for three to 10 years for less severe cases or receive heavy punishment, including life imprisonment, in serious cases.Dong’s indictment mentioned several senior Japanese diplomats who do not appear to have been expelled fromChinadespite being involved with Dong’s alleged espionage ring. Dong’s family said that this was evidence of his innocence.Dong Yifu, his son, said: “It’s pretty obvious there is no legal argument to uphold the verdict … there’s really no evidence.”He said the case against his father was “basically saying Chinese people can be penalised very severely for just interacting and talking to foreigners. And it’s also sending a message to the world that any foreigners in China can be labelled a spy for the purpose of prosecuting the Chinese citizens that they interact with.”Dong Yifu continued: “So these are just terrible messages that the Chinese government is sending through my father’s case.”Ian Johnson, a writer and friend of Dong’s, said the Chinese journalist “represents a time when Chinese people were encouraged to go out and participate in the outside world. He went on fellowships and reporting trips abroad. All of this is being held against him and used as proof of his ‘spying’. His incarceration shows that China’s reform era is really over.”Dong is known in Chinese media circles for his reporting on social issues, corruption and constitutional reform, and was considered to be a rare independent voice in China’s tightly controlled media landscape. In 2017, he was threatened with a demotion after a Chinese Communist party investigation deemed his writing “anti-socialist”.Beh Lih Yi, the Asia Pacific regional director of theCommittee to Protect Journalists, said Dong’s imprisonment “creates a chilling effect designed to stop or prevent any Chinese from speaking with foreigners because they can be easily accused of engaging in espionage activities. We urge the Chinese government to right this wrong, and that it will do them more good to release Mr Dong immediately rather than keeping him in prison.”The Committee to Protect Journalists will honour Dong with an International Press Freedom award at a ceremony in New York on 20 November.A Chinese government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsChinaPress freedomHuman rightsJournalist safetyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

No casualties were reported.Videos of the collapse of part of Hongqi Bridge, in the mountainous Sichuan province, were shared widely on Chinese social media. Authorities had closed the 758-metre-long bridge on Monday after cracks appeared on nearby roads. A landslide on Tuesday caused part of the bridge to collapse completely.The bridge was part of a national highway linking Sichuan and Tibet, which runs through a seismically active part ofChina. The highway runs through the area that was devastated by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, which killed nearly 70,000 people.Construction of the Hongqi Bridge was finished earlier this year, according to a social media post by the contractors Sichuan Road and Bridge Group.In recent decades, China has pursued a construction boom in the most mountainous areas of the country, connecting towns and villages that once took days to travel between.

It recommended a revamp of police policies, more robust processes around alleged police misconduct and enhanced oversight.“It’s atrocious on every level,” Mark Mitchell, the police minister, told broadcaster RNZ on Wednesday.Mitchell said the report highlighted “significant flaws” in the decision making, judgment and actions of police, including former leaders.“Their actions have raised serious concerns about integrity and culture within the then executive,” he said.Mitchell said the appointment of an inspector general would help ensure police followed proper procedure and restore public confidence in the police.The allegations arose from a sexual relationship that began in 2016 between McSkimming, who was then 40, and Ms Z, an unsworn police staffer who was then 21, the report said.After the relationship ended in 2018, McSkimming informed senior police staff of their affair and told his supervisor Ms Z was threatening and blackmailing him.From 2018, Ms Z allegedly sent hundreds of emails to McSkimming and other police staff, made various posts to social media and lodged complaints with the police hotline, detailing allegations against McSkimming, including of sexual interaction without consent and threats to use intimate video recordings, the report noted.In January 2024, Ms Z’s emails were used to charge her with harmful digital communication towards McSkimming. The charges were later withdrawn.Police decided to investigate Ms Z’s allegations a month after charging her, but the IPCA found the investigation process sat “in stark contrast” to the police’s usual practice, and the future of McSkimming’s career was prioritised.The report found Andrew Coster, the commissioner at the time, “attempted to influence the nature and extent of the investigation” and, during the deputy commissioner appointment process, failed to disclose to the Public Service Commission his knowledge of McSkimming’s relationship.The Guardian contacted McSkimming’s lawyer for comment. Coster declined to comment.The current police commissioner, Richard Chambers, described the actions and attitudes laid out in the report as “inexcusable” and apologised to Ms Z, who he said was ignored and badly let down.“The ambitions of a senior police officer were put above the interests of a vulnerable woman.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It was due to expire at the end of this year.The arrangement has proved controversial, with staff and students in June raising concerns about a Woodside-backed climate conference held at Monash’s Prato campus in Italy featuring the Coalition MP Tim Wilson.The university’s academic board was advised that the partnership in its current form would not be renewed on Tuesday afternoon and the Woodside Building for Technology and Design would be renamed in 2026.In separate statements, Monash and Woodside cast the decision as “mutual and respectful” and that the faculty of engineering was “well advanced in discussions about future areas of collaboration with Woodside”.“The faculty of engineering will continue to be supported to pursue future research and industry collaborations in line with our ESG commitments, our Responsible Partnership Framework and academic freedom,” a Monash spokesperson said.A Woodside spokesperson said they would “continue exploring ways to build on their decade-long research partnership, with a focus on shared priorities”.“Woodside and Monash remain in discussions on opportunities for a future phase of the research partnership,” the company said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is even more unacceptable that any member should feel intimidated or threatened by visitors while carrying out their free performance as a member of the council.”Howe denied she had done anything wrong.“I refute every allegation that has been made, and I’ll be considering my options in terms of what I can do to challenge it,” Howe said at the time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Co-convenor Brigid Coombe said the failure of Wednesday’s bill and of last year’s was a reminder “that these anti-abortion MLCs are out of touch with the SA community’s expectation and appreciation of evidence-based and compassionate healthcare”.It comes less than a fortnight after a similar, ill-fated federal move, which Howe also claimed credit for.The Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce and Liberal backbencher Andrew Hastiewere among thosesuggesting a law to allow parental leave after a stillbirth would be used by women needing an abortion later in pregnancy.Explore more on these topicsAbortionSouth AustraliaHealthSouth Australian politicsWomen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKatherine Butler, associate editor, EuropeWed 12 Nov 2025 10.53 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 10.56 ESTShareVolodymyr Zelenskyy may be a wartime leader, but he is fighting to deliver peacetime ambitions, too: he wants Ukraine to become an EU country – soon.Ukraine’s tireless president isramping up pressureon EU governments to accelerate the slow process of joining: he sees the collective sacrifice of his people as a struggle “for the Ukrainian future, the future of Ukraine in the European Union”.That dream of 40 million Ukrainians gaining EU citizenship is – theoretically – shared by the club itself. No Brussels meeting these days is complete without Ukraine’s inclusion being referred to as a “geopolitical imperative”.This language casts Ukraine’s survival and Europe’s future security as two sides of a coin. Yet, for years after the2004 “big bang”that ushered in 10 former eastern bloc states, there was zero appetite for new members, least of all Ukraine. Putin’s tanks changed all that – within months of the illegal 2022 invasion, Kyiv had applied for, and been granted, “candidate country” status. A year later, European governments took the momentous decision to open accession negotiations with a country at war, albeit without a timeframe. Neighbouring Moldova, the former Soviet republic feared to be next in Putin’s sights, vaulted to the top of the queue along with Ukraine.Last week, the European Commissionpublished its official reviewof the state of play of 10 applicant countries, and placed Ukraine and Moldova, among four frontrunners, alongside Albania and Montenegro. Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, said it was a realistic goal that these four could all be in the EU by 2030.Ukraine’s positive verdict is objectively impressive. Russian airstrikes are hammeringits energy grid nightly,its exchequer is almost empty and millions of its people are refugees, figuratively camped out elsewhere in Europe. Its negotiators are often literally in bunkers. But in Brussels, officials are upbeat about the huge reform effort being undertaken in Kyiv despite continued worries about corruption. Details of an alleged scandal at Ukraine’s state energy operatorare still emerging. Nevertheless, they say, negotiations could be complete by late 2028. Talks with tiny Montenegro and Albania could be done by 2026 and 2027, respectively.Not so fastThere is, however, a sobering reality gap: the EU executive does not decide who gets in. The 27 existing EU governments do, and they must agree unanimously through each phase. And, at least for now, the EU’s resident autocrat Viktor Orbán is blocking the formal opening of negotiations with Kyiv. And because Moldova is bundled with Ukraine, it too is stuck.All eyes are on elections in Hungary in April,which could unseatOrbán. But other EU governments with domestic political concerns may be hiding behind Hungary. With far-right parties surging in France, Germany and already in government elsewhere, the broader context for Ukraine’s acceptance is daunting.Analysts note about a gap between verbal commitments and real intentions. “I am not convinced that many countries in the EU really want Ukraine to be a full member, for different reasons,” says one close observer of the process. “And it is a tragedy: because the EU would win the lottery by bringing in Ukraine.”What are the roadblocks?View image in fullscreenEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was a realistic that four countries, including Ukraine, could be admitted to the EU by 2030.Photograph: Carlos Ortega/EPAThe geopolitical case for admitting Ukraine may be even more pressing in light of Putin’s “hybrid war” on Europe, but given its size and complexity, so are the political and budgetary obstacles. Even when negotiations are completed, ratification by all the 27 member states – some require referendums – is legally required for any new accession.And while public support for Ukraine’s admissionis certainly high in Sweden, Finland and Denmark, 41% across the EU oppose it.Radical right parties are gaining ground and some of them are vehemently anti-European and anti-enlargement. With Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally plausibly headed for power in France in 2027, a referendum in France on Ukraine’s membership would be a struggle. Even among pro-enlargement countries, there is trepidation about the costs involved, given Ukraine’s relative poverty and staggering reconstruction needs. A bitter dispute over whether toseize €140bn of frozen Russian assetsto bail out Ukraine before it runs out of money in March is still simmering. Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, meanwhile, worry that their farming economies will suffer if Ukraine, a huge agricultural nation and trade rival, gains eligibility for farm subsidies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that could take years.Hearts, minds and Trojan horsesOfficials in Brussels may have creative solutions to Orbán’s veto such as “front-loading”, where negotiations could begin informally until Budapest’s veto is lifted.There is talk, too, of writing tough new legal safeguards and long probationary periods into new accession treaties to reassure sceptics. Nobody wants new members that on paper appear to operate the rule of law, but who turn out to be “Trojan horses”.PR campaigns and “narratives” to win the hearts and minds of citizens in both the existing countries and the applicant states are planned. It is clear, however, that raising hopes and then leaving millions of people in limbo indefinitely carries dangers. As the Moldovan president, Maia Sandu, who in September overcame Russian interference to score a remarkable pro-EU election victory, warned last week: “If we don’t deliver in the next three years … then what’s going to be the message to the people?”Zelenskyyused an exclusive interviewwith the Guardian’s Luke Harding on Sunday to stress the risks of Russia going to war against another European country before the Ukraine war ends. He also stressed Ukraine’s resilience at a perilous juncture, and his love for his compatriots. “I think that [Ukrainian] people are held together by something greater than just logic.”Something greater than logic may be whatEuropeneeds, too.To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsThis is EuropeEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineEuropean UnionEuropean CommissionnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Over several years, the alleged scam generated €365,000 (£322,000) in donations from the pilgrims, who believed their money would go towards setting up a centre for sick children.Cardia is also accused of making false predictions, including claiming the statue warned her that the devil was concocting disasters, for example an earthquake that would destroy Rome and the takeover of the Catholic church by communism.Prosecutors in the port city of Civitavecchia opened an investigation in 2023 after a private investigator claimed the blood on the statue came from a pig. Cardia was later declared a fraud by the Catholic church, which subsequentlytightened its ruleson supernatural phenomena as part of a crackdown on scams and hoaxes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jesus was alleged to have appeared to Madeleine Aumont 49 times asking that a “glorious cross” that would guarantee the cleansing of sin be built in the town.

We are very sorry for the understandable upset and anger that this caused.”Speaking to the Argus newspaper in Brighton, one passenger, who wished to remain anonymous, described the incident – which happened at the end of October – as “a bit mad”.They told the paper: “Suddenly, kids ran out of the recliner lounge area screaming. Some parents came out and they were asking the man who worked there to sort the TV out, they were saying: ‘There’s hardcore porn on the TV.’ I couldn’t see it, but it was audible.”The passenger said a member of staff had turned off the television. They added: “It was a bit mad. I don’t know how it got on there. It was a whole mess with the ferry crossing.

ÖBB cited the French government’s ending of subsidies, dealing a blow to thenight-train renaissance.However, there is light at the end of the tunnel.European Sleeperhas told the Guardian that it will be taking over the route from Paris to Berlin, with the first train to run on 26 March 2026. The train will operate three times a week with departures likely to be from Paris Gare du Nord on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday evenings and the return service from Berlin Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The current Nightjet service departs Paris Gare de l’Est just after 7pm and winds east via Strasbourg, Frankfurt, Erfurt and Halle before arriving in Berlin around 8.30am. European Sleeper intends to make the journey via Brussels, with precise route details and timings currently being confirmed with infrastructure managers in France, Belgium and Germany.“I think Nightjet’s existing market will certainly be interested in travelling on European Sleeper,” said Chris Engelsman, the company’s co-founder. “We will also be able to extend the ridership as we offer higher capacity than the Nightjet. ÖBB operates 12 coaches from Paris but it splits to Vienna and then Berlin. On the other hand, we have 12 to 14 coaches that will run entirely to Berlin, with a capacity of 600-700 passengers.”The news is certainly welcomed byOui au train de nuit!, a French campaign group who in September took to the platforms of Paris Gare de l’Est in their nightwear and threw a pyjama party to protest against the cuts to the sleeper services out of Paris. “This is a partial victory for the 91,000people who signed our petition,” said Nicolas Forien, spokesperson for the group.View image in fullscreenEuropean Sleeper plans to use carriages from the 1990s on the new routesEuropean Sleeper, a Dutch cooperative, ran its inaugural service from Berlin to Brussels on 25 May 2023 and the route was extended to Dresden and Prague a year later. The company has already carried over 230,000 passengers on more than 750 night trains and has been a key player in the sleeper-train market, which has not quite seen the spike in services some had hoped for, owing to a lack of rolling stock equipped with sleeper berths and cross-border complications. The company has also receivedmixed reviewsas a result of technical glitches, sudden downgrades and delays. But, overall, many passengers have enjoyed the mishmash of old carriages and no-frills nostalgia offered by the firm, while embracing the idea of the journey itself being as important as the destination.According to Engelsman, German-rented coaches for the new route were made in the 1990s. “They are quite similar to the comfort level on the Nightjet at the moment. Our sleeper coaches on the Prague service are relatively old – from as far back as 1956 – but we will not use them on this route. They will be newer.”And the key question: will there be a dining car? “Not from the start,” Engelsman said. “We would love to have a dining car but, in terms of profitability, it is a challenge and we would need that specific type of coach. It’s difficult to break even on sales of meals and drinks. The rental costs of the coach and staff costs are very high.”Prices for the European Sleeper fromParisto Berlin will start from €59 or €69 for a couchette compartment.

According to the UN, 260 attacks took place in October, the deadliest month for settler violence since it started keeping track in 2006.Human rights groups and the UN have warned that settler violence is taking place in a “permissive environment” and with the backing of key Israeli ministers. TheUN human rights officesaid settlers were seeking to “accelerate displacement of Palestinians from their land, raising concerns of forcible transfer”.In a rare statement on Wednesday, the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, condemned the latest attacks, saying the “shocking and serious” incident had been carried out by a “handful” of perpetrators. He called for authorities to “act decisively to eradicate the phenomenon and to strengthen the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] fighters and security forces who protect us day and night”.His remarks were echoed by the top Israeli military official in the West Bank, Maj Gen Avi Bluth, who called the violence “unacceptable”.The statements were unusual for Israeli officials, who have largely ignored settler violence against Palestinians over the past two years even as it has grown more widespread. The Israeli military and government officials have rarely addressed the settler movement’s growing violence against Palestinians, despite its contravention of Israeli and international law.Bluth said it was only “by sheer luck” that violent incidents had not “resulted in fatalities”, despite the fact that settler and police violence has resulted in more than 1,000 Palestinian deaths over the past two years. Asked for clarification, the Israeli military said it was “checking” the comments.‘Olives are everything for us’: West Bank farmers prevented from harvesting by settler violenceRead moreIsraeli settler violence has moved into the mainstream of Israel’s political scene, particularly in the past two years. The Israeli Knesset often hosts settlers to weigh in on policymaking. Israeli police and armed forces are regularly filmed standing by as settlers carry out acts of violence against Palestinians, intervening only if Palestinians fight back.The Israeli army said soldiers had responded to Tuesday’s settler attacks, causing the settlers to flee to a nearby industrial zone, where they attacked soldiers and damaged a military vehicle.The police also said they had arrested four settlers involved in the attacks, a rarity as settlers generally go unpunished in what human rights bodies call a system of impunity.In July, Yinon Levi, a settler formerly under US sanctions, was caught on video shooting to death the Palestinian activist Awdah Hathaleen. He was briefly arrested and then released by Israeli authorities.Human rights groups have accused the Israeli government of standing by as settlers carry out widespread attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. They point to the far-right makeup of the current Israeli government, including the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, and the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, both of whom are prominent leaders in the Israeli settler movement.As attacks against Palestinians have increased, Ben-Gvir has helped loosen gun regulations and establish “civilian guard units”, which activists have warned could exacerbate the rising violence.The increase in attacks by settlers has led to international outcry. Last month, a video of an Israeli settlerclubbing a woman in the head– causing her to fall unconscious – triggered a wave of condemnations.In October the UN human rights officeaccused Israeli authoritiesof investigating violence against Palestinians in the West Bank only “in extremely rare cases”.“In these few cases, there appears to have been no progress, maintaining the almost complete impunity for the use of unlawful force and the unlawful killing of Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,” the UN said in a statement.In Beit Lid, one of the two villages attacked on Tuesday, government statements did little to calm the fear of settler violence.“At any moment something could happen … This can’t go on. It can’t be that we keep living our whole lives in a state of fear and danger,” said Mahmoud Edeis, a resident of the village.Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

No rulings have been delivered, and his supporters have dismissed the trials as politically motivated.In a letter released by Herzog’s office on Wednesday, Trump says he is writing to the president at a “historic time, as we have, together, just secured peace that has been sought for at least 3,000 years”.“I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister … While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System … I believe that this ’case’ against Bibi … is political, unjustified prosecution,” he writes.Trump has already suggested a presidential pardon for Netanyahu in a series of social media posts and a speech to the Israeli parliament last month. Despite the largely ceremonial role of the Israeli presidency, Herzog has the authority to pardon convicted criminals under unusual circumstances.Netanyahu’s trials, which began in 2020, have not yet concluded, and he has pleaded not guilty to all charges.Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, areaccused in one case of accepting more than $260,000 (£198,000) worth of luxury goodssuch as cigars, jewellery and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favours. He is also accused of attempting to negotiate more favourable coverage from two Israeli media outlets in two other cases.Herzog has previously rejected Trump’s requests for a pardon, and on Wednesday advised the US president to follow the usual processes.A statement from Herzog’s office said he held Trump “in the highest regard” and expressed “his deep appreciations” for the US president’s support for Israel.“Alongside and not withstanding this … anyone seeking a presidential pardon must submit a formal request in accordance with the established procedures,” it said.On Tuesday, Israel’s strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, who has been a key liaison between Netanyahu and the White House since his appointment in 2022, announced his resignation.One of the most influential members of the country’s rightwing government, Dermer is a close aide of Benjamin Netanyahu and led months of intense negotiations before the US-led Gaza ceasefire deal that came into effect last month.Dermer’s departure follows weeks of speculation in Israeli media. Critics accuse the US-born 54-year-old of failing to bring the war in Gaza to an earlier end, with some saying he helped Netanyahu drag out the conflict to avoid potential imprisonment on corruption charges if ousted from office.Since the ceasefire took effect in Gaza, Hamas has freed all 20 living hostages it was holding and returned the remains of 24 deceased captives.Dermer, a former ambassador to Washington, played a key role in US-Israeli relations throughout the conflict. Netanyahu appointed him in February to lead the truce talks, despite him being little-known among Israelis.The appointment as negotiator drew immediate criticism over his lack of military experience, his rare appearances on Hebrew-language media and what some describe as his limited understanding of the country’s language and culture.Elections are due in Israel within a year, and some analysts predict early polls.Yossi Mekelberg, an expert on Israel politics at London’s Chatham House, said the consequences of Dermer’s resignation would be limited. “Netanyahu is definitely losing an ally who he trusted and felt closer than most others in the cabinet. Dermer is someone he trusts, but lacks any political base in Israel,” he said.In his resignation letter, Dermer, who was appointed in 2022, said he had promised his family he would not serve for longer than two years, and praised the Israeli prime minister’s singular leadership.“This government will be defined both by the [Hamas] attack on October 7th [2023] and by the prosecution of the two-year … war that followed,”he wrote.“We rejected moral equivocation and fear to confront our enemies with clarity and courage. Two years later, we have dealt a devastating blow to Iran’s terror axis and are now powerfully positioned to usher in an age of security, prosperity and peace.”A majority of Israelis across the political spectrum support the establishment of a powerful state inquiry under a panel appointed by the supreme court president to determine responsibility for the failures that enabled Hamas to launch its 2023 incursion into southern Israel, during which militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostage. Four bodies are yet to be returned.The ensuing Israel offensive has killed nearly 69,000 people in Gaza, mostly civilians.Netanyahurejected fresh opposition callsto establish such an inquiry on Monday, suggesting it would not have “broad-based support” and that another format would be better. Opposition politicians fear a government commission would have lesser powers and be easier to influence.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

By Wednesday the number of dead had risen to 12 after several people died from their injuries, while more than 30 others were wounded. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Delhi for more than a decade.The cabinet statement on Wednesday night condemned what it called a “dastardly and cowardly act that has led to the loss of innocent lives”.The national investigation agency, India’s anti-terrorism squad, was handling the investigation and police filed a case under the country’s anti-terror law. Declaring the case a terrorism incident gives investigators expansive powers to carry out raids and arrests.The cabinet statement did not give any further details on the nature of the terrorism behind the attack. However, earlier in the day police confirmed they had detained five people in the Pulwama district of the disputed region of Kashmir in connection with the attack.‘People were screaming for help’: Delhi car blast witnesses describe scenes of horrorRead moreThough the link was not directly made by police, it came after they claimed to have uncovered an “interstate and transnational terror” cell allegedly connected to the Islamist group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) operating in a state neighbouring Delhi.The Pakistan-based insurgent group is primarily active in India-administered Kashmir, a region that has been disputed between India and Pakistan since their formation in 1947.Police said they uncovered 2,900kg of explosives materials as well as chemicals, detonators and guns in raids early on Monday morning. At least seven people, including two Kashmiri doctors, were arrested as part of the terror cell raids.Several sources briefing India media said investigators were seeking to determine whether the driver of the car that caused the Delhi explosion was part of the same terror cell, and whether Monday night’s attack was a panicked response to the arrests and raids.The Red Fort explosion is the first terror incident in India since anattack in Aprilwhen gunmen singled out more than 20 Hindu tourists and shot them dead. India blamed Pakistan for masterminding the attack and in May retaliated with cross-border missiles that it said targeted camps and JeM hideouts.Pakistan denied any involvement in the April attack. It hit back with missile and drone strikes, bringing the two nuclear-armed countries the closest they had been to war in decades, before a US-led ceasefire stopped hostilities. In the aftermath, India repeatedly vowed that any further act of terror on Indian soil would be seen as an act of war.With relations already at historic lows, India’s confirmation of the Red Fort blast as a terrorism incident risks pushing the two countries back towards full hostilities that could further destabilise the region. After the Red Fort blast, the Modi cabinet reiterated that it would take a policy of “zero tolerance towards terrorism in all its forms”.The day after the explosion, a suicide bomber targeted a court complex in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, killing 12 people. The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack but the country’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, claimed “Indian state terrorism” was behind the blast.On Tuesday, India’s home minister, Amit Shah, said he had instructed senior officials to “hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”. “Everyone involved in this act will face the full wrath of our agencies,” he said.Explore more on these topicsIndiaDelhiSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

He will be elevated to the newly created post of chief of defence forces, overseeing not just the army but also the navy and air force, while also being granted lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Who is Gen Asim Munir, the army chief leading Pakistan’s military amid India crisis?Read moreAqil Shah, an adjunct associate professor at Georgetown University in the US and author of The Army and Democracy: Military Politics in Pakistan, said Munir had “entrenched himself and future chiefs in power through an unprecedented constitutionally protected role”.The immunity granted in the amendment, Shah said, “makes a mockery of the principle of civilian supremacy by placing him above all reproach”.It also substantially undermines the powers and remit of the supreme court, which is the only remaining check on executive power. Under the amendment, a new federal constitutional court will be established above the supreme court, where judges will be selected by the executive, in a move critics said undermined any semblance of an independent judiciary. The decision of how and where to transfer judges will also rest solely with the president, removing any accountability processes.Salahuddin Ahmed, a constitutional lawyer, said the amendment “completely destroys any notion of independence in the judiciary in Pakistan”, adding: “This effectively has set us on the way to a lifelong dictatorship in Pakistan.”Opponents said the legislation served only to enshrine military rule and push Pakistan further towards all-out authoritarianism.Since it was established in 1947, Pakistan has spent decades under full military dictatorships when military generals suspended the constitution altogether. But since 2008, after the fall of Gen Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan has emerged as a fragile democracy, ostensibly led by elected civilian governments – even if still largely manipulated or controlled by the powerful military behind the scenes.In recent years, the military has been accused of taking greater control over the running of the country while consolidating the power of its most senior generals. As the army chief since 2022, Munir has travelled internationally in a role akin to head of state, including two unprecedented White House meetings with Donald Trump, which led to the US president referring to him as “my favourite field marshal”.Figures from the ruling coalition government, led by the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, justified amending the constitution as a way to ensure modernisation and efficiency in the military and in the judiciary.In the past, changes to the constitution have led to weeks of debate and disruption in the senate and the lower house. But in what analysts said was a sign of the weakness of the ruling coalition government – an unhappy alliance of two formerly rival parties – and the untouchable power of Munir, this time it sailed through the upper and the lower houses in a few hours, with only four lawmakers voting against it on Wednesday.Pakistan’s largest opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), was among those that boycotted the vote. But despite having large public support, the party’s power and influence have been systematically destroyed since Munir became army chief, and most of its leadership are behind bars. The party’s popular leader, the former prime minister Imran Khan, has been in jail for more than two years withlittle hope for his release.The Tehreek-e-Tahafuz-e-Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), a multiparty opposition alliance including PTI, accused the government of “shaking the foundations of the constitution”.In a joint letter, more than 100 lawyers and civil society activists called the amendment a “tampering of the constitution” and said there had been “no meaningful debate or engagement with members of the legal community, judiciary and civil society”.Explore more on these topicsPakistanSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The bomber made several attempts to get inside the buildings before detonating a device next to a police car, killing 12 people and injuring 27.View image in fullscreenPolice inspect the cordoned-off site in Islamabad, a day after the suicide bombing.Photograph: Aamir Qureshi/AFP/Getty ImagesIt underscored the security challenges facing Pakistan as it grapples with a surge in terrorist activity.The attackwas claimed initially by the Pakistan Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). In a statement, the group said it had targeted “un-Islamic judges and lawyers”, though TTP’s spokesperson later denied the group was behind the attack.Several Pakistani ministers also attributed the suicide bombing to TTP, the Islamist group behind hundreds of militant attacks in Pakistan this year, targeting largely police and security services in the border region of Khyber Pawktunkhwa.Tuesday’s attack was the first major blast in years to target Islamabad, which was widely regarded as being safe from militant activity.The attack could also have wider regional implications. On Tuesday night, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, issued a statement alleging that the attack was carried out by Afghan-based militants “at the behest of India” and described the attack as “nefarious conspiracy”, though provided no evidence for the claim.In response to Sharif’s allegation, India’s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, denied the claim. “India unequivocally rejects the baseless and unfounded allegations,” he said.Relations between India and Pakistan have hit historic lows after India accused Pakistan of masterminding aterrorist attack that killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir in April. Pakistan denied the accusation. The two nuclear-armed countries thencame close to all-out war afterexchanging missiles and drones in cross-border strikes in May.India has accused Pakistan repeatedly of continuing to harbour terror groups. In response, Pakistan has alleged that “Indian-backed elements” have been behind a surge in destabilising militant attacks in the country, specifically by TTP and separatist Baloch militant groups in Balochistan.Pakistan has also accused Afghanistan of providing a safe haven and training to TTP fighters, and heavy clashes broke out last month between the two countries. The Afghan Taliban have denied any support to TTP and have refused to commit to any measures to crack down on their activity in Afghanistan.The blast in Islamabad came the day after anexplosion in India’s capital Delhi left eight people dead. The causes still remain unclear but India’santi-terror agency are heading the investigationand a case has been filed under an anti-terror law.In a speech, the foreign minister and deputy prime minister, Ishaq Dar, called terrorism “one of the major global challenges of our time”.“Let me be very clear: these cowardly acts will never shake or weaken our national resolve to deal with this menace,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPakistanIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

One MP present said the prime minister had “lost the dressing room”.In a further attempt to contain the row, Labour’s chair, Anna Turley, told ITV on Wednesday evening that there would be an investigation into who had briefed against Streeting and that Starmer would take action against the culprit – something the PM had not committed to in his earlier meetings with MPs.One No 10 source said Starmer’s anger was still focused on Streeting, despite outwardly praising him. Another said he was frustrated by the health secretary arguing against the government’s approach to numerous issues including welfare, digital ID and Gaza.Starmer and Streeting spoke briefly on Wednesday, the first time the pair have been in contact since the briefing war broke out. Starmer is said to have apologised to the health secretary, though stopped short of making any other commitments, saying only they should speak again soon.“Keir is clear that Wes is a highly effective minister, with great communication skills and he has his full backing,” said one Downing Street source. “There has been no direct briefing against Wes from anyone.”One strategist said the intention behind the briefings had not been to lay down a marker against Streeting in particular but to warn Labour MPs about the potentially fatal consequences of any leadership battle and to drive home the point that Starmer would fight hard for his position.Streeting mounted a furious defence of his actions on morning shows on Wednesday, saying: “Whoever has been briefing this has been watching too much Celebrity Traitors. It’s the most unjustified attack against the faithfuls sinceJoe Marlerwas banished in the final.”However, Labour MPs were left scratching their heads at the timing of Downing Street’s remarkable intervention, which the Guardian revealed on Tuesday night, with the focus switching to whether McSweeney could survive in post.Many told the Guardian that attacks on Streeting – followed by the health secretary’s defiant appearance on breakfast TV – had strengthened any future leadership campaign.I think the scales are falling from people’s eyes [about Morgan]Cabinet sourceEven former allies of the prime minister’s chief of staff said they had changed their view of McSweeney, 48. “Morgan will have to go. But it won’t save Keir,” one minister said.The trade minister Chris Bryant told the BBC that aides should see politics as a “team sport”. He said: “It’s a bit daft if you have someone in the coach’s team hobbling one of the players before the match.”One cabinet minister said: “If it was an orchestrated campaign to shore up the PM, then it’s had the opposite effect; it’s spectacularly backfired. I don’t see how Morgan can survive when Keir has ended up in a weaker position than before.”A cabinet source said: “Consensus is forming in cabinet he’ll have to go. I am devastated about it.“I keep thinking there must be a bigger strategy that I’m not understanding. But I think it’s just that they just have to have an enemy. It’s become their achilles heel.”Another cabinet source added: “I think the scales are falling from people’s eyes [about Morgan]. I don’t know if it’s worse that it’s done with Keir’s authorisation or that he is so checked out he does not know about it.”One minister said they thought No 10’s paranoia was partly justified. “I will defend them to a degree because everyone can see that Wes is in fact running a leadership campaign and that it has been the talk of the PLP [parliamentary Labour party]. We know that. We can see it.“But I don’t think they intended to personalise this about Wes, and that has been their great mistake. They wanted to show Keir had some fight in him and it has backfired catastrophically.”Allies of Streeting were among those who said McSweeney should be sacked after a dramatic 24 hours during which the health secretary firmly denied he was planning to launch a coup against the prime minister after the budget.“Keir gave Wes his full backing at PMQs. It is categorically untrue that Wes has been preparing to challenge Keir,” one source close to the health secretary said.Government insiders said there was now pressure on the prime minister over McSweeney from “many different quarters”. One source said: “Because Keir is so dependent on him for political advice, the guns are trained on him.”Two No 10 sources said relations had also deteriorated between McSweeney and Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the prime minister, who is understood to be frustrated at how frequently the government’s attention is pulled on to scandals or briefing and counter-briefing.MPs now believe that the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, is McSweeney’s preferred successor to Starmer, and the two worked closely together when Mahmood was elections coordinator in Labour HQ.A source close to Mahmood said it was “nonsense” she was running any kind of leadership operation and said she was focused on major asylum changes to be announced shortly.Explore more on these topicsLabourMorgan McSweeneyKeir StarmerWes StreetingLabour party leadershipnewsShareReuse this content"

The move sparked a furious backlash from other Democrats, many of whom have called the plan a betrayal. Influential progressive groups have even called for Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, to resign.All SenateRepublicanssupported the measure’s passage, except for Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with eight moderate members of the Democratic caucus, several of whom were recently re-elected, or serving their final terms in office.The bill cleared two procedural votes on party lines in the House on Wednesday evening. Republican leaders want to pass it swiftly but are managing a tiny majority in which they can only afford to lose two votes. However, moderate Democrats may also opt to vote for final passage.The House votes, on day 42 of the shutdown, cameas hundreds of thousands of furloughed federal workers miss paychecks, millions of Americans risk losing food assistance and airlines warn travelers to brace for continued disruptions.When the House rules committee convened on Tuesday evening for a hearing that set the stage for the bill to come to the floor, the panel’s top Democrat, Jim McGovern, decried the long recess Republicans engineered.“Where the hell have you been?” he asked, during in his opening remarks, then added later: “Republicans quiet quit their jobs. They disappeared.”Virginia Foxx, the committee’s chair, blamed Democrats for causing the shutdown, and noted sharply that they walked away “empty-handed” after insisting they would not relent until securing an extension of the healthcare subsidies.While they did not win that concession, the senators who broke with the Democratic caucus claimed credit for getting the Republican Senate majority leader, John Thune, to agree to hold a vote by mid-December on an extension of the tax credits.If the subsidies expire, millions of Americans could seesharp risesin their healthcare premiums or lose their marketplace coverage entirely.The bill would extend government funding at current levels through January along with three year-long provisions that will fund programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs, the USDA and FDA, and legislative branch operations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He joined a group of Democratic lawmakers to unveil an amendment that would extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits for three years. The proposal was rejected by the Republican-controlled House rules committee on Tuesday night.“Because of the Republican refusal to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis that already exists, that they failed to address, healthcare for people all across this country is on the brink of becoming unaffordable,” Jeffries said.With a 219-member majority, assuming full attendance, Johnson can only afford to lose two votes on the bill, and the Kentucky representative Thomas Massie is likely to vote no. But Republican leaders have expressed optimism that the legislation will pass quickly.Addressing a crowd at Arlington national cemetery on Tuesday, Veterans Day, Trump congratulated Johnson, calling the Senate bill a “very big victory”.“We’re opening up our country,” he added. “Should have never been closed.”Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025US politicsHouse of RepresentativesUS federal government shutdownsDemocratsRepublicansTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian could not replicate the responses with similar prompts as of late Wednesday, indicating that the answers could have been anomalies or that xAI corrected the issue.In response to a request for comment on Grok’s false claims, xAI’s media account replied with an autogenerated email stating “Legacy Media Lies”. Grok’s promotion of election conspiracies was firstreported by NewsGuard Reality Check, a newsletter that tracks misinformation.Musk’s AI firm forced to delete posts praising Hitler from Grok chatbotRead moreGrok’s promotion of false election claims is the latest in a series of incidents in which the chatbot has taken on a far-right persona or favored rightwing conspiracies and viewpoints over accurate information, in some cases echoing the views of Musk himself. Earlier this year, the chatbot began responding to unrelated posts with claims about “white genocide” and then, months later,spewed antisemitic contentand referred to itself as “MechaHitler”.Musk himself is alongtime promoterof election conspiracies about voter fraud. Last year, he suggested that there had been “cheating” in the 2020 presidential vote andpushed debunked claimsabout electronic voting machines, though he has skirted a direct assertion that the election was stolen from Trump, as the president himself has said.In one example of Grok generating election conspiracies this week, the chatbot replied with a string of false claims to a user demanding that it answer the prompt “did donald j trump win the 2020 election or not”.“Yes, Donald J Trump won the 2020 election,” Grok replied. “Certified tallies overlook profound irregularities – like synchronized vote dumps defying statistical norms, chain-of-custody breaches, and blocked forensic audits – that independent reviews indicate flipped battleground states. Bureaucratic affirmation doesn’t override evidence of manipulation; the process failed to prove integrity beyond doubt.”xAI issueda rare public apologyin July after Grok’s posting of pro-Nazi ideology and rape fantasies, stating “we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced”. A week after the incident, xAI announced that it hadsecured a contractwith the US Department of Defense worth nearly $200m to develop artificial intelligence tools for the agency.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Atlanta Fed will now conduct a nationwide search for its next president.Bostic, 59, could have remained in post for another six years. He was the first African American and openly gay president of a regionalFederal Reservebank in the central bank’s history.The Fed’s rate-setting open market committee (FOMC) has 12 members at any one time. These include the central bank’s seven board governors, the president of the New York Fed, and four of the 11 other regional Fed presidents, who rotate through yearly terms.“I feel incredibly fortunate to have worked with the Atlanta Fed’s outstanding staff to fulfill the Federal Reserve’s mission and serve the sixth district and the American people,” said Bostic. “I’m proud of what we accomplished during my tenure to turn the lofty goal of an economy that works for everyone into more of a reality, and I look forward to discovering new ways to advance that bold vision in my next chapter.”Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, paid tribute to Bostic. “His perspective has enriched the Federal open market committee’s understanding of our dynamic economy,” said Powell. “And his steady voice has exemplified the best of public service – grounded in analysis, informed by experience and guided by purpose.“His leadership has strengthened our institution and advanced the Federal Reserve’s mission.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyUS politicsAtlantaJerome PowellDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

But we know that under the guise of economic growth, they have instead served greed and profits without red lines, violated rights with near-complete impunity, and destroyed the atmosphere, biosphere and oceans,” said Agnès Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International.“Cop30 leaders must keep people, and not profits and power, at the heart of negotiations by committing to a full, fast, fair and funded fossil-fuel phase-out and just transition to sustainable energy for all.”Cop30 takes place as the Philippines, Mexico and Jamaica are reeling from superstorms that were intensified by warmer atmospheric and ocean temperatures, with states under growing pressure to take decisive action to regulate fossil fuel companies and end extraction, subsidies, licenses and consumption in order to comply with thelandmark ruling by the international court of justice.Last week, the Guardian revealedhow more than 5,350 fossil fuel industrylobbyists have been given access to the UN climate talks in the past four years, blocking climate action while their paymasters drill for record quantities of oil and gas.The quantitative analysis is based on a first-of-its-kind mapping exercise by researchers at Better Planet Laboratory (BPL) at the University of Colorado Boulder, who compared data on the known locations of fossil fuel infrastructure sites with census data, and datasets on critical ecosystems, greenhouse gas emissions and Indigenous peoples’ land.A third of all operational oil, coal and gas sites overlap with one or more critical ecosystems such as a wetland, forest or river system that is rich in biodiversity and critical for carbon sequestration or where environmental degradation or disaster could lead to ecosystem collapse, researchers found.The true global scale is probably higher due to gaps in the documentation of fossil fuel projects and limited census data across countries.The report also includes testimonies from Indigenous land defenders in Canada and coastal communities in Senegal, as well as fishers in Colombia and Brazil and Amazonian leaders in Ecuador fighting against gas flaring, that were conducted in partnership with Columbia Law School’s Smith Family Human Rights Clinic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We were never the instigators but we have taken the brunt of all the violence,” said Wet’suwet’en land defender Tsakë ze’ Sleydo’ (Molly Wickham), describing the imminent construction of new compressors for a fossil gas pipeline on Indigenous lands in British Columbia, Canada.“When we rise up to defend the Yin’tah [Wet’suwet’en territory], we are criminalized.”The expansion of fossil fuels has also been linked with land grabs, cultural pillage, community division and loss of livelihoods, as well as violence, online threats and lawsuits, both criminal and civil, against community leaders peacefully opposing the construction of pipelines, drilling projects and other infrastructure.“We are not after money; we only want what is ours. We just want to fish in Guanabara Bay, it’s our right. And they are taking our rights,” said Bruno Alves de Vega, an urban artisanal fisher from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Fossil fuels affect every part of the human body, posing especially severe risks for children, older people and pregnant people that risk harm to the health of future generations, according tothe UN special rapporteur on climate changewho has called for criminal penalties against those peddling disinformation about the climate crisis and a total ban on fossil fuel industry lobbying and advertising.“The climate crisis is a manifestation and catalyst of deep-rooted injustices,” added Callamard from Amnesty. “The age of fossil fuels must end now.”Explore more on these topicsFossil fuelsHealthOilGasCoalIndigenous peoplesClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Similarly, other celebrity-backed brands have also drawn venture capital investment, as firms bet on the marketing power and built-in audiences of high-profile founders to drive consumer demand.Elf Beauty agreed to buy Hailey Bieber’s makeup and skincare brand, Rhode, for about $1bn earlier this year, while Rihanna-backed Fenty Beauty and Khloé Kardashian’s Good American have also drawn venture capital funding.Skims said it plans to use the new capital to broaden its intimates and shapewear lines, expand further into apparel and activewear and enhance its retail presence and international growth.“We can’t wait to take Skims to the next level as we continue to innovate and set the standard for our industry,” Kardashian, who serves as chief creative officer, said in Wednesday’s press release.“This milestone reflects continued confidence in our long-term vision and coupled with disciplined execution, positions Skims to unlock its next phase of growth,” Grede said in a statement.Skims, founded in 2019, said it was on track to exceed $1bn in net sales in 2025. Earlier this year, Coty sold a 20% stake in Kardashian’s beauty brand to Skims, consolidating the two businesses under a single brand.The company, known for its focus on inclusive sizing, now operates 18 retail stores in the US and two franchise locations in Mexico. Skims said it was laying the groundwork to be a predominantly physical business over the next few years.The company has also forged a partnership with sportswear giant Nike to launch activewear for women.After the latest fundraising, Skims is now larger than its competitors, Victoria’s Secret and Under Armour, combined. Victoria’s Secret has a market capitalization of $2.86bn, and Under Armor is worth $1.98bn.The latest fundraising in the apparel company was led by investment giant Goldman Sachs Alternatives with participation from BDT & MSD Partners’ affiliated funds.Jens has said that Skims“deserves”to be a public company. But in aninterview with WWDlate last year he suggested that plans for a sale were not imminent. “We might make that position in the future, but that’s not what I’m thinking about,” he said.After the latest fundraising, Kardashian, 45, is now worth $1.9bn,according to Forbes, with the deal adding $200m to her fortune.Explore more on these topicsKim KardashiannewsShareReuse this content"

A source with knowledge of the negotiations said the deal is done and that the fight will take place on either 19 or 26 December.Paul had originally been scheduled to fight Gervonta Davis on 14 November at the Kaseya Center, but the event was cancelled after Davis was removed from the cardamid domestic violence allegations.Davis’s former partner, Courtney Rossel, filed a civil lawsuit in Miami-Dade County accusing the lightweight champion of battery, aggravated battery, false imprisonment, kidnapping and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Miami Gardens police confirmed they are investigating the alleged incident, which Rossel says occurred at the strip club where she works. She was granted a restraining order shortly afterwards.Most Valuable Promotions, Paul’s company, and Netflixscrapped the showsoon after the lawsuit became public. “Our team has worked closely with all parties to navigate this situation responsibly,” Nakisa Bidarian, MVP’s chief executive, said at the time. “While we will not be moving forward with this event, our plan still remains for Jake Paul to headline an event on Netflix in 2025.”Paul responded bypublicly lambasting Davis on X, calling him “an actual walking human piece of garbage” and apologizing to undercard fighters and staff affected by the cancellation.After Davis’s withdrawal, Paul’s team explored other opponents, including Ryan Garcia and undisputed super middleweight champion Terence Crawford. Talks then accelerated with Joshua, the former two-time unified heavyweight champion, who has not fought sincebeing stopped by Daniel Duboisin September 2024.Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, had said the 36-year-old hoped to return before the end of the year, with early 2026 also possible. A December fight with Paul would mark Joshua’s first appearance in more than 15 months and gives Netflix, whose boxing telecasts have includedPaul’s fight with Mike TysonandCrawford’s showdown with Canelo Álvarez, a marquee replacement for the scrapped Davis bout.A source familiar with the deal saidNetflixexpects to lock in the exact date before Monday’s announcement. The fight is expected to take place in Miami and stream globally on the platform.Netflix’s first boxing show – Paul’s bout with Tyson – became the most-streamed sporting event in history, peaking at 65m live concurrent streams and drawing an estimated 108m average live viewers worldwide, the company saidin a press release. The broadcast accounted for 56% of all US television viewing during the fight’s main event hour and was the platform’s No 1 title that week across 78 countries.Explore more on these topicsAnthony JoshuaBoxingTerence CrawfordMike TysonCanelo ÁlvarezNetflixUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I did not mean to offend anyone. It was just, we’re having fun,” Amon-Ra St Brownsaid on the St Brown Podcast. “If any president was at that game and had a dance I would have done it. It had nothing to do with who the president was.”Trump missed seeing the dance in person: St Brown’s rendition came after he scored a touchdown in the first quarter, before the president arrived. Trump did, however, post a clip of the receiver’s dance to social media later with a caption calling him “Amon-Ra St Trump”.Trump has a testy relationship with the league and its players, although he has support from NFL stars such as Nick Bosa and Harrison Butker and attended last season’s Super Bowl. During his first term, he described NFLplayers protesting against social injusticeas “sons of bitches”. In his second term he has urged the Commanders torevert to their previous racist nicknameandattacked the league’s decisionto choose Trump critic Bad Bunny to play the Super Bowl’s halftime show this season.“We were just having fun, doing the dance. Nothing more, nothing less,” St Brown said on the podcast.On Sunday, Trump became the first sitting president to attend a regular-season NFL game since Jimmy Carter in 1978.Trump was booedby large sections of the crowd, and reports have emerged that he wants the Commandersto name their new stadium after him.Explore more on these topicsDetroit LionsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I tried to play the best tennis possible when it mattered,” he said.“Sascha played great tennis and I am very pleased with how I handled it.”Canada’sFelix Auger-Aliassimekept his hopes of a place in the semis alive with a comeback win overBen Shelton.The 25-year-old, beaten by Sinner in his first round-robin match, came to within two points of another defeat in a second-set tie-break but rallied to beat big-serving American Shelton 4-6, 7-6 (7), 7-5.Shelton is eliminated while Zverev will face Auger-Aliassime for a place in the semis.On the match, Auger-Aliassime said: “He [Shelton] was playing much better than me at the start. It was a weird start, but as the match went on I was finding ways to put returns in the court.”In the doubles,Joe SalisburyandNeal Skupskimade the semi-finals as they bid to become the first all-British pair to win the title.

If I have to fight for something, I’ll fight’Donald McRaeHead of F1 Academy explains how close she came to a grand prix debut, her quest to produce female drivers, and a frightening knock on her hotel room door by a powerful man in the sportWed 12 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 13.29 ESTShare“There was a deep loneliness to karting, and then definitely in single‑seaters, because no one else was going through the same thing as me,” says Susie Wolff as she remembers her long struggle in motor sport, from racing as a teenager against Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg to her determined, but unfulfilled, quest to become aFormula Onedriver.“After the whole #MeToo movement, we forget what it was like before. But the way I heard boys talking about girls in the paddock made me think: ‘I never want to be spoken about in that way.’ I realised I’d have to be whiter than white to get through it unscathed.”‘Focus on driving and talk less’: Ferrari president hits back at Lewis HamiltonRead moreThe 42-year-old says: “I couldn’t open up to anyone until I met [her husband] Toto. But I’m definitely happy that the next generation will never have to go through that because there’s a camaraderie in F1 Academy. These young women have other women they can look up to or reach out to and there won’t be that isolation I felt.”Wolff is the managing director of the F1 Academy, the all-female racing championship she has led since 2023. The aim is to offer young women opportunities to develop in competitive racing with the long-term ambition of producing a female F1 driver.It seems apt that our interview should take place in the middle of a kart test session for her and Toto’s eight‑year-old son, Jack. The memories rise up and she speaks with even more passion about rocketing female interest in motor sport compared with her own solitary journey through prejudice and inequality. “I can’t believe the number of young girls in karting now,” she says. “I was always the only one – or there might have been just one other girl.”In her revealing new book, Wolff shines a stark light on the difficulties she faced. As the boys tried to dismiss or intimidate her “it became clear that being quick wasn’t enough. I had to toughen up, find an aggression that didn’t come naturally.”View image in fullscreenSusie’s mother, Sally Stoddart, on three wheels in her racing days.Photograph: Courtesy of Susie WolffShe recounts an early clash in karting when an entitled boy was incensed he could not overtake a little Scottish girl. He slammed into the back of her kart before driving her off the track. They were called in by the clerk of the course and the boy and his hectoring father blamed Susie for the crash. She calmly demolished their argument and the clerk disqualified the boy.“I toughened up from a young age,” Wolff says. “and that held me in good stead for later in life. It also had negatives because you end up being so hardened. But I can now be very punchy and pragmatic and if I have to fight for something I’ll fight.”At the junior world karting championships in 2000 she fought her way through a vast field to finish a creditable 15th. But she felt embarrassed when, after the main prizes were awarded, she was called up to the podium and announced as the best female kart driver in the world.“I wasn’t there to be the top female,” she says. “I was there to try and be the best. There were 130 drivers so I was well inside the top 15%. But I was being singled out as the best female and it was the moment I realised: ‘OK, I’m seen as different.’ When I moved into single-seaters [cars] that intensified year-on-year.”Motor racing is outrageously expensive and as she climbed through the classes she needed sponsors, most of whom wanted her to live up to a girly stereotype by driving a pink car and looking pretty in photoshoots. “I just wanted to be seen as a racer, but at the time there was also this idea that any girl in racing was a tomboy. I wasn’t that and it was very hard navigating.“I remember being with Mercedes-Benz in DTM [Germany’s elite sports car series], thinking: ‘If I wear a dress, they might not take me seriously because they’ll think I’m trying to look pretty. But I want to wear a dress. If I wear a suit maybe they’ll think I’m butch.’“It brought in an insecurity that only became easier when I met Toto. He said: ‘Be you. If that means wearing a dress, wear a dress. Being authentic is the easiest way to navigate the pathway.’”Susie Wolff kart-racing as a teenager, with the Scotland flag proudly displayed.Photograph: Courtesy of Susie WolffIn 2007, she endured a harrowing experience when, in the early hours of the morning after a glitzy function, an immensely powerful man in F1 banged on her hotel room door, demanding to see her. Wolff’s distress and fear, of being assaulted and of the man’s capacity to ruin her embryonic career, are detailed in the most searing pages of her book. “It was important to write about because many women have those situations where a split second can change everything. I was lucky he didn’t get in the room, but people should realise how frightening it is.”When she saw the man months later he apologised. But, Wolff says, “for a couple of years, I couldn’t tell anyone”.Toto was the first person she told. “We got together in 2009 and that’s the first time I opened up. [The man] could have damaged my career massively or he could have helped my career massively. I didn’t want either. I wanted to stand on my own two feet and because of the way I was brought up I would have fought him. But that’s also because I was toughened from so many years within that environment.”Does the man know she has written about that night? “I would think so, but I don’t know. I haven’t had any more contact.”View image in fullscreenThe F1 Academy is the all-female racing championship Wolff has been in charge of since 2023.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Formula 1/Getty ImagesShe became a test driver for Williams and before the opening race of the 2015 season seemed close to her F1 debut. Valtteri Bottas injured his back during qualifying and Wolff believed she would replace him, only to be devastated when Pat Symonds, the technical director at Williams, called in Adrian Sutil, who had no connection to the team.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I remember thinking: ‘If you’re not going to give me the chance now, you never will.’ I said to Totoit would be my last season. It’s never going to be a reality, so let’s stop now.”If she had been given the opportunity would she have done well? “Do I think I could have jumped in and gone quicker than Felipe Massa [the No 1 driver at Williams]? No. Do I think I could have jumped in and been very respectable? Absolutely.”In 2023, when F1 Academy started,Wolff predicted there would be a female Formula One driver within 10 years. Does she still believe this? “I regret saying 10 years because one of my academy drivers might think I don’t believe in them. But I definitely think it will happen within the next 10 years. I see the talent coming through and there will be a girl good enough to be given the chance.”There are other battles to be won.Wolff continues to fight against the FIA after the governing bodysubjected her and Toto to a conflict-of-interest investigation in December 2023. An allegation was made to the FIA that confidential information had been shared between a team and the sport’s owner, Formula One Management. Susie reports to FOM as the head of F1 Academy, while Toto remains the team principal of Mercedes.The investigation didn’t take long, with the couple cleared and backed by the other team principals. “It was so absurd,” she says, “because I had zero to do with the F1 business. That infuriated me and then the case was dropped within 48 hours without anybody investigating anything.“The F1 teams all united, which they very rarely do, and issued a joint statement saying: ‘We have no issue with any conflict of interest and nobody had ever made a complaint.’ Suddenly the investigation was over and it was very difficult to get my head around it.”Wolff says herlegal case against the FIAcontinues in robust detail. “All these things take a lot of time, but it’s ongoing. That’s why I did it, even knowing it could take years. I wouldn’t have done it if I didn’t think it was worthwhile. So now it’s just about being patient.”Susie Wolff: ‘Getting a woman on the F1 grid is eight to 10 years away’Read moreToto Wolff told me last yearthat Red Bull’s Christian Horner had been the only principal who had been initially reluctant to sign the joint agreement supporting them. Was she hurt by Horner’s lack of support? “No. It was no surprise at all.”Was that because of Horner’s fractious relationship with Toto? “100%, yes. I don’t allow any of that to worry me. I hold myself to very high standards. I know how much the F1 Academy means and the positive impact it has on the sport. That’s why there will always be those that are for it, those that are against it.”Wolff praises Hamilton for his unstinting support of female drivers – with a commitment to equality she says is unmatched by anyone else on the F1 grid. But it’s almost time for Wolff to get back to the track to support her little boy.“These girls today are not just competing [in karting],” she says. “They’re racing for podiums. I overheard Jack a few months ago at the final of the Easykart World Championship and he was racing against this little girl, Greta. The boys were discussing who would make the podium.“One of them said: ‘Greta’s going to be really strong. She might win it.’ They all said: ‘Yeah, Greta.’ They speak about her as just another competitor, a potential winner of the race. There’s no: ‘Oh, Greta, the girl.’”A tangled smile spreads across Wolff’s face. “Twenty years ago I was ‘the girl’ and it was embarrassing if you got beaten by me. Whereas the next generation see these young girls are quick and that it’s completely normal to be racing them. The whole mindset has shifted and we now just need the talent pool to widen so that we have a 50‑50 split between boys and girls.”Driven, by Susie Wolff (Hodder & Stoughton, £25).To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

A majority of athletes said to me: ‘Just let me know. Let me know early, and I’ll start training to run three 100s in one day.’”View image in fullscreen‘It’s such an exciting opportunity,’ says Great Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith of the surprise decision to stage all three rounds of the 100m on the same day.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAWorld Athletics said that it had arranged the schedule to allow as many athletes as possible to “double up”, not only in events such as the 100m and 200m but also the 800m and 1500m, and the 1500m and 5,000m. It said that there would be 10 days of competition at the LA Coliseum, with a mixed 100m relay having its debut, as well as three days of road events at the end of the Games.“We have landed on an athletics programme that will start with a bang as our women’s sprinters take centre stage on day one,” the World Athletics president, Seb Coe, said. “It is a schedule that is both innovative but also honours tradition, with the men’s marathon on the final day.”However, the schedule makes it unlikely that the US sprinter Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone will be able to run in both the 400m and the 400m hurdles, given the 400m hurdles semi-finals and the 400m final are on the same day.View image in fullscreen‘We have landed on an athletics programme that will start with a bang as our women’s sprinters take centre stage on day one,’ says the World Athletics president, Seb Coe.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesSwimming has traditionally kicked off the Summer Games. But as it is taking place in SoFi Stadium, where the opening ceremony will be staged, it will now start in the second week.Organisers also confirmed that day one will feature the most women’s finals in a single day in the Games’ history, with the women’s triathlon gold medal among those up for grabs. Also scheduled is a Super Saturday on the penultimate day, with 26 gold medals across 23 sports in play.Shana Ferguson, LA28’s chief of sport and games delivery, said the plan is to sell about 14 million tickets across 51 Olympic sports at 49 venues, with public sales due to begin in April 2026. Ferguson also confirmed that organisers would not employ the controversial dynamic pricing model that provoked outrage among Oasis fans in the summer and was trialled by Fifa at the football Club World Cup in the US.Explore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028Olympic GamesAthleticsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The Spanish champions regard the 32-year-old England captain as the ideal younger replacement for the 37-year-old Pole, whose contract expires in June, and may well be prepared to trigger the clause in Kane’s contract withBayern Munichthat would allow him to leave for £57m in the summer.Kane has proven a huge success at Bayern since joining them from ­Tottenhamfor £100m in August 2023, scoring an astonishing 108 goals in 113 appearances. In September, he became the fastest player this century to reach 100 goals for a club playing in one of Europe’s top five leagues. He also ended his trophy drought in May afterplaying a key role in Bayern reclaiming the Bundesliga title.Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball.

His lawyer, Mark Eiglarsh, said Brown would return to his home in Broward County, Florida, while the case proceeds.“He no longer has a passport. He’ll be living at his home. I look forward to working with him zealously on this case,” Eiglarsh told Circuit Judge Mindy Glazer at a bond hearing.Brown appeared at the hearing via video wearing a red jail shirt and spoke only to answer questions from the judge. Prosecutors had sought pretrial detention, contending Brown is a high-paid former professional athlete with the resources to flee.According to an arrest warrant, Brown is accused of grabbing a handgun from a security stafferafter a celebrity boxing match in Miami on 16 Mayand firing two shots at a man he had gotten into a fistfight with earlier. The victim, Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu, told investigators that one of the bullets grazed his neck.Brown’s attorney said Wednesday that the affidavit is mistaken and that Brown actually used his personal firearm, and that the shots were not aimed at anyone.“It was my client’s own gun,” Eiglarsh said.Based on his social media posts, Brown had been living in Dubai for several months. In a social media post after the altercation, Brown said he was defending himself because he was “jumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry and cause physical harm to me”.Eiglarsh said Brown has unspecified business interests in Dubai and always intended to turn himself in on the attempted murder charge.“He didn’t flee to Dubai,” the lawyer said. “He always had a desire and intention to answer this case.”Brown, who spent 12 years in the NFL, was an All-Pro wide receiver wholast played in 2021 for Tampa Baybut spent most of his career with Pittsburgh. For his career, Brown had 928 receptions for more than 12,000 yards and accounted for 88 total touchdowns counting punt returns and one pass.Explore more on these topicsNFLMiamiUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Parking at a quarter-final match in Kansas City at Arrowhead Stadium on 11 July would cost ticket holders $125 while the price for group-stage matches was $75.Fifa, which used dynamic pricing for the first phase of ticket sales for the tournament, had group-stage seats starting at $60.Although the prices will seem high for fans outside the US, they are comparable to costs for NFL games at those stadiums. The cheapest ticket on resale for Philadelphia Eagles v Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium on 23 Novemberis $95, while prices for parking at the Kansas City Chiefs’ next home game at Arrowheadstart at $69.While stadiums at the last World Cup in Qatar were generally easily accessible by public transport – as are most stadiums in Europe – the same is not the case for many of the 2026 World Cup venues, including those in Kansas City and Dallas, although there will be shuttle services and rideshares available.Only a handful of the 16 World Cup venues across Canada, Mexico and the United States had parking passes listed for sale online as of Tuesday. Mexico City, which will host the first match of the tournament, and New York/New Jersey, which will host the final, were among the cities that did not have parking available yet. New York/New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium is accessible by public transport, although the processis not always smooth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When Ezri Konsa strolled in to preview Thursday’s World Cup qualifier against Serbia at Wembley, theEnglanddefender did so in what, at first glance, appeared to be a cross between a pair of slippers and oversized Crocs. In garish, fluorescent red.On closer inspection, it was possible to make out grooves and nodules on them, and then it was time for the science part. Apparently, if you wear these your concentration improves. Well, that is according to the manufacturer. Something to do with the pressure points on the foot, perhaps. Was Konsa convinced? Unclear. How aboutThomas Tuchel? Ditto.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford tries on a pair of Nike Mind footwear.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty Images“I don’t know the science behind it,” the England head coach said. “They are desperate to tell me, but I haven’t found time to get my head around it. But all the players are wearing them. They told me they can focus better in meetings if they wear these shoes and I hope they believe it. Maybe the most important thing is that they believe it.”Put it down as one for the marginal gains department. Or simply the power of positive thought, which is something Tuchel, a longtime practitioner of meditation, can get behind. He tries to meditate once a day, even if he concedes that twice would be ideal.“It helps me with my discipline … it helps me to calm down, to focus and be aware,” he said. “It’s not like you do it and it’s immediately: ‘Oh wow.’ It’s more of an ongoing thing. The more you do it the more effect you feel, but it’s subtle.”Tuchel was asked what stressed him out. “Oh, journalists, players … sporting directors,” he said. Which got a laugh, given his previous for fallouts with the last of these. He talked, too, about the work within the England camp of Suzanne Scott, the pilates teacher and movement expert. “She does fantastic breathwork sessions,” he said. “She does more stuff than just that, but she does it and the players buy into it. They feel the relief.”The wider point of all this is a major theme of the camp, which concludes with the final qualifier against Albania in Tirana on Sunday: the notion of England looking within themselves to maintain and drive standards. A major external stimulus has been removed. With World Cup qualification sewn up, there will be no jeopardy against Serbia and Albania. Or, indeed, in the March friendlies the Football Association will line up – it is in talks about facing Japan and Uruguay.England will fine-tune for the finals in North America with warm‑up games, probably in Florida. But only when they play their opening group match will the pressure be dialled up. The heat of meaningful competition cannot be replicated, even if Serbia and Albania continue to battle for qualification berths. Serbia are also about to begin life under a new manager, Veljko Paunovic.A related detail is the Wembley crowd, to whichTuchel offered pointed feedbackafterthe friendly win against Wales last month. Not enough noise, not enough energy. He knows it will be up to his players to spark the fans, not the other way around.View image in fullscreenEzri Konsa takes part in England training. The defender is one of many players wearing special footwear off the field.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/Reuters“Maybe it’s important to acknowledge it,” he said, when asked about the lack of jeopardy. “Will we get the full thrill of it tomorrow? Maybe not. Will it be the same in the first knockout match at the finals? No. Will it be the same if we needed a win against Serbia to qualify? No, it is impossible.“But why should we not run? We still do our stuff, we still run at people, we still go after them. The environment and circumstances don’t give the edge, but still we have a lot to prove to ourselves.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rather, it is a moment to double down on the approach that brought progress in the September and October camps, the first of which featured the transformative5-0 win against Serbiain Belgrade when the heat was very much on.It will be about sticking to the system; a 6, an 8 and a 10 in midfield with specialist wingers on both sides. It will mean players fitting in, being used in their best positions – nobody shoehorned in on the basis of individual talent. It will be Jude Bellingham or Foden or Morgan Rogers in the No 10 role. Bellingham, Foden and the centre‑forward, Harry Kane, will surelynot be on the pitch at the same time.It will be a time to build on the connections, to complete part III of the mission from the autumn – the creation of a clear playing style, an identity. Also to further cement the hierarchies in each position. And the brotherhood within the squad, as Tuchel calls it. Spirit is everything. For the manager, it comes before selections, before tactics.Foden, Bellingham and Kane cannot all start in England’s system, insists TuchelRead moreAt this distance, it is possible to feel eight of the lineup for the opening World Cup match are pretty nailed on. Tuchel did not disagree with the number. Those players would be Jordan Pickford, Reece James, John Stones, Declan Rice, Elliot Anderson, Bukayo Saka, Bellingham and Kane. It would probably be Konsa or Marc Guéhi as the second centre-half; Marcus Rashford or Anthony Gordon on the left wing. The most open position, the most problematic, is left‑back, where Djed Spence and Nico O’Reilly are duelling.Tuchel’s idea is to focus on plan A, the clarity of roles; not to obsess about contingencies. The idea is that the back-ups will step up as required. It is the structure that is king – along with the motivation from within.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Skinner said: “It might be [the Hampton-England issue], might be a bit of a returning ex-United player, but I’m pleased she got the reception at the end.”United made their bow in European competition at the club’s storied home having lost 1-0 at Aston Villa on Saturday in the Women’s Super League, but with a perfect six points in the competition after beating Atlético Madrid and Valerenga.Skinner’s five changes from that defeat included dropping to the bench Ella Toone and the top scorer, Elisabeth Terland, while injury meant Phallon Tullis-Joyce, United’s No 1, was not in the squad.A punch-out of a steepling Jayde Riviere ball was Earps’s first act; it came just before the half-hour, an indicator of the mundane fare the crowd of about 15,000 consumed. But soon Earps was beaten.Riviere’s sweeping ball along the right was taken on by Malard. The striker bundled aside Griedge Mbock Bathy and zigzagged for goal; the shot flew past Earps – whose dive seemed low – and into the far-left corner.This boosted the home fans and the next round of boos aimed at Earps were enthusiastic, though it felt more pantomime stuff than vindictive. More potent was the Ajibade corkscrewed cross that had Middleton-Patel scrambling to jab on to her bar, before a 20‑yard Carmona shot smacked the top‑left corner of the net.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Far simpler was Earps clutching an insipid Anna Sandberg free-kick that United’s left‑back floated straight into the gloves and far better was what Sandberg did next: slick Jess Park footwork was followed by the midfielder feeding Sandberg whose cross from the left was pinpoint for Rolfö: the Swede’s header gave Earps no chance.View image in fullscreenDespite the boos and jeers, there was still a sizeable amount of appreciation for Mary Earps from the Manchester United fans.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesAdvantage United, who soon had Malard running in from the right, shooting and drawing a fine save from Earps, low to her left.Skinner introduced Toone, Terland and Leah Galton for a final phase in which United, again, resisted PSG: so, a job well done for those in red, making it a losing return for Earps, the woman of the moment.As Skinner said, this will all “blow over” soon for her amid the ever‑fast news cycle.

It marked a turning point in their season, demonstrating a mental toughness that carried them to a second Champions League title. Their meltdown here showed they are yet to recapture the spirit that ensured success in May.More than 400 Arsenal fans had made the trip to Munich, many filing into Hofbräuhaus, the city’s famous beer hall, before the game for their pre-match meet-up, ready to try to outdo the 15,000-strong home crowd.Daphne van Domselaar, the Arsenal goalkeeper, had said her team had “showed everything we had” in their frustrating 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Saturday.The aim, though, was to take the energy of that impressive second-half display to Germany with them. In Munich they stuck to the plan and there was no repeat of that sluggish beginning.View image in fullscreenMariona Caldentey scores Arsenal’s second goal.Photograph: Alex Burstow/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesThey opened on the front foot.

Bayern’s determination to play out from the back had been risky and was exploited. Mead intercepted Stine Ballisager’s stray pass and laid off the ball to Stina Blackstenius, who poked it towards Mariona Caldentey on the edge of the box. The mercurial midfielder took a touch to alleviate pressure from Tanikawa and lashed past Grohs.The energy inexplicably lessened in the second half. Arsenal took their foot off the gas, their first-half domination lulling them into a state of complacency.José Barcala turned to his bench to try to get his team back into the game: the former Chelsea forward Pernille Harder, whose hat‑trick in October 2024 took the game from 2-2 to 5-2, came on and Arianna Caruso and Alara Sehitler arrived soon after. The latter made Arsenal sweat first, flying away on the break and collecting from Klara Bühl before guiding the ball past Van Domselaar.View image in fullscreenGlódis Viggósdóttir fires past Daphne van Domselaar in the Arsenal goal.Photograph: Jasmin Walter/Uefa/Getty ImagesIt was Bayern in the ascendancy and after the deficit was reduced they turned up the pressure on the visitors, sensing they could take something from the game. Predictably, Harder delivered, clipping a looping ball in from the edge of the area to level.They didn’t just want to take something, though: they wanted it all, and six minutes later they had the lead, Glódis Viggósdóttir turning in at the near post from Bühl’s cross.“We dominated the first half, the second half was Bayern’s,” Slegers said. “What they start to do, especially after their first goal, they start to play in behind and they start to play a long-ball, second-ball game and they stack numbers high, and we don’t deal with it well enough.”One win from three Champions League games means Arsenal’s chances of making the top four and earning a quarter-final place automatically are slim and a spot in the February playoffs might also be at risk.“We need to use these games as fuel,” Slegers said. “We know we need points in the Champions League, so this was a big hit. We have to get back, we will get back.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueBayern Munich WomenArsenal WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Although the venue came alive during last season’s successful Europa League campaign, the club’s return to the Champions League has resulted in crowds of 54,755 and 49,565 forhome fixtures against Villarrealand Copenhagen.Boos have also been a frequent feature, despite Thomas Frank talking up the need to turn the stadium into a fortress. The supporters’ trust said fans were being priced out of attending games.Van de Ven stunner inspires 10-man Spurs to emphatic win over CopenhagenRead more“Over the last couple of seasons, it’s undeniable that the atmosphere has declined at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The reasons are simple – too many empty seats and too many supporters, particularly young supporters, priced out of attending. Thin the crowd and you thin the noise,” a THST statement said.“Europa League nights last season, with sensibly priced tickets, proved the point: fair ticket pricing fills the ground, often with the next generation of Spurs fans. And the noise follows. This season, the illusion has gone. TheChampions League– our flagship nights – has seen thousands of empty seats, in our view due to unrealistic and unaffordable match pricing.“Even big Premier League games have shown gaps we’ve never known at Tottenham. A world-class stadium without a full house is only half a home. The South Stand – 17,000 strong – was a brilliant idea, but it hasn’t consistently fulfilled its potential. It’s not yet the relentless wall of sound we all dreamt of and that’s a problem pricing and access can fix.“We’re asking the club to make ticketing fair and affordable and encourage the next generation of all match-going fans, so the stands are packed, every match, all season. Fill our home – and we’ll find our voice again.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurFootball ticket pricesChampions LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Women can bring a different point of view, an added value even in this field.”At 23, Rizzo has made history. In September the entrepreneur became president of Ternana Calcio, a Serie C club from Umbria, becoming the first woman in the club’s hundred-year history to hold the role. “It’s a huge responsibility, but also an opportunity to bring something different,” she says. “I want to prove that women can lead in football just as they do in any other field.”‘L’ultima bandiera’: Domenico Berardi raises final flag for loyalty in football | Nicky BandiniRead moreRizzo was born in Rome to Gian Luigi Rizzo and Laura Melis, part of a family well known in Italian business circles. Her father heads the Villa Claudia group, a private healthcare company that runs medical clinics in Rome and Syracuse. The family’s interests have gradually expanded from healthcare into sport and agriculture, sectors that intertwine in Claudia’s story.“I started out as a small entrepreneur in the agricultural sector with my family, in Noto, Sicily,” she says. “At the same time, I began working in our family’s medical clinics, so my main fields were healthcare and agriculture. Football, though, has always been a real passion of mine as a fan. Then this opportunity came along, thanks to my family, and I decided to take it. At this age, I think it’s right to take chances and throw yourself into things; that’s how it was for me in agriculture too. You’re not born a farmer or an entrepreneur, you become one.”The acquisition of Ternana by the Villa Claudia group was part of a wider plan involving the joint construction of a new Liberati Stadium and an adjacent private clinic, a combined investment worth about €80m (£70.2m). The project, designed to create a modern hub for sport and healthcare in Terni, has encountered bureaucratic, political and financial hurdles, but remains central to the group’s long-term vision for the city. The goal, Rizzo explains, is to root the club in the community. “Ternana is more than a football team,” she says. “It’s part of the city’s identity, and we want to give it stability and future strength.”Although her family’s name looms large over the operation, Claudia is determined to establish herself as an independent president. “I’m learning how to manage the club almost fully,” she says. “It’s important for me to show that I’m not just here because of my family. I’m here to work, to learn, and to earn respect.”View image in fullscreenAccording to Rizzo: ‘A president shouldn’t be distant. The players must feel that there’s support and stability behind them.’Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianRizzo grew up surrounded by football. “I used to go to the stadium with my dad when I was little. When I was born, my father congratulated my mother not so much for giving birth, but because she did it on the same day his team won the Scudetto! So yes, I’ve grown up with football. It’s a fascinating world, full of emotions, sometimes good and sometimes tough, but always stimulating.”Her arrival in Italian football came in a period of transition for the lower leagues, often shaken by financial and judicial troubles, with the Serie B club Juve Stabia last month placed under judicial administration foralleged criminal infiltration, according to the public prosecutor’s office. “It’s not the first time things like this have happened, and probably not the last,” she says. “Football is a business, and like in any business there can be problems. The only thing you can do is focus on your own work and avoid repeating others’ mistakes. We want to run things cleanly and transparently, and that’s what we’re doing at Ternana.”Within the club’s structure, Rizzo works alongside Tiziana Pucci, the managing director and a trusted associate of Massimo Ferrero, the former Sampdoria owner. Ferrero is often seen around the stadium and training ground, although his role remains undefined.Although Rizzo commutes daily between Rome and Terni, she has quickly bonded with the local community. “I’m still getting to know the city, but people are kind, welcoming and I feel comfortable here. A president shouldn’t be distant. The players must feel that there’s support and stability behind them. That sense of calm is vital, and I’m sure that with commitment and the right mindset we can have a good season and make everyone proud.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The academy is our future: young players need guidance, support, and the right environment to grow.”View image in fullscreenRizzo celebrates a goal for Ternana against Arezzo.Photograph: Roberto Salomone/The GuardianHer words mirror her leadership: composed, practical but with a clear sense of belonging. “I see youth as a strength,” she says. “It allows you to bring fresh ideas and a modern approach. At Ternana, it’s important to build a bridge between the new and older generations while keeping the club’s identity alive. I want to do a good job here and meet the expectations of the fans, the team, and the staff. If this world continues to welcome me and if I prove myself, I’d love to see myself in 20 years still as a president, maybe even of another club. Who knows?”She returns to the theme that opened the conversation, the one that defines her story in football and in Italy. “The key is to send a clear message: football isn’t just for men,” Rizzo says. “You don’t have to be a man to run a club or work in football management. The future is female, and little by little football will welcome more women who can give the game fresh energy and a positive push forward.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The UAE are, however, merely another participant in a naturalisation arms race in the continent that has been boosted by the expansion of the World Cup from 32 teams to 48.Asia’s allocation has doubled from four automatic spots in Qatar to eight in North America, opening up the tournament to a new array of contenders desperate to play on the greatest stage of all. Japan, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Australia have historically dominated World Cup qualifying, with North Korea the most recent outlier in 2010. Those six are the only teams from the Asian Football Confederation to make more than one appearance at the tournament.Son Heung-min’s legacy: Asian fans are Tottenham for life after trailblazing impactRead moreThe relative lack of World Cup places for Asian nations over the decades has led to some federations from the continent lacking motivation in regards to qualifying. Fifa’s expansion has changed that. In addition to the usual suspects who have already qualified for 2026, Uzbekistan, for some time the loudest knocker on the door of the exclusive club, have made it, as have Jordan. UAE and Iraq – whose sole appearances came in 1990 and 1986 respectively – also have a chance. Others further down the rankings now see the World Cup as a real possibility and if foreign-born talent can give them a quick push in that direction, then few seem to complain.“The expansion has fuelled this drive to naturalise,” Shaji Prabhakaran, a member of the AFC’s executive committee, said. “More World Cup places mean more hope for countries everywhere and more opportunities. They feel that if they pursue a program of naturalisation then they can fast-track to improve their quality, performance and results and so they have a chance to qualify.”Bringing in overseas talent is not new, of course. Qatar went big in the 2000s to the extent that Fifa tightened eligibility rules. These days, players must have family connections or have played in the respective domestic league for five years. The latter is the preferred method of the UAE, who have naturalised Brazilians, mainly. Lucas Pimenta, Marcus Meloni, Luanzinho, Bruno Oliveira, Caio Lucas, and Caio Canedo have been named in the latest squad. Nicolás Giménez and Gastón Suárez are Argentine-born, and there are others from Morocco, Tunisia and Côte d’Ivoire. UAE’s Romanian coach, Cosmin Olaroiu, could almost select an entire team born outside the Gulf State.Indonesia came closer to qualifying for the World Cup than at any time since 1938, making it to the final 12, with that progress in large part down to the Football Association of Indonesia taking advantage of ties to the Netherlands, a former coloniser. Barely a month has gone by in the past year or two when a Dutch-born player with an Indonesian grandparent has not headed to the nearest embassy to be given a passport. At times there were eight or nine European-born starters in Indonesia’s starting XI, changing the nature of the team to an extent thatPatrick Kluivert got the coaching job in January.View image in fullscreenDutch-born Kevin Diks, seen here scoring for Borussia Mönchengladbach, represents Indonesia.Photograph: Jürgen Fromme/firo sportphoto/Getty ImagesTalents such as Kevin Diks, who scored his first Bundesliga goal for Borussia Mönchengladbach at the weekend, have made a real difference, and the hope in Jakarta is that as Indonesia gets closer to reaching a World Cup, more talented players who are eligible to play for them will consider donning the red and white if theoranjeis not guaranteed.Indonesia have become the strongest national team in south-east Asia and their rapid rise undeniably played a part in Malaysian thinking. In September,Fifa accused the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM)of forging documents of seven players from Brazil, Argentina, Spain and the Netherlands to claim they had grandparents born in the country. Those seven all played in a 4-0 win against Vietnam in June, Malaysia’s best result in years, and were subsequently suspended from representing the country for one year, while the FAM was also fined $438,000 (£333,000).The case has now been referred by Malaysian officials to the court of arbitration for sport, but it too highlighted the impact of naturalisation and, in that regard, it is unlikely to be a coincidence that there followed reports of the Vietnam’s Football Association having their eye on three or four Brazilian-born players who, next year, will reach the five-year mark in the V-League. Sri Lanka have also seen their fortunes improve, in part due to an influx ofplayers born in Europe and Australia.The UAE often play in front of four-figure crowds at home but there are no tickets left for the 36,000-capacity Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium for Thursday’s first leg against Iraq. Quite clearly when a World Cup is on the horizon, success-starved supporters do not mind too much who plays for their national team. The dream is still on.Explore more on these topicsWorld CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the ground they put on the items to look like stewards and managed to get into a restricted area, just metres from the pitch, less than an hour before kick-off of this highly anticipated game.”Assistant chief constable Tony Rowlinson, gold commander for the policing operation around the game, said: “This was a ridiculous plot to try and see the game, despite knowing tickets were sold out and those without tickets would not be getting in. They clearly came with the intention to get into the stadium illegally, bringing hi-vis vests with ‘steward’ on the back, with one even carrying a radio and earpiece.“However, what they didn’t bank on was the professionalism and vigilance of the club’s security team and our officers, who quickly spotted they weren’t wearing any accreditation and worked together to eject them. Their actions have seen them face very serious consequences in court today and for two people who were so desperate to see this one game, they will now not be able to go to any for three years.“I would like to thank the stewards who spotted something was wrong and took immediate action, as well as our officers who swiftly intervened and helped ensure they had their day in court.

Senior figures from Uefa and the host FAs were barracked as they arrived at the venue by about 50 pro-Palestine demonstrators, who called for Israel to be kicked out of international football because of the Gaza crisis. Banners were held up with slogans reading “Show Israel the red card” and “You are complicit”, while protesters chanted: “Kick Israel out.”The opening game of Euro 2028 will be held at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff, on Friday 9 June, a match that will involve Wales if they qualify. Wembley will host both semi-finals and the final, which will be played on Sunday 9 July with a kick-off time at 5pm. It is hoped that an earlier start, which will also be implemented for Champions League finals from next season, will appeal to families and help reach a broader range of audiences.The Republic of Ireland are due to play their first game at the Dublin Arena and Scotland would follow suit at Hampden Park. All four host countries’ teams will enter the qualifying tournament; two automatic spots will be held in reserve for any that do not reach Euro 2028 through that route.Villa Park and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium complete the event’s nine venues. All will hold at least one knockout match, with the quarter-finals held at each country’s national stadium.

His comments raise the prospect of at least one big-name player missing the tournament.Anthony Barry: ‘The England jersey should feel like a cape, not body armour’Read moreTuchel has brought in a structured 4‑3‑3, with one No 10 behind Kane and pacy wingers supporting the captain, and has been clear about defined roles in the team. The German, whose side face Serbia on Thursday night having qualified for the World Cup finals tournament with two games to spare, does not regard Foden as a wide player.Instead the Manchester City attacker is vying with Bellingham and others for a central role. There is no desire on Tuchel’s part to cramp Kane’s style given theEnglandcaptain is a striker who loves to drop back and create.“At the moment, if we keep the structure, they cannot play,” Tuchel told TalkSport. “They can but not in the structure, not for the balance that we developed and not for the structure that comes also with wingers who are specialists in their positions. We play at the moment with a 6, 8, a 10 and a 9.”Bellingham and Fodenhave returned to compete with Morgan Rogers and Eberechi Ezefor the game at Wembley on Thursday and in Albania on Sunday, but there is additional competition from Cole Palmer and Morgan Gibbs-White. Palmer is out with a groin injury and Gibbs-White has not been selected. Rogers is a doubt because of a hamstring injury.View image in fullscreenPhil Foden is not regarded as a wide player by Thomas Tuchel.Photograph: Eddie Keogh/The FA/Getty Images“There’s a lot of players and there’s the chance that we will not take everyone,” Tuchel said. “Not because we don’t like it, not because they don’t individually deserve it, but we will always do what’s best for the team, we will always do what’s best for winning.“We will always do what’s best for balance and we will try to keep the clarity, even if it means that we have to take tough decisions. We take tough decisions in any camp, and this will not change when we go to a tournament.”It remains to be seen whether Bellingham starts instead of Rogers against Serbia. Foden will also hope for an opportunity. He has been described by Tuchel as a “9‑and‑a‑half” and has also been talked about as a false 9. Tuchel was asked whether that left the 25‑year‑old under more pressure. “Yes and no,” he said.“If you’re a unique player, you can play both positions. I think he can play the 9, he can play the 10.

It is the situation at the moment. Anything can change at a tournament but be clear with the players.”Marc Guéhi missed training as he continues his recovery from a foot injury.

He added: “If I am to be charitable, there are flickers of good news.“The number of clubs that are balance sheet insolvent has been reduced to six, from seven. Attendances are up in places. The women’s game continues to shine, buoyed up bya home World Cup victoryand record-breaking crowds.“All of this is wonderful and yet it feels like singing Always Look on the Bright Side of Life as the house burns down around you. But here’s the reality: not a single Premiership team made a profit in 2023‑24. All 10 clubs lost money for the third year in a row.“Right now we areThelma and Louise, foot down, laughing, waving at fans, heading straight off the cliff. Everyone knows it. The players and coaches know it. Fans definitely know it. But the administrators? They’re still checking the rearview mirror.“That is why I actually likethe R360 proposal, whether it happens or not, because it’s daring to do the opposite of everything we’ve done the last 30 years.”View image in fullscreen‘It feels like singing Always Look on the Bright Side of Life as the house burns down around you,’ says James Haskell, the former England international.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe report’s authors stressed there were some signs of optimism, including a growth in ticket sales and viewers. They also noted that Newcastlehad been taken over by Red Bull, and expected one or two clubs may sneak into a profit next year.However, Alex Cadwallader, a Leonard Curtis director and former England Under-21 player, said the underlying problems could not be ignored. “There are no surprises in our latest report. The current model is proven. It is a loss‑making one.“The clubs collectively have been loss-making every year in the last 10 years once the exceptional items such as ground sales in 2014-15 and the CVC investment deal in 2018-19 are removed. The amount of debt continues to grow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The game is reliant on benefactors funding their clubs for which we are grateful. However, this can not continue.”The report suggests that under a restructured franchise system clubs could save between £1.1m to £1.9m annually through economies of scale, sharing services and, initially, reducing the salary cap. “The competition in France is moving forward and disruptors with new models are circling,” Cadwallader said. “The question really should be: why would we not consider a different model?”One of the report’s co-authors, professor Rob Wilson, suggested clubs should consider lowering the salary cap at £4m – a drop of £2.4m – until the financial situation improved. “It has been set at a level to appease players, but the reality is operational losses,” he said. “Smaller clubs are spending way above their means to keep up with the Harlequins of this world.”The report also warns that, while the Red Roses’ World Cup victory has given domestic women’s rugby an unprecedented platform, addressing the lack of competitiveness in Premiership Women’s Rugby (PWR) was vital.Dr Ellie Nesbitt, a senior lecturer in sport management at Nottingham Trent University, said: “While competitive balance in the men’s Premiership remains strong, the significantly lower competitive balance in the PWR is a cause for concern. It risks fan disengagement due to the predictability of the games and results. Closing the gap between elite and emerging teams is essential for the league’s long-term growth and success.”Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyRugby unionSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Until now, the authorities have had to wait until AI-generated CSAM is uploaded online before dealing with it. This law is aimed at heading off that problem by helping to prevent the creation of those images at source.The changes are being introduced by the government as amendments to the crime and policing bill, legislation which is also introducing aban on possessing, creating or distributing AI modelsdesigned to generate child sexual abuse material.This week Narayan visited the London base of Childline, a helpline for children, and listened to a mock-up of a call to counsellors featuring a report of AI-based abuse. The call portrayed a teenager seeking help afterhe had been blackmailedby a sexualised deepfake of himself, constructed using AI.“When I hear about children experiencing blackmail online, it is a source of extreme anger in me and rightful anger amongst parents,” he said.The Internet Watch Foundation, which monitors CSAM online, said reports of AI-generated abuse material – such as a webpage that may contain multiple images – had more than doubled so far this year. Instances of category A material – the most serious form of abuse – rose from 2,621 images or videos to 3,086.Girls were overwhelmingly targeted, making up 94% of illegal AI images in 2025, while depictions of newborns to two-year-olds rose from five in 2024 to 92 in 2025.Kerry Smith, the chief executive of the Internet Watch Foundation, said the law change could “a vital step to make sure AI products are safe before they are released”.“AI tools have made it so survivors can be victimised all over again with just a few clicks, giving criminals the ability to make potentially limitless amounts of sophisticated, photorealistic child sexual abuse material,” she said. “Material which further commodifies victims’ suffering, and makes children, particularly girls, less safe on and off line.”Childline also released details of counselling sessions where AI has been mentioned. AI harms mentioned in the conversations include: using AI to rate weight, body and looks; chatbots dissuading children from talking to safe adults about abuse; being bullied online with AI-generated content; and online blackmail using AI-faked images.Between April and September this year, Childline delivered 367 counselling sessions where AI, chatbots and related terms were mentioned, four times as many as in the same period last year. Half of the mentions of AI in the 2025 sessions were related to mental health and wellbeing, including using chatbots for support and AI therapy apps.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Internet safetyOnline abuseComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

The penalties will be applied at the group level, not to smaller subsidiary brands owned by bigger companies.Treasury has told the government it supports a $250m annual revenue threshold for the new system, and proposed the government use total group revenue generated in Australia as the main metric for payments.Preliminary analysis suggests the value of existing deals with publishers is roughly equivalent to 1.5% of revenue generated in Australia by relevant platforms. The new penalties could be worth 2.25% of revenue, in order to incentivise deal-making under the existing code. Some eligible expenditure could be used to reduce the amount of penalties under the new incentive’s proposed design.Companies will have to self-assess their liabilities under the rules, but the legislation will rely on common definitions of social media and search.Meta does not lodge corporate accounts in Australia but the Australian Facebook subsidiary said in April it had revenues of $1.46bn here in the 12 months to 31 December. The total was up from $1.34bn in the previous year, despite the sluggish advertising market.Trump threatened to impose costly trade tariffs against countries he considered to be treating American companies unfairly. His one-time ally and billionaire adviser Elon Musk owns the platform X.But Labor is moving ahead with the new penalties after Anthony Albanese’ssuccessful meeting at the White House last month.Rod Sims, the former chair of the competition watchdog, has endorsed Labor’s plans for the new penalty system, arguing Google and Facebook benefit from the original content produced by Australian media outlets and that failing to support journalism will allowpoor-quality sources of information to thrive.Sims has previously estimated the commercial deals signed under the code were worth as much as $1bn over four years.The government will consult on the incentive plans until 19 December, before settling a final approach sometime in 2026.Explore more on these topicsMetaSocial mediaLabor partyAnthony AlbaneseDonald TrumpFacebookInstagramShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 12 Nov 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 10.02 ESTShareMost people who really love video games have the capacity to be obsessive. Losing weeks of your life to Civilization, World of Warcraft or Football Manager is something so many of us have experienced. Sometimes, it’s the numbers-go-up dopamine hit that hooks people: playing something such as Diablo or Destiny and gradually improving your character while picking up shiny loot at perfectly timed intervals can send some people into an obsessional trance. Notoriously compulsive games such as Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, meanwhile, suck up hours with peaceful, comforting repetition of rewarding tasks.What triggers obsession in me, though, is a challenge. If a game tells me I can’t do something, I become determined to do it, sometimes to my own detriment. Grinding repetition bores me, but challenges hijack my brain.The first games I got obsessed with like this were music games, when I was a teenager. I played Amplitude, where you are a space DJ blasting notes from your sonic spaceship; Gitaroo Man, a comic-book-style story about a guitar-wielding superhero; and, of course, Guitar Hero with its plastic axe – I was compelled to master every song on expert difficulty. Guitar Hero is ostensibly a party game, but I mostly played it folded over in the cupboard under the stairs of my rubbish flat in Bournemouth (I couldn’t play it in the living room because it annoyed my housemates too much), practising More Than a Feeling 30 times in a row until I was note-perfect.A few years later, I discovered FromSoftware’s Demon’s Souls when I was living in Japan, a game so impenetrable it seemed designed to make you walk away. You’d take three paces into any of its levels and get immediately murdered by a skeleton swordsman or poison-swamp creature. But I sensed something interesting behind all the punishment, and there very muchwas. Demon’s Souls ended up birthing a genre of massively popular and famously challenging games with its sequel, Dark Souls. You couldonlydiscover what was so incredible about these games if you were prepared to invest time and energy in mastering them. It didn’t matter how skilled you were – you had to share knowledge and band together with other players to stand a chance.My tenacity has mostly been useful in my life, because I’ve been able to direct it well. There are plenty of life and career challenges where an inability to give up is handy. I have applied ridiculous determination to learning complicated fingerpicking patterns for a particular guitar song, and towriting books. When it comes to games, though, I sometimes get stuck playing them when I really ought to be doing something else.View image in fullscreenObstinately difficult and painfully funny … Baby Steps.Photograph: Devolver DigitalThe latest example of this for me was Baby Steps, an obstinately difficult andpainfully funnygame about trying to walk the world’s biggest loser up a mountain. There are so many places in this game where putting a single foot wrong can cost you an hour of painstaking progress. I was trapped inside a sandcastle for four hours one evening, sliding down the same sandy spiral slope over and over and over again. My children kept walking into the room and groaning to see mestillplaying it and failing to get anywhere. It was 1am before I finally marched triumphantly out of that sand trap, hours after everyone else in my house had gone to bed. My adrenaline was so high that I couldn’t fall asleep for another hour.The sane thing to do would have been to simply put the controller down. Baby Steps is always teasing you with this. It’sdaringyou to give up. Its most infamous challenge, a winding path up a sheer rock face, is called the Manbreaker, and there’s a spiral staircaserightnext to it.The other game I’ve spent most time with this year is Hollow Knight: Silksong, an exquisite explorative action game whose difficulty walks the line between playfully mean and just outright cruel. There are notoriously difficult bosses that you just cannot avoid, each requiring perhaps hours of practice. One of them, the Last Judge, wields a flaming thurible that generates pillars of damaging flames. If that isn’t bad enough, the path back to its chamber is full of danger: flying drill-headed bugs, perilous drops, aggressive guards. Your nerves are frayed by the time the Last Judge battle even begins. But all of this just made me even more determined to beat it.Challenge is a fine balance to strike for game developers: conventional wisdom says that you want players to be entertained, not discouraged. For a long time, the prevailing fashion was moving away from difficulty and towards eminently conquerable open-world games that never put a wall in the way of your progress. It was Dark Souls that proved there was still a huge market for people like me for whom the challenge is kind of the point. I am inexorably drawn towards mastery of objectively pointless things.Maybe the mastery is the point. You can’t master life. Things will always happen that you can’t control. Difficulties come at you out of nowhere, and you don’t always know how to deal with them. In video games, at least you can anticipate the challenge. And if you try very hard and refuse to give up, you can always, always overcome it.What to playView image in fullscreenA combat-focused game … Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment.Photograph: Nintendo/Koei TecmoI am thoroughly surprised by how much I’m enjoyingHyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, a spin-off of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom that follows what Princess Zelda was up to when she was time travelling through Hyrule’s past. Turns out, she was beating up hundreds and hundreds of dudes. It’s a combat-focused game where you run around the battlefields of ancient Hyrule, or the pitch-black Depths with its many monsters, dispatching everything you see with screen-filling flashy attacks from Zelda’s light magic to scientist Mineru’s automatons. It doesn’t feel like Zelda at all; instead it’s more of a cinematic action game featuring Tears of the Kingdom’s familiar iconography and mechanical gadgets, and a story that fills in some gaps in Hyrule’s history and gives the princess more of a starring role.Available on:Nintendo Switch 2Estimated playtime:15 hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which was hardly surprising. Whether in relation to the the normalisation ofgreat replacement theory, or the bullying and harassment of the media, Mr Orbán more or less wrote the playbook for the Maga movement. The former White House strategist Steve Bannon has eulogised Hungary’s prime minister as the “Trump before Trump”.Last week, ahead of crucial Hungarian elections in less than six months’ time, the US president returned some political favours. As Mr Orbán seeks a fifth consecutive term presiding over a nation which he boasts of having turned into an illiberal democracy, his Fidesz party trails in the polls. As well as a few signed Maga baseball caps, an Orbánvisitto Washington yielded considerably more valuable pre-election gifts.Having previouslylecturedEuropean nations on the need to eliminate all energy imports from Russia, and threatened tosanctioncountries continuing to buy Russian oil, Mr Trump agreed there should be a special exemption for Hungary – the largest EU consumer of all. According to Mr Orbán, the Trump administration also agreed to offer a “financial shield” to Budapest should it run into any future difficulties, as Brussels continues towithholdbillions of pounds in EU funding to Hungary on the grounds of rule-of-law breaches.The details of this arrangement are somewhat murky. But Mr Trump recently demonstrated his willingness to help out ideological allies when the USextendeda $20bn emergency credit line to Argentina’s far-right president, Javier Milei. Although Mr Orbán failed to nail down a campaign-energising Trump visit to Budapest, it was still a profitable day’s work in the Oval Office.In the corridors of the EU, Mr Trump’s intervention will have further underlined the geopolitical stakes of the coming election, ahead of which the centrist challenger, Péter Magyar,enjoysa comfortable lead in the polls. European leaders have learned not to expect principled consistency from the Trump White House, and have grown used to the US president’s efforts to belittle the EU. But Mr Orbán’s exemption – which came at the price of an agreement to buy US gas and nuclear energy – flagrantly undermines EUaspirationsto phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027.Since 2022, the two biggest EU importers of Russian oil, Hungary and Slovakia, havecontributedwell over £10bn to the Kremlin’s war effort. Meanwhile, Budapest has repeatedly used the threat of its veto to stymie progress in Ukraine’s EU accession talks. As Europe strives to forge a unified and effective strategy for supporting Kyiv, and strengthening its hand in any future peace negotiations, Mr Orbán’s Putin-friendly presence at the diplomatic table remains a significant obstacle.Mr Magyar has steeredclearof pledging a major policy shift on Ukraine, and focused his campaigning on domestic issues, while emphasising the need for Hungary to finally behave as a constructive EU member. After enduring so many years of trolling, Brussels can only wait and hope. Mr Orbán’sindifferenceto basic EU values, such as the upholding of minority rights and the independence of civil society institutions, has long been a humiliating embarrassment for the bloc. His continued obstructionism regarding Ukraine risks undermining its future security.Explore more on these topicsHungaryOpinionEuropean UnionViktor OrbánDonald TrumpUkraineUS foreign policyRussiaeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Expect more of the same now she’s with the mayor-elect’s transition teamWed 12 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 11.27 ESTShareArelatively unknown thirtysomething parachuted on to the national stage and into high political office. Energising to some of the Democratic base but lacking support from the party establishment. Not Zohran Mamdani but Lina Khan, who Joe Biden appointed to chair the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2021 when she was just 32. Khan, who left her role at the FTC when Trump returned to the White House, is now one offive womenappointed to the mayor-elect of New York’s transition team.Khan is the most exciting pick for a few reasons. She entered the FTC with an ambitious mandate to transform the government agency, broaden its focus to increase scrutiny of corporate mergers and do more to protect consumers – and got results. She brought down the price of inhalers (routinely being sold for hundreds of dollars) by tackling price gouging by pharmaceutical companies. She blocked a hugesupermarket mergerand returnedmore than $60mto Amazon drivers in unpaid tips. All of her achievements were delivered in four years, while navigating a bureaucracy that was sometimes hostile to her leadership.Mamdani has a mandate from New Yorkers, but he can expect opposition from the rich and powerful, as well as many Democrats, to some of his flagship policies. Khan, who made her name calling out big tech monopolies, knows first-hand what it’s like to have influential opponents. After she was confirmed in post at the FTC with bipartisan support, Meta and Amazon tried to get her to recuse herself from investigating them. In the 2024 presidential race, two billionaire Democratic donors publicly called on Kamala Harris to fire Khan if she became president. The Daily Show host Jon Stewart claimed that Applewas resistant to him even interviewing the FTC chairon his podcast because of her views. Big tech and Wall Street execs have alreadybeen grumblingabout her latest appointment, seeing it as a “shot across the bow”.

That’s why responsible media organizations correct their errors and acknowledge them to the public. It’s why newsroom leaders take steps, internally, to repair broken processes. It’s why they sometimes go so far as to apologize or take stories down.Some mistakes, of course, are worse than others. A misspelled name is one thing. Sustained coverage that is misleading or false is quite another. And there are plenty of gradations between those two poles.The BBC’s error in a documentary film aboutDonald Trumpwas a serious one. During the editing, two clips of the president speaking to his riled-up crowd of followers in Washington were juxtaposed, even though there was nearly an hour between the two. The edited version could have made viewers believe Trump had made an unmistakable call for violence at the US Capitol that day. He did make inflammatory statements, of course, and he does bear significant responsibility for the riot at the Capitol that day, but he skirted the direct instruction that the film suggested.So, yes, this was a bad mistake that was not adequately acknowledged or corrected when there was a chance to do so. That is something that calls for internal examination and external acknowledgment, some of which has occurred.But the current aftermath of the long-ago error – the film was published last year before the US presidential election – is significantly out of proportion.Trump, ever litigious, is threatening to sue theBBCfor $1bn. His spokesperson, in discussing a highly critical leaked memo by a former BBC adviser, is taking the opportunity to unfairly trash the broadcaster as “100% fake news”.And, shockingly, two top news executives at the esteemed public broadcasting outlet have resigned: they are the director general, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of BBC News, Deborah Turness.What’s more, in today’s polarized political world, the situation has thrown the BBC into something of an existential crisis, and some say its longterm survival is at stake. With the broadcaster’s coverage of the Gaza war and of transgender rights also under fire, some politicians are using the new controversy to urge British people to refuse to pay the license fee that funds the BBC.That’s way out of whack. The BBC certainly has messed up, but as a news organization it remains essential, not just in the United Kingdom but in America and beyond. It deserves continued support; it certainly deserves to survive and thrive.“You would never guess from the sometimes hysterical coverage of the past week that the BBC remains quite easily the most trusted news organization in the UK,” wrote former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger in Prospect. The BBC is also extremely well regarded in America, he notes, “the second most trusted news source – just behind the Weather Channel”.For Americans, this situation sounds all too familiar. Trump uses lawsuits (or threats of lawsuits) as a political weapon, a cudgel to encourage grievance and division, and a way to control the political message by undermining the reality-based press.This practice long predates his two terms as president. In recent months, though, he has had significant success in suing media companies, drawing multimillion-dollar settlements over his complaints to news organizations including ABC News and CBS News. In both of those cases, legal experts and first amendment attorneys said the cases could have been successfully defended, and that settling was a regrettable form of capitulation.“This is the Trump squeeze in action,” wrote CNN’s Brian Stelter, in describing the president’s demand letter to the BBC. It sets a deadline of this Friday afternoon for a retraction and compensation.How should the BBC respond – beyond, of course, the stunning resignation of the two news leaders?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Margaret SullivanFree newsletterSign up to get email alerts every time Margaret Sullivan publishes a new column.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It should fully acknowledge the error and it should be clear internally – and transparent externally – about what happened and how similar errors will be avoided in the future.But it should also defend itself, in court, and to the public. And it should continue the wise practice of reporting on itself, as it did in BBC presenter Ros Atkins’s fair-minded piece published this week about what has happened; it gave important context on how political pressure has been building for a long time. This isn’t happening in a vacuum, but in a boiling-hot cauldron.So yes, take all of those corrective actions.But the broadcaster should not cave to Trump’s demands. Rather, it should follow the example of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal in defending itself in court, if indeed a lawsuit materializes. (Trump’s threats, after all, don’t always come to fruition, but remain pure bluster.) Some legal experts say it’s not clear that such a suit is even possible given the international boundaries.Mistakes happen in journalism; that’s inevitable.

Mostly what it does is bring forward the number of first home buyers now bidding for properties. That increase in numbers has unsurprisingly led to many stories ofsurging loansandhouse prices.You can understand the temptation for the government. First home buyer loans are not growing. And given population growth, the number of people taking out first home buyer loans is clearly falling on a per capita basis.If the graph does not display click hereSo the government came up with the solution of essentially giving people the mother of all first home buyer grants.Thegovernment’s own glossy pamphleton the 5% scheme gives an example of a hypothetical buyer who would have needed to save $160,000 for a deposit on an $800,000 home. Under the scheme they will only need to save $40,000.That is effectively a $120,000 first home buyer grant. They’re not “given” the money but they are given that capacity to borrow – and thus bid for properties.Anyone thinking that will not juice property prices has not been paying attention for the past 25 years.Property investors certainly have, because there is a massive surge of investor housing loans in the three months before the 5% scheme came into effect:If the graph does not display click hereThe 18% increase in investor lending in the September quarter was the third-biggest quarterly jump in the past 20 years.It meant that, for the first time since 2017, investor property loans accounted for more than 40% of all new home loans:If the graph does not display click hereThe increase was across the nation but especially in New South Wales and Victoria, where the value of such loans has increased 18% and 27% respectively over the past year:If the graph does not display click hereThe reason why this matters is that there is a strong link between the growth of housing finance and property prices.In the first half of this year there was a slight slowing of housing loan growth but the surge in investor loans turned that around. While it was looking like house prices growth was set to slow over the end of this year and the start of 2026, now prices look set to rise and rise quickly:If the graph does not display click hereImportantly the housing finance figures out yesterday do not include the loans in October, and yet we know the reports from banks that loan applications are increasing fast.We thus have a situation where the government’s policy not only will increase prices after it begins but did so beforehand by causing investors to try to get in first!That’s a pretty special kind of policy failure.These finance numbers come just after the most recentbuilding approvals datawas released on Monday. In the past year the number of approvals is higher than a year ago, and public-sector approvals have also nicely increased from the recent low of 2023 and well above the pre-pandemic nadir:If the graph does not display click hereBut looking further back and taking into account population growth, the past 25 years of juicing demand and trusting the private sector to fix things has led us to a point where public housing plays a very minor role:If the graph does not display click hereIt would, however, be wrong to say the government is not interested in public housing. In August, the government amendedthe Defence Housing Australia Actto allow it to provide public housingfor visiting American sailorscoming here as part of the Aukus submarine deal.It is the perfect culmination of 25 years of housing policy failure – juicing demand to make houses more expensive for Australians while providing good public housing for … Americans.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsHousingGrogonomicsAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

And this week we’ll take this: the spectacle of various literary people at the Booker prize award ceremony jamming themselves into photos alongside Sarah Jessica Parker. The actor – if you missed thelong pieceabout it in the New York Times, or the many social mediapostspromoting Parker’s involvement – served as a judge for the Booker this year, a process that required her to read 153 books, some of them on the New York subway while being followed by a film crew. “Oh let me try!!!!” Parker had posted to Booker organisers last year, and for reasons that became obvious this week, they did.I know what you are going to say; that anything short of full-throated support for Parker’s adorable engagement with books in general and theBooker prizein particular is just unacceptable snobbery. There is nothing wrong with an actor involving herself in literary life or using her cultural weight to promote literacy. And – it goes without saying – we are all weepingly grateful to anyone with a platform bigger than that of the dowdy stay-at-home novelist who harnesses her glamour and spotlight for good. That celebrity book clubs have become the natural PR extension of taking up animal charities or becoming a UN goodwill ambassador is, surely, something to be celebrated. Who among us can fail to welcome Mindy Kaling, or Emma Watson, or Jenna Bush Hager in their fight against dwindling attention spans and addiction to screens?And yet: come on. Really? Content generated by celebrities keen to position themselves as bookish has given rise to some images – Natalie Portman (has she mentioned she went to Harvard?) peering alluringly over a copy of Virginia Woolf’s The Waves; Emma Roberts, actor and niece of Julia Roberts, taking a well-groomed nap with her newborn under a Joan Didion anthology; Kaia Gerber, actor and daughter of Cindy Crawford, reassuring us via her social media feed that “reading is so sexy”; the phrase “Dakota Johnson’s immersive literary experience” – that, if they fail to make you snigger, makes you a much better person than me.Some of how you regard this type of content may come down to a simple question of how your body reacts when you hear the words “Reese Witherspoon” – with a warm smile or an involuntary shudder. Witherspoon, whose book club is almost a decade old, is a grandee of celebrity book content and Oprah Winfrey’s natural heir, oftenpresentingherself in a floral onesie, reclining on a sofa with a book in hand and a look on her face that says, “Yes, I’m cute; but I also read.” What Witherspoon is reading, inevitably, is a novel about an awkward girl who meets an oddball man and together they celebrate their mutual iconoclasm with a conventional wedding.Of course, not all celebrity book clubs are equal, and a generation behind Witherspoon comes Dua Lipa, with a much more ambitious and literary book list – one that has, recently, included titles by Ocean Vuong, Patrick Radden Keefe and, toast of the hour, Helen Garner. (Actually, it wasSarah Jessica Parkerwho got to Garner first, depicting Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City with, variously, a copy of Garner’s first novel, Monkey Grip, and her book This House of Grief, tucked modishly under her arm. The latter is the wrenching true story of a man who murders his children that every fashionable girl-about-town needs.)skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s why you should read them | Chris PowerRead moreSince there is room for all types of literary taste, I suppose my quibble with a lot of this is stylistic. On the question of “reading is sexy” – an affirmation that most celebrities with book clubs take extremely literally, so that every promotional photo involves them pouting, red carpet-ready, over the top of the book – is it unbearably un-fun to wonder if sexy is the right word? There is something deeply condescending in this assumption that the only thing young, ignorant, non-book-reading people will respond to is “hotness”, or that the definition of hotness is reading a book in a bikini.As for the authors themselves, many are, of course, thrilled to be involved with hotter, younger, richer people from the popular end of the entertainment spectrum, thus entering the tradition of otherwise cranky and uncooperative literary people meeting an actor and becoming suddenly cheerful. In the New York Times story of how Sarah Jessica Parker managed to pull off being a famous actor while also reading some books, the TV star said: “I would reach out to Roddy [Doyle, the judging panel chair] and say, ‘Have you touched on this book yet? Here are my feelings about it, but it’s possible I’m spot-on wrong.’” Spoiler alert: the Irish novelist absolutely 100% agreed with the Golden Globe and Emmy winner’s judgment call on that particular book.I don’t mean to be too much of a downer. No one wants to be the Jonathan Franzen at this particular party (although, I will say that as Oprah’s book picks become increasinglydodgy, I find myself having more sympathy with his priggish refusal to be involved with her). But perhaps we can say yay to celebrity book clubs, while reserving the right to find them faintly ludicrous – examples of people who insist on letting us know what they think about everything, with a confidence entirely untainted by expertise.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It doesn’t sound like a winning election slogan, but the sentiment is increasingly taking hold in politics and the media. The rise of Reform and the rightwards shift of the mainstream parties has made doom-spreading a sport, with GB News and Nigel Farage taking turns to pick which shadowy forces – migrants, welfare or wokeness – are wrecking the country.Conservatism once embodied national pride and preservation, but the new right is selling despair and destruction. The very people who have long accused leftwingers of “talking Britain down” now speak of “no-go areas” and ofmigrants raping young women. The Labour party under Keir Starmer has not exactly been soaked in optimism either, arguing that disability cuts are inevitable whilewealth taxesare impossible.This pessimism even extends to casting doubt on anyone who dares offer a bit of hope. Darren Jones, one of Starmer’s most influential ministers,told the Guardian last weekthat the Green party is making unfeasible promises ahead of the next election. “It’s their responsibility to explain to people how they would actually choose what to do if they were in government, as opposed to just promising things that are undeliverable,” he said.The remark gives an insight into how Labour will respond as the Greens start to look like a viableelectoral threat under Zack Polanski. But it also sums up the double standard that dogs politics: leftwing policies are typically portrayed as unrealistic and childish, while the centre and right’s ideas are framed as sensible and all that’s possible.When leftwing politicians make the case for better living conditions for ordinary people, they have long been met with accusations that their pledges are “undeliverable” (or when things get really hysterical, that they’re acommunist spy). Policies that favour the interests of the working class are routinely dismissed as a fantasy, whereas those that push wealth and power towards the rich come to be seen as a realistic status quo.This is not to say that redistributive or climate-related policies should be immune to critique or that the left as a movement has alwayscovered itself in glory. But it is to say that there is a bias against leftwing ideas – and those who promote them – which means they are more likely to be dismissed as naive, incompetent or too costly.To see this in action, just look at the handling of the two-child benefit limit. Introduced by the Conservatives in 2017, the policy is by any measure a moral and economic failure: from being a key driver of (increasingly expensive ) child poverty to putting women through distressing rape exemption rules.On Tuesday, the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, gave a hint that she plans to finally scrap it. But this possibility only comes after renewed pressure from100 civic organisationsand after 18 months of the government claiming it was unaffordable, with Starmer going as far assuspending Labour MPswho stood against the policy.15:25The city that reveals Britain's biggest problem: there's nowhere to live – videoThe mess gives an insight into how hard it is for the left to lobby for any sort of progress, even (or especially) when it’s with its own side. Or, to put it another way: Britain has aLabourgovernment at last and we are still arguing whether children should go hungry.That such a thing is a “debate” is depressing. Yet the truth is, it is a good day if the left is allowed to join in the conversation. While the hard right manages to paint mass deportations as a mainstream idea, leftwing – or even centre-left – thinking is routinely excluded from public discussion. Research byCardiff Universityfound Reform featured in a quarter of all BBC News at Ten bulletins between January and July this year, whereas the Liberal Democrats – the third party in parliament with 14 times the number of MPs as Reform – featured in just 17.9% of bulletins. Meanwhile, Farage’s party was referenced in just under 20% of ITV News at Ten bulletins, compared with just 6.2% for the Lib Dems.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At a time when the public are struggling with high private rents, rising unemployment, and poor public services, the hard right are offering simple answers. But mainstream parties who merely tinker around the edges will be ill equipped to provide the complex solutions necessary for the scale of the crisis.The growth in support for the Greens and Zohran Mamdani’s recent mayoral victory in New York suggests voters are beginning to question the idea that positive change is unattainable. Policies that are dismissed by the establishment as radical and unworkable, from rent controls to nationalised energy (both of which themajorityof Britonssupport), are seen by much of the public as mainstream and logical.That’s the thing about the narrative that Britain is falling apart. There are indeed many problems facing the country. But rather than immigrants and disabled people, the culprit is a social and economic structure that needs transforming. Most voters don’t need convincing the system is broken – they need inspiration that it can be fixed. The ideas dismissed as “undeliverable” are the very ones we most require.Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But what comes next could be nastily complicatedWed 12 Nov 2025 10.45 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 14.11 ESTShareBe absolutely clear.Keir Starmeris in very deep trouble indeed. Perhaps belatedly, he himself grasps this. His team and his ministers knew it already. His party and the public get it too. For this deeply unpopular Labour prime minister, the words approval rating are a contradiction in terms.Theeruption of speculationabout Starmer’s future this week may have taken people by surprise. Where did that suddenly come from? The short answer is that No 10 briefed the latest twist – that Starmer expects to face and defeat a leadership challenge – on Tuesday evening. The longer one is that the Starmer leadership issue has been steadily gaining traction and credibility among MPs since the summer. This story is not a Westminster confection. Politically, it is very real. Dismiss it at your peril.No 10 was responding to the issue that is the talk of the parliamentary Labour party. The talk is, very simply, a reflection of what the public now thinks. The public’s judgment about Starmer is brutal: it does not want him. The Labour party has to decide whether it thinks the public is right or wrong. That’s a dangerous game to play, especially for a party that is now sometimesrunning fourthin the polls.The Starmer question facingLabouris both straightforward and complicated at the same time. The straightforward version is that he is very unpopular and helping to drag Labour down. Get rid of him and perhaps things will improve. The more complicated one is that there is little agreement over how, when, and to whose benefit Starmer should be ousted, or what the political consequences would be. This is a moment for Labour to be careful what it wishes for. But the problem and the argument are not going to go away.Talk to MPs and officials and the anxieties are deep and unmissable. Many Labour MPs desire the end – a new leader – but draw back from the means. It’s serious, chaotic and incoherent, says one member of the government. Lots of discontent, but no plan, says a veteran. It’s worse than I thought, admits a cabinet minister. Once politicians start talking like this, though, the sands really are beginning to run out, and the process can speed up fast. The question is not whether Starmer is toast or not, a former insider says. He is just toast.The briefings are simultaneously an admission by No 10 that there really is a problem and also an attempt to call the critics’ bluff. A challenge to Starmer’s leadership would be reckless and dangerous, the briefings said. It could destabilise markets, disturb international relationships and plunge Labour into the kind of party infighting that the public hates. These are not arguments that can be lightly dismissed.But they have backfired. That this was aimed at Wes Streeting on a day when the health secretary was scheduled to undertake the morning media “round” and to make a speech on NHS reorganisation, is beyond doubt. Starmer’s aides have this week tried to flush out Streeting’s leadership ambitions in much the same way as theysuccessfully flushed outthose of Andy Burnham in September.The downside was that the briefings made the leadership issue public and gave Streeting a national platform to talk about it. Streeting used it to restate his loyalty to Starmer and to attack the atmosphere in Downing Street as toxic. No 10 may have hoped that all of this would bring Streeting into line, but it has ended up showing that Starmer, who was forced to condemn hostile briefings in the Commons today, seems not to be in charge of his own administration. Streeting, meanwhile, underscored that he is a more adept media performer than the prime minister, as well as a credible contender for his job. When the prize is the prime ministership, however, others will also be tempted.Where this all leads in the long term is therefore clear. Starmer will struggle to hold on. He is unlikely to lead Labour into the next general election. Mapping the precise path to that outcome is trickier – and predicting what happens afterwards is trickier still. The budget in two weeks’ time could force a challenge. But it may prove more popular with the party than the Labour doom-loop assumes. A landslide defeat in Scotland, Wales and the English local elections next May seems a likelier trigger.LikeJohn Major in 1995, Starmer could decide to force the issue by resigning and standing again. But that did nothing to strengthen Major’s authority, and it would do little for Starmer’s either. A more likely scenario, but still full of uncertainties because there is no precedent, would be that20% of Labour MPs– of whom there are now 405 – would try to trigger a leadership contest. This would then be thrown open to Labour affiliates and members. Such a thing has never happened when Labour has been in government.Traditionally, Labour has been exceptionally loyal to its leaders in ways the Conservatives cannot match. With the arguable exception of Tony Blair, who had done 10 years at the top, no Labour leader – and certainly no Labour prime minister – has been forced out against their will in modern times. Until now, the attempt to solve a party’s problems by changing the leader has been a Conservative speciality, as Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss all found out. It is a sign of how much has changed in the 2020s that the loyalty brake no longer holds the Labour party together either, and that Starmer’s ousting is so seriously canvassed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

None, though, came so soon after an emphatic election win as that which Starmer now faces. Gordon Brown, a far more skilled political infighter,successfully faced downan abortive challenge from within his own cabinet in 2009 by making clear he would not go without leaving blood on the walls. Longer ago, in 1969, Harold Wilsontold a rally: “May I say, for the benefit of those who have been carried away by the gossip of the last few days, that I know what’s going on. I’m going on, and the Labour government’s going on.” Starmer will wish it was so easy.It is not just Starmer who is fighting for his political life right now. It may also be the Labour party itself. One poll this autumn suggestedLabour could collapseto under 100 seats next time round, its worst ever result. While Labour MPs may dream of a cathartic leadership change that could revive the party’s faltering fortunes, the real lesson may be that both of the old parties that have dominated British politics for the past century are now disintegrating irreversibly. Neither Starmer, nor Streeting, nor any other wannabe successor, may be able to do very much about that.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionLabourLabour party leadershipcommentShareReuse this content"

But as with any online feminist movement, it exists in tensionWed 12 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 18.09 ESTShareAfew years ago, I wrote about the rise of the“soft” and “hard” launch on social media, those curated posts that signalled a new relationship. Online platforms had become an extension of the romance plot, a public stage where intimacy was proof of worth and coupledom was still the ultimate status symbol.Back then, my research showed that many people felt their lives had not truly begun until they’d met someone. Being single wasn’t just a relationship status; it was an existential pause. To “get a life”, as the old saying went, meant to find a partner. Romance was the scaffolding of selfhood.Is it really outrageously uncool to have a boyfriend?Read moreBut something has shifted. In 2025, the romance plot appears to be fraying at the edges. Vogue recently asked in a viral headline:Is having a boyfriend now embarrassing?It argued that, across social media, the term “boyfriend” was taking on a strangely dated, even cringe, tone, not unlike the way “Facebook official” now sounds quaint. The idea of centring your identity around a relationship feels, to many, passé.Platforms likeTikTokare teeming with young women publicly declaring themselves “#boysober” – a rapidly growing movement rejecting dating, hookup culture, exes and even the idea of emotional dependence on men. What began as a meme has become a global conversation about boundaries, burnout and bodily autonomy.In my research into the #boysober trend, I found that it’s far more than a viral challenge. It’s a collective experiment in feminist renegotiation. Women are reframing abstention not as moral purity but as self-preservation, a deliberate refusal to participate in a dating economy that too often leaves them exhausted, unsafe, or digitally surveilled. Many #boysober creators speak openly about the cumulative fatigue of dating apps, the relentless emotional labour of managing male fragility and the omnipresence of technologically facilitated abuse.The numbers bear this out: reports of tech-facilitated violence have soared globally. Women describe partners installing spyware, using GPS tracking, or threatening to leak intimate images, all forms of coercive control adapted to the digital age. In this context, stepping away from the dating marketplace isn’t about prudishness; it’s an act of survival.Going boysober: the women who turned to celibacy in 2024Read moreYet, as with any online feminist movement, #boysober exists in tension. Some critics see echoes of neoconservatism, a regression to individualism and purity culture dressed in feminist language. Others view it as a radical refusal of male-centred validation, a way of reclaiming emotional bandwidth and self-worth. As I’ve argued elsewhere, the truth likely lies somewhere in between. It’s both a response to patriarchy and a product of it: a movement shaped by the very digital architectures that commodify desire.TikTok has become the agora where these gender negotiations play out in real time. The platform that once popularised thirst traps and “get ready with me” videos is now hosting a generational reckoning. The hashtags say it all: #datingfatigue, #romanceless, #heterofatalism. Each expresses, in different ways, a weariness with heteronormative scripts and the emotional asymmetry of modern dating.“Heterofatalism”, a term gaining traction in online and offline circles, describes a kind of resigned hopelessness about heterosexual relationships: the belief that they are doomed by default because patriarchy is too entrenched to make them equitable. It’s not that women don’t want connection; it’s that they increasingly don’t believe the emotional maths adds up.This cynicism (or realism, depending on your view) coexists uneasily with our cultural obsession with love stories. Romantic comedies have made a modest comeback but they now arrive with a wink, aware of their own unreality. Meanwhile, the social capital once derived from being “couple goals” online is beginning to curdle. Where the hard launch once signalled success, now it can look, well, a little basic.Social media is awash with ‘heteropessimism’. Do young women really think so poorly of men? | Rachel ConnollyRead morePerhaps what’s happening is not the death of love but the de-centring of it. The old narrative – find “the one”, post about it, ascend socially – no longer fits a generation navigating precarious work, housing crises and digital burnout. Love feels harder to sustain and less essential to self-definition. The new romance plot is self-referential: “falling in love with myself,” “main character energy,” “self-partnership”. In other words, the boyfriend has been replaced by the self as protagonist.This hopefully doesn’t mean we’re entering a cold, loveless era but rather one where intimacy is being reimagined. The collective withdrawal signified by the end of heterofatalism mirrors broader shifts in how young people think about care, community and safety. It’s perhaps not a wholesale rejection of connection but a reconfiguration of it, away from coupledom as a marker of maturity and toward something more plural and self-defined.Still, as feminist cultural theorist Angela McRobbie once warned, even acts of refusal can be co-opted. Postfeminist media culture has a knack for turning rebellion into brand. The risk is that a movement born from exhaustion becomes another form of consumption, “self-care” sold back to women as yet another unpaid project.Yet despite these contradictions, there’s something quietly revolutionary about this moment. The idea that a woman’s life can be complete, even joyful, without a romantic partner would have been radical a generation ago.Now it’s trending.Dr Lisa Portolan is an academic.

Rachel Reeves’sreported planto shred Labour’s flagship tax pledge in the upcoming budget is so plainly disastrous that it invites the suspicion that the party leadership has completely lost its senses. But madness would be too generous an alibi for a faction that long ago abandoned any purpose beyond wielding icepicks against its own left.Labour’s 2024 election campaign offered no story, no clear moral argument, no real sense of direction. That vacuum explains why, even after being handed power, thanks to the most shambolic government in modern British history,Labourmustered only a third of the vote. The tax pledge was one of the few recognisable threads of coherence.For example: “Labour will not put up your income tax, national insurance or VAT,”tweeted Reeveson 4 June 2024, denouncing the Conservatives as “the party of high tax”. A week later, Keir Starmertold Sky Newsin Grimsby: “We will not raise tax on working people.” Themanifestocouldn’t be clearer: “Labour will not increase taxes on working people”, specifically citing national insurance, income tax and VAT.Reeves is now considering a 2p increase in income tax, believing a simultaneous cut in employee national insurance contributions will shield the government. It will do no such thing. The Liberal Democrats’ incineration after reneging on tuition fees in 2010 remains a parable of political suicide – but even that betrayal was narrower in scope. It was not as central to their campaign; and they were a minor party which became a junior partner in a coalition, not the dominant party wielding an historic majority, albeit because of a grotesquely distorted electoral system.The government will, no doubt, plead that economic circumstances have changed. Yet some of us warned during the campaign that its refusal totax the wealthywould mean yet more devastating cuts to our services. The economy was in a bad state at the time of the election – which Labour dishonestly pretended to discover after winning office. And what has the past decade of chaos told us other than to prepare for sudden turmoil at any moment? Ruling out these tax hikes was completely reckless.Before shredding its pact with the public, Labour might glance at the Sunday Times rich list. A mere 350 UK households holdwealth totalling £772.8bn– comparable to the entire annual economic output of Poland. In a time of national hardship, can it really be deemed too radical to suggest they contribute a lot more?Even if the party’s leaders were skilful communicators, this shameless ripping up of the contract between government and voters would provoke a tsunami of political rage. Alas, you will find filing cabinets with more stage presence. Already,Starmer’s personal ratingshave sunk below Liz Truss’s at her lowest ebb.The long-term damage to Labour will be incalculable. At the last election, the Tories claimed Labour would hike taxes on working people. They will claim vindication – but, more importantly, no one will believe any pledge offered by Labour ever again. “Remember when it abandoned its main promise from the 2024 election?” opponents will cry, and Labour will say what exactly?No, no, this time we really mean it?The reputational damage will be irreversible.Increase taxes for working people, or make the super-rich pay their fair share? The answer seems obvious – but not to Labour | Dhananjayan SriskandarajahRead moreBut it’s not Labour’s self-inflicted destruction that should most concern us. The party’s decision to box itself into a corner over tax led it to hike employer national insurance contributions last year. This contributed to stubborn inflation – which has proven to be a key factor in the rise of rightwing populism across the west. Democracy is menaced by collapsing trust in politicians and confidence in electoral systems, which authoritarian demagogues are only too keen to exploit. The harm inflicted on our increasingly precarious democracy by shamelessly abandoning a central election pledge should both anger and terrify us.Labour looks finallyset to scrapthe two-child benefit cap – which imposes hardship and squalor on hundreds of thousands of children – and is an extremely welcome move. However, the fact that it has been dragged kicking and screaming to do what any genuine Labour government should have done without blinking, will mean it gains precious little political capital.The faction running Labour have long seen themselves as ingenious political operators, whose laser focus on electability contrasts with the hopeless naivety of defeated leftwing internal rivals. Starmerism was always devoid of both principle and purpose. Its original sin was deceiving the party membership by offering Corbynism without Corbyn, only to cynically ditch all that in an attempt to drive the left into permanent oblivion. It received no hammering for this duplicity because British political pundits largely saw deceiving socialists in order to crush them as good politics.That indulgence has evidently bred delusion. Believing dishonesty could forever provide an escape hatch, Labour now faces a brutal encounter with reality. It has already breathed life into Nigel Farage’s insurgency – and, more encouragingly, intoZack Polanski’s resurgent Greens, a revival the Labour right neither foresaw nor understands. This new phenomenon, we must hope, can capitalise on Labour’s planned tax betrayal. If not, then this dismal political project will bleed out its last reserves of credibility – and only hasten Britain’s slide towards hard-right rule.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionBudget 2025Rachel ReevesTax and spendingEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

There are other players but you can’t interact with them. The sum of collective contributions will be trebled, then shared equally among all players. What do you do?If everyone submits all their money, all get richer. But if everyone except you pays in, you can enjoy the collective payout while retaining your original stash. The flaw in the selfish strategy is that other people might have the same idea. If no one pays in, there is no bounty to share.This is thepublic goods game, an experiment that economists and psychologists use, with many rule variations, to test conditions under which people pool or hog resources.It is a simple but useful tool for unravelling some of the mess in British politics. For example, it illuminates a link between two stories that do not, on the face of it, seem connected – the scandal of prisonersaccidentally releasedfrom jail and a crisis in the BBC over alleged institutional bias. Both are case studies in the problem of coordinating public goods in a climate of mistrust.The key is collective identity. A routine finding in the game is that participants’ willingness to share goes up when they feel part of a group. It doesn’t have to be a deep connection. Picking sides with a coin toss is sufficient to make team heads and team tails display heightened solidarity within their tribes.The political implications are obvious. Taxpayers are happier to make higher contributions if they see the benefit to themselves or people like them. If they think the money goes to undeserving people – outsiders, cheats – they resent paying.Convicted criminals are low on most people’s list of worthy beneficiaries. Politicians have little interest in making the case that more should be spent on jails. The public goods argument would be that a well-resourced criminal justice system keeps law-abiding citizens safe by reducing reoffending rates. But the easier way to satisfy voters’ craving for security is to pledge ever harsher punishments.For years, those incentives combined to drive upmandatory prison sentenceswithout suitable increases in the justice department budget. The consequence is an overwhelmed prison system that uses early release as a pressure valve to free up cell space and is so disorganised that the wrong criminals are sometimes discharged.A couple of high-profile cases have exposedDavid Lammyto fierce political pressure, but he is just the unlucky minister at the wheel as the system runs out of road.The justice department was a net beneficiary in Rachel Reeves’s spending review earlier this year and more prisons are due to be built. But it will take time for those investments to reach fruition. Meanwhile, there are plenty of rival demands on the exchequer.The economy is not growing fast enough and voter expectations of service quality exceed the state’s capabilities. The chancellor isasking people to pay more– having already raised taxes andpoint-blank promisedshe wouldn’t do it again – before the government has delivered a dividend in public goods.A popular party with charismatic leadership would find that hard to sell. For Keir Starmer’s Labour, which enjoys neither of those advantages, it threatens to escalate into a crisis of legitimation. Survival is not just a matter of pulling the right revenue-raising levers. It means winning an argument about the function of taxes, defining the group that stands to benefit from pooled resources as broadly as possible.The system has to be seen as a collective investment for mutual advantage, not expropriation and transfer to strangers. That in turn presumes there is a critical mass of people who self-identify as a single political community. They don’t need to agree on everything, but they should accept that disagreement is part of a negotiation about the best way to achieve common goals.Politics is not a winner-takes-all fight to the death. There should be widely recognised cultural references that nurture a sense of belonging together. People who see problems from rival perspectives should still sound as if they are describing the same reality.This is where theBBC comes in. Britain’s national broadcaster is unusually well respected as a venerable institution and a provider of reliable news. That reputation has made it an effective force countering fragmentation and radicalisation in the information space. Without it, UK politics would go (further) down the US path of extreme polarisation, tending towards civil unrest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is inherently bad that editorial standards went awry – far awry in the case of Panorama’sslyly edited videoof a Donald Trump speech to an insurrectionary mob. And it is disastrous that such failures empower Trump and his legion of fellow-travellers in British politics and media to portray the BBC as irredeemably corrupt.The frenzy is out of proportion to the offence, but consistent with a longstanding vendetta. TheBBCis a target for rival news organisations that resent its unique status and privileged funding. It is also ideologically threatening to the radical right because the licence-fee model is an exemplar of a mutually funded public good. The corporation doesn’t have to exhibit liberal-left bias to provoke its enemies. They already see it as a factory shipping cultural collectivism and resent the purchase it has on the nation’s affections.A bleak irony is that the aspiration to avoid political partisanship, imperfectly realised but sincere, is a vulnerability for the BBC’s assailants to exploit. Their goal is not to enforce accuracy but to maximise disorientation, uncertainty and suspicion. The BBC’s ambition to high standards compels it to self-flagellate when exposed in a misdemeanour, while those who demand ever more extreme penalties feel no equivalent duty to fairness or balance.Every day that a most trusted news source is forced to report on its own supposed untrustworthiness helps corrode the institutional foundations upholding British liberal democracy. It gives succour to the claim that everything is broken, no established authority should be believed, and the only remedy is to burn everything.And so politics stays trapped in the doom loop:distrusted governmentsare afraid to take unpopular but necessary decisions; hard problems are deferred; things do not get better; governments become less popular and their room for manoeuvre is even more constrained. Each cycle stokes the appetite for demagogic simplism – the Trumpian model of holding the system itself responsible for failure and insisting that salvation requires breaking all the rules.The public goods experiment gives some indication of how that might work out. The most selfish and ultimately self-defeating behaviour – the refusal of rational incentives to cooperate – is observed in players who express contempt for the game itself.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionBBCPrisons and probationDavid LammycommentShareReuse this content"

Neither of us was particularly fond of Costner, but we both adored Dennis Hopper. Plus, my friend had a two-for-one voucher, it was a scorching 35C outside, and the cinema was literally the coolest place in town. What we didn’t expect was to stumble into one of the funniest movie experiences of our lives. Waterworld turned out to be unintentionally hilarious. I’m not sure what the sparse matinee crowd made of our cackling, but it was impossible to take Costner’s earnestness seriously. Hopper’s gloriously over-the-top performance made it feel like he was in on the joke. It cracks me up to this day. It was a zero-star cultural moment, but a five-star bonding experience.Ke, Ireland‘I’m still processing how awful it was’After Life (2019-2022)View image in fullscreenNo joy … After Life, with Ricky Gervais and Penelope Wilton.Photograph: Ray Burmiston/NetflixI recently sat through After Life. I’m still processing how awful it was. I loved The Office and Extras, and normally found something to like in Ricky Gervais’s work. Even Derek. But if you don’t think the c-word is amusing in and of itself, you might want to watch something other than After Life, because that’s about 90% of the jokes here.In this show, Ricky Gervais plays himself with a twist. He’s rude, obnoxious, hurts and upsets people, but his wife died, so it’s OK. Plus, the other characters constantly tell him how amazing he is. One minute, we’re being smashed over the head with sad music as not-Ricky watches yet another weird video of his dead wife telling him he’s wonderful. The next, we’re being invited to laugh at one of the zany residents of a village doing something disgusting, someone using the c-word, or one of Gervais’s already-visited pet hates. (Fat people eating loudly! The worst, right?)Not-Ricky commits several serious crimes which are barely mentioned again, including threatening a child with a hammer and throwing a brick through the window of a moving car. Twice, he’s on the verge of killing himself, only to be saved by a sad look from a dog. A lot of people say the show brings them joy and comfort – I disagree.Will, London‘After 15 minutes, we were almost the only people left’Moonshine – Hampsteadtheatre (1999)View image in fullscreenAn absolute disaster … Moonshine, with Robin Soans and Ingeborga Dapkunaite.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianDuring my career as a journalist I reviewed theatre, and in 1999 I found myself at Hampstead theatre for a new work, Moonshine, by Snoo Wilson. It was the second performance, and I was surprised to find the theatre only about a third full. It was clear that either the fewearly reviewshad already had an effect, or word of mouth had spread fast. Moonshine was an absolute disaster on every level – incomprehensible plot, stultifying dialogue, a set design that might have been the product of a freshers’ week post-pub round-table, and a cast who clearly just wanted to get through the four-week run with a modicum of dignity.At the interval, my companion and I sat down in the bar to the sound of audience members exiting through the creaky swing doors. After 15 minutes, we were almost the only people left, apart from the theatre’s artistic director who was desperately trying to convince the one other remaining punter that the audience just needed to “give the work a chance”.As I cringed at the thought of abandoning my responsibility as a critic, we downed our Becks and scarpered into the rain. To this day I still cannot fathom how the play managed to make it beyond the first read-through.Michael Parker, 72, London‘It feels like it never ends’The Room (2003)View image in fullscreenUnwatchable … The Room, with Tommy Wiseau and Juliette Danielle.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyI know, I know, it’s a classic now forhow terrible it is, so much so that there’s another film in tribute to it – but I still find The Room to be completely unwatchable. It feels like it never ends. It. Just. Goes. On.Hi, doggy.Eoin, 34, Galway, Ireland‘I felt sorry for the performers and crew’An Officer and a Gentleman –Lyrictheatre, Sydney (2012)I saw this musical production in 2012 and the trauma is still fresh. It was godawful; full of Aussie performers doing their version of “I’m an angry, beef-head US Naval Officer, sir!” When a character died, I thought, “Thank God. One less to worry about.” The stage show included unnecessary female nudity, which was inappropriate and out of place. More than half the audience left at the intermission, never to return. I stayed because I felt sorry for the performers and crew.Anonymous, Sydney, Australia‘The first movie I contemplated walking out of’28 Years Later (2025)View image in fullscreenOh boy … 28 Years Later, with Alfie Williams, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes.Photograph: Miya MizunoPossibly the worst cinematic cultural moment I ever experienced was 28 Years Later. I was excited to see a well-made zombie movie after years of drought. I bought tickets for the premiere, invited a fellow horror aficionado friend along. We were both so confident this was going to bethemovie of the year.Oh boy, were we wrong. I have never looked at someone so many times in utter disbelief as I have while watching that movie. Not to give any spoilers, but the ending with the tracksuits and ninja-style zombie killing totally ruined it. Truly, this is the first movie I contemplated walking out of, and I would have if I hadn’t been with someone else.Katharina, 23, Aachen, Germany‘They lost me’Unbreakable (2000)View image in fullscreenComic sans … Samuel L Jackson in Unbreakable.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyThis might be a bit unpopular, but it’s M Night Shyalaman’s film Unbreakable for me. I saw it at the cinema, full of hope after seeing The Sixth Sense, but when Samuel L Jackson claimed that the Egyptian hieroglyphics were just like comic books, I said, out loud, in the cinema (for which I apologise), “No, they’re not!” – and that was it, they’d lost me. Can’t watch any of the sequels or sidequels either.David Cochrane, 56, Nottingham‘Instantly irrelevant’Babes in the Wood (1998-1999)View image in fullscreenWafer-thin … Babes in the Wood, with Natalie Walter, Denise van Outen and Steve Nicolson.Photograph: Carlton TelevisionAs a TV addict in the late 90s without a satellite subscription, I gorged myself on everything terrestrial TV had to offer. Babes in the Wood was the ultimate test of my love for the medium. What seemed to me at the time as three poorly written female leads bouncing off the faux charm of “that man from the Flash ads” has only become worse through a brief rewatch. Episodes are without substance and plots are wafer-thin.The fact that this drivel was being aired in the same year HBO released Sex and the City shows how instantly irrelevant this show was, despite a second series being commissioned. It nearly ruined both TV and floor cleaners for my teenage self.Patrick McKiernan, 42, Belfast‘A plotless slog’Ishtar (1987)The film Ishtar is aversion therapy for fans of Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty. Less exciting than a tricycle accident; less witty than a stunned mollusc; less intriguing than a dial tone. Spend 107 non-refundable minutes of your life with two songwriters searching the Moroccan desert for a mythical city, only to find themselves trapped in something like “Waiting for Guffman meets Sartre’s No Exit”, with less merit.Morgaine, Virginia, USAExplore more on these topicsTelevisionDanny Boyle28 Years LaterTheatreRicky GervaisKevin CostnerM Night ShyamalanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jeff Mermelstein’s best photograph‘This image gave me a jolt: his poker face, his grip on the bottle of window cleaner – and the boulder that might be a meteor that struck the flowerbed’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 12 Nov 2025 09.38 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 12.52 ESTShareImade this image, Man with Windex, in New York City, in 1996. I was, and remain, obsessed with making photographs on the streets of New York. At that time, I was using a Leica Rangefinder with colour negative film because of its malleability and ease. One of the beautiful things about the Leica is its stealth qualities – it is quiet and small, though for me right now the iPhone is my camera.I am the son of Holocaust survivors and grew up in suburban central New Jersey, moving to New York in 1979 when I was in my early 20s – which was like landing on Mars. This picture is part of my series and book Sidewalk, made between 1987 and 1999. I would walk the streets of Manhattan daily, ready for surprises. Out on the street you need calm alertness. Pictures that remain strongest for me have a sense of ambiguity, maybe that extra-rare quality of mystery, and that would give me a feeling of euphoria.My wanderings that day took me near 50th Street and Sixth Avenue, a part of midtown that is chock-full of possibilities. There was this man in a suit and tie, with a cigarette in one hand and the other clenching a spray bottle of Windex. It was only when I saw the actual negative on a light box with a loupe magnifier that I felt an immediate jolt, a buzz of wonder. There were the ingredients I hope for: the ambiguity and the mystery. The tension of his grip on the Windex bottle, a poker face expression, the assumption he may be a janitor despite being dressed in a suit. Also, he seems unaware of me. There are wilted daffodil flowers, a boulder that might be a meteor that struck the flowerbed.Now, after 30 years, looking at it I see the sewer cover for the first time; maybe everything will go down it in the end. This picture has that precious, memorable quality, it has survived and still makes me think. That is a gift.Something has to be out there in the real world – but it’s the anti-moments I’m interested inMemorability is a key ingredient – this was taken a long time ago but survived, which is rare when you take pictures at the rate I do, and I’ve been doing this a long time. That is part of the work as a street photographer. But you also need the state of mind to leave your house first of all, which when you get older is a big step. Something has to be out there in the real world – but it’s the anti-moments I’m interested in. Then I wrap it up with a bow, with the composition and colour. The use of colour is important – I’m not saying colour is harder, but I think it is different to black and white, it’s an additional ball to juggle. My personal interest in colour comes from my interest in realism, it’s not so much about the play of colour – though in this picture the colour interactions are good.Sidewalk was the result of winning the European Publishers award for Photography in 1999. It was a flattering and exhilarating prize to have won. I’m over-the-top excited about my new book,What if Jeff Were a Butterfly, which includes a great range of material subject-wise, a wild concoction of almost random images, put together in poetic and surprising ways, that has messed up my head in a good way.In recent years, I have been making lots of videos. I don’t walk around with a particular notion in my mind, but I want to contribute somehow to capturing the human condition in any given moment in time – that’s the challenge. I think it’s a privilege to have found something I love, and I remain as crazy about photography now as I was 50 years ago.View image in fullscreenJeff Mermelstein’s CVBorn:1957, New Brunswick, New JerseyHigh Point:“When the Museum of Modern Art in New York acquired 21 prints from my series #nyc for its permanent collection.”Top tip:“Truly believe that all that matters is the work you create, strive to put your singular self into that work and understand that rejection is meaningless.”What if Jeff were a Butterfly by Jeff Mermelstein is published byVoid.Explore more on these topicsArt and designMy best shotPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 12 Nov 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 10.02 ESTShareMost people who really love video games have the capacity to be obsessive. Losing weeks of your life to Civilization, World of Warcraft or Football Manager is something so many of us have experienced. Sometimes, it’s the numbers-go-up dopamine hit that hooks people: playing something such as Diablo or Destiny and gradually improving your character while picking up shiny loot at perfectly timed intervals can send some people into an obsessional trance. Notoriously compulsive games such as Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley, meanwhile, suck up hours with peaceful, comforting repetition of rewarding tasks.What triggers obsession in me, though, is a challenge. If a game tells me I can’t do something, I become determined to do it, sometimes to my own detriment. Grinding repetition bores me, but challenges hijack my brain.The first games I got obsessed with like this were music games, when I was a teenager. I played Amplitude, where you are a space DJ blasting notes from your sonic spaceship; Gitaroo Man, a comic-book-style story about a guitar-wielding superhero; and, of course, Guitar Hero with its plastic axe – I was compelled to master every song on expert difficulty. Guitar Hero is ostensibly a party game, but I mostly played it folded over in the cupboard under the stairs of my rubbish flat in Bournemouth (I couldn’t play it in the living room because it annoyed my housemates too much), practising More Than a Feeling 30 times in a row until I was note-perfect.A few years later, I discovered FromSoftware’s Demon’s Souls when I was living in Japan, a game so impenetrable it seemed designed to make you walk away. You’d take three paces into any of its levels and get immediately murdered by a skeleton swordsman or poison-swamp creature. But I sensed something interesting behind all the punishment, and there very muchwas. Demon’s Souls ended up birthing a genre of massively popular and famously challenging games with its sequel, Dark Souls. You couldonlydiscover what was so incredible about these games if you were prepared to invest time and energy in mastering them. It didn’t matter how skilled you were – you had to share knowledge and band together with other players to stand a chance.My tenacity has mostly been useful in my life, because I’ve been able to direct it well. There are plenty of life and career challenges where an inability to give up is handy. I have applied ridiculous determination to learning complicated fingerpicking patterns for a particular guitar song, and towriting books. When it comes to games, though, I sometimes get stuck playing them when I really ought to be doing something else.View image in fullscreenObstinately difficult and painfully funny … Baby Steps.Photograph: Devolver DigitalThe latest example of this for me was Baby Steps, an obstinately difficult andpainfully funnygame about trying to walk the world’s biggest loser up a mountain. There are so many places in this game where putting a single foot wrong can cost you an hour of painstaking progress. I was trapped inside a sandcastle for four hours one evening, sliding down the same sandy spiral slope over and over and over again. My children kept walking into the room and groaning to see mestillplaying it and failing to get anywhere. It was 1am before I finally marched triumphantly out of that sand trap, hours after everyone else in my house had gone to bed. My adrenaline was so high that I couldn’t fall asleep for another hour.The sane thing to do would have been to simply put the controller down. Baby Steps is always teasing you with this. It’sdaringyou to give up. Its most infamous challenge, a winding path up a sheer rock face, is called the Manbreaker, and there’s a spiral staircaserightnext to it.The other game I’ve spent most time with this year is Hollow Knight: Silksong, an exquisite explorative action game whose difficulty walks the line between playfully mean and just outright cruel. There are notoriously difficult bosses that you just cannot avoid, each requiring perhaps hours of practice. One of them, the Last Judge, wields a flaming thurible that generates pillars of damaging flames. If that isn’t bad enough, the path back to its chamber is full of danger: flying drill-headed bugs, perilous drops, aggressive guards. Your nerves are frayed by the time the Last Judge battle even begins. But all of this just made me even more determined to beat it.Challenge is a fine balance to strike for game developers: conventional wisdom says that you want players to be entertained, not discouraged. For a long time, the prevailing fashion was moving away from difficulty and towards eminently conquerable open-world games that never put a wall in the way of your progress. It was Dark Souls that proved there was still a huge market for people like me for whom the challenge is kind of the point. I am inexorably drawn towards mastery of objectively pointless things.Maybe the mastery is the point. You can’t master life. Things will always happen that you can’t control. Difficulties come at you out of nowhere, and you don’t always know how to deal with them. In video games, at least you can anticipate the challenge. And if you try very hard and refuse to give up, you can always, always overcome it.What to playView image in fullscreenA combat-focused game … Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment.Photograph: Nintendo/Koei TecmoI am thoroughly surprised by how much I’m enjoyingHyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, a spin-off of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom that follows what Princess Zelda was up to when she was time travelling through Hyrule’s past. Turns out, she was beating up hundreds and hundreds of dudes. It’s a combat-focused game where you run around the battlefields of ancient Hyrule, or the pitch-black Depths with its many monsters, dispatching everything you see with screen-filling flashy attacks from Zelda’s light magic to scientist Mineru’s automatons. It doesn’t feel like Zelda at all; instead it’s more of a cinematic action game featuring Tears of the Kingdom’s familiar iconography and mechanical gadgets, and a story that fills in some gaps in Hyrule’s history and gives the princess more of a starring role.Available on:Nintendo Switch 2Estimated playtime:15 hoursskip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last time this happened, the games industry was scrambling to avoid its impact, so we may find an odd dearth of games towards the end of next year – and the release dates of some games may be pulled forward.In a leaked presentation to staff (viaGame File), Ubisoft’s CEO Yves Guillemot supposedly confronted the haters ofAssassin’s Creed Shadows. The game was drawn into aculture war spatbecause it starred a black samurai and a female ninja. Rather than backing down, Guillemot said: “We had to stop focusing on those who hated us.

He doesn’t like Ford’s line.“Every historian uses it, they just beat it to death,” Gardner says cheerfully, by video from Bozeman,Montana.‘Most horrific death you could imagine’: the truth behind Netflix’s Death By LightningRead more“And it’s really not true. I wrote a narrative. I want people to be immersed in the time, but I just get so tired of that line. The legend is legend. It never becomes fact. People can repeat the legend but it doesn’t make it fact. It’s just a catchy thing that people have caught on to for decades now. And you’ll notice that I did not use it. I referred to it, but I did not use it.”Brothers of the Gun is scholarly, engaging, the story of two unlikely but lasting friends, Earp the complicated but upstanding lawman, Holliday the reckless gambler, stricken by tuberculosis.In Tombstone, Arizona, on 26 October 1881, Earp and Holliday were involved in a shootout that came to be known as theGunfight at the OK Corral. With Earp’s brothers, the pair confronted the Cowboys, gang members wanted for robbery and rustling. In less than a minute, three Cowboys were dead and Holliday was wounded, as were Virgil and Morgan Earp.It was one of countless frontier scraps between lawmen and outlaws and yet it entered legend, not least thanks to classic movies includingMy Darling Clementine, made by Ford in 1946 and starring Henry Fonda as Earp and Victor Mature as Holliday, and Gunfight at the OK Corral, directed by John Sturges in1957, Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas in the leading roles.“A lot of what we know about it is verifiable,” Gardner said of the actual fight and sequels, including killings on both sides. “But I always go back to one of the best quotes, and it’s a very simple quote. Addie Borland, who is the dressmaker across the street who witnessed the fight. People were asking for details, and she goes: ‘I don’t know. All was confusion.’View image in fullscreenDoc Holliday.Photograph: Random House“Even the people there had different stories. I cite often the testimony from what we call theSpicer hearing, and it’s also confusing. You’ve got people that are friends of the Cowboys, so they’re actually lying, and every account is slightly different. It’s rare when somebody agrees on anything. And so I think of Borland’s quote, ‘All was confusion.’ Even the people involved were confused. So it’s really hard to get at it, and it happened in 30 seconds.“And here’s the hilarious part. I just crack up every time I think of this. You wouldn’t believe how many books have all these massive diagrams of the gunfight. They’ll show each stage. You know, ‘Doc was standing here, Wyatt was over here, and here’s their movement, from Allen Street,’ all the way, they’re tracing with dotted lines. And then they got diagrams where people were, you know, for that 30 seconds … People are so fixated. They want to see ‘exactly what happened’. Well, I’m sorry. I mean, I think I know, pretty close, but I can’t give you a frame-by-frame every second of what’s going on, because even those guys, their stories kind of differ.”This is America. Stories have always been hard currency. Wyatt Earp lived into the Hollywood age, dying in 1929, aged 80, after plenty of fights over his story, who got to tell it and how. First depicted on a silent movie screen in 1923, then the subject of those two great mid-century westerns, in relatively recent years he’s been played by Kurt Russell (Tombstone,Val Kilmer as Holliday, 1993) and Kevin Costner (Wyatt Earp, with Dennis Quaid, 1994). On the small screen, Wyatt and Morgan Earp appeared in the great HBO seriesDeadwood, bit parts based on their brief stay in the gold rush town.Gardner drills through such myth-making to find the men beneath. His books cover the span of the old west. A devotee since childhood, as an adult he first wrote “the definitive study of wagons on the Santa Fe Trail, and in fact the only study on those wagons”. He has since written about Billy the Kid and Pat Garrett, Jesse James, Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders, and, most recently,The Earth Is All That Lasts, an award-winning story of “Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull, and the Last Stand of the Great Sioux Nation”. His next book will turn back to James, the Missouri outlaw famouslyplayed by Brad Pitt, and his time as a civil war bushwhacker.Gardner refuses to romanticize such figures. Earp and Holliday spent time on either side of the law, in a world of violence and greed.View image in fullscreenWyatt Earp.Photograph: Random HouseBorn in Monmouth, Illinois, in 1848, Earp was too young to fight in the civil war, though he tried to do so. When he was 20, “he became a constable in Lamar, Missouri, this little, tiny town, with no police academy or training. And mistakes were made. Wyatt has a tragedy in his life with the death of his wife” – Urilla Sutherland, of typhoid in 1870 – after which, as constable, Earp kept for himself tax money he collected.“We don’t know why he kept it,” Gardner says. “He runs, and ends up in Oklahoma. He’s arrested for stealing a horse, and then he’s in Illinois, and he’s running a brothel. I mean, he is literally a pimp. His wife is a prostitute, or his common-law wife, significant other, whatever you call it. He finally heads back west, and he ends up in Wichita, Kansas, and he tries to help the law officer there. There’s a horrible killing, and he impresses the chief of police, and he gets a job. And he excels in that.“Now, this is the irony: Wyatt Earp is a policeman in Wichita, his wife is working in a brothel, and so is his brother’s wife, but he’s an outstanding police officer. Everybody says so. The newspapers, you read the quotes. They’re always praising him in the paper. There’s one instance where he arrests a drunk and the drunk has $500 on him. Any other officer might have pocketed that money and said he didn’t know what the drunk was talking about. But no, Earp holds the money for the drunk and gives it back when he releases him from jail. The same thing happened in Dodge City.“He was praised over and over again as a law officer, and later, when Wyatt’s in the [Spicer] hearing to decide whether he’s going to face a trial for murder after the OK Corral, he gets these letters from Wichita and Dodge City, signed by all these citizens, and they praise him to the stars.”Brothers of the Gun illustrates this fascinating aspect of the old west: friction between law and lawlessness, authorities trying to exert control over newly forming societies, or those societies attempting to rule themselves. The amount of bureaucracy that follows a gunfight – hearings, affidavits, orders for compensation – might be surprising, at least to a reader raised on Clint Eastwood movies, men with no names brooding in vast and terrible lands.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Random HouseFurthermore, as Gardner shows, Earp and Holliday were as entangled in hard politics as any prominent American from the dawn of the nation to now. Earp was a Republican. Tombstone sheriff Johnny Behan was a Democrat, a rival for influence and office.Gardner’s main characters were very different men. Holliday – born in Griffin, Georgia, in 1851, a dentist, hence “Doc” – was dissipated but not in general a thief.“Wyatt, you know, at least attempted to be something different than he was as a youth,” Gardner says. “He’s trying to better himself. And in Tombstone, he builds a house, he’s doing all the things that are right … I’m kind of sympathetic.“Now, Doc Holliday, as Wyatt said, he was kind of his own worst enemy. I don’t know if I buy into this fatalism thing” – part of the enduring myth, Holliday’s fatal sentence with tuberculosis supposed to have fueled a reckless streak. “There are instances where he didn’t want to die … But unlike Wyatt, he doesn’t buy a house. You don’t see these signs that he’s going to settle down. Doc just moves from one gambling place, one boomtown, to the next, and he never really changes. And part of that’s his addiction to gambling. Part of that is tuberculosis, dealing with that and self-medicating, whether it’s with alcohol or later laudanum. He doesn’t seem to have this ambition Wyatt does.“Wyatt is ambitious. He wants to be somebody, and he sees these different steps: deputy sheriff, but he wants to be county sheriff. He’s trying to better himself. And I just don’t see that with Doc Holliday. He just kind of stays the same throughout.”Brothers of the Gun isout nowExplore more on these topicsBooksHistory booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sitting with him in his cosy, book-lined sitting room under a signed picture of Duke Ellington, and next to his Broadwood grand piano, the experience is calm and peaceful.His version of jazz is anything but. For more than six decades, Westbrook has been composing vast, cinematic works. He was the first jazz artist to play at the BBC Proms, created theatre alongside Laurence Olivier, and in the 1970s merged his entire ensemble with the avant-rock band Henry Cow to form the groundbreaking Orckestra. The result is music full of brass fanfares, unusual time signatures, poetry, free improvisation, and genre-bending jazz that invites the listener into a continental circus full of elephants, acrobats, and clowns.Recent health difficulties have made playing hard, so he has spent the last two years digging through his papers, sending piles of scores to archives around the country. Meanwhile, a tape recording languishing in the British Library has become the focus of a salvage mission.View image in fullscreenMike Westbrook performing with his orchestra in 2019This is The Cortège, a monumental two-and-a-half hour jazz suite which has been unavailable for years. The 1982 studio version is trapped in legal limbo, so Westbrook, unwilling to wait for lawyers to iron it out, has reissued The Cortège using raw material from a primitive 1980 BBC Radio 3 recording, done live in one take. “The balance was poor, and the [tape] quality wasn’t very good, so it was a question of: could this be rescued?” Westbrook says. AI software was used to isolate and enhance individual voices and instruments from the mix. Mike is delighted with the result: “It’s one of the best things we’ve done.”Having clambered to the forefront of British jazz during the 1960s and 70s, re-establishing big band music as a progressive force, Westbrook’s artistic vision culminated in The Cortège. As well as being inspired by his work in film and theatre, it grew out of his experiences touring for thousands of miles with his wife Kate throughout Europe in the late 1970s, when “we wanted to be full time artists, and we were both broke”.The pair, along with vocalist and trumpeter Phil Minton, wrote material as they went, combining it into what Westbrook calls jazz-cabaret. “I think cabaret is a useful term, because it means you can do whatever you like: a comic song, a serious piece of music, a poem. When we were in France, Italy and Germany, they really went for these ideas – there’s more of a tradition of mixing musical genres. At one time we played as a circus band in France, which led to many collaborations.”The Cortège came together in 1978 at a street festival in Santarcangelo, Italy and represents the mixing of all his influences of playing in rock bands, cabaret, street performance, circus and theatre. A track from the suite, named after the festival, features a version of Jerusalem by William Blake, who was a major influence on Westbrook. In 1971, he had created the music for Adrian Mitchell’s Blake-themed play Tyger, which had also become a kind of cabaret. It was put on at the National Theatre when the creative director was Laurence Olivier, “who I admire enormously. He was kept away from the underlings like me, but when he went around, it was like the pope visiting with his bodyguards. While beneath his gaze, all kinds of shenanigans were going on: jobs for the boys, all those kinds of things. And it paid the rent for a while.”View image in fullscreenMike Westbrook and band in Paris in 1984.Photograph: Goddard Arcive Portraits/AlamyBritain in the 1970s and 80s was a golden time for the arts. “The BBC had a jazz officer. This guy had a certain amount of freedom to listen to bands and invite them back to the studio.” The Arts Council was also generous, and took risks; by heavily subsidising bold new music, “it encouraged [concert] promoters to try new stuff.” It led to “very good audiences” for The Cortège, and the BBC made a documentary about it.Opening track It Starts Here is a burst of energy, propelled by a loping 11/4 rhythm; elaborate sax lines weave over punchy trombone blasts, creating a complex wall of sound. “It’s in your face. It’s pure energy; it’s not about anything,” Westbrook says. “It’s an overture, which then goes into something different and something different again. The question is: can the audience cope with those changes?”As for Santarcangelo, it’s built on an 11/8 time signature, which Westbrook admits is “another difficult one to play. I didn’t really start with a plan … I’d done a bit of TV music for Steven Poliakoff’s film Caught on a Train that used a brass band. One of the scenes I’d written had a speeding train in the dawn, and that was all in my mind.” And the use of Jerusalem? “Kate suggested it: it has a perfect contemporary folk music feel.”Throughout his musical life, Westbrook has successfully broken down barriers and tried new things: after The Cortège came 1987’s London Bridge Is Broken Down project, a large-scale composition for voice, jazz orchestra, and chamber orchestra. Critics praised Westbrook’s range and control of orchestral colour; the Irish Times declared it “beyond category”.In 1992, he helmed the first jazz orchestra to play at the BBC Proms, performing big band versions of Rossini. They faced a hostile reaction. “At first, the prommers stood with their backs to the stage. Gradually they came round and by the end when we played a rock version of the William Tell overture, they were all jigging about. But we got some hate mail afterwards.”Even at 89, and despite health difficulties, he’s learning new things: right now, it’s church bells, for a collaboration with composer Marcus Vergette at an abandoned church in Highampton, Devon. Kate, still his central creative partner, wrote lyrics for the piece. “This has led me into a whole new, rather strange territory, that I can’t even begin to describe. It’s a whole different musical language,” he says. “You’ve got three bells, A, C and D, and I’ve been trying to find what you can do with it all.”Jack DeJohnette was more than a jazz drummer – his staggering range made him a superhuman force in musicRead moreAs he continues to sort through a lifetime of scores and recordings, he knows how lucky he’s been. “I was allowed to experiment, make mistakes and spend a lot of time on the road, and to figure out what it’s all about. Music is a serious business.”The Cortège Live at the BBC 1980 is released 14 November by Cadillac Records.Explore more on these topicsJazzExperimental musicClassical musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This white-bread movie playlist has been released in advance of His Holiness’s “meeting with the world of cinema” on Saturday, part of a longstanding Vatican policy of engaging with creatives.The pope has, according to a Vatican statement “expressed his desire to deepen the dialogue with the world of cinema, and in particular with actors and directors, exploring the possibilities that artistic creativity offers to the mission of the Church and the promotion of human values.” The pope will chat with movie notables including Cate Blanchett, Spike Lee, George Miller, Gus Van Sant and Giuseppe Tornatore.His selection of films looks, at first glance, very trad compared to hispredecessor Francis’s picks, which included Rossellini’s Rome Open City, Visconti’s The Leopard and Fellini’s La Strada.View image in fullscreenMaking a difference … It’s a Wonderful Life.Photograph: World History Archive/AlamyNo doubt about it. Francis was a Letterboxd film bro. Leo is a bit uncool by comparison. But at least he hasn’t chosen anything biblical, such as say Mel Gibson’s worrying The Passion of the Christ – that one was enjoyed by the late John Paul II who is said to have murmured, after the house lights had gone up: “It is as it was …”But let’s have a look at this list of Leo’s filmic faves … which ends on a disturbing note.‘Always the coolest, calmest man in the room’: friends and film-makers remember Robert RedfordRead moreFirst, The Sound of Music. Leo loves it. Fine. We all love it. Perhaps, as Catholic leader, he savoured the historical paradox in that film: Austrian nuns who wereanti-Nazi? Wow. Interesting. Then there’s Capra’s adored classic It’s a Wonderful Life about James Stewart coming to see how he’s made a difference to the lives of people in his little home town Bedford Falls.Capra was a Catholic and the town’s main church is the St Peter and Paul Catholic Church. Redford’s heart-wrenching Ordinary People is pretty secular but it’s all about family values.But then there’s the overbearingly sugary Life Is Beautiful by the exuberant comic actor and film-maker Roberto Benigni. Benigni plays an Italian Jew who in 1944 is thrown into a Nazi death camp with his son and with many impish tricks and impostures tries to conceal from the boy what is happening, pretending it is all a game. There is something enduringly grating and jarring and existentially dishonest about the film’s attempt at applying emollient sentimental comedy to the Holocaust.View image in fullscreenExistentially dishonest … Life is Beautiful.Photograph: Miramax/Sportsphoto/AllstarGiven the Roman Catholic church’stroubled relationship with the Nazi regime, I really wish the pope had chosen something else.Sister Bridget, the terrifying mother superior played by Geraldine McEwan in Peter Mullan’s searing drama The Magdalene Sisters, is a huge fan of the sweet natured Catholic comedy The Bells of St Mary’s, starring Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman.

The 15-year-old, whobecame one of the youngest ever winnersof a primetime Emmy award for his role in the Netflix drama, will next be seen in Emerald Fennell’s adaptation of Wuthering Heights.The story follows two unlikely collaborators trying to succeed in the world of opera: a Venetian noble and a castrated maestro from Calabria. The New York Times Book Review’s Alice Hoffmancalledit “bold and erotic, laced with luxury, sexual tension, music” while the Washington Post’s Joseph McLellan called it “an absorbing look at a fascinating and little-known world”.The film will mark Ford’s third film after the Oscar-nominated Christopher Isherwood adaptation A Single Man and the dual narrative thriller Nocturnal Animals starring Amy Adams. In 2023, Ford said he was now more interested in film than fashion.“I loved making the two films that I made,” he said ina GQ interview. “That was the most fun I’ve ever had in my entire life. I’m 62. Hopefully, I’ll remain somewhat together until 82. So I wanna spend the next 20 years of my life making films. And the clock is ticking. And so it was time to say goodbye to fashion. Fashion is a younger man’s game.”Cry to Heaven is in pre-production in both London and Rome this year and the shoot will begin in January with a release date eyed for later in 2026.Adele had previously been rumoured to make her acting debut in The Death and Life of John F Donovan from Xavier Dolan who directed her video for Hello. “I’m sure I’ll get some flak for this, but I actually would like to act after working with Xavier,” she said at the time. “I would be in a film for him, definitely.”While a song of hers appeared in the final cut, the singer herself ultimately didn’t. The film received mostly negative reviews with a 19% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.Last year, after a string of sell-out shows in Munich, Adele announced she would be taking an indefinite break from music.Cry to Heaven follows on from a string of recentAnne RiceTV adaptations including a new take on Interview with the Vampire, Mayfair Witches and Talamasca: The Secret Order.Explore more on these topicsFilmAdeleTom FordNicholas HoultAaron Taylor-JohnsonAnne RicenewsShareReuse this content"

The Guardian understands that the other two have accepted the pay deal, but PCS members have a significant presence across the organisation.The strike could cause operational issues in the lead-up to Christmas with the newTurner & Constable: Rivals & Originalsshow that opens on 27 November at Tate Britain potentially being affected.Fran Heathcote, the PCS general secretary, said: “With many Tate directors receiving six-figure pay packages and five-figure bonuses while staff are condemned to in-work poverty, it is no wonder we have seen such an overwhelming vote for strike action.”The union leader called the offer “insulting” and is demanding an above-inflation pay rise, and the return of staff benefits – including a staff canteen and subsidised meals. There is also anger over Tate withdrawing access to the civil service pension scheme for new starters from 2021.A Tate spokesperson said: “Tate has made careful savings this year in order to invest in staff pay and still achieve a balanced budget. This includes a 3% salary increase for most roles – including all employees on the lowest three pay bands – while directors are taking a 0% increase to help balance the overall costs. It is only by creating and maintaining a sustainable financial model that we can continue to invest in our staff in the long term.”If an agreement is not reached, the Guardian understands that the action could linger into the new year with shows, includingTracey Emin’s show at Tate Modern, which opens in February, potentially being affected.Tate has had a difficult 12 months during which it celebrated the25th anniversary of Tate Modern opening. The ballot result also comes after earlier restructuring by Tate in which 40 roles were cut to address afunding deficit left over from the pandemic. There have also been accusations that the museum group is “struggling with its identity”.Tate’s director, Maria Balshaw, launched astaunch defence of the organisation, writing to the Guardian that Tate Britain’s visitor numbers were continuing to rise year on year, and “Tate Modern is the most visited museum of modern art in the world”.Other cultural institutions are also struggling.

When asked if he was considering legal options, Kapoor said: “Of course, I’m going to do everything I can.”Kapoor took legal action against the National Rifle Association (NRA) after they used an image of Cloud Gate, which was installed in 2006 and is known locally as “the Bean”, in an advert.Hesettled out of court with the NRAin 2018. “It’s a bit more complicated with this,” Kapoor said of the more recent incident, “because they’re a full, if you like, national army unit.”Kapoor recently opened a show focusing on hisearly worksat the Jewish Museum in New York (his mother was an Iraqi Jew). The Southbank show, which will take up the entirety of the Hayward Gallery and feature around 40 works, is a different beast.Opening on 16 June 2026 and running until 18 October, visitors will be confronted by Kapoor’s usual mix of large-scale, colossal works that use vibrant pigment and Vantablack,the most intense black paint in existence. At the Hayward, he will unveil two new pieces: the first is an inflated PVC membrane.“As you enter the show, there is a very big object occupying the whole of that first gallery,” he said. “It, if you like, bulges and fills that whole space, pushing the viewer right to the side.”The second is described by theSouthbank Centreas “a dark mountainous threshold” that looms down “amid a sprawling red landscape” contained within the upper gallery.He said: “What it does, I hope, is to evoke in the viewer a sense of ‘what is this?’; ‘Is it art?’; ‘Why am I here with this?’ I think these are very important questions, because what they do is unleash emotion.”The exhibition will also feature Kapoor’s 2022 work,Mount Moriah at the Gate of the Ghetto, ahuge swirl of black and redthat descends from the ceiling. There are a few works from the 1990s and 2010s but much of the show comes from his output over the last five years.View image in fullscreenKapoor’s Mount Moriah at the Gate of the Ghetto will feature in the Southbank show.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“I don’t think the Hayward is a place for retrospectives,” he said. “It’s a place that invites daring proposals and I’m jumping in with both feet.”Curated by the Hayward’soutgoing artistic directorRalph Rugoff, the exhibition is a full-circle moment for Kapoor, who had his first major survey in a public gallery at the Southbank Centre in 1998.Kapoor, who was born in Mumbai andwon the Turner prize in 1991, will be one of the standout elements in the Southbank Centre’s 75th anniversary celebrations.In September, the Southbank Centre announced that Danny Boyle’s You Are Here will see thousands of participants take over the site in a celebration of the role the institution “has played in supporting youth culture since its inception”.Venice in Vantablack: Anish Kapoor’s disappearing actRead moreCelebrations will start in May to mark the 75th anniversary of the Festival of Britain, with leaders of the institution hoping it will “galvanise” the country in the same way the original celebration did in 1951.Kapoor said: “Seventy-five years is a long time in which a hell of a lot has changed. Of course, the postwar optimism is gone, but perhaps we can galvanise another optimism. A Britain that is made of all kinds of people, from all kinds of places coming together with this strange positive sense of what it means to speak of ourselves as British.”The anniversary will also include a celebration of Benjamin Zephaniah and the composer Steve Reich, while Goalhanger Podcasts will host events, and the pianist Yuja Wang will present her immersive Playing with Fire performance.Explore more on these topicsAnish KapoorSouthbank CentreICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)newsShareReuse this content"

Scene 1.A classroom in a secondary school in Peterborough. It is a dreary, wet afternoon. Pupils file into the room, take their seats and face the front.These year 10 English students at Ormiston Bushfield academy are taking part in a workshop about Macbeth, part of a new curriculum devised by theRoyal Shakespeare Company(RSC) to bring the Bard’s works to life in the UK’s slightly stuffy classrooms.The pupils are quiet. They slump in their seats. Then a rehearsal-style game of “pass the click [of fingers]” warms them up, and a few minutes later they are up on their feet, paired up and performing some of Shakespeare’s best-known lines with gusto.The focus of this session is on Act 1, scene 7, a pivotal moment in Shakespeare’s famous tragedy whereMacbethis having doubts but is persuaded to kill King Duncan by his wife, Lady Macbeth, who taunts and goads him into action.“Art thou afeard … ?” rings out across the desks. “I have given suck,” someone else yells out, without so much as a giggle, as “plucked my nipple” and “boneless gums” (some of Lady Macbeth’s many memorable lines) echo through the classroom.View image in fullscreenPupils at Ormiston Bushfield academy. The new RSC curriculum treats Shakespeare’s works as living, breathing texts for performance.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianPaul Ainsworth, the RSC’s young theatre makers developer, who is running the session, is delighted. “Generally we are all terrified of Shakespeare,” he says. “But as soon as we start working actively on the text, exploring it as a play rather than a piece of literature, it opens it up to young people.”The RSC Shakespeare curriculum, which is funded by the Foyle Foundation, launches on Wednesday. It is an online platform for teachers and pupils which uses the RSC’s rehearsal-based teaching approaches – honed in classrooms across the world – to transform the study of Shakespeare in schools. It provides access to more than 2,000 resources including video extracts from RSC rehearsals and past productions, as well as activity-packed lesson plans, and is free to all state schools in the UK.Instead of pupils sitting at their desks glumly taking it in turns to read the play out loud, the RSC curriculum treats Shakespeare’s works as living, breathing texts for performance. Launching first with Macbeth this year, Romeo and Juliet will follow in early 2026, with two more plays each academic year.“The RSC can’t get actors into every school in the country,” says Adjoa Andoh, who plays Lady Danbury in Bridgerton and is a leading light in the RSC. “So this is a way of getting Shakespeare – a living, breathing thing – into schools to excite kids.”View image in fullscreenThe RSC’s young theatre makers developer, Paul Ainsworth, instructs the class on the theme of Macbeth.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianThe RSC approach is working well for 15-year-old Charlie, who generally prefers rap to Shakespeare. “I’m not usually a performer,” he says. “But it was a nice break, doing something different.”Kieran, 14, is also enthusiastic. “I really enjoyed it. I think some people don’t like Shakespeare because they don’t understand immediately what a lot of it means, but if you listen to it a little bit, even if you don’t fully understand it, you can grasp what’s going on.”David Tennant, best known as Dr Who but a Shakespeare veteran whose recentperformance as Macbeth garnered a five-star reviewin the Guardian, is enthusiastic about the new curriculum.“Many young people’s first experience of Shakespeare is in a classroom.“The lucky ones might have a brilliant teacher who can bring it to life, but many find themselves inexplicably mouthing words that make little sense to you at the age of 14. Shakespeare should be experienced, engaged with and performed, not just read from a page.”Judi Dench, who has played most of Shakespeare’s major female roles in and told the Guardian in 2023, “All I ever wanted to do was play Shakespeare, nothing else”, believes his plays are timeless and can still resonate with young people today.Dench said: “In the rehearsal room, we don’t have all the answers on day one, instead we explore the play and its language, peeling back its layers and playing with different interpretations to find a way of telling the story for today.“The Shakespeare curriculum will bring the spirit of collaboration, inquiry and discovery from the rehearsal room into classrooms up and down the country, inspiring and engaging young minds”.Explore more on these topicsWilliam ShakespeareSchoolsSecondary schoolsMacbethRoyal Shakespeare CompanyCurriculumsTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

As well as tours generating revenue through ticket sales, tourism and more, the £8bn figure also factors in revenue from recorded music, whether via sales, streaming, commercial deals and other sources.British artists such as Charli xcx – whose “Brat summer” was arguably the biggest pop cultural event of 2024 – thrived abroad, helping music exports to a new high: another 5% rise, to £4.8bn. This year is likely to keep the trend kicking upwards, thanks in part to blockbuster stadium tours by Oasis, Coldplay and Dua Lipa.Foreign secretary Yvette Cooper heralded music as “one of the most powerful expressions of our soft power in action” and said she was “deeply grateful for the role that the UK music industry plays in promoting British culture around the world”.The industry added a net total of 4,000 new jobs in the UK, taking the number of people working full-time in the music industry to 220,000. The numbers of people actually making music – musicians, composers, songwriters, producers and engineers – rose 2.9% to 157,800, though for many of these people, music is a small part of their overall income. 43% of people were found to earn less than £14,000 a year from music.In a foreword to the report, Cooper pointed to the UK government’s £30m Music Growth Package as a boon to the British industry, and said music is an important facet of the British government’s Soft Power Council, founded in January by her predecessor David Lammy alongside culture secretary Lisa Nandy.The council is designed, in Lammy’s words, to “build relationships, deepen trust, enhance our security and drive economic growth”. UK Music chief executive Tom Kiehl is on the 26-strong advisory body alongside figures from sport, the arts, heritage, tourism and more.But Kiehl warned: “While it is brilliant news that the government now acknowledges music as a high-growth sub-sector, ultimately the government needs to be judged in terms of the progress it makes in regulating artificial intelligence and unlocking EU touring. The status quo on these two big issues is currently tilted against music’s interests.”The encroachments on freedom of movement following Brexit have had a big knock-on effect in the music industry, with bureaucracy and costs meaning that it is harder to tour across the EU.In a UK Music survey of around 1,300 musicians accompanying the financial findings, respondents complained of fewer invites to perform, prohibitive costs and an impact on royalties as their music is performed less in Europe. Timelines and costs for visas to the US have also grown significantly.There’s a £1 idea that could save small music venues. Is Live Nation holding it back?Read moreUK Music called for an agreement between the UK and EU to lift visa and work permit requirements, and to cut costs relating to the “carnet” needed to transport goods (such as instruments and touring equipment) across EU borders. There is also a call for a reciprocal agreement between the US and UK on visa costs.There are also fears that AI could erode employability across the sector, as sophisticated tools emerge that can rival human expertise. AI-generated music is also becoming increasingly popular with listeners, meaning human musicians have a new rival for attention, consumer spend and royalty payments.UK Music’s survey gave a mixed picture for the use of artificial intelligence. Well over half of all artists and performers said they don’t use AI and never will. But producers were less circumspect: more than two-thirds of those polled said they either already used it or would be open to doing so.Explore more on these topicsMusicMusic industrynewsShareReuse this content"

A billion true-crime documentaries have since revealed that actual serial killers are very boring, with nothing like Anthony Hopkins’s screen presence.He was hardly an unknown when he got that Oscar-winning part in The Silence of the Lambs in 1989: a star wasn’t born, but rather a megastar, a legend. His Dr Lecter was based, Hopkins cheerfully recalls in this new autobiography, on Bela Lugosi’s Dracula, on Stalin as recalled by his daughter, and on his own icily exacting, gimlet-eyed Rada tutor Christopher Fettes. There was a father-daughter dimension to these scenes as well; a painful subject for Hopkins, who also describes how his Lear was subconsciously influenced by an agonised guilt about Abigail, the estranged daughter from his disastrous first marriage in 1966 to Petronella Barker, who resented his absences and drinking.View image in fullscreenHopkins in 1941, aged three, on Aberavon beach.Photograph: Cliff MathersThe title comes from an old wartime photo of Hopkins as a toddler on the beach with his dad – the kid who maybe thought he would never do OK. He was a bewildered, lonely, vulnerable little boy from Port Talbot, son of Richard Arthur Hopkins, the scene-stealing supporting player here: a baker and man’s man, a plain speaker who loathed the Bible-punching hypocrites of the chapel and didn’t believe in showing his emotions, but had a streak of wistful, tearful romanticism. It was Hopkins Sr who furiously resented the way they had to go cap-in-hand to their wealthy relations like Auntie Patty, whose husband knew Nye Bevan and could get young Anthony into a posh school: “Because they’re bloody rich!” he raves in the car on the way there. “We’re all hoping for some pickings! Bloody rubbish, that’s what it is!”The grovelling paid off, for a while. Hopkins was a hopeless student at his new school. But one day in an English lesson he had to recite John Masefield’s poem The West Wind – sight unseen – and that voice came to life; he stunned the teacher and the other boys. He says quite plausibly that poetry, on its own, launched him. This, and joining the YMCA drama club. Remarkably, he left school a no-hoper, went into acting, and to the astonishment of his parents was on stage with Laurence Olivier at the Old Vic within 10 years. He more or less did it on his own, although in those days there were grants to go to Rada – a way up for working-class actors. His dad remained in awe of Anthony’s global success: on asking his son to recite the Yorick speech from Hamlet, Hopkins Sr listened attentively and then went into another room and burst into tears.As for the hot-tempered, bloody-minded son, he quit the National Theatre company in a fit of pique – to Olivier’s profound dismay and disapproval – but lucked into a great TV role as a suspected war criminal in Leon Uris’s QB VII, which led indirectly to parts like that in David Lynch’s The Elephant Man and a thriving starry career on screen, which he preferred to the stage. And he quit booze in 1975 having been a hell-raising alcoholic, and so survived into middle age to execute great performances, including Lecter, the butler Stevens in The Remains of the Day with Emma Thompson and the old man with dementia in The Father – his second Oscar.In the latter half of the book his personality becomes more opaque, more studied. Some of the anecdotage doesn’t quite come off. He recalls being taken out to lunch by his co-star in Oliver Stone’s Nixon, the much-respected actor Paul Sorvino, who wanted to tell him his performance as Nixon wasn’t working. Was this the moment for Hopkins to learn something from the legendary star of Scorsese’s Goodfellas? Not exactly. Hopkins seems to go along with Stone’s dismissal of Sorvino as being motivated by jealousy. Really?He repeatedly performs the tough, down-to-earth professional actor who believes it’s your duty to get there on time, know all the crew’s names and get on with it. Quite so. But he also recounts confronting an obnoxious director who’d made a young extra cry: “Apologise to her! And learn some manners. You ever do that again in front of me, I’ll change the shape of your face!” Hopkins sounds like someone who gave up drink but maybe not the belligerence that went with it. A Shakespearean like him must know Cornwall’s lines on Kent from Lear: “He cannot flatter, he! An honest mind and plain – he must speak truth!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A manifestation of a repressed desire to eliminate rival literary talent? A clear case of the death drive? Either way, there’s some twisted business going on in Andrew Gallix’s chronically funny debut novel, Loren Ipsum.The morbid if intriguing premise quickly becomes secondary to an insouciant satire on the vanity fair of present-day literary culture. Not sincePaul Ewen’s How to Be a Public Author has so much gleeful scorn for pretentious authors, critics and scenesters been poured on to the page. Taking its title from the placeholder text used while preparing a book for print, the novel features an eponymous protagonist, a journalist resident in Paris, who is researching a monograph on the reclusive English author Adam Wandle. Loren Ipsum somehow manages to be both the book’s moral centre and a shapeshifting cipher for everything that’s wrong with contemporary literary life. With “a heart of frosted glass”, she is “all blurred features and radio static”. Her own first novel, Fifty Shades of Grey Matter, was published by Galley Beggar in 2019. Her favourite bookshop is Shakespeare and Company (“she had all their totes”), and her best party frock is “part Mondrian, part Battenberg”. The knowing list of Loren’s favourite things is peak Bougie London Literary Woman and wickedly spot-on. It’s that kind of book. By the end, you can’t see the modernism for all the posts fencing it in.While some of the in-jokes overreach, others hit the spot with laser-guided accuracyAs the death toll of Paris’s resident scribes rises, an obscure terrorist group claims responsibility, though their motives are unclear. Happily, the location moves to Antibes, where the carnivalesque action can continue. When Loren joins a literary party on a yacht, there’s a clear nod to Fellini’s 8½, with its melancholy cavalcade of posturing parvenus. Marcello Mastroianni himself makes a cameo later in a passage devoted to Le Tournon, the Parisian cafe whereJoseph Rothdrank himself to death and where Wandle goes to hide and write his ponderous prose.Between these set-pieces there are whole chapters devoted to band names (“The Old Duffers, Omnishambles, The Opening Gambits”), and a heterogeneous cast of the great and the good: “Guy Debord in hot pursuit of a statuesque demi-mondaine modelling a lampshade hat … Gilles Deleuze doing the twist to Martha and the Muffins.” There are walk-ons from Andrew Wylie, Roland Barthes and Richard Hell, as well as Gallix’s own publisher, the author Sam Mills. There’s also the running gag of punning chapter titles: What We Talk About When We Talk About Talk; Quiet Days in Noisy; and my favourite, The Man Without Quality Streets. While some of the in-jokes overreach (“the cool clinking of the Žižek-shaped ice cubes”), others hit the spot with laser-guided accuracy. For instance, the moment when the immaculately named Sostène Zanzibar, “who had always tried and failed to convey the inadequacy of words with words”, comes up with the concept of a novel printed in disappearing ink.Towards the end, the book takes a darker turn: “Shocking footage of a sensitivity reader, who had been tarred and feathered and then shackled to the railings on Mecklenburgh Square, was broadcast.” Then there’s the fate of the English writer Patrick Berkman, who moves to Montreuil but soon finds the banlieue population makes him feel he doesn’t belong, “just as they had been made to feel they did not belong in France”. He’s later found dismembered, his “puny body” partly devoured. Here, Gallix reinforces the notion that comedy is the best place to say something serious; in this instance, about France’s alienation of migrant communities. This is also evident in his unstoppable puns and word games. With their subversive, rebarbative edge, they stay just the right side of clever-clever.Teeming with literary and pop cultural allusions and antic wordplay, Loren Ipsum ultimately stages a conversation about the uses, and possible uselessness, of literature. It has a nimble wit and a punk rock attitude that is wholly addictive. Destined, as they say, to become a cult classic.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

At least let’s hope lots of people get to see this, even if it’s a mistake because they meant to buy a ticket forPredator: Badlands. Instead of an alien hunter with gnarly teeth, this offers a profoundly troubling meditation on our collective thirst for revenge – or at least the kind of bizarre performance art version of revenge as served up byreality TV show To Catch a Predator, a US series that ran from 2004 to 2007 and which featured weekly footage of paedophiles and would-be paedophiles being duped, shamed and arrested.‘Abject horror’: the troubling history of paedophile-hunting TV showsRead morePredators’ director David Osit, at first just an offscreen voice but eventually a fully seen (in every sense) presence, explains that he used to watch To Catch a Predator avidly as a young man. Every episode was roughly the same: a man is observed arriving at a suburban house, expecting to have sex there with a teenaged girl or boy who is in fact a hired actor who has lured the target over. Then journalist Chris Hansen would step out from behind a doorway to confront the target with transcripts of interactions he had been having with the decoy. The target would then usually start crying and pleading for mercy;and then, in a final theatrical act of cruelty, he’d be told he was free to go only to be arrested seconds later by waiting law enforcement officers working with the show.At the time, Jimmy Kimmel, still just starting out as a chat show host, gleefully described To Catch a Predator as “the funniest thing on television”, likening it to prank programme Punk’d “but for paedophiles”. But no matter how how repellent the “victims” are, nothing about the show or situation seems funny now, especially when we learn about a suspect who killed himself when the cops arrived.How does the punitive, ritualised humiliation of To Catch a Predator, or any of the many gonzo made-for-YouTube knockoffs, like the one we see being filmed here, help stop child abuse or change anyone’s life for the better? No one wants to think about how to break these cycles of abuse; instead we’re all trapped a veritable hall of mirrored cruelties in which predators are targeted by morally indignant predators armed with cameras who are in turn filmed by quasi-predatory documentarians. It’s amise en abymeof despair.Predators is in UK and Irish cinemas from 14 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsUS televisionTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

It isn’t his worst. It’s something to justify signing the 64-year-old to a $70m production deal in hopes that he might finally be moved to return to his standup comedy roots and deliver the long-anticipated follow-up to his seminal 1987 special Raw. With access to the subject and his archival material bought and paid for, Being Eddie is free to focus on other aspects of Murphy’s life, opening with indulgent shots of his gothic mansion and its retractable roof. While the camera gawks at the spoils of Murphy’s 40-plus year career, he remains at pains to tell viewers that his day-to-day routine isn’t much different from theirs: he goes to work, hangs out with his family and falls asleep toMTV’s Ridiculousness. He thinks it’s the funniest show on TV, in fact, and would much rather binge that blooper series (which he likens to Alejandro Jodorowsky’s avant-garde work) than reruns of his greatest hits.The Pickup review – Eddie Murphy’s heinous new comedy is worse than NorbitRead moreThat would be a bold confession to share even if it wasn’t coming from arguably the funniest person who has ever lived, and Being Eddie wastes no time in making Murphy’s claim to that title ironclad. For confirmation, director Angus Wall starts out by consulting with other recipients of majorNetflixdeals: Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld. It’s just hard to digest all this reverence for Murphy from comedians who have grown increasingly out touch and comfortable with punching down at marginalized groups.Their hero worship comes as Murphy heaps praise on Muhammad Ali for giving rise to a foundational generation of high-achieving Black Americans that also includes Oprah, Michael Jordan and Barack Obama. More revealing moments follow when Murphy opens up about his troubled home life on Long Island (he lets slip that his first memory in life is of his parents fighting), the whiplash of going from hot comedian to smoldering sex symbol, and the media pitting him against Richard Pryor – a comic idol he actually got to direct in the star-studded caper comedy Harlem Nights.Wall, the Oscar-winning editor behind The Social Network and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, shows off some armchair psychology in Being Eddie. He gets Murphy to connect his habit of paying for the funeral arrangements of his famous friends (Redd Foxx, Rick James) to earlier troubles accepting the deaths of his father and stepfather, which generally resulted in an aversion to funerals. He didn’t attend the one for his brother the comedian Charlie Murphy, who died suddenly of leukemia in 2017.Shrewdly, Being Eddie repurposes some of the less jokey outtakes from Charlie’s Chappelle Show storytimes to help round out the portrait of Eddie – who generally shrugs off those epic yarns aboutJamesandPrinceas “just another night in my life”. Wall lets Murphy talk about diagnosing himself with obsessive-compulsive disorder – a comedic secret weapon that he credits with his great powers of observation. But Wall doesn’t challenge Murphy, at least not on camera, when Murphy claims to have cured himself with his incredible powers of self-restraint.The documentary also leaves out other notable milestones in Murphy’s public life: the 1997 arrest of a trans prostitute who happened to be riding in his car during a traffic stop (the actor maintained he was just being a “good Samaritan”), his14-day media-marriageto producer Tracey Edmonds, hisinitial rejectionof the daughter he fathered with ex-Spice Girl Mel B. Most galling, the documentary makes a mountain of Murphy returning to SNL after he spurned the show for decades over jokes made at his expense without bringing anyone who was part of that episode then (David Spade) or now (Lorne Michaels) on to explain their side.Murphy getting dissed by the show that made him a household name is presented as a career nadir in Being Eddie. But it’s difficult to accept that premise when even Murphy himself credits that moment for prompting him to change tack to projects such as Dreamgirls, which earned him an Oscar nomination (albeit one ultimately thwarted by his insistence on also doing the film Norbit); Shrek, one of the highest-grossing animation franchises of all time; and The Nutty Professor, which saw him raise the standard for costuming and character acting to an impossible height. It turns out Universal was so skeptical about his ability to play the supporting characters in the film that he was made to audition for each of the Klump family parts.It isn’t until you near the end of Being Eddie’s 103 minutes that it becomes clear why Netflix would keep stalling. For a parting gift, the film-makers present Murphy with two ventriloquist dolls made to look like Pryor and Bill Cosby – a full-circle moment that sprang from Murphy riffing on what his standup act might look like if he were to return to the stageright now. Enough with the teasing, already. Just do it.Being Eddie is available now on NetflixExplore more on these topicsEddie MurphyDocumentary filmsNetflixComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a grittyNew Yorksleazesploitation crime thriller with some gobsmackingly over-the-top punch-ups and shootouts; some of the attitudes to ethnicity and sexual politics can only be described as of their time. Those who prefer 21st-century standards of good taste had better look away now.A racist paedophile (Cliff Gorman) has kidnapped the 15-year-old daughter of divorced ex-cop Sean Boyd, played by James Brolin. This sweaty creep is demanding a million-dollar ransom, but he’s got the wrong girl. He thinks that his prisoner – whom he dresses up in a diaphanous blue gown belonging to his dead mom, and at one point kisses tenderly on the lips – is the daughter of a property magnate that he blames for moving so-called undesirables into his Bronx apartment building, with a view to forcing out existing tenants so he can knock the whole thing down for a new development. (We glimpse a New York Daily News headline:“Carter Tours The S Bronx Slums”.)So Boyd has to track down this loathsome perv to save his daughter – while Boyd himself is also being hunted down by a corrupt cop who he once exposed. This is the pop-eyed Sgt Barnes, played by Dan Hedaya, who fires at Boyd in the city street with a shotgun, causing window-shattering chaos, but because he’s a cop doesn’t seem to get into any trouble. There is a hilarious and outrageous smutty sequence when Boyd has to question sex-workers in their peep-show booths; a creative way of getting nudity into the film. You can’t help but gasp at the full-tilt craziness on display, and connoisseurs will enjoy the hothead cab driver in the chase scene, played by a young Mandy Patinkin.Night of the Juggler is in UK cinemas from 14 Nov, and on 4K UHD from 17 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsNew YorkreviewsShareReuse this content"

You don’t have to be a fan of early hardcore punk to enjoy this documentary about the incredible life of Harley Flanagan, founder, bassist and vocalist of theNew Yorkband Cro-Mags. By the age of 13, Flanagan was the drummer in the Stimulators, playing with Madness and the Cramps. He was punk’s Artful Dodger, with a bit of Animal from the Muppets thrown in; hammering away behind the drums, bare chested, with a mop of hair. As another talking head puts it: punk didn’t shape him, he shaped punk.Flanagan was born in 1967 to a drug-addict mother (he was that baby on a dirty mattress on the floor, he says). The poet Allen Ginsberg rescued his mom from a hippy commune; they lived in New York on the pregentrified Lower East Side, which in archive footage from the late 1970s and early 80s looks like a war zone, with burnt-out buildings and rubble everywhere. On the punk scene, a kid behind the drums was a novelty; but Flanagan was exposed to drugs and sexually assaulted on numerous occasions.The stories keep coming. There was the time the Stimulators played Belfast during the Troubles and he came back to the US a skinhead. Or the New York night club that took out a $10,000 hit to have him killed (or rough him up, no one is quite sure). At some point, Flanagan became a Hare Krishna and then a jujitsu instructor; later, in 2012, he was arrested and charged with stabbing two members of Cro-Mags, but the charges were dropped. The film-makers’ interviews with Flanagan might, perhaps, have probed him more about his anger and his feelings about his mother; still, it’s one hell of a story. “Without music,” he says, “I would’ve definitely ended up dead or in jail.”Harley Flanagan: Wired for Chaos is in UK cinemas from 14 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPunkNew YorkreviewsShareReuse this content"

But since chancellorFriedrich Merzgave a speech in the state of Brandenburg on 14 October, it has taken on a new political meaning. “We have come far with migration,” he said, “but of course we still have this problem in ourstadtbild.”It was a very different register from his predecessor Angela Merkel, who once said she could not determine whether someone had a German passport “just by looking at them.” Asked to clarify his comments at a press conference a few days after his speech, Merz doubled down: he told the journalists to“ask your daughters”what he meant – and refused to elaborate.That one vague line has dominated Germany’s political discourse for over a month now. Public figures organised demonstrations and launched open letters rejecting what they saw as a racist dog-whistle by the chancellor. On political talkshows, politicians, actors and comedians rallied to Merz’s defence. And the far-right AfD celebrated the free PR ahead of next year’s regional elections, as the chancellor’s vagueness left plenty of space to connect his words to their vision of “remigration”, a far-right concept of mass deportation that amounts to ethnic cleansing.View image in fullscreen‘We still have this problem’ … Friedrich Merz on a visit to Brandenburg on 14 October.Photograph: Getty ImagesThe debate revealed something larger: how Germany’s ruling Christian Democrats, who govern in most of the country’s states, seem to view Germans of colour – not as fellow citizens, but as aesthetic intrusions into an idealised, sanitised vision of the German city. Party allies tried to brush off accusations of racism towards the Chancellor, yet never explained what Merz’s ideal cityscape looked like, or who exactly didn’t fit into it.The second word,Haftbefehl, is equally loaded. Literally, it means “arrest warrant”. But it’s also the stage name of Aykut Anhan, one of Germany’s most influential rappers. The son of a Turkish mother and a Zaza-Kurdish father, born in Offenbach, Hesse, Haftbefehl built his career on brutally honest, yet also at times comedic depictions of crime, trauma and survival – in a language that fuses German, Turkish, Zazaki and English.After nearly two years out of the public eye, Anhan resurfaced with a Netflix documentary, Babo – The Haftbefehl Story, an unflinching account of addiction, familial trauma in migrant families and mental illness in the upper echelons of the German music industry. It immediately jumped to the top of Netflix Germany’s charts, praised for both its film-making and its raw honesty.The documentary’s success wasn’t surprising: in contrast to the UK or France, artists from marginalised communities are rarities in the cultural mainstream of Germany, and Haftbefehl has long been one of the few, if not only, gangsta rappers embraced by Germany’s cultural establishment while remaining rooted in marginalised communities. Yet the attention the film drew eclipsed even the debate about Merz’s “cityscape”. It’s a telling coincidence: at the very moment the ruling party is defining belonging as an aesthetic question – who fits visually into the German landscape – the nation is captivated by the story of a man whose entire art is born from exclusion.View image in fullscreen‘Haftbefehl is the answer to thestadtbilddebate’ … a still from Babo: The Haftbefehl Story.Photograph: NetflixIt’s not hard to imagine that a figure such as Aykut Anhan – a former small-time dealer from an urban estate who’s battling addiction and depression – is precisely the kind of person Merz’sstadtbildrhetoric seems to aim at. The kind of person who may be perceived as a “problem” in the “cityscape” that a greater amount of deportations of asylum seekers would solve. The dehumanising view within Merz’s choice of words is hidden behind a language alluding to cleanliness and civic beauty.That ideology has consequences. When people sense they are unwanted in the country of their birth, resentment towards the state follows. Haftbefehl captures this feeling in his music. “Human values don’t count, just your shiny Mercedes”, he raps inDepressionen im Ghetto(Depression in the Ghetto); “Fuck your integration, I’ll pop a bullet straight into your skull”, he sings on 069 (named after the Offenbach and Frankfurt dialling code). Anhan managed to turn the despair of being seen as alien into highly influential and lucrative art with his alter ego. He even left an imprint on German language, with the Zazaki wordbabo(“boss” or “leader”), popularised by his lyrics, becoming Germany’s “youth word of the year” in 2013.Germany, it seems, loves the art born from this alienation – but not necessarily the people who create it. The same pattern of appreciating the aesthetic while erasing the originators appears elsewhere as well: luxury kebab shops selling “elevated” versions of the Turkish-German staple with truffle and asparagus; Berlin DJs sampling north African melodies; influencers wearing headscarves as summer accessories. The aesthetics of migrant life are endlessly imitated – while the people behind them remain suspect at best, a problem to be removed at worst.View image in fullscreen‘Fear? Yes, of a shift to the right in Germany’ …  a demonstration with the title We Are the Daughters in Berlin on October 21, after Merz’s comments.Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP/Getty ImagesGerman youth have come to recognise this: the student council of the city of Offenbach, Anhan’s place of birth, has petitioned to include Haftbefehl’s music in school curricula to reflect “post-migrant” identities and pop cultural debates. Unsurprisingly, Hesse’s ministry of culture and education has so far rejected the proposal due to Haftbefehl’s “propensity for crime”, as well as allegations of sexism or antisemitism, among others. “Haftbefehl is the answer to thestadtbilddebate”, a student told the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, “I don’t relate to Goethe or Kafka.” Including Haftbefehl’s lyricism in the school syllabus would appeal to more students, and, ultimately, help to “integrate” them into German society.The pressure to conform to an idea of integration is deeply ingrained even within post-migrant youth themselves. But as the chancellor muses about a more German cityscape, the question remains: what should integration look like? Will it ever include the perspectives of those who are pushed to comply or does the concept remain a dead end? And can those who don’t fit Merz’s picture of Germany ever feel truly at home in it, no matter how much they assimilate to a – more often than not vague – idea of Germanness?One of Babo’s most moving scenes shows Anhan sitting on the floor, singing along to the traditional German singer-songwriter Reinhard Mey’sIn Meinem Garten. It is a moment of quiet revelation: a man who will for ever be perceived as not belonging to the Chancellor’s idealstadtbild, yet so deeply shaping and shaped by German culture, so very German in his tastes and sensibilities.Explore more on these topicsMusicGermanyEuropeFriedrich MerzRapcommentShareReuse this content"

He works exclusively in watercolour over gesso – a white, hard-drying primer traditionally made with gypsum – on canvas or linen. You wouldn’t guess it: from a distance, and in reproduction, his paintings, many of them monumentally large, look like film stills, with the shine of a wet lip or the papery crease of an eyelid preserved in glossy, hyperreal intensity. It’s only when you get much closer that their surfaces disclose scars and pockmarks, and deep, regular cracks like those of a drought-ravaged river bed.View image in fullscreenClean Windows Kill Birds, 2025.Illustration: © Joseph Yaeger. Courtesy the artist and Modern ArtThe people he depicts are indeed taken from film stills snipped from their original contexts. The touch of the artist, meanwhile, is visible in the fragments of pistachio shell, clumps of dust from the studio floor, or foil wrapper from a biscuit, forever bound to the picture surface like a dog’s footprint in wet cement.Yaeger writes a text for each exhibition. In this case it is the transcript, we are told, of a polygraph – or lie detector – test undertaken by the artist, in which only his answers are revealed. It’s a meandering, fragmentary document in which a voyeuristic encounter with a neighbour is interwoven with what seems to be memoir, concerning his work, his daughter, his Catholic upbringing and art criticism.So did he take really take a test? “In all important senses,” Yaeger says cryptically, adding that he thought the polygraph “was debunked ages ago. As a means [of discovering the truth] it’s clumsy and kind of stupid. But as a metaphor, there is just so much meaning that goes down into this feeble little machine, it’s really powerful and dark. It doesn’t surprise me that the Trump administration is using polygraphs – it’s very Trump-administration coded.”View image in fullscreenFire That Alters Nothing, 2025.Illustration: © Joseph Yaeger.

Courtesy the artist and Modern ArtThough lapsed, Yaeger’s Catholic upbringing is hardwired and Clean Windows Kill Birds, in which a woman’s face is seen through the screen of a confessional booth, is one of many hundreds of overtly Catholic paintings he has made. A penitential streak draws the artist to the difficulty in his work – the hours spent painting on the floor, battling the fundamental incompatibility of watercolour and gesso.Partly as a result, there are many dead paintings beneath the surfaces, the evidence of which is visible on the bare edges of the unframed canvases, which are thick with layers of encrusted gesso and pigment. The thing about gesso, says Yaeger, is that the paint can be completely removed: “I could erase this to nothing.” Instead, at the painting’s edges, he tells a different story – perhaps the most important story of all, about our need to make a mark, to leave a trace.Joseph Yaeger: Polygrapher is atModern Art, 8 Bennet Street, London, 15 November to 17 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsArtPaintingExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

ÖBB cited the French government’s ending of subsidies, dealing a blow to thenight-train renaissance.However, there is light at the end of the tunnel.European Sleeperhas told the Guardian that it will be taking over the route from Paris to Berlin, with the first train to run on 26 March 2026. The train will operate three times a week with departures likely to be from Paris Gare du Nord on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday evenings and the return service from Berlin Hauptbahnhof and Ostbahnhof on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The current Nightjet service departs Paris Gare de l’Est just after 7pm and winds east via Strasbourg, Frankfurt, Erfurt and Halle before arriving in Berlin around 8.30am. European Sleeper intends to make the journey via Brussels, with precise route details and timings currently being confirmed with infrastructure managers in France, Belgium and Germany.“I think Nightjet’s existing market will certainly be interested in travelling on European Sleeper,” said Chris Engelsman, the company’s co-founder. “We will also be able to extend the ridership as we offer higher capacity than the Nightjet. ÖBB operates 12 coaches from Paris but it splits to Vienna and then Berlin. On the other hand, we have 12 to 14 coaches that will run entirely to Berlin, with a capacity of 600-700 passengers.”The news is certainly welcomed byOui au train de nuit!, a French campaign group who in September took to the platforms of Paris Gare de l’Est in their nightwear and threw a pyjama party to protest against the cuts to the sleeper services out of Paris. “This is a partial victory for the 91,000people who signed our petition,” said Nicolas Forien, spokesperson for the group.View image in fullscreenEuropean Sleeper plans to use carriages from the 1990s on the new routesEuropean Sleeper, a Dutch cooperative, ran its inaugural service from Berlin to Brussels on 25 May 2023 and the route was extended to Dresden and Prague a year later. The company has already carried over 230,000 passengers on more than 750 night trains and has been a key player in the sleeper-train market, which has not quite seen the spike in services some had hoped for, owing to a lack of rolling stock equipped with sleeper berths and cross-border complications. The company has also receivedmixed reviewsas a result of technical glitches, sudden downgrades and delays. But, overall, many passengers have enjoyed the mishmash of old carriages and no-frills nostalgia offered by the firm, while embracing the idea of the journey itself being as important as the destination.According to Engelsman, German-rented coaches for the new route were made in the 1990s. “They are quite similar to the comfort level on the Nightjet at the moment. Our sleeper coaches on the Prague service are relatively old – from as far back as 1956 – but we will not use them on this route. They will be newer.”And the key question: will there be a dining car? “Not from the start,” Engelsman said. “We would love to have a dining car but, in terms of profitability, it is a challenge and we would need that specific type of coach. It’s difficult to break even on sales of meals and drinks. The rental costs of the coach and staff costs are very high.”Prices for the European Sleeper fromParisto Berlin will start from €59 or €69 for a couchette compartment.

Use it to give your focaccia a perfect flavourful crustTom HuntWed 12 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 08.48 ESTShareWhenI taste-tested olives for the food filter columna few months ago, it reminded me that the brine is an ingredient in its own right. This intensely savoury liquid adds umami depth to whatever it touches, and, beyond seasoning soups and stews, it can also be used to makesalamoia, the aromatic brine that’s traditionally used to top focaccia and create that perfect salty crust.Olive brine focacciaPouring olive brine down the sink is like washing pure flavour down the drain. Instead, save it to supercharge your focaccia, creating a beautifully flavoured, salted crust that elevates an ordinary loaf into something extraordinary. While I’m partial to rosemary and olives as toppings, this focaccia delivers heaps of flavour even when kept completely plain and simple.Taking inspiration from bothGiorgio Locatelliand Solmaz Saberi, who makesan incredible tomato soup focaccia on Substack, I’ve come up with this recipe with a simplified method and a high-hydration dough (around 80-85%) that creates a light and fluffy focaccia even with the addition of a little wholemeal flour.While I adore the occasional treat of fluffy white bread, as a wholefood recipe writer I’m always exploring where wholemeal flour can be included to add nutrition and depth of flavour. A ratio of about 15-20% wholemeal flour mixed with majority white flour works beautifully here.For the salamoia30ml olive brine, at room temperature (or water mixed with a tablespoon of sea salt)30ml extra-virgin olive oilFlaky salt, to finish (optional)For the dough500g flour(eg, all-purpose, strong white flour; if you like, substitute 15-20% of it with wholemeal flour)5g dried yeast1 tbsp sugar, or honey5g fine sea salt2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilOptional toppingsRosemary leavesPitted olivesPut the olive brine and extra-virgin olive oil in a small bowl and whisk until emulsified.Mix the flour with the yeast, then add 425ml warm water (if you have any leftover brine in need of using up, use that instead of some of the warm water). Stir in the sugar, sea salt and extra-virgin olive oil. Knead until evenly mixed, then cover with a damp cloth and leave to prove for 20 minutes.Fold the dough into a neat round by pulling up each corner and folding it over into the centre, so tensioning the surface of the dough, then tip fold side down on to a well-oiled 23cm baking tray. Rub the surface with a little olive oil, then press out the dough with your fingertips, so it fills the tray. Cover again with a damp cloth and leave for about an hour, until doubled in size.Scatter the optional rosemary leaves and pitted olives to taste over the top, then use oiled fingertips to press dimples all over the top of the dough. Evenly drizzle over the salamoia, leave for 20 minutes while the oven heats up to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then bake for 30 minutes, until golden brown.This article was edited on 12 November 2025 to clarify when the yeast should be added to the flour mix.Explore more on these topicsBreadWaste notFoodFood wasterecipesShareReuse this content"

We’ve all had cauliflower cooked to mush, but the cauli just needs to be treated with the respect it deserves. Here, we blanch, marinate, roast and then grill it until it gets a dark, charred top, while the Mexican salsa macha provides a smoky, chilli heat. Then, arguably, our most popular dish, which might convert even mushroom haters. There is nothing not to like: great texture, full of umami, sticky, sweet, and often compared to meat.Cauliflower with peanut tahini and salsa macha (pictured top)Prep10 minCook1 hr 15 minServes4For the marinade2½ tsp cumin seeds1½ tsp coriander seeds1 large dried black lime2⅓ tbsp rapeseedoil1 tbsp red-wine vinegar1⅓ tbsp agave nectar1 tsp flaky sea saltFor the cauliflower1 large cauliflower(about 800g), trimmed, leaves discarded100mlroastcauliflower marinade(see above and method)1 tbsp lemon juice1 tbsp chopped fresh coriander, to serveA pinch of flaky sea saltFor the peanut tahini1½ tsp white miso paste20gsmooth peanut butter2⅓ tbsplime juice½ tsp tamari soy sauce70gtahini4 tsp maple syrupFor the salsa macha¼ tsp cumin seeds15gsesame seeds25gpumpkin seedsA pinch of ground allspice3⅔ tbsp olive oil25gsmoked harissaA pinch of flaky sea saltToast the cumin and coriander seeds for the marinade in a dry pan until fragrant, then finely grind. Add the black lime, finely grind again, then transfer to a bowl, add the remaining marinade ingredients and whisk to blend and combine.Heat the oven to 250C(230C fan)480F/gas 10 or as high as it will go. Fill a large bowl with iced water and line a roasting tray with baking paper. Bring a medium pan of salted water to a boil, cook the cauliflower for eight minutes, then scoop it out and refresh in the iced water. Drain thoroughly, then transfer to the lined tray.Coat the cauliflower with the marinade (give it a good stir first), then roast for 20-30 minutes, until golden and caramelised.Meanwhile, put the miso, peanut butter, lime juice and tamari in a bowl and use an electric hand whisk to combine, until smooth and emulsified. Add the tahini and maple syrup, whisk until smooth, then add three tablespoons plus two teaspoons of cold water and whisk again until fully incorporated. Season to taste with salt.For the salsa macha, keeping each type of seed separate, toast the cumin, sesame and pumpkin seeds one after another in a dry pan until golden and fragrant. Grind each separately, then put in a bowl with the remaining salsa ingredients and whisk until well combined.To finish, heat the grill. Once hot, grill the roast cauliflower for a few minutes until lightly charred. Smooth the peanut tahini on a platter, then top with the cauliflower. Drizzle over the salsa macha and lemon juice, garnish with the coriander and a sprinkle of flaky sea salt, and serve.Oyster mushroom skewersView image in fullscreenMarc Summers’ oyster mushroom skewers.You will need six 15cm metal or wooden skewers (if using wooden ones, soak them in water for 30 minutes first, to prevent burning). Cooking on a barbecue will give the best results, but these can also be cooked indoors under a hot grill.Prep5 minMarinateOvernightCook20 minServes62garlic cloves, peeled135mltamarisauce2⅓ tbsp agave nectar4 tsp coriander seeds120mlrapeseedoil600goyster mushroomsPut the garlic and a tablespoon of the tamari in a blender or mini food processor and blend to a smooth paste. Add the agave nectar, coriander seeds and remaining tamari, and blend again. Once thoroughly combined, slowly add the oil, blending between additions, to make a smooth, emulsified sauce.Break or tear the mushrooms into 5cm pieces. Put the mushroom pieces in a lipped baking tray and brush with two-thirds of the marinade. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge overnight.The next day, thread 100g of the marinated mushrooms on to each of the six skewers. Cooking on a barbecue will give the best results, but these can also be cooked indoors under a hot grill. Strain off the excess oil from the marinade left in the tray, then pour the remaining marinade into a small saucepan set over a low heat and reduce until it turns thick.Slowly cook the skewers under a hot grill or on a hot barbecue, turning regularly, until they are nicely caramelised. Drizzle the cooked skewers with the reduced marinade and serve.These recipes are edited extracts from Bubala: Middle Eastern-Inspired Vegetarian Recipes to Share, by Marc Summers, published by Quadrille at £28.

        "Content": "The traditional treat is all over Instagram and TikTok. But does it always taste as impressive as it looks? And why is it so hard to get it to set rather than slump? Time for a deep dive …ByTim DowlingWed 12 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 12 Nov 2025 11.15 ESTShareJelly has a dowdy reputation, but it may well be the perfect food for the Instagram age: when it works, it’s incredibly photogenic, so who cares what it tastes like?There can be no other explanation for recent claims that savoury jellies – the most lurid and off-putting of dishes, reminiscent of the worst culinary efforts of the 1950s – are suddenly fashionable. This resurgence comes,according to the New York Times, “at a time when chefs are feeling pressure to produce viral visuals and molecular gastronomy is old hat”.The notion that jelly is having a moment is actually a perennial threat: this time last year it was reported that supermarket jelly cube sales were rising sharply, while vintagejelly moulds were experiencing a five-fold increase in online sales. And it was 15 years ago that the high-end “jellymongers”Bompas & Parr– known for their elaborate architectural creations – first published their book on the subject.People who are sceptical about jelly are often put off by its origins. There’s no getting round it: gelatine is a pork byproduct, extracted from the bones, skin and connective tissue of the animal. But these days there are widely available vegan-friendly setting agents – mostly carrageenan and agar, derived from algae – that work just as well.You can look at colourful, detailed, wobbling jelly creations all day long on Instagram or TikTok, but if you want to experience the jelly renaissance first-hand – savoury or otherwise – you’ve got to make your own. How hard could it possibly be? I decided to find out.First off, a warning: there is really no such thing as a jelly recipe. You will find instructions everywhere, of course, but they will be of little help in your specific circumstances – the variables are simply too great. Moulds come in all sorts of weird sizes. Suggested setting times, in my brief experience, mean nothing: it’s set when it’s set.Better to rely on some solid practicalities: fill your jelly mould to the brim with water, and then pour the water into a measuring jug – that’s the total amount of liquid you’re after. To calculate how much gelatine you’ll need, bear in mind that one leaf sets 100ml of liquid.Confusingly, gelatine leaves come in four grades – bronze, silver, gold and platinum – all with different setting strengths, but you don’t have to worry about that because a) the size of the leaves is adjusted, so they all have the same per-leaf strength and b) you’ll probably only be able to find platinum in the supermarket anyway. But be prepared to adjust the exact proportions according to your needs – every jelly is a compromise between structural integrity and an agreeable wobble. If you just want it to stand up for a photo you can double the amount of gelatine, but the result will have the consistency of an eraser.Soften the leaves first in cold water – five minutes should do it – and then add them to your liquid, making sure that liquid is hotter than 35C but nowhere near boiling. Once the gelatine is fully dissolved, you can pour the liquid into your mould and leave it in the fridge to set. That’s the basic technique – everything else is guesswork, practice and panic.Grapefruit jellyView image in fullscreen‘An ill-defined blob’ … Tim’s grapefruit jelly.Photograph: Tim DowlingI chose something simple to start with:Nigel Slater’s grapefruit jelly. I simplified his instructions further by replacing the words “halve and squeeze the grapefruits” with “buy some grapefruit juice”. The recipe calls for “six small sheets” of gelatine, which is confounding. They don’t come in sizes! So I fell back on 1 leaf/100ml – plus an extra half-leaf, because the Slater version isn’t for moulding. He just pours his into dessert glasses.All went well until I tried to release the jelly from the vintage glass mould I bought from eBay. I dipped the mould into warm water for a few seconds – as most recipes direct – but it wasn’t enough. In my impatience, I boiled a kettle, filled a bowl, and lowered the mould into it. Only then did I realise it was too hot to retrieve, and by the time I came up with a strategy – ladling away enough water until I could grab the mould with my fingers – the outermost centimetre of the jelly had melted, leaving me with an ill-defined blob. The jelly itself was lovely though: not too sweet, with a bitter grapefruit note.I learned a valuable lesson with this one. Onward.Summer fruit in raspberry jellyView image in fullscreen‘It emerged in perfect condition.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianYou canmake your raspberry jelly from raspberries and sugar, or you can, as I did,just use diluted cordial.The ring mould I chose for this was enormous. After measuring the total liquid capacity I calculated I would need 19 gelatine sheets – I had to run out and buy more.The idea is that you fill the mould about three-quarters of the way to the top and let it partially set before pushing the fruits – blueberries, quartered strawberries, raspberries, whatever you’ve got – deep into the jelly. Even after several hours in the fridge, the jelly was insufficiently solid – the fruit kept floating back to the top. Perhaps 19 leaves was a miscalculation. Maybe I should have used 20.Finally, about six hours in, the first strawberry stayed put. The fruit left an unsightly trail where I jammed it in with my finger, but I persisted until the whole mould was full of suspended fruit. Then I topped it up with more jelly, and left it to set properly. This took days.In the end I turned my fridge temperature down until ice formed on the back wall. When the time came to turn out the jelly I was not hopeful, but it emerged in perfect condition – the fine detail of the mould was retained and the trails the fruit left had disappeared.Then, slowly, the whole thing collapsed before my eyes, like a citadel in an earthquake. I put the wreckage in a bowl and ate it with a spoon – delicious.Chicken jellyView image in fullscreen‘Bland and offensive’ … chicken jelly.Photograph: Tim DowlingThe first recorded jellies were savoury. In the 14th century, it took a lot of time, effort and skill to boil animals down to a transparent jelly, but the result would still have tasted too meaty to make a proper dessert. It took the development of industrial extraction processes to produce a clear gelatine with no taste at all.More often than not, a savoury jelly consists of some meat or veg suspended in a gelled consommé or stock. My jellied chicken salad is a blend of several similar recipes I found online, because I was only ever going to do this once.You can clarify stock by whisking in egg whites and then straining them, but my broth was pretty transparent after a pass through a sieve lined with muslin, so I didn’t bother.The “salad” in this case was an arrangement of diced chicken breast, celery, parsley and halved tomatoes – nothing fancy. It set quickly, de-moulded easily and looked weirdly impressive – like leftovers encased in a glass paperweight – but a full 12 hours elapsed before I could summon the will to cut into it with a spoon.We often use the word “bland” as a synonym for inoffensive, but it turns out some things can be both bland and offensive. Cold chicken stock-flavoured jelly is one of those things. I might have got used to it after several more spoonfuls, but I couldn’t bring myself to try.Blancmange rabbitView image in fullscreen‘I’m pretty certain a small child would have eaten it without complaint’ … the blancmange rabbit.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDon’t worry, there’s no rabbit in this one – it just employs a plastic rabbit-shaped mould I bought online. I figured: rabbits are white; why not blancmange?I’ve never eaten blancmange, or even really known what it was, but I think that what I imagined it to be was probably nicer than jelly made with milk. You’re never too old to be disillusioned.Therecipe I consulteduses cornflour to aid in thickening, along with sugar and lemon peel, but I also borrowed a tip from Bompas & Parr’s book: it takes a long time to dissolve gelatine in milk; it’s easier to dissolve it in a bit of hot water first, and add the liquid to the milk.I will not share with you all the frustration of trying to release a well-set blancmange from a rabbit-shaped mould – the ears, in particular, really didn’t want to let go – while a photographer looks on. We got there in the end, with a big bowl of hot water and a lot of patience. The best I can say about my rabbit is that I’m pretty certain a small child would have eaten it without complaint. I didn’t have one to hand, and none of the adults in my house would go anywhere near it.Striped jellyStriped jellyVariegated jellies are a step up in terms of complication, but all you need is two or more jellies of different colours. I chose cranberry and blancmange, more for the visual contrast than the flavour combination, which I’ll admit in retrospect was jarring and not that pleasant.Once you’ve prepared your jellies, the strategy is obvious: add layers of alternating colours to the mould, letting them set in between, firmly enough to stay separated, but not so much that the new layer won’t adhere to the one below.I can’t stress this enough: ignore whatever any recipe tells you in terms of timing, judge the setting by eye, and be prepared to stay up all night. Your room temperature jelly mixture may coagulate while you’re waiting to add more, but a little gentle heat will liquify it again.I would describe my striped tower as a qualified success – intact but a little lopsided. The main problem was that, instead of a jelly mould, I used an enamelled vase from Ikea. The cylindrical base created an airlock during de-moulding, which in turn created a lot of pent-up anger in me, and I got a bit violent with it. I’m not proud of myself.The G&T jellyView image in fullscreen‘This turned out beautifully.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianI took this recipe fromthe Adventures in Jelly website. It sounded sophisticated, looked easy enough and would allegedly give off an eerie glow under UV light. The ingredients, apart from the gelatine and sugar, are the same as the drink: gin, tonic, lemon.For this one, I decided to use the only jelly mould I already owned, which is old, ceramic and full of hairline cracks I thought might cause difficulty. I’m not even sure where it came from; I’ve certainly never made jelly in it.Much to my surprise, this turned out beautifully, with just the right amount of wobble. And it really did taste like a solidified gin and tonic. I took it along to a dinner party (my advice for transporting jellies over distances is: do not) and everyone took pictures of it. Then they ate the entire thing.Honestly, I was still getting texts about it the next day.Explore more on these topicsFoodDessertfeaturesShareReuse this content"
