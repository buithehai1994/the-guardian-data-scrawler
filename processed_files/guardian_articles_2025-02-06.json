They said they believed some MPs who supported the principle would find a reason why the bill in its current form would not work.“That would be a real shame,” they said. “There is a danger of some people allowing the perfect to be the enemy of the good, and there will never be a perfect bill.”More than 200 amendments have been tabled to the bill, whichpassed with a majority of 55 in November, and potentially hundreds more are expected over the coming weeks. Several committee members said there were real fears they would not have enough time to engage properly with all the amendments.Leadbeater tabled a number ofgovernment-drafted amendmentsthis week, a sign that the government is taking a muscular approach to closing potential holes in the bill while ostensibly remaining neutral on the issue.Two key areas of dispute on the committee are the role of the high court in the process of requesting an assisted death, and whether the bill’s scope should be extended beyond just those adults who have a terminal illness and less than six months to live.A number of committee members, including the most high-profile Conservative backer, Kit Malthouse, believe the bill should be altered to remove the signoff from a high court judge and replace it with an expert panel. This could include a specialist lawyer, a social worker and a psychiatrist with expertise in mental capacity and coercion.One committee member said they believed there were considerable concerns in government about the high court judge requirement.A former supreme court judge has told MPs that applications for assisted dying should not need high court approval. Lord Sumption said the requirement “infers a protection that is largely illusory and undoubtedly very time-consuming”.Leadbeater has said she will not allow any removal of the “judicial element” of scrutiny, a phrase that some opponents believe means she is open to some changes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Leadbeater has previously ruled out such a change.Gordon said: “For those with neurodegenerative conditions, in their last six months, it may be too late for them to engage in the bureaucracy of applying.”Rachel Hopkins, a Labour MP on the committee, said she would back the change. “I can see why this amendment is needed. Our assisted dying law should be a compassionate one, and where that means people with different terminal conditions need a different approach, I support that.”Leadbeater has been under significant pressure over the makeup of the committee and the way it has taken evidence.On Thursday, the shadow Commons leader, Jesse Norman, criticised the procedure in the house, saying it “left a host of important questions entirely untouched”, and he accused the government of “quietly and wrongly standing behind this private member’s bill”.He said: “The membership is disproportionately weighted towards supporters of the bill. The schedule has been highly congested with back-to-back sittings that do not allow MPs to prepare … all these things are shocking attempts to undermine and short-circuit the proper scrutiny of the legislation.”Lucy Powell, the Commons leader, said it was “extremely regrettable and unadvised of the shadow leader to use his very privileged position at the dispatch box today to give such a political, one-sided and misleading account”.Powell said the committee was weighted to reflect the balance of support among MPs and said Leadbeater had taken the unprecedented step for a private member’s bill of hearing evidence from experts in public.She said the government had “a responsibility to ensure that any bill that is passed by this house is workable and operable”.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingLabourHealth policynewsShareReuse this content"

It now expects the economy to grow by just 0.75% this year, compared with a previous forecast of 1.5% made in November, in a fresh blow for Reeves as she battles to revive confidence.A week after the chancellor gavea major speech to restate the government’s commitment to growth, the Bank said it was cutting its forecasts to reflect fragile business and consumer sentiment and near stagnant activity after the October budget.Business leaders have blamed the sharp fall in confidence on Reeves’s decision to increase employer national insurance contributions by £25bn from April, while concerns are also rising over the global outlook as Donald Trump launches a tariff war on the US’s allies and enemies alike.Some analysts suggested the Bank’s forecasts showed the UK sliding towards “stagflation” – a toxic combination of weak growth and high inflation which is hard for policymakers to manage.Jonathan Haskel, a former Bank rate-setter, said stagflation was the right word to describe the “difficult position” Britain faced, telling the BBC: “I’m afraid it’s not very pretty, OK.”Susannah Streeter, the head of money and markets at Hargreaves Landsdown, said: “The risks of stagflation are stark.Inflationremains above the Bank’s 2% target and price pressures are piling up, but the economy is stagnating, and business confidence has taken a knock.”Keir Starmer said the reduction in borrowing costs, which should help to bring down mortgage rates, would put more money in people’s pockets. But pressed on the growth outlook, the prime minister said: “Look we’ve got more to do, we were never going to turn this around in six or seven months, so that just spurs us on.”The Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority of seven to two for an immediate cut in borrowing costs from 4.75% to 4.5%. The decision led City traders to bet that Britain’s sluggish economic prospects would force the Bank into a deeper round of rate cuts later this year.Two of the MPC’s nine members backed a more drastic half-point cut in the face of the deteriorating growth outlook.Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, said the weakness in the economy meant the central bank would take a “gradual and careful approach to reducing rates further”, as it prepared to prioritise protecting the economy despite the short-term rise in inflationary pressures.“There will be a bump in the road [from inflation] but we don’t think that bump is going to have a lasting effect,” he said.Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said further rate cuts were required to support households and businesses. “This rate cut is badly needed to help lift the economy out of stagnation. The Bank must now keep moving with further cuts,” he said.The Bank expects inflation to rise from 2.5% now to 3.7% by the summer, well above its 2% target, as household energy prices rise, as well as water bills and bus fares.The Bank’s gloomy assessment is likely to be echoed by a similar downgrade from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) when it publishes updated forecasts on 26 March.Last month Reeves came under scrutiny amid a rise in government borrowing costs, fuelled by higher-for-longer rate expectations in Britain and the US. This led to warnings that she could be forced to increase taxes or cut spending to avoid breakingher fiscal rules.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “No investment equals no growth. So what are we waiting for? There are plenty of projects crying out for public investment that will drive growth and create good jobs.”Reeves’s plan for economic growth is focused on clearing the way for private sector investment in infrastructure, includinga third runway at Heathrow.The Bank welcomed the chancellor’s policies, but said it had not upgraded its forecasts accordingly, as such changes take years to bear fruit. “Addressing those questions is critical, so we very strongly agree with the chancellor on this point,” Bailey said.He also suggested Labour’s commitment to changes and “showing real signs they are going to happen” could help to reboot animal spirits among business, in a benefit for the economy in the shorter term.The Bank said it was monitoring Donald Trump’s on-off tariff policies closely, though it had not included their impact in the current forecast.Bailey warned that Britain would not be immune to a global trade war. “Greater global protectionism would be likely to have a negative impact on world economic activity in the medium term, and lead to increased trade fragmentation,” he said.The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said of the reduction in interest rates: “This will be welcome news for many families and businesses who have been hit hard by Labour’s mismanagement.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)Rachel ReevesBank of EnglandEconomic policyInterest ratesInflationAndrew BaileynewsShareReuse this content"

Every time the manager had seen “light at the end of the tunnel”, he said, it had “usually been an oncoming train”.He was talking about the club’s injury situation, the crisis that never seemingly ends, and yet the line about the train was an appropriate way to describe Liverpool, who did not so much roll into theCarabao Cupfinal, their first such showpiece under Arne Slot, as steamroll their way there. They refused to countenance any other outcome. They utterly flattened Spurs.‘We’re getting stronger’: Slot’s ominous message after Liverpool crush SpursRead moreWho can stopLiverpoolthis season? It is the question on everybody’s lips as they look down from the summit of the Premier League and eye glory in the Champions League and FA Cup, too. Nobody believed Spurs would do so here, probably not the diehards who made the trip north and possibly not even the players themselves – certainly not once the reality of what they were facing dawned on them.It was over, really, when Mohamed Salah scored from the penalty spot early in the second half to give them the aggregate lead – his 26th goal of the season. At that point, Spurs were just about still in it but by now absolutely nobody believed they were. The evidence had been mapped out in graphic detail across the Anfield turf where Liverpool were quicker, sharper, hungrier. Simply remorseless.Spurs could point to a single flicker in front of goal, the moment on 78 minutes when Son Heung-min pulled off a step-over and blasted against the bar from a tight angle. They had just five shots in total; the rest were eminently forgettable. None was on target.View image in fullscreenCody Gakpo (right) opens the scoring for Liverpool from close range in the first half.Photograph: Nick Potts/PABy then it was 3-0, Dominik Szoboszlai having added further to Cody Gakpo’s first-half opener, and there would still be time for the imperious Virgil van Dijk to add the fourth. It will beup to Newcastleto deny Liverpool in the final. Slot’s team will start as the heavy favourites.There were the inevitable “Sacked in the morning” chants for Postecoglou from the Liverpool supporters; they have tracked him for weeks and, well, he is still here.Next up for Postecoglou is Sunday’s FA Cup tie at Aston Villa. What had to hurt him was how little of the adventure and personality he demands were on show. Spurs went with a whimper. And, of course, another injury, Richarlison forced off at the end of the first half to join the 10 players who did not make the trip because of various problems.It was easy to feel that Liverpool wanted to right a couple of recent wrongs against Spurs from matches in London. There was theLuis Díaz disallowed goal farragobut more pertinently, perhaps,the first leg of this tie, when the midfielder Lucas Bergvall ought to have been sent off rather than allowed to stay on to score the only goal. They did not allow Spurs to play and how they came to do so themselves.Liverpool turned up the heat as the first half wore on. They dominated possession and their press became an increasing problem for Tottenham. Slot’s team camped in opposition territory and the breakthrough had been advertised, Szoboszlai seeing a goal ruled out for offside from a Salah pass.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is what Slot’s Liverpool do to you. The ball was worked wide to Salah and when he crossed with the outside of his boot and Darwin Núñez brought a dose of chaos in the centre, it ran for Gakpo. His feet were planted but he was able to summon the power. Should Antonin Kinsky have done more to keep out the shot? Possibly. The goalkeeper was erratic.Kinsky just about tipped a Salah volley on to the top of the bar in the 44th minute and that was when Richarlison was down at the other end with a calf problem, Liverpool playing on. Richarlison had clashed at the outset with Van Dijk, accusing him of throwing an elbow in his direction. It is fair to say that sympathy from the Kop was in short supply for the former Everton player. Postecoglou introduced Mathys Tel, his new outfield signing, having started his other one, the centre-half Kevin Danso. For both, it was a grisly welcome to the club.Liverpool make winning look easy as Slot’s machine rolls on to Wembley | Andy HunterRead moreKinsky was in the spotlight at the start of the second half. Liverpool brought still more intensity and the goalkeeper did well to repel a Szoboszlai header from a corner. And yet moments later, when Salah played a teasing ball into the area for Núñez, it was possible to foresee the disaster. Núñez was always going to be too quick, Kinsky was never going to pull out of the attempt to claim the ball. All he touched was Núñez. Salah picked out a top corner from the spot.Liverpool were in no mood to preserve what they had. Gakpo and Ryan Gravenberch both hit the woodwork before Conor Bradley played in Szoboszlai with a lovely first-time pass. The finish was never in doubt. Nor was that from Van Dijk when he rose to meet a corner. Liverpool march on.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupLiverpoolTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The cap previously limited payouts to two times a banker’s salary.HSBC to open London ‘wealth centre’ in effort to draw in premier clientsRead moreThe proposals, first reported by Sky News, would take Elhedery’s total potential pay package up from around £10.5m to more than £15m.Elhedery, who is French, previously served as the bank’s chief financial officer and took the reins from predecessor Noel Quinn in September 2024.He wasted no time making his mark on the bank, announcinga major restructuring planin October that would split the bank’s operations geographically between east and west and result in a swathe of job losses.It emerged in recent weeks that the overhaul will also include shutting parts of HSBC’s investment banking operations – involved in mergers and acquisitions and equity fundraising for listed companies – in the UK, the US and Europe.The London-headquartered bank, which makes the bulk of its profit in Asia, is due to give further details when it publishes full-year earnings on 19 February.The potential pay changes follow similar moves by Barclays, which is also looking to take advantage of the bonus cap removal andoffer a lower salary and bigger bonus package for its chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan.

Katrin Ivanova (centre), Dzhambazov’s partner, is also accused.Composite: BBC newsFellow Bulgarians Gaberova, her ex-boyfriend Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, of Acton, west London, and Ivanova, from Harrow, have denied involvement.The court has heard how Gaberova was charmed by Dzhambazov in Valencia and left her boyfriend Ivanchev, unaware the older Dzhambazov was still with his partner, Ivanova.Jurors viewed extracts of the former competitive swimmer Ivanchev’s police interviews, in which Morgan suggested he had attempted to throw Gaberova “under a bus” to save himself.He blamed Gaberova for getting him involved, accused her of “manipulating” him and claimed she was used as a “shield” by Dzhambazov, jurors heard.Morgan said Ivanchev’s account was “nonsense”, asking: “Do you know the expression ‘throwing someone under the bus’?“He is trying to put you in it to save himself, isn’t he? Give the police officers a bit of information here and there to make it seem like he is the reasonable one answering all the questions, meanwhile pretending that somehow or other he was manipulated into doing all this by you. And it’s not true, is it?”Gaberova replied: “Some of this was because Biser has told me that he is sick.”The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Train details will be deleted from departure boards three minutes before they leave.Network Rail said the scheme was designed to stop passengers dashing for trains. A poster for the scheme said: “This is so everyone can board safely and keep trains running on time.”But passengers have reacted with fury, saying they should be given the information to decide for themselves.Many also fear the system will cause more rushing than it prevents. They pointed out that trains’ platform departures are often only revealed minutes before they are due to depart, so the new system could only give them seconds to react to platform announcements.Aphotograph of the posterfor the new system was shared online by an X user called Jonathan. He wrote: “This is so patronising, good grief. ‘We would prefer you missed your train than that you rushed to catch it’.” He added: “Who do you think is best placed to decide whether it’s worth the risk and exertion to catch my train? You??!?”Alexandra Wilson, an academic and writer asked: “But how soon before departure do they actually announce the platform? It’s often incredibly late, prompting a stampede.”Tony West, who commutes between London and Didcot,posted: “Doesn’t this just mean everybody will run because they won’t know exactly when the train will leave[?]”Jeremy Leggett, a rural policy adviser from Brighton, tweeted: “Not sensible to remove information from displays three minutes ahead of departures, especially when connecting trains are the norm, eg Brighton east- west. Bad policy as well as patronising. @SouthernRailUK.”MJ Simpson pointed to aflaw in the plans. He wrote: “So if you’re booked on the 5.25 and you get to the station at 5.23, there will be no sign of the 5.25 on the departure board, even though it hasn’t left yet. Have I got that right?”Speaking to the Times, which first reported the scheme, Simon Watson, a York commuter, said: “The trains are every 30 minutes and when I am heading home, which one I’m on can make the difference between being home for the children’s bedtime or not. Whether I run for the train is my decision.”He said it would force passengers to use their phones for information about departures. “Surely it’s better to rush looking at the departure boards than your phone,” he said.Last year chaotic scenes and persistent overcrowding at nearby Euston station prompted Network Rail toallow passengers to board some services early. It now allows passengers to board about 40% of Avanti West Coast services from the station 20 minutes before departure. The move came after London TravelWatch said passengers were being put in danger by high levels of overcrowding.Despite the improvements, passengers saidEuston is still a “nightmare”.Explore more on these topicsRail industryRail transportTransport policyTransportLondonNetwork RailRail travelnewsShareReuse this content"

Or, phrased another way, it had an almost 99% probability of passing by without incident.At up to 300ft (90 metres) in width, according to Nasa-funded skywatchers who spotted it from a telescope in Chile just before new year, the object is roughly the same size as the Tunguska asteroid thatflattened about 830 square miles(2,150 sq km) of remote Siberian forest when it exploded in 1908.Asteroid triggers global defence plan amid chance of collision with Earth in 2032Read moreAstronomers, however, are urging Earth dwellers not to panic, even though 2024 YR4 has rocketed to the top of official impact risk lists on both sides of the Atlantic, and has the rare rating of three on theTorino Impact Hazard Scalethat ranges from a no-risk zero to a civilization-ending 10.Fluctuations in the chances of a strike so far out from an object’s arrival are common, and ina YouTube videoentitled “How asteroids go from threat to no sweat”, Esa explains that the likelihood of 2024 YR4 ever striking the planet will drop to virtually zero once updated data on speed and trajectory is received in the coming weeks and months.The planetary defense coordination office of Nasa, the US space agency, agrees.“There have been several objects in the past that have risen on the risk list and eventually dropped off as more data have come in,” researcher Molly Wasser saidin a statement.“New observations may result in reassignment of this asteroid to zero as more data come in.”Colin Snodgrass, professor of planetary astronomy at the University of Edinburgh, told the Guardian last week: “Most likely this one will pass by harmlessly.“It just deserves a little more attention with telescopes until we can confirm that. The longer we follow its orbit, the more accurate our future predictions of its trajectory become.”Other recent similar scares would appear to reinforce the message.The asteroid99942 Apophis, discovered in 2004 and larger than the Eiffel Tower, was once given a rating of four on the Torino scale, but was eventually calculated to be no threat to Earth on any of its close passes for at least the next 100 years.Yet even if 2024 YR4 continues on towards Earth with a high chance of impact, the success of Nasa’s Dart mission in 2022, in which a spacecraft was deliberately crashed into an asteroid the size of a football stadium andaltered its trajectory, gives grounds for optimism for the future of humanity.“This asteroid is of the scale that a mission like Dart could be effective, if required, so we have the technology and it has been tested,” Snodgrass said.Explore more on these topicsAsteroidsSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

Heston Blumenthal brings his to the boil from cold. Now scientists have weighed in on the perfect way to boil an egg, and the results are egg-stremely tasty.From a materials perspective, cooking an egg within its shell is more complicated than it might at first seem. Chefs are challenged by the fact that an egg’s components: yolk and white, are made of different proteins that denature and thicken at different temperatures: 85C (185F) for the white and 65C (149F) for the yolk.Also problematic, is that the yolk cannot be heated separately from the white, unless they are literally separated and cooked in different vessels. Because of this, the white and outer sphere of yolk are often overcooked, while the centre might be underdone.In 2002, the French molecular gastronomist Hervé This proposed analternative solution: cooking the egg in a water bath at 65C for at least an hour. This “sous vide” method imbues the yolk with what he claims is an unparalleled flavour and texture. However, it also means the white does not fully set.The new approach, known as “periodic cooking”, was inspired by a technique previously developed to create layers within plastic objects. “It enables us to have one material, in one piece, but with different structures and therefore different properties,” says Ernesto Di Maio, a materials scientist at the University of Naples Federico II, whose lab invented it.View image in fullscreenAlternating an egg between pans of water kept at different temperatures every two minutes, for 32 minutes, is no mean feat.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianIt was a friend who suggested he try applying it to food. “After all, our famous, superstar chef in Italy, Carlo Cracco, sells eggs for €80 each,” Di Maio says.His PhD student Emilia Di Lorenzo mathematically modelled the transfer of energy through the different layers of an egg, plus their cooking dynamics, to come up with a basic method. She then refined it using computational fluid dynamics software.The technique involves alternating an egg between a pan of boiling water kept at 100C and a bowl kept at 30C every two minutes, for 32 minutes (eight cycles in total).By interrupting the transfer of heat from shell to centre, the yolk’s temperature never rises above 65C. “It only reaches a gel-like state,” says Di Lorenzo. The research was published inCommunications Engineering.View image in fullscreenCompared with a control egg cooked the Delia Smith way, the periodic yolk was creamier with a greater depth of flavour.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianTrying to replicate this in my own kitchen was no yoke.I borrowed an aquarium heater from my son’s fish tank to set up the 30C water bath, but each time I reintroduced the hot eggs, the temperature rose. This meant I needed to reset the stopwatch, quickly add some additional cold water, and keep a record of how many transfers I’d done – all before the next two minute timer went off – and then transfer the eggs back to the pan, without dropping any.As time ticked by, I grew increasingly sceptical – how on earth was the yolk going to remain soft, when my eggs had spent a total of 16 minutes in boiling water?But science won out. My first attempt was, in fact, too liquid, which Di Maio attributed to using too large an egg. “We based these calculations on a 68g egg. If your egg is much larger, you should increase the cooking time by about 20 seconds each cycle,” he suggested.On my second attempt, I cracked it: the white was gelatinous; the yolk a gel-like liquid. Compared with a control egg cooked the Delia way, the periodic yolk was creamier with a greater depth of flavour.Di Lorenzo has also used nuclear magnetic resonance and high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyse the nutritional composition of periodic eggs, against sous vide and soft-boiled ones. Doing so suggested that the periodically cooked yolks contained more polyphenols – micronutrients with purported health benefits.Di Maio says he now boils all his eggs this way, and his friends and family thank him for it: “Of course, it takes time. But I think it’s good to dedicate some time for the people you love.”I ask Di Lorenzo if she feels the same way. She pauses, and looks a little sheepish: “I don’t really like eggs,” she says.Explore more on these topicsScienceEggsFoodnewsShareReuse this content"

And, just as the reactions from the bereaved and survivors has been mixed, so too were the views of the local residents the Guardian met.Some thought it should remain as an angry reminder of systemic failure, of as yet undelivered justice and of harrowing grief. Others believed a more peaceful monument to the 72 dead and the many more severely traumatised would be beneficial.Grenfell Tower demolition would risk fire being forgotten, some survivors sayRead more“I am a little bit teary,” said one woman, a mother of two, of the news. “I am really quite shocked. I don’t understand why they would want it to be gone.”One of her friends survived the horror of 14 June 2017. “He didn’t want to see it any more. Some people don’t because it’s too traumatic.“But I do want it still to be here. I grew up here. I want it for remembrance. It’s not an eyesore. I see it every day. It’s a symbol of what happened.”On the night of the fire, the 31-year-old ran from her home to the 24-storey block after being alerted by a distressed friend whose sister lived in Grenfell and was failing to answer her phone. Thankfully, she was a survivor. “I saw her being carried out over a fireman’s shoulder,” she said.For her, the tower as it stands today “is 100% a symbol of justice that has still not been had”. Until that day comes, it should remain, she said. “Eventually it is going to be forgotten. But people are still grieving. It is way too soon.”Tracey, who has three adult children, was one of those who thought now was the time to demolish it. “I walk to my mum’s and I see it. I walk to church and I see it,” she said.View image in fullscreenSeveral residents spoke of the personal impact of seeing the tower every day.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian“I know people who died there and I still have nightmares. But I think it should be a resting place now, for those whose spirits and whose souls are still trapped there.“As it is, we can’t say goodbye to them because you see it, every single day. It is a reminder of what happened.”Her nephew was due to stay at a family friend’s in the tower that night, but instead went to his grandmother’s.“It re-traumatises us. Not that we will ever forget. But to give them a final, peaceful resting place. We could have a nice garden that people could go to instead,” she suggested.Maria, 71, agreed. “I open my window every day and I see it. Every single day I see the tower. And it reminds me of that day. We can’t move on. We relive it. It depresses me.”Dismantling the tower, she said, “is the right thing to do”.“Of course, we feel for all those who lost loved ones, and those who survived. But what happened has happened.”A commission looking into a future memorial on the site has said that if the tower came down, it should be “dismantled with care and respect”.View image in fullscreenA final design for the memorial is expected by spring 2026.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianA final design for the memorial is expected by spring 2026, and construction could begin that year. A shortlist of five potential design teams was announced last month, and a winning design team is due to be selected this summer.Moss, 37, a tech worker born and raised nearby, said: “My brother-in-law lost his aunt and his uncle.”Of the proposed demolition, he said: “I think it really depends on what they replace it with. And that needs to be decided by the families and loved ones of those who died. Make it a people’s decision.“I see it every day. It’s become a thing in its own right. It’s a beacon, definitely, for justice. Generally, I think there are mixed emotions about it. But we have to move on.”Elina, 41, the mother of a young baby, said the decision was a “heartbreaking” and difficult one.“This is a reminder,” she said. “Maybe it should come down a bit, not all of it, but keep some of the structure there. And I like the idea of turning it into a living garden.“I think to wipe it off the Earth completely is just too heartbreaking. It’s as if those people never existed. So, to completely wipe it off, that is too harsh.”Explore more on these topicsGrenfell Tower fireLondonEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That said, the role was controversial at the time – there was an online petitionurging a boycott. But it has only looked more tone-deaf over time.In 2022, Cumberbatch offered an almost-apology,telling Variety: “In this era, my role would never be performed by anybody other than a trans actor. But I remember at the time not thinking of it necessarily in that regard, and it being more about two dinosaurs, two heteronormative cliches not understanding this new diverse world. But it backfired a little bit.”Apparently, the role still plays on his mind, since this week he offered a further lament to Variety. “I’ve had to apologise for that quite a lot. It’s a difficult one to talk about,” he said. “I love that group of people and it was the chance to be part of something that the first time around was iconic … But it got complicated and it got misunderstood and I upset people. I respect that, so I probably wouldn’t do that again now.”Emma Stone: AlohaHer career has flourishedin the past decade, but in 2015 Emma Stone was staring down the barrel of a career-ender. The culprit was her role in Cameron Crowe’s Hawaii-set Aloha. In Aloha, Stone – a woman from Arizona with Swedish, German, English, Scottish and Irish ancestry – was cast as the air force pilot Allison Ng, a woman described as being of one-quarter Chinese and one-quarter Hawaiian descent.Even before the film was released, activist groups were calling out the film’swhitewashing of Asian culture, which prompted Stone to say that she had “learned on a macro level about the insane history of whitewashing in Hollywood and how prevalent the problem truly is. It’s ignited a conversation that’s very important … There’s a lot of conversation about how we want to see people represented on screen and what we need to change as a business to reflect culture in a clearer way and not in an idealised way.” When Sandra Oh made a crack about the film at the 2019 Golden Globes, noting thatCrazy Rich Asianswas “the first studio film with an Asian-American lead since … Aloha,” Stone yelled: “I’m sorry!” from the audience.Tim Roth: United PassionsView image in fullscreenFoul play … Tim Roth as Sepp Blatter in United Passions.Photograph: Screen Media Films/AllstarIt’s hard to think of a film quite as ill-conceived as 2014’s United Passions, a Fifa vanity project released shortly before Fifa was engulfed in ajaw-dropping corruption scandal. The film was a flop, failing to make back even $200,000 of its $32m budget.The man who played the now disgraced Fifa president Sepp Blatter had no qualms about apologising for his part in it. Talking to the German newspaper Die Welt in 2015, he said: “I apologise I didn’t question the director, I didn’t question the script. This is a role that will have my father turning in his grave.” He expanded in aReddit interview: “I hated doing it, it was the wrong film, but for the right reasons. I had two kids in college so I had to make a decision and it was probably poorly judged, but once you make that decision you have to follow through. It’s a hard road, being in something you don’t want to do, but I’m glad I did it for my family.” In other words, as he told Yahoo Movies, United Passions was“a crap movie that I did for money”.Mahershala Ali: Green BookAlmost everyone involved in 2018’s Green Book has apologised for something or other – its writer for tweeting that Muslims in Jersey City werecheering when the “towers went down”on 9/11; its director forflashing his penisat colleagues during meetings in the 90s – but none quite as hard as Mahershala Ali, who played the real life concert pianist Don Shirley.Despite Ali winning an Oscarfor the role, some viewers complained that Shirley’s agency had been removed to accommodate a “white saviour” narrative. None were more outraged than Shirley’s brother, who called the film“a symphony of lies”. Amid this, Ali rang Shirley’s family. “I got a call from Mahershala Ali, a very, very respectful phone call, from him personally. He called me and my Uncle Maurice in which he apologised profusely if there had been any offence,” said Shirley’s nephew, Edwin Shirley. “What he said was: ‘If I have offended you, I am so, so terribly sorry. I did the best I could with the material I had. I was not aware that there were close relatives with whom I could have consulted to add some nuance to the character.’”Paul Newman: The Silver ChalicePaul Newman’s screen career seemed to get off to a flying start in 1954, when his first feature performance, in Victor Saville’s The Silver Chalice, resulted in a Golden Globe nomination. Despite this, the film has not been well remembered, holdinga 13% rating on Rotten Tomatoesfor its lumbering script and inauthentic sets. However, it was Newman – who played the artist who made the chalice that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper – who had the worst to say of it.Calling the film “the worst movie produced during the 1950s”, Newman actively tried to scupper its legacy. When it played every night for a week on a Los Angeles TV station in the early 60s, Newman took out adverts in trade papers reading: “Paul Newman apologizes every night this week – Channel 9.” This only drew everyone’s attention to the film, which received unusually high ratings.Mark Wahlberg: The HappeningView image in fullscreenMark Wahlberg (with Zooey Deschanel), looking for an escape route.Photograph: 20 Century Fox/Sportsphoto/AllstarMark Wahlberg doesn’t readily gives himself over to apologies, probably because he is too busygetting up at 2.30am to exercise. But sometimes – just sometimes – he crosses the line so egregiously that it would be wrong if he didn’t acknowledge it. We are talking, of course, about his role in M Night Shyamalan’s 2008 film The Happening.A bad movie in the classic sense, in that you can’t tell whether the cast and crew are doing it on purpose or not, The Happening is a film about telepathic trees who drive humans to suicide. It is so stupid that it briefly made Wahlberg a laughing stock. Eventually, the din became so loud that Wahlberg felt forced to give the closest thing to an apology he has ever given. Behold: “It is what it is. Fucking trees, man. The plants. Fuck it. You can’t blame me for not wanting to try to play a science teacher. At least I wasn’t playing a cop or a crook.” One for the all-time apology archives, you’ll agree.Explore more on these topicsFilmBenedict CumberbatchFilm industryPaul NewmanMark WahlbergEmma StoneMahershala AlifeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s almost impossible to believe any of the bragging, soundbite-spewing chancers are even good at businessLouis StaplesThu 6 Feb 2025 10.17 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 10.19 ESTShareThe opening scenes ofThe Apprentice– Lord Alan Sugar’s search for a new business partner – have become a yearly tradition on British TV. We meet a squad of suited and bodycon business dress-clad candidates, who seem to be competing to say the most ridiculous thing. “I’m like a lion in the business world. Fierce, hungry and ready to devour my prey,” says Chisola Chitambala, a contestant on the latest series, which is airing weekly on BBC One. “The level of competitiveness I have isdisgusting! I am the human equivalent of a tank.Nothinggets in my way,” insists meal-prep entrepreneur Mia Collins. “I can sleep when I’m dead!” proclaims Amber-Rose Badrudin, while hair-transplant consultant Carlo Brancati boasts: “What others can earn in a month takes me one hour.” (This gives rise to the question: what are you doing here, then?)The first series of The Apprentice premiered 20 years ago this month on BBC Two. The days when it felt like a genuinely exciting format are long gone, however, because it is now one of the most predictable shows on TV. Ratings have stalled, it’s beingpanned by criticsand it has grown into a high-cringe spectacle – one that symbolises a wider slide in standards in reality TV and beyond.The central appeal of The Apprentice has always been twofold. First, its scratching of a society-wide itch to see “corporate types” – professionals who are arrogant enough to think they know it all – being cut down to size; and second, the “rags to riches” element, dating from the early days of reality TV, when shows like The X Factor and Big Brother gave people who had traditionally been shut out of opportunities a shot at becoming rich and famous.This was the first problem The Apprentice encountered: it became an easy vehicle for celebrity. Contestants such as Saira Khan – a fan favourite and runner-up from the first series – launched successful media careers. Long before she ended up a far-right media commentator,Katie Hopkinswas the pantomime villain of series three, where she became the first contestant to leave the competition voluntarily. (Did she ever want the job? Or just the airtime?) The standout contestants, such as Jessica Cunningham and Luisa Zissman, soon started appearing on other reality shows, with the Apprentice-to-Celebrity-Big-Brother pipeline turning into British reality TV’s unofficial graduate scheme.View image in fullscreenMinding his own business … Lord Alan Sugar.Photograph: N/A/BBC/FremantleMedia LtdJames Hill, who was one of the breakout stars of series 10, in 2014, appeared on CBB the following year, where he was crowned the winner. He tells me that he originally went on The Apprentice “to be taken more seriously” in business and didn’t expect the lucrative TV offers that came next. “I don’t think you can go on any TV show and think, ‘I’m going to be the next David Beckham,’” he says. “You just have to run with it and see what happens.”Still, it’s undeniable that the show has leaned into casting over-the-top TV personalities, many of whom clearly want to be famous. “When it first started,” Hill says, “it was a lot more serious and the personalities weren’t as vibrant. But I think TV has changed in general. Audiences have changed – they want more of the ‘reality’ aspect. That balance of fun and professionalism has shifted.”He might be right that audiences want more drama – after all, reality TV is a conflict-heavy medium. But the balance feels skewed. We still need to be able to believe in the premise of the show: that it’s a genuine search for business talent.‘Do you want a little experience of stalking?’: what happened when Bear Grylls offered to ‘hunt’ me in a jungleRead moreThe Apprentice has always contained a heavy dose of humiliation. The often-ridiculous tasks, which usually require interaction with the public or “industry leaders”, are designed to create as many toe-curling moments as possible. But casting on the more recent series has turned up the cringe-o-meter to such an extent that the show’s very premise feels ridiculous, too.In the early years, when the contestants reached the final five, they were put through a gruelling set of interviews with some of Lord Sugar’s most trusted business associates. During these interviews, great care was taken to scrutinise their CVs. Embellishments or lies, which inevitably surfaced, represented a major scandal. Now, though, when the contestants reach the interview stage, the difference is stark. The interviewers don’t need to dig for white lies, because many of them don’t seem to have the basic knowledge of how to run a business. The “gotcha” moments are someone forgetting to include the most basic elements, such as costs or profit, in their business plan. When confronted with the fact that they are clearly out of their depth, it feels like not only a waste of time for the participants, but a waste of the viewer’s time, too, when we’ve spent weeks watching them.Some of this is down to the format. Since 2011, candidates stopped competing for a job with Lord Sugar and began fighting it out for a £250,000 investment in a business idea and a 50-50 partnership with him. Often, viewers have been put in the frustrating position where a candidate with a strong record in the weekly tasks ends up pitching a concept that is flawed, or isn’t something Lord Sugar is interested in investing in. This first happened in 2011, when Helen Milligan had an exemplary task record, but her idea of an elite concierge service didn’t spark joy. Tom Pellereau – an inventor with a far worse record in the challenges – won the investment instead. The producers can take some of the blame here, too: over time, the tasks have become more complex, to the point where the contestants are given days (or mere hours) to come up with campaigns and pitches that would normally take a team of professionals much longer. It feels as though they’re being set up to fail.The Apprentice season 19 trailer – videoThe show’s normalisation of underqualified candidates feels representative of a slide in standards that goes far beyond TV. We live in a world of personal branding and image curation, where little more than confidence and a social media profile is needed to brand yourself as a business success. The darkness of this is easy to spot in outlandish scammer stories such as those of the“Tinder Swindler” Simon Levievorfake New York heiress Anna Delvey, but it has also seeped into our culture. And as a medium that rewards those who have “the gift of the gab” (translation: chancers), reality TV is a powerful vehicle for this type of branding. Just look at Donald Trump, who co-produced and hosted the original US version of the show, rebranding himself as a business success following a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and failures in the 1990s. He probably wouldn’t be president today without it.Some might argue that prioritising personality isn’t the end of the world – especially on a reality show. “I think you have to remember, it is TV. It is not real life and you have viewers at home who want entertainment,” Hill says, when I ask about the declining quality of candidates. “People have been selected for the process because they’ll make good TV. But then you have people who are there because they have great business plans, so it’s finding a balance between the two.”Unfortunately, it’s been obvious for some time that The Apprentice is failing to strike that balance – to the point where it feels like we’re watching the bottom of the barrel being scraped. I want to say that viewers “deserve better” here, but while I’m still tuning in to watch such repetitive slop, I’m not entirely convinced that’s true. It used to be The Apprentice’s contestants who looked like fools. Now the viewers do, too.Explore more on these topicsThe ApprenticeTelevisionAlan SugarReality TVKarren BradyKatie HopkinsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The kind of slow day when the government more or less looked like it was going to set the news agenda. Not be derailed by some catastrophe or cock-up. Or Donald Trump declaring war on Greenland and turning Gaza into a Middle East Riviera of golf courses and casinos. The world as one large real-estate deal.These are the days that governments live for. A rare moment of stability. Nothing going visibly wrong. Or more wrong that it already was. A day when ministers have the illusion of being in control. When their delusions were more or less aligned with reality. When Rachel Reeves could say the interest rate cut was all down to her. When Keir Starmer could go out and about and talk about his plans to build mini-nuclear reactors on every street corner and be guaranteed that a few people were actually listening.ForYvette Cooper, the morning started with a half-hour phone-in slot on LBC’s Nick Ferrari at Breakfast show. In times past, this could have been fraught with danger. Nick is not known for being gentle with politicians, and most cabinet ministers look on his show as an endurance test. A necessary rite of passage. Something that can’t be avoided. Their goal? To get out alive having taken as little damage as possible. To bask in the absence of pain when it’s over.But the home secretary is an experienced performer these days. Confident in her ability to play the game. On top of her brief. Certain she can fend off whatever comes her way. Yet still somehow guarded. She doesn’t really do compassion. Or listening. She’s nobody’s first choice for a shoulder to cry on. Not the person to go running to if you’re in trouble.The opening question came from a woman whose son had been stabbed to death three years ago. What was she doing about knife crime? Cooper leafed through her notes. Halve it in 10 years. Install scanners and arches in some schools. Stop kids buying knives online. Could she be certain this would be effective? Yes, she said. Hmm. We all remember previous home secretaries saying much the same and look where we are. What no minister will admit is that no one can guarantee our safety. If a child is determined enough to carry a knife then no one can stop them. There are knives in every kitchen drawer.Nor can you make sure that atrocities such as the Southport killings never happen again. Some people are so mad, so bad, that they are going to do horrific things. The mental health services and Prevent are never going to be entirely foolproof. They are going to make mistakes. Bad judgment calls. Some bad people are inevitably going to slip through the net.We live in an imperfect world. We can learn lessons from every killing, every failure of the system. But we can’t stop some people from doing bad things. If history can teach us anything, it’s that we don’t have that much control.But all that goes in the box of things that a home secretary and a radio interviewer can’t admit. It’s an affront to their sensibilities. An admission of their own limitations. So Ferrari asked Cooper what she could do to make sure young people stopped carrying knives and that there would never be another Southport attack. Cooper thought a moment. “I would tell them to stop,” she said. Now why hadn’t the rest of us thought of that? If only we had realised it was that simple.Nick then played a recording of an interview with Katy, the daughter of the murdered MP David Amess. She wanted an inquiry into his killing. Just like there was going to be an inquiry into Southport. Yvette prevaricated slightly. She would be releasing more details. Though she couldn’t say if it would be aninquiryinquiry. There were all sorts of inquiries and she wasn’t yet sure whether the inquiry she had in mind could in fact be called an inquiry.Weirdly, this made perfect sense to Ferrari. Maybe he and Cooper have their own private language which is separate to ours. They operate in a meta-sphere where soon there will be an inquiry into everything. Our lives will all be put on pause while we all hold inquiries into everything that has gone wrong. Maybe there will be an over-arching inquiry into all the ongoing inquiries. Just to make sure they were functioning properly. And why stop there? Why not have an inquiry into the over-arching inquiry? We could all slide into a parallel universe. Either way, Louise Casey is going to be one busy woman.We then moved on to a call from David. He was concerned that people were being showered with £3K of free clobber when they arrived in small boats. Yvette muttered something about criminal gangs. Nick intervened. Were we really going to give hats and puffer jackets to new arrivals? He seemed to think we would be better off letting children freeze to death. If they hadn’t bothered to pick up clothes in Calais then they deserved hypothermia. For a moment it seemed that the “tough on gangs” home secretary might agree, but she demurred. She had done her 30 minutes. All was well. She could leave the studio and get on with her day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Always good for a laugh. He was out and about trying to convince himself that Kemi Badenoch’s new immigration ideas were properly thought through and not just some kneejerk response to the popularity of Reform. On the Today programme, Nick Robinson made the fatal mistake that so many journalists make with Chris. He tried to take him seriously. A category error. Rather, he is a role model for halfwits everywhere.Within seconds of opening his mouth, Philp was out of his depth. He clearly had no idea about who would be refused leave to remain and who wouldn’t. Robinson suggested the example of a Nigerian woman called Kemi working in McDonald’s. Would she be kicked out? What if she claimed benefits for a while? What if she got ill and needed the NHS? How low-paid was low-paid? Did people working in care homes count as making a contribution to society?The Philpster had no idea. Out of his depth in a sink. The David Cameron government had only promised to keep immigration down because we were in the EU then. Er … Whatever happened to taking back control of our borders after Brexit. Poor Chris. He wasn’t even aware that he had been part of a government that had overseen record levels of legal migration. He sounded on the verge of tears.More in pity than despair, Nick sent him on his way. Suddenly everything made sense. “I’ve been looking at an idiot,” he said to himself.Explore more on these topicsYvette CooperThe politics sketchLabourLBCnewsShareReuse this content"

Bathing, stretching and cooking: the relentless grind of self-care consumes 112 days of my life each yearEstelle TangThu 6 Feb 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 12.31 ESTShareIt was the sixth time I’dwashed my handsthat day. My red, raw wrists stung as I toweled off, protesting the friction and New York’s bone-dry winter. Being a dog owner (twice-daily poop exposure) during peak respiratory illness season (strangers coughing on you) is no joke.I thought about how life is a procession of vital, unskippable tasks: washing and eating and resting and pooping and exercising and brushing your teeth on a loop, forever.Some version of this tedium thrums steadily for all of us. “A quiet monologue runs through my head at all times. It is this:dinner dinner dinner dinner,” wrote Rachel Sugar in the Atlanticlast month. “It’s not just the cooking that wears me down, but the meal planning and the grocery shopping and the soon-to-be-rotting produce sitting in my fridge.”That day, my friends texted about the slog of personal upkeep. “I am now putting basic things like ‘apply night cream’ on my daily to-do list,” said one.“For some reason filling up my humidifier is where I really get mad. I’m spending my wild-ish and precious-ish life on a HUMIDIFIER,” wrote another.A final miserable text pinged: “When is anyone supposed to do anything?”Great question.I did some mental calculations. How long did it take to cook fiber-rich oatmeal and walk my recalcitrant hound? Add the hours spent bawling to my therapist and the minutes of stretching muscles foreshortened by my sedentary job. Drinking two liters of water takes several minutes multiple times a day, as does showering and brewing cups ofpolyphenol-rich black tea.All thatmeditating, all thatflossing,all theskin cellsI had to slather with SPF: I wondered what I could have done instead, like learning Cantonese or being up to date on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.Teeth gnashing, I opened up a spreadsheet and started cataloging the chores of being alive and their duration. Meditating: 3,650 minutes a year. Washing my face: 730 minutes. Walking the dog: 25,550 whole freaking minutes a year. As the list grew, so did my fury. It was humiliating how much it took to simply be a person. My friend Sisyphus,I thought, feeling kinship with him and his big stupid rock.Finally, I crunched the data to estimate how much time I spent a year on this nonsense. The total: 162,335 minutes.I was agog. A simply ridiculous number! Equivalent to 2,705 hours a year, or 112 days. And it didn’t account for work or sleep, both of which I definitely need to do. I’m not a gym rat, or someone with a 12-step skincare routine. I don’t cook every day, play soccer or do pilates. I hadn’t included grocery shopping,laundry, cleaning,volunteering, watering my numerousphysiologically beneficialplants or staying informed amid a devastating news cycle.I don’t have children or a car or a house – just an annoying body with chronic pain, for which basic maintenance can feel relentless. You can probably put on socks in a matter of seconds; for me – please do not picture this – it can take about a minute.And this all adds up to 162,335 minutes per year! When am I supposed to, say, lie on the floor and contemplate the mysteries of existence?I am joking, but in a demanding and chaotic world, plenty of other people are seeking ways to manage the basics. According to Google Trends, searches for“self care reminders” went up 3,800% in mid-January. In 2024, lifestyle brand Lululemonreportedthat 45% of respondents to their corporate survey experienced “wellbeing burnout”. “The more pressure we feel to be well, the less well we feel,” reads the report. But this isn’t even as high-concept as that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In an interviewwith the Guardian last year, she said: “We are being forced to be ‘well’, to pretend we’re OK, to never have needs, to never be sick, because all those things would mean something is wrong with us and we don’t actually belong. This constant pressure can be deadly.”It’s a refreshing view that recognizes the burdens of upkeep – even when it’s a privilege to be able to do it.“I resent how much time this takes up,” I texted my friends. My health issues mean routine tasks are more time-consuming than they used to be.I tried an anti-inflammatory diet for a week. This is what I learnedRead moreThis left me with a dilemma. As a lifestyle editor, I encounter a lot of information about how to improve one’s wellbeing. I don’t have the constitution to be a fanatic, which is good because that’s the mindset that leads tocomparing erections with your son, Bryan Johnson–style. But there are some gradual changes I’d like to make based on what I want my future to look like: likeweightliftingfor bone health andeating more nutritiously. I’m also forever curious about adjustments to body function. For instance, should I really be paying more attentionto my feet?Rageful spreadsheet frenzy over, I took a beat. One hundred and twelve days was almost a third of a year. That’s a lot! Why would I put pressure on myself to do more? With this data, I stopped wondering if I should try every new healthy activity. I simply don’t have time. I need to work and have fun and do nothing sometimes (which can also begood for you).Life admin– what adrag! But deciding what to eat and doing YouTube workouts are also how I care for myself. I appreciate those efforts – well, I have to, as part of my nightly gratitude practice (1,825 minutes a year).Still, dreading another two months of cracked, inflamed skin, I ordered the humidifier my group chat recommended. But, they warned, you have to fill it up every night. My heart sank, thinking of the sluggish water pressure in my kitchen faucet. At a few minutes a pop, there goes another 240 minutes of my life.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealth & wellbeingMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Better blurbs? Changes in the school curriculum? Flashy new biographies of dead authors? Or might it be pastel pink covers emblazoned with characters that look as if they just got back from Comic-Con?Publisher Penguin Random House (PRH) is trying its luck with the latter: its youth imprint, Puffin, has announced a series of new editions ofJane Austennovels pitched at young romance readers. Although Austen’s stories will remain the same, the covers of these editions feature cartoonish illustrations of the characters, and are being marketed as “full of meet-cutes, missed connections and drama”. This description makes it sound as if these classic works are akin to the kind of contemporary romance novels that are hugely popular on TikTok with teenagers and young adults.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PuffinThere have been successive attempts by publishers to “crack” BookTok (the nickname for TikTok content about books, which has the power to propel titles into bestseller lists) – you need only check their social media accounts to see the desperation to go viral. And it’s easy to see why, as publishers struggle to reach young peoplewho studies show are increasingly uninterested in reading.BookTok is unpredictable –an obscure 1995 dystopiaand aDostoevsky novellaare among the titles it has turned into hits – and therefore hard to target. But the one thing we know for sure is that its users love romance – “spicy” novels by authors such as Colleen Hoover, Sarah J Maas and Emily Henry have become bestsellers thanks to their popularity on the app.Each of the six Austen books in the “First Impressions” series, due out in March, will be introduced by a popular YA romance novelist. Boyfriend Material author Alexis Hall, who has written the foreword for Persuasion, describes Anne and Captain Wentworth as “legit freaking soulmates”, while author of the Maple Hills series Hannah Grace says of Sense and Sensibility’s Elinor: “I’d bet that her favourite Taylor Swift song would be This Is Me Trying.”Unsurprisingly, criticism of these covers has abounded on platforms such as X and Reddit – with social media users claiming that “Tiktokifying” Austen was patronising younger audiences. The Booker-nominated author Brandon Taylor, while conceding that the idea could work in theory, said that the execution was “weird” ina thread on X. “They turned Fanny Price into a Targaryen,” he said of the Mansfield Park cover, which features an illustration of a woman who bears a striking resemblance to Emilia Clarke’s character in Game of Thrones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The once clothbound, gold-embossed look has been eclipsed – at least among young BookTok readers – by something closer to pick ‘n’ mix: neon colours and bubble, brush-lettered fonts with homogeneous artwork.A desire for modernised classics isn’t new (nor is buying them for display purposes only), but the discomfort around these covers speaks to what may feel, to many, like an abrupt shift in what “modernisation” means in 2025. Alongside these covers, you can also find a similar treatment of classics elsewhere, such as in 2020 when the US retailer Barnes & Noble received backlash – and ultimately suspended –a series of classics with racially swapped characters on the covers. We have seen a boom in peppy Austen film adaptations, such as Dakota Johnson’s Persuasion (2022) and Anya Taylor-Joy’s Emma (2020) and there are even total reworkings made to appeal to the romance market, such as the “audio smut” company,Bloom Stories, which has rewritten Pride and Prejudice to make it “spicy”.The impetus, then, for these covers makes sense. But will they actually sell? Heather Slater, manager of Forum Books in Northumberland, is sceptical. She says she regularly sells Austen titles to young readers looking for their “romance fix” but who are eager to expand beyond young adult romance novels. However, while she believes Austen novels do have the tropes many romance readers seek – “the gossiping of Emma, the desperate romantic Marianne Dashwood, the classic enemies to lovers story of Mr Darcy and Elizabeth” – she thinks the new covers “frame these novels in completely the wrong light”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Puffin“They potentially give an impression to those who don’t realise they are actually classics that they have been given a rework to a present day setting,” she says.“I think it’s pure snobbery to criticise the design in itself, but I would say that they’re a bit misleading for readers – romance books with those types of covers are a very different reading experience from Pride and Prejudice,” says book blogger Soniya Ganvir, one half of the influencer duo@browngirlsreadbooks. “It’s not going to be a spicy romance like Bridgerton so in the long term will it really capture the audience they’re aiming for?”The new covers are “a little too obvious” says Jess White, the Liverpool-based writer of the popular Substack Jess White Reads Books. She says she can understand Penguin’s desire to reach audiences that aren’t reading classics with these new editions (which, in her opinion, “are actually really hideous”) but thinks the move being so clearly a trend-driven sales grab will turn readers off.“Pandering” to readers of contemporary romance “is a little desperate”, she adds, “especially because there is such a difference between those kinds of texts and Austen … I’m not entirely sure that Austen’s novels need a sales boost as they’re always in print anyway, and have droves of readers.”This is something Ganvir echoes: “Lots of excellent work, especially by women and racialised minorities doesn’t get even a fraction of the marketing spend that will have gone into this rebrand … books that, while great, are also outdated.”But Caden Armstrong, the owner of the romance bookshop Book Lovers Bookshop in Edinburgh, is more optimistic about the rebrand. The shop’s staff “are utterly in love with these new editions”, they tell me. “They merge classic literature with a new colourful and unique art style that we believe will bring in a new wave of young Jane Austen fans.”Saber Kahn, who works for the independent bookshop chain Topping Books, doesn’t see anything wrong with the new covers. “I don’t believe in gatekeeping of any sort and objecting to these feels like that and a bit precious. While the covers might look different, Jane’s voice hasn’t changed: always fresh and vibrant to read.”Explore more on these topicsBooksJane AustenPublishingChildren and teenagersTikTokSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ten years ago I saw his photos at the Royal Academy and realised he was also a brilliant photographer; I started reading biographies and checking out the movies I’d missed. Then I wrote a fun song about him called Dennis Hopper where every line rhymed with Hopper. I thought it would be great to do an EP, because his life was so colourful, but after some of my band members secretly recorded some instrumentals and suggested I put lyrics to them, I realised it could be an album of his life.I started just before the pandemic but had all these other albums and box set projects, so I’d work intensely on Hopper then leave it and return with fresh ears. It has 25 songs. A friend of mine suggested I was doing too many voices myself – an American commentator, an old hippy and so on – and needed some guests. I used to love thoseBruce Springsteenbootlegs where he’d do these incredible narratives at the end of the songs and thought, “If we could only get Bruce … ” He had come to a Waterboys gig in Dublin 10 years ago so there was a connection, and our manager asked his. Bruce did three takes for the song Ten Years Gone and sent all three. I got to pick between them. He did it so brilliantly and brought all the drama that I’d hoped he would.View image in fullscreen‘I’m looking for people with an attitude or a character’ … The Waterboys lineup in 2019.Photograph: Shirlaine Forrest/WireImageWhat did you think of Prince’s cover ofThe Whole of the Moon– andFather Noel Furlong’s cover inFather Ted?SmilinPeterPrince did it twice. He did a solo piano version at Ronnie Scott’s in 2014, which I’ve never heard, anda version in Minneapolis in 2015 with 3rdEyeGirl. I love it when people change my songs and make them their own. He flipped the lyrics round to sing “Isaw the whole of the moon”, using the song to make a Black Lives Matter statement, which I thought was very powerful.I love theGraham Norton version on Father Tedwhere he’s playing the bonkers priest in the caravan who remembers the words wrong. There’s a gay disco version as well, byBoys of a New Age, with a killer synth riff, which is storming.In theThe Double Life of Bob Dylanbiography I discovered that you got invited to one of Dylan’s jamming sessions withDave Stewartin London. How was it?Bibliophile63It was 1985. Bob had heard The Whole of the Moon and apparently liked it, and invited us to come down to the studios. Three of us turned up – myself, Steve Wickham and Anto Thistlethwaite. Bob was really nice to us. He had a quiet word with each of us individually because he must realise that he’s precious to people and it’s nice to have a private moment with him. We played for a couple of hours. [Blondie’s] Clem Burke was on drums. The weird thing was that Bob wasn’t singing. They were creating instrumentals for which Bob would later write the lyrics, which wasn’t his usual way with a sheet of paper. In a quiet moment I leaned over and asked, “Do you still write songs the other way?” He leaned towards me with a sort of glint in his eye – as if he knew what I was implying – and said, “Yes, I do.”What is the legacy of Dennis Hopper’s generation?MachoPudCulturally we’re still only coming to terms with what happened in the 1950s and 60s. There was the march of technology, mass production and the confluence of civilisations: the Black African American experience meeting the white experience and Hispanic experience. Then the evolution of consciousness: the pill, women’s liberation. It was all in this melting pot of incredible musical and cultural progress. Jimi Hendrix’s guitar playing is a good metaphor for how ahead of its time it all was and we’re still catching up. Oddly enough, now we’ve got the backlash with Maga and all that. People are trying to turn back progress but it won’t work because humanity has to move forward, and we will.When you releasedThe Liar, did you think it possible that Trump would be electedpresident again?PaulWB1960It was written around the time of his second impeachment. When it came out in 2022 I always had this sneaking dread that Biden’s presidency would turn out to be a moment between two Trump nightmares.Would you have actually liked to have been a fisherman? Or indeed a “brakeman on a hurtlin’ fevered train”?DeJongandtherestlessThere was a moment in my life where my personal circumstances were sufficiently confusing and confounding for me to wish exactly that. Unfortunately, I didn’t go off and do it. I put it in a song instead.What are your memories of your teenage years inAyr, and have you ever thought of doing an album inspired by Burns as you did with Yeats [An Appointment With Mr Yeats, 2011]?Chriswa29Burns has been done so many times and so well that there’s not really much fresh ground for me. Yeats felt underdone. Ayr was very beautiful geographically, a great old town to be in as a teenager that taught me a lot of life lessons. My first band members were blokes from Ayr. My first girlfriends were the women of Ayr. I owe the town a lot.View image in fullscreen‘I owe the town of Ayr a lot’ … Mike Scott with band recording in 1985.Photograph: Lynn Goldsmith/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesMy first gig was your old band calledAnother Pretty Face. How do you look back on your Edinburgh punk days?M1keM5I was living in Edinburgh and in my first proper band. I had a job in the HMV shop to make money to buy instruments. The moment we got the sniff of a record deal I was off, but it was a golden time: great fun, uncomplicated. Me and the guitar player lived in a bedsit with an Iranian landlady and if you had any lingering guests after 10pm she would come storming up the stairs. Pity the poor interloper! I think of those times with a lot of fondness.“Your coat is made of magic / And around your table angels play”is beautiful. IsWhen Ye Go Awayabout anyone in particular?IanJamesCameronIt grew out of another song, Killing My Heart, which is on The Best of the Waterboys and the Fisherman’s Box box set. I didn’t think we had the definitive version so I stole most of the lyrics and put new music to it. Killing My Heart was about my own relationship at the time with my partner who became my first wife, a relationship going wrong for a member of the band, and one going wrong for a member of my family. But When Ye Go Away is more reflective: all the pain was left in Killing My Heart.What doesSpiddalmean to you and do you ever get back to it?Captain LSpiddal is a village on the north coast of Galway Bay in the Irish-language area [where some of Fisherman’s Blues was recorded]. I was there last summer being interviewed for a documentary about a pub called Hughes’ and everything came back to me. The charms of the place, the Atlantic light, the sense of freedom and the magic of the Gaelic-speaking world. We got a tour of a new studio there and I was smitten all over again, thinking: could we come back and make a record? It’s otherworldly and an inspirational place, so maybe something will happen.When did you first hear the phrase “a bang on the ear” and did you have to ask what it meant?strawwdogIt was a telephone conversation with a crew member of the Waterboys who had a little boy called Benji. We were joshing on the phone and as we were signing off I said: “Oh, and give Benji a clout in the head from me.” It’s not meant literally; it’s code for an affectionate “hello”. I thought, “I like that phrase. I’m going to use that.”Red Army Bluesis probably my favourite Waterboys song. You sing it with real conviction even though it’s written from someone else’s point of view. How did the song come about?wyngatecarpenterI was fascinated by the second world war and read two books that inspired that song. One was The Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer, a Frenchman of German extraction who was drafted into the SS. The other was The Diary of Vikenty Angarov, a story of a Russian who had fought in the Red Army. Because he’d seen how people lived in the west, it was threatening to Stalin’s control. So a lot of the soldiers who had fought for Russia and defeated fascism were sent to the gulags. I was very moved by both books so I put together the song from the Russian soldier’s perspective, but using place names and incidents from The Forgotten Soldier.Wikipedia says that there have beenmore than 80 members of the Waterboys, either as contributors to albums or tours. What does it take to be a Waterboy?69thAnteaterIt’s a matter of pride to me that we’ve had more members than any other band ever! I think the nearest competitor is Santana. I’m looking for people with an attitude or a character, and they have to be versatile enough to play all the different kinds of music that factor into the Waterboys’ sound. My skills as a bandleader have developed, so now I find it much easier to bring whatever I need out of the musician.View image in fullscreen‘The fiddle carries a very particular emotion’ … Mike Scott of the Waterboys.Photograph: PauI Mac ManusDid you recognise early on thatKarl Wallingerwas a talent best-suited to front his own band, and did you remain friendly after he left to formWorld Party?takinarideI always knew he was a potential band leader. The first time I went to his flat in London he had a reel-to-reel recorder and played me some songs he’d been working on and was singing. I always knew he was going to go off and make his own albums. After he left the band I didn’t see him for years. Then, when he was living in New York in the early 90s, we met up, had a meal and played each other our new records. But he had this bad habit of putting me down in interviews in a very personal way, and that didn’t really foster a good relationship.WillSteve Wickhambe in the Waterboys again?SharonProbably. He’s on one song of the Dennis Hopper album, but the fiddle has a very particular sound and carries a very particular emotion. I spent 25 years singing with an incredibly talented and brilliant fiddle player who can mirror everything I do and go everywhere with me. At the moment, it’s really a good experience for both of us to not have to work alongside each other. For me it’s a bit like life after fiddle – or more likely life between fiddle eras. We’re still best mates.Life, Death and Dennis Hopper is released 4 April. The second single from the album, Andy (A Guy Like You), is released 7 February.

On paper, I’ve achieved everything I set out to accomplish. Some milestones took one or two attempts, while others came with surprising ease. I’m now a specialist in a sought-after field, hold an academic position at a university, and am married with a substantial mortgage.And yet a persistent sense of inadequacy lingers. There’s always someone who seems to have achieved more – at least on paper. I often feel like an impostor, as if luck or connections were the real reasons I got here. When success required more than one attempt, I can’t shake the thought that I didn’t truly earn my place. If I really belonged, I tell myself, I would have succeeded on the first try.I see men striding in with ease, seemingly free from this constant self-doubt, while I endlessly nitpick and self-criticise. I can’t seem to let go. How do I stop this cycle? What can be my circuit breaker?Eleanor says:Maya Angelou had dreadful impostor syndrome: “I’ve run a game on everybody, and they’re going to find out.” Someone at the very top of their game, 11 books in, can still have that critical inner voice asking, “Do you really deserve this?”I feel despair about the state of the world. How can I find the courage to not abandon hope? | Leading questionsRead moreOne strategy is to answer that voice, toprove its suspicions wrong. You could try to answer yours by noting that even if luck played a role in your success, that doesn’t mean talent didn’t – connections help, but people don’t tend to stick their necks out for someone they don’t think is deserving. You could also point out that skill takes time to acquire: you’d never say a cellist isn’t really virtuosic if they only got good by practising.And while lots of people might be lots better in each given area, is anyone else as good at the combination? Try to list all the different things you’re good at across your personal and professional life. It’s probably quite an idiosyncratic set –yourcombination of skills,yourstyle of being. People might outstrip you on any given item, but the combination is yours. Nobody beats you at being you.Those are great ways to answer the inner critic when it asks, “Do you really deserve this?” But you can also look for ways to refuse that question instead of trying to answer it.We fixate on questions when we think something important turns on them. What turns on whether you “really” earned your place? If you did get there partly by luck, would that mean you didn’t belong? Not remotely; not if you do a great job now you’re there. If it does turn out there’s someone who’s achieved more, would that mean in absolute terms you aren’t any good? Not even a bit.Maybe the trick isn’t to prove beyond doubt that you deserve your success, but to deny that being able to prove it matters much. The fact is you’re here now; you’ve arrived. You can look backwards and tally the merits. Or you can ask how you’ll use your talents and time now that you’re here.You asked for a circuit breaker. It might sound strange, but one strategy might be to nod a little thanks to this critical perfectionist tendency. Wretched as it is to hear that critical voice when it turns on you, it might also have helped to get you where you are. It might have driven you to perfect those skills, keep going, demand more of yourself.Another strategy might not be in thought but in action. What would it mean to treat your discomfort here as an insight? Maybe you did get lucky. Maybe every successful person does. Maybe we’re condemned to uncertainty about how our talents stack up against those of others or against an imagined ideal. What would it mean to receive that lot with gratitude and responsibility? Perhaps we’d turn outwards more, ask less about what our positions say of us and more about how to use them. Perhaps, even, we’d shift from trying to prove ourselves to interrogating the very norms that make us feel we must.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsWork & careersLeading questionsAustralian lifestyleWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Up close it may look like a gigantic allotment, but this unusual project actually stretches for 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres), a green belt that now completely rings the city ofOuagadougou.The green belt began life many years ago in the 1970s, with the aim of building a protective wall against the encroaching desert that lies beyond the greenery, just a few steps away. InBurkina Faso, one-third of the territory – about 9 million hectares of productive land – is degraded, with an estimated average degradation rate of 360,000 hectares per year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). “Burkina Faso is not a climatically favoured country, but the drought of the 1980s exacerbated the problem, leading to significant population movements toward less degraded areas,” explains Sidnoma Abdoul Aziz Traoré, an environmental economist and expert in land degradation at the Centre Universitaire de Ziniaré (CUZ). But the situation, he says, is not irreversible.View image in fullscreenThe project of the green belt of Ouagadougou in the capital’s fourth arrondissement.Photograph: Èlia BorràsThe initial goal of the green belt was to reforest 2,100 hectares at an annual rate of 100 hectares, and by 1986, the area where trees had been planted was 1,032 hectares. The project stuttered a little in later years, despite reaching 2,000 hectares. But new impetus has recently been given to the project, which seeks, beyond holding back the desert, to combat heat and promote urban agriculture to help feed a city that has doubled its population in just 14 years, according to data from the National Institute of Statistics and Demography (INSD). The deadly heatwave that hit the country last year, with the temperature in Burkina Faso exceeding 42.3C (108F) for three consecutive days, only hammered home the urgency of what is now a vital project for the city.“The Sahel responds more quickly to climate change, and we are less prepared,” explains climatologist Kiswendsida Guigma at the Climate Centre of the Red Cross Federation in the Burkinabè capital. “When we analyse the situation on a large scale, we realise that the climate phenomenon has contributed to increasing heat. As a result, there are new initiatives like planting trees. People have realised that we need to cool the city, although we haven’t managed to do it on the necessary scale.”“One of the objectives of the green belt is to lower the city’s temperature; that’s why we’re also planting trees,” says Moumini Sawadogo of the Spanish Red Cross, which financed a two-hectare garden as part of the belt, including the construction of two water wells and training in agroecology. Research has shown that “botanical gardens are the green spaces with the greatest capacity to lower city temperatures”, and that sites such as the Chelsea Physic Garden and Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, or the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore, reduced air temperatures during heatwaves in the city streets around them by an average of 5C.City residents can have a plot of six beds. Zarate Ibundo, 55, has lived his entire life collecting stones to sell – a job for those seeking to earn a daily living by any means. Most go to quarries on the city’s outskirts, where they manually break large stones into gravel, which is then used to decorate the gardens of wealthier homes. But two years ago, Ibundo left the stones to engage in agriculture, and now has a plot of six beds, each about 3 metres long and 1 metre wide. “Now, I can earn 2,000xof [West African CFA francs] (£2.54) per day,” he says from the garden where he cultivates lettuce and seasonal produce, located in the fourth arrondissement of Ouagadougou. Here, about a third of the population lived on less than £1.53 per day, according to the World Bank.Cabbage, onion, mint, lettuce and papaya are now found in the plots, where women work, rest, walk, share and chat while collecting water from tanks within the area. “My suffering has decreased because I have food and earn money,” says Ibundo.View image in fullscreenZarate Ibundo (left) and Nagbila Salimata (right) in the green belt of Ouagadougou.Photograph: Èlia BorràsFor Nagbila Salimata, 66, it’s the first time in her life that she feels she works in tranquility. Like her companion, Ibundo, she used to make a living collecting and transporting stones to sell. Now she eats onion and okra, a fresh and appreciated product in Burkinabè and African cuisine. Just a few steps away, right outside their garden, the ground becomes sandy again, and the wind raises dust that makes the neighbourhood cough. It seems impossible that these green beds used to be like that.“The 2024 heatwave was exceptional. I think it has helped open people’s eyes to the fact that climate change is present even in the city,” says Guigma. According to a study published by Nasa that analysed the impact of green spaces in 500 cities worldwide, cities in the global south do not have the same cooling capacity. While in richer cities, green spaces can cool up to 2.5C, in an average northern city, the cooling capacity is 3.6C. The same study refers to this as the “luxury effect”, as wealthier cities have more green spaces. “It’s already clear that global south countries will be impacted by heat waves, rising temperatures, and climatic extremes more than their global north counterparts,” said Chi Xu, a professor of ecology at Nanjing University and a co-author of the study.The belt can also offer a solution to people fleeing rural areas, who are accustomed to working the land, like Lassina Kaboré, 54, who used to work as a cereal farmer, but had to give up his farm and had turned to collecting garbage with a donkey and cart. He now looks after six beds of lettuce, which give him some income.View image in fullscreenCabbage from the Ibundo’s bed.Photograph: Èlia BorràsIbundo, Salimata and Kaboré rest under a banana tree to talk. “We water, rest, water – that’s our day,” they say, laughing and buying some soy skewers from a street vendor.

Everyone knew that something bad was about to happen, but there was still a sense it might not be so bad. After all, Trump’s first four years had been less terrible than observers predicted. That was always a mistake: aspiring autocrats are most dangerous when they come to power a second time. But even those bracing for shocks could hardly have expected Trump to be so blatantly lawless and destructive once back in office. This approach – sabotage bureaucracies, violate the constitution, then see what happens – might now beapplied to education.Trump’s choice of education secretary, pro-wrestling billionaire Linda McMahon, seemed positively harmless compared with figures like the walking talking threat to public health known as Robert F Kennedy Jr. Though she hasan accusationof having enabled the sexual abuse of young boys in the wrestling world hanging over her, McMahon denies all wrongdoing.At least unlike Trump’s first education secretary, Betsy DeVos, McMahon seemed to have no particular investment in charter schools and predatory for-profit colleges. Perhaps nothing worse might happen than a push for conventional Republican policies, in particular voucher schemes thatend up helping wealthier parentswho are already sending their children to private schools.True, Trump’s executive orders also affirmed a desire for more “patriotic education”, possibly based on another amateur whitewashed American history as first formulated by his ill-fated1776 commission. But these are no more than bombastic sounding wishlists: the federal government does not control curricula and most spending on education is local or strictly determined by Congress.Yet, the surprise is that Trump has not pursued the strategy familiar from other far-right populists in power, namely what scholars call “autocratic legalism”: observe formal procedures when legislating, but violate the spirit of the law and, ultimately, the constitution, as you pursue a relentless concentration of power. Despite the Republican control of all branches of government, Trump (and Elon Musk) have opted for a strategy of chaos, sabotage and evident lawlessness: destroying USAid and quite possibly now trying the same with the Department of Education.Trump clearly feels emboldened to adopt the conduct long familiar from his businesses: just see how far you can push and see who will really sueAs lawyers have been shouting from the rooftops, departments cannot be undone by executive order; Congress needs to act. That was one reason why some observers suggested sitting back and relaxing before Trump came back into office; after all, he had threatened to kill the Department of Education before. In fact, the Republican party has been committed to the idea ever since the 1980s.Yet, Trump clearly feels emboldened to adopt the conduct long familiar from his businesses: just see how far you can push and see who will really sue. Of course, the imperative – break things, and if they were really important, someone else will put them back together – is also part of the worldview of his new Silicon Valley allies. And Trump might be forgiven for thinking that, after years of never having been held to account for anything – from allegedly inciting an insurrection to mishandling documents – he is the most unconstrained president ever.I didn’t think Trump’s second act would be that bad. Oh, how wrong I was | Arwa MahdawiRead moreCourtsmight eventually put a stop to Trump’s sabotage of the American state. His administration might just disaggregate some of the functions of the Department of Education, let private actors take over loans and the states be responsible for special education (all of which will make the most vulnerable kids worse off), plus get rid of whatever Musk happens not to like on a particular day and then declare victory. But a lot of damage will have been done, including the intimidation of plenty of administrators in colleges and universities and possibly schools, which will do Trump’s bidding even in the absence of valid laws. Florida has set the example; and in the face of legal uncertainty, many adapt andself-censor.One executive orderinstructed the justice department to initiate a compliance investigation of a private institution of higher education with an endowment of more than $1bn. Deans may well be inclined to obey in advance and abolish anything smacking of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) – which like critical race theory, has now been redefined into an all-purpose political weapon. The spending freeze of National Science Foundation grants, possibly followed by a devastating attack on the institution itselfthrough mass layoffsand the scramble to find the tiniest traces of DEI in existing projects –such as, God forbid, the word “women”– will have a majorchilling effect.Trump does not have the authority fundamentally to reorient education; but, as we have by now seen, lack of authority does not equate to refraining from power grabs. The shock-and-awe tactics could further radicalize rightwing activists; civil rights enforcement in schools and universities over which Trumpists will have controlmight be both weakened and weaponized. One thing is sure: as with USAid, Trump’s actions manage to inflict harm on many individuals and cause major national self-harm at the same time.Jan-Werner Müller is a professor of politics at Princeton University and is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Health, the law, checks and balances: it is testing public confidence in everythingThu 6 Feb 2025 13.31 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 13.36 ESTShareBeyond reasonable doubt. Those words carry a heavy moral burden, and so they should. Jurors hold another human being’s life in their hands, and must be convinced there is no other rational explanation for the facts presented to them than the defendant’s guilt. But what happens when those facts start to shimmer and blur, to multiply and divide confusingly before your eyes?Lucy Letby is officially Britain’s worst serial child killer, serving 15 life sentences for murdering seven babies and trying to kill seven more. But her case has become as troubling to some medical professionals as it is attractive to conspiracy theorists because of the stubbornly persistent doubts at its heart. There are things we may never know for sure about those babies’ last moments.Yet justice – for both Letby and the poor bereaved parents – requires a verdict nonetheless.This week, the Tory MP David Davis, who is convinced Letby is a woman wronged,hosted a press conferencewith Prof Dr Shoo Lee, a retired Canadian neonatologist whose work was cited by the prosecution in support of its case that Letby killed some of the babies by injecting air into them. Lee’s argument that his research on telltale signs of so-called air embolisms was misinterpreted hasalready been consideredand rejected by the court of appeal – it concluded that the unusual skin colouring his paper describes wasn’t the only diagnostic clue the prosecution relied on – but Lee doesn’t give up easily.Having assembled a panel of 14 undeniably eminent doctors to review the babies’ medical notes, he travelled from Canada to announce that Letby could not be a murderer because his panel had found no murders. All the babies, he argued, died of natural causes or “bad medical care” on a unit he felt would have been shut down as unsafe had it been in Canada.For the parents, it must be torture. One mothertold the Daily Mailshe had found “every aspect of what they are doing” profoundly disrespectful, including the drama of staging a press conference: “This isn’t a show, this is our real lives.” It would be unspeakably cruel to raise doubts unnecessarily in families who will be haunted by them.Yet if Lee is right, then Letby has been doomed to die in jail for something she didn’t do. When even the ex-director of public prosecutions Ken Macdonald – hitherto astern critic of bystanderschallenging the Letby verdict without understanding the evidence –begins arguingthat such is the public unease that the Criminal Cases Review Commission “will want to look at this very carefully”, something is afoot. This is no longer just about one conviction, but public confidence in everything from the safety of maternity units to theongoing public inquiryinto the Letby case, the effective functioning of the appeal courts and the use of medical evidence in trials. It has become a kind of test case for justice itself.Are lay juries the right people to assess incredibly complex medical evidence like this? I’ve never forgotten reporting years ago on a coroner’s inquest involving a jury, where it became obvious from the questions they were asking the coroner that some jurors were hopelessly lost. It was uncomfortable for everybody watching but agonising for the parents of the child involved, reliant for a verdict on people who didn’t seem to understand the evidence. To be blunt, that’s probably where jury cases end up more often than anyone wants to think, because the alternative to juries with all their human flaws is losing the right to trial by your peers. But this system requires expert witnesses who can boil technical evidence down into clear and simple terms, and therein lies a risk.In their forensic account of the trial,Unmasking Lucy Letby, the BBC journalists Jonathan Coffey and Judith Moritz describe the perplexing case of baby O, where the original pathologist and the prosecution’s pathologist disagreed about his cause of death. The authors commissioned a third pathologist to adjudicate, who promptly disagreed with both the others. Though it’s perfectly normal for good scientists to disagree in good faith, their anonymous expert added that “courts want people who are more absolute”, so the same very confident people get asked again and again. And since “everyone knows who the hawks are and who the doves are”, lawyers soon learn who to call, depending on the answer they need.The crucial safeguard remains the defence’s right to call its own medical experts to challenge the prosecution’s, and the biggest puzzle of this case remains that Letby’s high-powered defence team didn’t do so. They commissioned a report from neonatologist Dr Mike Hall, challenging the diagnosis in several of the cases, and drew on it in cross-examination. But they didn’t get Hall to testify, for reasons he has never understood. Instead, they focused on discrediting the prosecution’s lead witness,retired paediatrician Dr Dewi Evans, accusing him of being dogmatic and making facts fit his theory – arguments rejected by both trial judge and the appeal courts. (Letby’s new barrister, Mark McDonald, is arguing that Evans’s credibility is damaged because he changed his mind about the causes of three babies’ deaths, criticism Evans rejects as “unsubstantiated, unfounded, inaccurate”.)What is the new challenge to the evidence used to convict Lucy Letby?Read moreThe case for a miscarriage of justice would look overwhelming by now if Lee’s findings perfectly matched Hall’s misgivings, but unhelpfully it’s not that simple: in some cases, more experts seem to mean more competing accounts. How do you “follow the science” when it leads in circles?This case was never, of course, just about science. Letby was the nurse that death seemed to follow around, the only one present for every incident Evans identified as suspicious: the death rate plummeted when she was, at colleagues’ insistence, removed from the ward. As Moritz and Coffey conclude, it’s as hard to argue definitively for her innocence as for her guilt. Even Hall told them he couldn’t say whether she was culpable.But he also pointed out that strictly speaking, that’s not the question: it’s whether Lucy Letby had the fair trial to which both the guilty and the innocent are entitled, and in his view she did not. Did the jury really hear the facts, and nothing but the facts? Until that question is answered, doubts both reasonable and unreasonable cannot be laid to rest.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now Europe must stop placating themThu 6 Feb 2025 11.22 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 11.25 ESTShareDonald Trump’s proposal to evict 2 million Palestinians from Gaza is an unashamed declaration of support for ethnic cleansing. As so often, he seems ready to ignore moral and legal codes alike. “Deportation or forcible transfer of population” is listed in the Rome statute of the international criminal court as a crime against humanity. And yet a US president has put that idea on the table. Trump insists this would be in everybody’s interest. According to him, Palestinians would not want to return to their homes. “I have heard that Gaza has been very unlucky for them,” he recently said. The population is, in Trump’s words, “living in hell”, with “death and destruction and rubble and demolished buildings falling all over”. He made no mention of Israel’s responsibility for that death and destruction and rubble.More than 30 years ago, during the early months of the bloody Bosnian war that I had been reporting on as the eastern Europe editor of the Independent, the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadžić, explained to me that the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population that was then under way was, in fact,doing the Bosniansa favour. “We let them go,” Karadžić explained with a smile, “with their luggage and everything.” Like Karadžić, Trump does not hide the fact that Palestinians who are forced to abandon their homes would have no choice in the matter. Sitting next to Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump suggested: “I don’t think they’re going to tell me no.”In 2019, Israeli election posters boasted of Netanyahu’s friendship with Trump, showing pictures of the two smiling men together. The Israeli prime minister praised the US president for “the kind of thinking that will reshape the Middle East and bring peace”. Netanyahu’s own perspectives on peace are questionable. Only two months ago, a panel of judges at the international criminal courtunanimously confirmed a requestmade six months before that by the chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, for the issue of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes against humanity, in connection with murder, starvation and intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population. (Khan also requested indictments against Hamas leaders, for the brutal and lawless attacks of 7 October.)Trump is not alone in rolling out the red carpet for someone wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes. Trump’s old friend Kim Jong-un last year defied the court by proudly welcoming Vladimir Putin to Pyongyang. But Trump takes his loathing of justice to another level. The US president wants to impose sanctions on the ICC in order to prevent it from doing its job in “balancing the scales” of justice; his ultimate goal appears to be to weaken or destroythe court itself.Trump talked of Gaza as a “Riviera of the Middle East”, thus building on his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s earlier musings about the “very valuable” potential of Gaza’s “waterfront property”. A Baedeker travel guide published in 1943 on the Nazi-occupied territories of eastern Europe boasted that some of the most attractive towns and cities in the region were nowjudenfrei, “Jew-free”. The “very valuable” Gaza real estate that gets Trump and his son-in-law so excited (and for whicharchitectural sketcheshave even been prepared)–would presumably be “Palestinian-free”.The sanest voices in Israel decry such madness – most obviously on behalf of the Palestinians, but also on behalf of Israel’s own future peace and stability. As Yasmin Levy summarised inHaaretz: “Trump’s Gaza fantasy sends Israeli rightwing pundits into rapturous delirium.”Trump’s proposals are obviously unreal, not least since he has no workable suggestion for where 2 million Palestinians should be transferred. And yet, even the discussion of such inhuman and lawless ideas only piles on the instability in the region.Netanyahu is the problem, not the solution, even if Trump refuses to acknowledge this. But it is not just Trump who has reacted with indignation on Netanyahu’s behalf. European governments, despite being co-founders of the ICC, have been reluctant to accept their obligation to arrest Netanyahuif he sets foot on European soil. European governments seem more eager to placate the dangerous bully than to confront him. It shouldn’t be left to smaller parties such as Britain’s opposition Liberal Democrats to describe the proposals as dangerous. While the latest statements by Trump are deranged, they can’t be ignored. Fudged language becomes impossible if a leading ally proposes, endorses or commits serious crimes.Steve Crawshaw is author ofProsecuting the Powerful: War Crimes and the Battle for JusticeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Just look at the cruel state of women’s prisonsZoe WilliamsA new report says there’s a ‘basic lack of decency’ in England’s jails. It’s a motif repeated across a nation stripped to the boneThu 6 Feb 2025 07.47 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 10.25 ESTShareOne of the fundamentals of modern jail craft is the idea that it’s hard to convince prisoners that you care about their welfare if they’re living in squalid conditions. This has been understood for years, with fluctuating amounts of buy-in from politicians about how important it was to offender management that inmates felt cared about.Self-harm, meanwhile, has long been an issue of concern. I remember, in the 1990s and 2000s, detailed conversations with prison psychologistsabout why women’s prisons had disproportionate amounts of it: one idea, which I always found the most convincing, was that women, where they had children, were almost always the main carer, so were in a state of constant anxiety about who was looking after them. Another theory was that psychological interventions such as anger management courses had been devised for male prisoners; women responded differently to the discovery that they could have controlled their anger – by blaming themselves. That was also plausible.The one thing nobody ever debated was whether or not self-harm was the Ministry of Justice’s problem. Naturally, it is their problem; if you’re keeping people incarcerated, you have to keep them safe. On Wednesday, the chief inspector of prisonspublished a reporton women in prisons in England which found that self-harm was being driven by a “basic lack of decency” in jails. The details are tragic. Inmate calls to their children limited to one a month; remotely situated jails with no transport links so family visits are prohibitively expensive; prison uniforms designed for men; bizarre restrictions such as no underwear in the washing machines. Some of this sounds like performative cruelty, but all of it is rooted in a toxic combination of budget cuts and soaring prisoner numbers: the adult women’s prison population in England and Wales stood at 3,611 in November 2023, and is projected toincrease to4,200by November 2027, a rise of 16%.This increasingly punitive approach is completely needless; many of these women are on remand for nonviolent crimes and won’t go on toreceive custodial sentences. To put this display of toughness down to political posturing to mask a broken justice system would be speculative. What’s certain is that there have been cuts across the prison estate since 2012,resulting inovercrowding, understaffing, inexperienced staff and inhumane conditions.As Labour touts more brutal cuts to benefits, how is this different from life under the Tories? | Frances RyanRead moreWe know all that, but we’re failing to articulate the obvious: the fundamental precept of the state’s intervention in a private life is that welfare is paramount. That intervention may also be punitive, but not since Victorian times has prison been understood as punishment alone. If the government, under any circumstance, poses an active threat to your welfare, that alters the contract. Prisoners, having broken the contract already, are always the last to be heard on this (though bear in mind the point about remand – many of these women will be found not guilty).Academics David Walsh and Gerry McCartney, inSocial Murder? Austerity and Life Expectancy in the UK, explore in data and case studies the idea that policies might be causing life-threatening harm to people’s lives. They start with the data – again, it won’t come as a big surprise. Between 2014 and 2018, life expectancy, after decades of continual improvement,stopped increasingacross the UK. In some parts of the population – for instance, the poorest 20% in Glasgow –premature death increasedby between 6% and 7%.The authors then look at various policies, through a series of case studies – the changes to disability benefits and privatised work capability assessments are illustrated with the death by suicide of aprofoundly depressed manwho was found fit to work by Atos. It’s not at all complicated, tracking how cuts to local authority social care budgets, combined with more and more stringent access to personal independence payments (Pip), might lead to malnutrition, nor how the bedroom tax might cause deaths of despair – the case of one woman who killed herself after debts accrued because she had a spare room after her 16-year-old son also killed himself isbreathtakingly sad.The UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Professor Philip Alston, said of austerity afterhis visit to the UKin 2018, that “the bottom line is that much of the glue that has held British society together since the second world war has been deliberately removed and replaced with a harsh and uncaring ethos”.Which, again, we knew. But there’s something blocking the next step in this debate, almost as if we don’t want to let that next foot fall: what is your relationship with a state that doesn’t care? Is the phrase “welfare state” now wrong? Do we have to find some other way to describe such statutory provision that has not been dismantled? The concept of nations being “developing” or “developed” is understood; in the first your welfare is haphazardly overseen by a community, before reaching the nirvana of the second, in which your welfare is assured by government. But how do we understand and orientate towards a state that is developing backwards? It feels like some bizarre politeness, or a collective aversion to drama, that keeps us debating policy and society as though our welfare were paramount to it, when that is observably no longer true.Meanwhile, the Labour MPs of the “red wall”, the very seats where these life expectancy impacts of austerity and its aftermath are most obvious, call upon their leader to talktougher on immigration– as if that’s what’s driving the Reform UK vote; as if foreigners are what’s poisoning the well. It’s as if they don’t want to understand where voters’ anger is coming from, don’t want to consider its legitimacy. And yet they must. Or their politics, if you could call it that, will be swept away.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

The truth of that old piece of wisdom was demonstrated on Thursday as the FTSE 100 went on a rip-roaring run – up 104 points, or 1.2%, to a new closing high of 8,727 – while theBank of Englandcut interest rates because the UK economy was flat on its back.The point always to remember about the Footsie is that its constituents are an international crew, or at least they operate internationally. Goldman Sachs’ analysts calculated recently that, in aggregate, only 22% of the revenues ofFTSE100 companies were generated in the UK. North America, at 29%, and the Asia-Pacific region, at 23%, are more important. Think of the likes of index heavyweights AstraZeneca, BP, GSK and Shell: their UK revenue exposures are measured in low single-digit percentages.Thus if lower UK interest rates also mean a lower pound – and sterling fell almost a cent against the US dollar asthe Bank cut by a quarter-point to 4.5%– there is a straightforward translational effect. Earnings made in dollars are suddenly worth slightly more in terms of sterling-denominated share prices. Those companies exporting from the UK also become marginally more competitive.There are probably also other factors at play. If it is now more likely that UK interest rates will be 4% by the end of year (and possibly a notch lower, according to market prices), the plumpish dividend yield on the Footsie starts to look positively fat. It is 3.4%. Throw in share buybacks, companies’ other way to distribute earnings, and the dividend yield is in effect even higher.Those statistics reinforce another point that analysts have been making for ages: the UK stock market looks cheap versus its international peers. “Comparing valuation to profitability, the UK is one of the cheapest regions in the world,” said the fund manager Fidelity International at the start of this year.Rate cut can lift mood but Bank’s forecasts are unambiguously bleakRead moreAt the time, Goldman’s calculations showed the UK stocks as a whole priced at 11.9 times expected earnings, compared with 22.9 times for the US market. Yes, as everybody knows, the US picture is distorted by the huge and richly valued “magnificent seven” tech stocks – the likes of Apple and the chipmaker Nvidia. But, even when big tech was removed from the sums, the US market was still on 19.9 times, way above the UK.Then there are recent market-moving events. Investors are starting to fret about the solidity of the seven at current valuation if a chatbot out of Chinacan knock 17% off Nvidia’s share price in a day. The Footsie, previously derided as Jurassic on account of its overrepresentation of boring banks and commodity stocks, can suddenly be viewed as a way to add safety and diversity to a portfolio. And that 29% exposure to North America still provides lots of exposure to a hot US economy without the hard-to-value AI bits.Then there’s a crucial factor in the background: tariffs. It is possible to believe the UK will be out of Donald Trump’s firing line because it has a trade deficit in goods with the US, unlike the European Union where German carmakers and others may become the president’s targets. Again, the possible advantage is strictly relative – nobody truly wins in a trade war – but they all count.None of the above should provide any consolation to Rachel Reeves. The first mission of the mission-led government was to “kickstart economic growth” and the Bank has halved its forecast for GDP growth in 2025 to just 0.75%.There are no positives for the chancellor there, especially if spending cuts have to follow. It’s just that the Footsie is not the economy.Explore more on these topicsFTSENils Pratley on financeStock marketsEconomic growth (GDP)Bank of EnglandInterest ratesRachel ReevesEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

But this time looks to be different. In his opening weeks, the US president has taken a flurry of actions he never attempted before, wieldingsweeping tariffsagainst the US’s neighbors, upending portions of thefederal workforce, and attempting to change constitutionally enshrinedcitizenship laws through executive order.The early signs on foreign policy are no exception. In hisinaugural address, Trump said next to nothing about the issues that have dominated US foreign policy for decades – matters of war and peace in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Instead, he spoke of expanding US territory in the western hemisphere (and going to Mars), harking back explicitly to the 19th-century tradition of manifest destiny. Astoundingly, Trump mentioned China solely for the purpose ofaccusing it, inaccurately,of operating the Panama canal. When he turned beyond the Americas, Trump’s most telling line signaled restraint: “We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end – and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.”I didn’t think Trump’s second act would be that bad. Oh, how wrong I was | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThenMarco Rubio, the secretary of state, made even more pointed and intriguing remarks. Rubio ran for president in 2016 vowing to usher in a “new American century”, the mantra of post-cold war neoconservatives. But days ago, sitting for hisfirst lengthy interviewas America’s chief diplomat, he emphasized the need for a foreign policy grounded in the US national interest and said:“So it’s not normal for the world to simply have a unipolar power. That was not – that was an anomaly. It was a product of the end of the cold war, but eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet. We face that now with China and to some extentRussia, and then you have rogue states like Iran and North Korea you have to deal with.”For a US secretary of state to announce that the world is now “multipolar”, or is inevitably heading in that direction, is historically significant. Hillary Clinton also used the m-word in 2009 at the start of her tenure in the same role, but she invoked it less than affirmatively: Clintonprofesseda desire to move “away from a multipolar world and toward a multipartner world”. Rubio, by contrast, meant that a world of multiple poles or powers is to be accepted, not resisted. He also implied that US foreign policy had long been off course, having taken unrivaled American dominance to be a normal or necessary condition when in fact it was destined todisappear. At the end of the cold war, Rubio explained: “We were the only power in the world, and so we assumed this responsibility of sort of becoming the global government in many cases, trying to solve every problem.”The message: no longer.Still, no longer could lead down any number of roads. Read against theTrump administration’s Americas-centric start, Rubio’s comments have provoked dread – or excitement, depending on the perspective – that the United States will radically reduce its political-military role beyond the western hemisphere even as it asserts its power within the Americas.For traditional figures in Washington, the fear is that Trump 2.0 will give China and Russia a free hand to command “spheres of influence” in their regions, so long as they permit the United States to police its own sphere. For advocates of US restraint overseas, the hope is that Trump will deliver on his promises to end the wars inUkraineand the Middle East, shift more responsibility for defending Europe on to the shoulders of European allies, and seek to find a stable if competitive mode of coexistence with China. If Rubio thinks the world is now multipolar, presumably it follows that the United States should abandon the approach it pursued in the bygone age of unipolarity – a grand strategy of “primacy” or “hegemony”, as scholars call it.No one is safe from Trump’s racist agenda | Bakari T SellersRead morePerhaps. Rubio, though, was not nearly so conclusive. Throughout the interview, he referred to the governments in Moscow and Beijing in adversarial terms, which hardly suggest a willingness to grant them spheres of influence. Nor is there a straight line from acknowledging the loss of unipolarity to abandoning primacy. Even in a crowded, competitive landscape, the United States could try to remain militarily stronger than every rival, retain all its globe-spanning defense commitments, and maintain a large troop presence in Asia, Europe and the Middle East simultaneously. Those are the elements of primacy. Rubio did not renounce any of them. The United States, in short, could still pursue primacy without enjoying unipolarity.Indeed, in associating multipolarity with the existence of “multi-great powers”, Rubio may have meant to affirm the outlook of the firstTrump administration, which adopted “great power competition” as a watchword. For Trump 1.0, as for the Biden administration that followed, the rise of China and the assertion of Russia did not compel Washington to pare back its military commitments and presence. Quite the contrary. Over the two presidencies, Nato enlarged to four new countries, the US military presence in the Middle East (excluding Afghanistan) remained stable, and the United States deepened security cooperation with Ukraine, Taiwan and others.So far, the appearance of formidable rivals has done less to discipline US ambitions than to furnish US global primacy with a new rationale – to stand up to the aggressive and revisionist activities of America’s adversaries. As Rubio put it: “China wants to be the most powerful country in the world and they want to do so at our expense, and that’s not in our national interest, and we’re going to address it.”But Rubio did signal more restraint than a continuation of business as usual. Just after his remarks on multipolarity, he noted that the second world war ended 80 years ago and that “if you look at the scale and scope of destruction and loss of life that occurred, it would be far worse if we had a global conflict now.” Since the end of the cold war, US leaders have invoked the second world war almost exclusively to exhort the country to lead the world. Rubio, by contrast, did so to caution against the dangers of overreach. He continued:“You have multiple countries now who have the capability to end life on Earth. And so we need to really work hard to avoid armed conflict as much as possible, but never at the expense of our national interest. So that’s the tricky balance.”Quite so. In recent years, the risk of conflict between major powers hasgrown acute. The war in Ukraine – in which one major power is fighting directly on its borders and the other heavily arming its opponent – had no parallel during the cold war. A US-China military conflict over Taiwan would be ruinous. In a country unused to paying noticeable costs for foreign policy choices, and a world that no longer remembers the last general war, Rubio delivered a salutary message.The Guardian view on Donald Trump’s power grab: a coup veiled by chaos | EditorialRead moreThe policy test, however, is still to come. If the new administration is serious about avoiding catastrophic wars, without exposing core US interests to great power predation, it will make a determined, sustained diplomatic effort to end the war in Ukraine and minimize the risks of escalation if initial talks do not succeed. It will explore politically difficult ways to reach a modus vivendi with China, including by offering assurances that the United States does not seek to keep Taiwan permanently separate from the mainland, a red line for Beijing.The new administration’s opening moves suggest some intention to find a more sustainable and less confrontational approach toward the world’s major powers. But if unipolarity is dead, the lure of primacy remains very much alive.Stephen Wertheim is a senior fellow in the American statecraft program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School and Catholic UniversityExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsMarco RubioRepublicansUS foreign policyChinacommentShareReuse this content"

But there is too much gloss, when so many people are still sufferingThu 6 Feb 2025 08.42 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 11.16 ESTShareNow she’s an opera. Yet another myth-making apotheosis lifts Margaret Thatcher to iconic realms, crafting for her an image recalling Elizabeth I. Historian Dominic Sandbrook is writing the libretto of her story, as one Thatcher tribute act trips over the next. This week sawJames Graham’s Brian and Maggiedrama about an interview that helped tip her towards her downfall. Next week, Radio 4 brings usWhen Larry met Maggie, Tim Walker’s play imagining scenes when Laurence Olivier coached the ingenue education secretary in the art of wooing and even seducing audiences.This week marksthe 50th anniversary of Thatcher’s electionas leader of her party. I started counting but lost track of the myriad actors who have played her, some of the greatest of our time.Harriet Walter was magnificent, as ever. So wereGillian AndersonandMeryl Streep.Lesley Manvillewas just as fine, as wasPatricia Hodge, and I’m sure Frances Barber will be next week in Walker’s radio play. None but royalty of stage and screen are fit to play her.Many writers of these dramas are just as excellent, magnetically drawn time and again to delve into the nature of the leader who made herself a legend. Like Elizabeth I, she styled herself into the embodiment of an emblem, with the big gold hair, pussy bows, sculpted shoulders, well-trained deepened voice using words by her playwright speech writer, crafted into an image instantly recognisable from afar.The problem is that good writers and good actors will produce a human drama of depth, subtlety and intelligence in a character, if flawed, an audience must feel for. That’s what a work of imagination requires. Writers will instinctively lean into her well-polished creation as the almost rags-to-riches grocer’s daughter above the shop in Grantham, the many rejections to get selected for seats, the snobbery and sexism of her party’s grandees, who she triumphed over to sweep them to three great victories. But she was not quite such a ground-breaker as the daughter of a very typical Tory alderman, while her marriage to a multimillionaire greatly spurred on her political career. The man she ousted as leader,Edward Heath, came from a humbler background: the son of a maid and a carpenter who, after Ramsgate grammar and fighting in the second world war, knew rather more of the working classes than she did.Each piece of her life story has been honed into a drama, usually compelling: I watch them all with fascination. But plays can’t really do the stuff of politics: drama likes the rows, contests, defeats and conquests, but political issues are dry terrain, rapidly passed over for spicier themes. The inevitable result is that even astute and politically savvy writers such as James Graham end up whitewashing what Thatcher and her politics actually did to Britain. This 50-year marker comes at a melancholy time when her actions are rebounding on the country with a vengeance. Polls show the policies she was most famed for are those most voters now bitterly regret. Let’s look at her legacy.View image in fullscreenMargaret Thatcher at Wistow colliery, Selby, in 1980.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe one that most upends her claims to a grocer’s daughter’s thrift is her squandering of North Sea oil proceeds that came onstream just as she arrived in No 10. After too-cheap privatisation, she spent the tax income;had she saved like Norway, her bequest would be a sovereign wealth fund of hundreds of billions.She inherited a countrymoving markedly towards economic equality, but her 1980s policies caused top pay and wealth to soar, while the bottom deciles fell back. Inequality has stayed at that high level ever since. Her “big bang” blew the lid off grotesque financial earnings, meaning fortunes for a few, rather than economic stability. Savaging the unions,she caused a sharp drop in wages’ share of GDP. Industry and manufacturing were downgraded. Winning the bitter battle with the miners, due to NUM leader Arthur Scargill’s tragic mishandling, was not enough: she punished mining communities, leaving them to rot without other industry or training, leaving social scars that are still deep 40 years on.Other parties envied her popular sale of council homes to tenants at knock-down prices as a stroke of political genius to propel her property-owning democracy. Now with 2m council homes sold, many owned by landlords charging astronomical rents,home ownership in England has fallen from 71%at its peak to 65%, moving further from reach of young renters, with the country trapped in a housing crisis.Who now would celebrate her privatisations of water, energy, Britoil and a host of public goods at well below market price? A total of£5bn in water debts was written off, with natural monopolies never constrained by weak regulators. Railways were privatised by her successor, following her creed. All this failure on an epic scale has taken decades and serial bankruptcies to acknowledge.Bus privatisation outside London led to a welter of companies cutting routes and pay, higher fares, fewer buses and fewer people riding them. She may not actually have saidanyone on a bus aged more than 26is a failure, but that summarised her attitude.Outsourcing all manual and much administrative work from national and local authorities was done by her fiat. Lower pay and conditions were the only way the likes of Serco and Capita could profit from taking on these services, another motor driving inequality.The1982 Falklands war saved her from the lowest ever polling for a prime minister. It was a majestic success to send a flotilla to the other end of the earth and vanquish what looked like a powerfully armed Argentine dictator. However, praise for her recklessness is like applauding a child for surviving running across a road.The poll tax that brought her down was not an aberration, but sprang from a profound belief in flat taxes, as she cut top tax rates. That idea of equal taxes she had wisely kept in check until then.Most of these things inevitably slide away from plays and films. There’s a risk they will slip from national memory, as Conservative thinktanks, such as Policy Exchange, reminisce this anniversary week about “her philosophy and vision … her courage”. They can’t claim economic success for her except for the rich, with no improved national productivity.Lest we forget, the things she did are doing us immeasurable harm right now. She is not history and certainly not entertainment. She is the unfortunate lived present.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMargaret ThatcherOpinionConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

Sudan’s military, which launched a major offensive against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in September, made swift progress in Gezira state, and in recent days has abruptly and unexpectedlyregained groundin Khartoum.Whether it has truly turned the tide – as key backers appear to believe – has yet to be seen. Even if the capital can be fully retaken and secured, reconstructing thedevastated citywould be an immense task. The RSF might well entrench themselves elsewhere; this may further spur their ferocity in the western region of Darfur. Meaningful negotiations between the warring parties look even more distant. There is still less prospect of a return to civilian politics,overthrownin a coup by the partnership of the army chief, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF leader, Lt Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo – known as Hemedti – before they turned on each other.It is hard to fully capture the brutality of that shift from hopes of a brighter future to the horror of this conflict. Atrocities have been committed by both sides, but especially the RSF, with the USformally declaringthat they have committed genocide in Darfur – as their progenitors, the Janjaweed militias, did two decades ago.Yet the international community’s indifference to the suffering of Sudanese civilians is also deeply shocking. With its gaze fixed on the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, it has largely ignored what António Guterres, the UN secretary general, has described as “a nightmare of violence, hunger, disease and displacement”. Half of Sudan’s population – almost 25 million people – facehigh levels of acute food insecurity, with a third of those facing an emergency or famine-like situation.Both the warring parties have used the denial or destruction of food as a weapon. But this is not just about the problems of delivery. The UN’s humanitarian appeal remains appallingly underfunded. Sudanese people who have fled to Ethiopia, Chad, South Sudan and Ugandaare receivingonly 30%-60% of a full food ration. No one expects help from the new US administration – Elon Musk’s announcement of the shutdown of USAid has seen crucial drugsabandoned in Sudanese warehouses. But many other countries are failing Sudan too. Multiple parties havefed the conflagrationto further their own interests. Too few want to deal with the consequences.Already there are growing concerns that the war could capsize South Sudan. Though the fragile 2018 truce has so far held in the world’s newest nation, Sudan’s conflict has brought hundreds of thousands of refugees, soaring food prices and a devastating, months-longhalt to oil exports, which account for 80%-90% of the government budget. There is also mountingunease about Chad. The Chadian government’s alliance with the United Arab Emirates, which backs the RSF, has caused anger, and there are worries that the influx of refugees may be destabilising intercommunal relations.Sudan’s location – between the Sahara, the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and the Red Sea – means that what happens within its borders has profound implications beyond them. Even if Europe would prefer to pretend that this crisis is not happening, it is also desperate to limit migration and contain the growth and impact ofviolent extremism in the Sahel. To ignore this catastrophe is not only inhumane but, even in terms of self-interest, unwise.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How would you react to that news? Quite probably with disbelief and the suspicion that it was fake news. Very likely with outrage. And maybe also with a frisson of fear. Possibly a mix of all three. After all, a thing like that isn’t supposed to happen in a settled democracy like ours, is it?Except that this week it really did happen. It was even announced in parliament. It took place whenAngela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and communities secretary,decreedthat nine English local authorities, where council elections had been due to take place as usual this year on the time-honoured first Thursday in May, would not now go to the polls after all.This is a serious blow to democracy. It is not mitigated by the fact that previous governments have sometimes done something similar. Though it has been stripped of many powers and starved of cash over the years, local government is well embedded. It has powers and legitimacy. Local elections can change lives on issues ranging from schools to care. If nothing else, their results are also minutely scrutinised by experts likeSir John Curticefor what they say about the political mood of the nation more widely.Ms Rayner’s reason for stopping the 2025 elections is that she is midway through reforming the structure of local government in England. In December, she told England’s existing patchwork of council, district and unitary councilsto recast itselfinto a more orderly pattern of single-tier authorities, each with an electorate of around half a million voters, to be headed by elected mayors.Elections will still go ahead on 1 May this year in many places, including 14 of England’s 21 county councils. The cancelled elections will eventually occur in May 2026, once the new authorities are in place, and on the same day as the next Scottish parliament and Welsh Senedd elections. Yet the cancelled elections this year are hardly minor; they include heavily populated places like Essex (home to around 1.5 million people), Hampshire (1.4 million) and Norfolk (900,000). Unsurprisingly, the parties that were set to do well there this year, like the Liberal Democrats and Reform UK, are crying foul.There is an undoubted case for Labour’s changes. England is far too centralised. Local government is too weak. Successive reforms have left it too much of a jumble. But Ms Rayner’s new, moreNapoleonicstructure is not a cure-all. It will be hobbled from the start unless local government finance is reformed. Rachel Reeves’srecent decisionto change the Treasury’s “green book” public investment rules will certainly help, especially in the north. But it is only a first step.The crucial question is whether Ms Rayner is seriously willing to work with other political parties in the nations, regions and localities. The results of the devolved elections, when they finally take place in 2026, may pose this question very starkly, especially if Reform UK and the Scottish National party emerge among the winners. Ms Rayner sometimes sounds as if she sees English devolution merely as a means to deliverLabourgovernment policies at the local level. But this is an unsustainably rigid approach. If local government is seen simply as a Whitehall delivery agent and not as a legitimate, sometimes alternative and oppositional expression of local difference, Ms Rayner’s changes risk going the way of earlier efforts and withering on the vine.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Oh, how wrong I was, 5 February). My teenage daughter begging me to take shooting lessons “so we have protection because you are an immigrant”, and asking me “What if they take away your citizenship? Does that mean they will take mine away too?”, ended that feeling pretty quickly. I explained to her that it was very hard to “denaturalise” a citizen and that I would never be buying a firearm (at least I hope I don’t feel forced into this).I live and work in a small city with lots of refugees, immigrants and international students, and we are all scared. I am now carrying my US passport and social security card with me everywhere I go. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been here, and the Department of Justice is already threatening to prosecute a local sheriff.The first Trump term was traumatic, but now the wheels are well and truly off the bus and we are careening down a steep cliff. That a non-elected billionaire is running around DC with seemingly unchecked power, aformer reality show personalityis in charge of transportation, awoman with zero educational credentialswill be confirmed as education secretary anda man with zero healthcare experiencewill be making decisions about the health and wellbeing of all Americans should instil fear and anger in us all.The Democrats have once again shown themselves to be spineless, the majority having caved to the whims of this narcissist and his cabal of maniacs and sycophants.Joanne KennedyLansing, New York, USWith Donald Trump withdrawing the United States from theWorld Health Organization, the Paris climate agreement, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) and its main agency serving Palestinians, Unrwa, and with the dismantling of USAid, the US has effectively resigned its role as world leader.The question for those of us living in countries with no hope (or desire) to replace the US is whether this is the declaration of a job vacancy or a voluntary redundancy presaging a restructuring.If the former, there is only one candidate: China. If the latter, countries with significant diplomatic capability and soft power need to start creating a vision of a multipolar future that gives due weight to southern hemisphere countries that have had their voices drowned out. Every threat is also an opportunity.Paul SawbridgeEaling, LondonAs a Canadian expat, may I ask where is the Commonwealth’s support for Canada in the midst of these trade threats (Trump agrees to postpone Canada and Mexico tariffs by one month, 3 February)? The Commonwealth bangs on about how relevant and vital it is, but hasn’t said boo about the tariffs or the taunts to annex Canada. Like everyone else, it is sucking up to Donald Trump.Jane BraithwaiteBristolIn light of this week’s news (UN chief warns against ‘ethnic cleansing’ after Trump’s Gaza proposal, 5 February), with fear and loathing regarding Trump’s interests, I remember this headline from the Guardian on 19 March 2024: “Jared Kushner says Gaza’s ‘waterfront property could be very valuable’.”Susan OhanianCharlotte, Vermont, USHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus, a letter byProf Katherine SleemanThu 6 Feb 2025 13.01 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 13.04 ESTShareI believe the voluntary assisted dying (VAD) practitioner who Gaby Hinsliff refers to as “evangelising” about how well the system works in Australia is my daughter, Dr Clare Fellingham (How do we introduce assisted dying? Experts and politicians hope someone else has the answer, 31 January). This does her, and her fellow witnesses, a grave disservice. They were asked to give evidence of the development, implementation and practice of VAD in their respective states, which they did.They gave the committee facts, not faith; experience, not opinion. Any “evangelising” would have been for those at the end of life to have the choice to die with dignity at a time of their choosing. It is vital to remember that VAD as proposed in Kim Leadbeater’s bill is only available to those who are terminally ill. Their choice is not between living and dying, but dying and dying.My daughter believes that palliative care and VAD are branches of the same tree, as do I. I have worked with those at the end of their life as a lay volunteer both in a hospice environment and in hospital. Both are rooted in the compassionate determination to relieve suffering, and the importance – for the dying and those who love them – of a good death.Lyn DadeTwickenham, LondonLast week, the assisted dying bill committee heardevidencefrom almost 50 experts over three days. Rather than providing clarity, the sessions revealed complexity and uncertainty, and fundamental questions remain unanswered. Will assisted dying be an NHS service? What drugs will be used, and are they safe and effective? Is feeling a burden a valid reason for having an assisted death? Can the Mental Capacity Act operate as the framework for consent? Would the judicial safeguard make this law more safe or just more cumbersome?Experts highlighted potential risks of this bill for minoritised ethnic groups, for people with mental illness and for disabled people. Some indicated that a small number of wrongful deaths might be a price worth paying. We are told by the bill’s supporters that this would be the safest assisted dying law in the world. But empirical evidence to back up that assertion is lacking. Perhaps the most important question for MPs and society to grapple with is: “How safe is safe enough?”Prof Katherine SleemanKing’s College LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

So the first time I tell them how to bring the ball out from the back against a 7-9-11 press, they were maybe like: ‘OK.’ But the more times you face them, the more it becomes natural for you.Liverpool sweep Tottenham aside to book Carabao Cup final with NewcastleRead more“The more games you play, the more team meetings you have, the more training sessions you have, the better they know what we expect from them and what to expect from each other.“Second of all, I believe in the fact that the more games you play the physically stronger you become. Some people think you get tired but as long as you manage it well, the players will get stronger by playing a lot of games instead of getting tired.”Liverpool were remorseless against a Spurs team who were unable to show who they were, to play with any aggression or personality. The visitors managed only five shots – none of them on target. “Tottenham are always able to score a lot and create a lot,” Slot said. “That they didn’t tells you a lot about our work rate. We showed our mentality from the first to the last second.”Ange Postecoglou continues to live under immense pressure; a route to silverware now closed off, his team struggling in 14th place in the Premier League. “We didn’t give ourselves a chance to take the opportunity which is probably more disappointing,” the Spurs manager said. “I would have liked us to play more like who we are. There is a lesson in there for us that if we veer away from that it almost becomes impossible for us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His last England start in the No 15 jersey came in the2023 World Cup bronze-medal matchvictory over Argentina but he played all but seven minutes of last year’s defeat by France, coming off the bench after an early injury to George Furbank and catching the eye on the counterattack.France are odds-on favourites to storm Twickenham again, having clinchedan emphatic 53-10 victorytwo years ago, but given their tendency to kick from deep, there is method to Borthwick’s selectorial gamble which he has been weighing up for some time.Quick GuideEngland v France: the teamsShowEnglandM Smith; Freeman, Lawrence, Slade, Sleightholme; F Smith, Mitchell; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Stuart, Itoje (capt), Martin, T Curry, Earl, Willis.Replacements: George, Baxter, Heyes, Chessum, Cunningham-South, B Curry, Randall, Daly.FranceRamos; Penaud, Barassi, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Jalibert, Dupont (capt); Gros, Mauvaka, Atonio, Roumat, Meafou, Cros, Boudehent, Alldritt.Replacements: Marchand, Baille, Colombe, Auradou, Guillard, Jegou, Le Garrec, Gailleton.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I think he is a gamechanger. He’s a player who can do things very few of the players in the world can do,” said Borthwick of Marcus. “And I want him to bring all those natural instincts on to the field in an England shirt. I want those natural instincts on the pitch. He sees space that other players don’t. He has an ability to find gaps in defences that most people don’t know are there.“I was chatting with Marcus last night and he was tremendously excited about the game on Saturday. He was excited about the feeling of playing with Fin Smith. We trained together on Tuesday and then reviewed that training session and reviewed what they did together. He was feeling really exhilarated about the opportunities of those two ball players and the space they could find and the space they were trying to look for.“If you look at the way Marcus plays, particularly in those unstructured situations, you see how dangerous he is. If you give him time and space, he can hurt the opposition.“You could talk a lot about Fin’s distribution skills, which are excellent. His kicking game is really very, very accurate. Early this season, we had Fin at 30 tackles in a game for Northampton. It tells you a lot about the personality – he’s tough, he’s brave. When players see a fly-half willing to defend like that, they have immense respect for him. So we can talk all about those different skill sets, which he certainly has, he’s an elite player, but he’s also a very tough, brave young man.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His side can heap the pressure on Borthwick, however, with England facing their worst ever losing run againstSix Nationsand Rugby Championship sides if they are defeated again on Saturday.“There is always expectation,” added Borthwick. “Any of the main English sports there is expectation to win – cricket, football, rugby – there is expectation and when you take the job you expect that expectation. I would rather be involved with a team that has expectation than one that doesn’t.”Borthwick has handed a first start to Tom Willis, with Ben Curry dropping to the bench, while Ollie Sleightholme replaces the injured Cadan Murley on the wing. Jamie George is named on the bench for a first appearance since he was stripped of the England captaincy. Freddie Steward is not in the match-day 23.Meanwhile, Borthwick has said that Immanuel Feyi-Waboso could be back for the end of the Six Nations after he opted to forgo surgery on a dislocated shoulder. When announcing his squad last month, Borthwick had said the Exeter winger would be having surgery in the coming days and be unavailable for the entire competition. His Exeter director of rugby, Rob Baxter, had previously said that the fact that Feyi-Waboso has been awarded an enhanced England contract, giving Borthwick “final say” on sports science matters, was slowing the entire process down.“I think there is a possibility he’ll be back before the end of the Six Nations,” said Borthwick. “And I’d love him to be back before the end of this Six Nations. We talk about players with pace, power, skill … it depends how things progress, but he’s going well so far. Ultimately, [surgery is] a player’s decision, it’s always the player’s decision. And we are supportive of the player’s decision. I think Manny is in charge of that process.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamFrance rugby union teamSix Nations 2025Six NationsRugby unionSteve BorthwicknewsShareReuse this content"

It was a nice moment for us to celebrate,” said Taylor. “The performance tonight really deserved that. We showed good character.”Khadija Shaw pulls out of Manchester City match after receiving abuseRead moreFowler’s first-half strike was cancelled out by Mariona Caldentey’s penalty in the second before Arsenal’s goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar saved a Fowler spot-kick two minutes after the home team had scored the equaliser. The game had looked destined for extra time, but Fowler’s bobbling effort five minutes into added time wrongfooted Van Domselaar and inflicted Arsenal’s second defeat under Renée Slegers, who said her side had had “not enough end product on the attacks”.There is no love lost between Arsenal and City. Chloe Kelly sat in the stands for Arsenal after her deadline-day loan move from City a reflection of that, following an acrimonious end to her time in Manchester, with Laura Wienroither also unable to play in the fixture having moved the opposite way on loan.There was confusion at Meadow Park as the clock ticked closer to the scheduled kick-off time of 7pm, players returning for a second warm-up as news filtered round that the start time had been pushed back by 15 minutes and then a further 15 due to a broken-down ambulance leaving the ground short of medical support.Despite the delay and eagerness to get going there was a caginess to the opening exchanges, neither side wanting to give much away early on, with the Gunners having sucker-punched City twice in the first eight minutes of Sunday’s Women’s Super League match which the Gunners won 4-3 in Manchester.“I was expecting this to be a game of fewer goals, because I think both teams were unhappy with the chances and goals conceded on Sunday,” said Slegers afterwards.View image in fullscreenMary Fowler receives the adulation of her teammates after opening the scoring.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersThis fixture was a chance for City to quickly exorcise the ghost of the frenetic defeat at the weekend. The visiting team drew first blood, with the former Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema providing the impetus, the WSL record goalscorer driving through the middle on a counterattack before playing the ball to Fowler to her right to fire beyond Van Domselaar.There was a notable absence for City, with Khadija Shaw, who was a second-half substitute in Manchester, absent entirely, having withdrawn from the squad to protect her mental wellbeing after she was subjected to racist and misogynistic abuse after the league match with Arsenal.City kept the pressure on in the second half, twice rattling the bar in quick succession, first from a ­Kerolin cross, then via a ferocious Aoba Fujino strike, but they failed to capitalise on their dominance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With Arsenal, the holders, in the ascendancy, Stina Blackstenius was released but was clipped in the box by Rebecca Knaak and Caldentey slotted in from the spot. The decision “looked a bit harsh”, said Taylor, with Knaak having got a touch on the ball before she connected with the Swedish forward.There was a chance for instant retribution when Fowler was muscled down between Kyra Cooney-Cross and Lotte Wubben-Moy but the Australia international’s spot-kick was straight down the middle and palmed away by Van Domselaar to the delight of the anxious home crowd.They would not be left ruing the miss, though, with Fowler stepping up to score her fourth goal in two games against Arsenal and send City through to the final.“I haven’t played in a final yet with the girls, so it’ll be a new feeling for me here,” said the goalscorer. “We’re ready for it, and I’m just super pumped for it.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballArsenal WomenManchester City WomennewsShareReuse this content"

The club’s Ratcliffe-led football department informed Amorim the ­position would not be open in the close ­season. Given this he was asked if the board accepted performances could become even poorer.Manchester United confirm Lisandro Martínez has cruciate ligament injuryRead moreAmorim said: “It’s a little bit harder for me to cope with that [poorer results] than the board, because the board already knows [what might happen under him]. I explained all the risks. Everything that has happened I explained to the board [before taking over], and they said the same thing: ‘We need to start now’ [him take the job].“But I understand at this moment, with a lot of losses, especially at home, the environment is really hard, but I feel the support of the board, if you’re asking that. I’m not the slightest bit worried about that, it’s just the pain of losing that is the hardest thing to cope with.”In the winter windowMarcus Rashford was loaned to Aston Villaafter Amorim refused to select him for six weeks. He was asked if the forward plays well under Unai Emery, Villa’s manager, if this would reflect badly on him as a coach.“As a journalist or a fan, you can take this in the way that you want,” the manager said. “What I say is I couldn’t put Marcus to see the way you’re supposed to play football and to train the way I see it. And sometimes you have one player who is really good with one coach and the same player with another coach is different.

Littler played down the row before the match, saying: “He’s not wrong, I was late. I did get a little telling off.”Van Gerwen carved out a 5-3 lead over Littler with two breaks of throw but wobbled at the finish line, almost allowing his opponent to snatch the win before holding throw in the 11th and final leg.Humphries, who lost to Littler in last year’s Premier League final, launched his campaign with a 6-2 defeat of Nathan Aspinall. In their semi-final, Van Gerwen outscored Humphries but was erratic on doubles, missing 11 including a match dart on the bullseye. By contrast, his opponent was clinical, landing 140 and 120 checkouts before holding his nerve in a deciding leg to edge through 6-5. “I was very fortunate,” Humphries admitted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At a ­cricketing level, when women’s and girls’ cricket is growing rapidly around the world, it is heartbreaking that those growing up in Afghanistan are denied this opportunity, but the appalling oppression of women and girls by the Taliban goes so much further.“The board recognises there are different views and opinions on the issue of boycotting the match and has listened carefully. We have been in close contact with the government, the International Cricket Council, our England men’s players and other stakeholders to discuss this matter, as well as considering how best the ECB can support those women cricketers who have fled Afghanistan.“Following this, we remain of the view that a coordinated international response by the cricketing community is the appropriate way forward, and will achieve more than any unilateral action by the ECB in boycotting this match. We have also heard that for many ordinary Afghans watching their cricket team is one of the few remaining sources of enjoyment. As such, we can confirm that we will play this fixture.”While Afghanistan are the only ICC full member not to run a programme for women’s cricket, recent diplomatic dialogue between the Indian government and the Taliban – talks that reportedly included strengthening sporting ties – means their removal from cricket’s top table is unlikely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The defeat left Inter in second place on 51 points, three behind the leaders, Napoli, andFiorentinamoved up to fourth on 42 points, above Lazio on goal difference.The original match on 1 December was suspended when Fiorentina’sEdoardo Bove collapsed on the pitchand was taken to hospital, and the game restarted at 0-0 in the 17th minute with a Fiorentina throw-in.Fiorentina were under the cosh early on, with David de Gea parrying a shot from Lautaro Martínez and Carlos Augusto having a goal chalked off for offside, but the two best chances of the opening half fell to the hosts – a Kean header and a shot dragged wide.Inter struggled to get forward and create any real openings early in the second half, and Fiorentina took a deserved lead from a corner in the 59th minute. Luca Ranieri arrived from outside the area, getting to the ball ahead of Davide Frattesi, and hit his shot first time low into the corner.There was little in the way of response from Inter, and Fiorentina doubled their lead nine minutes later. Dodô crossed from the right and Kean pulled away from his marker before powering a header into the bottom corner, this time leaving Sommer with no chance.With time running out, and an Inter comeback looking unlikely, Fiorentina wrapped up the win in the 89th minute, the goal coming from a Federico Dimarco howler. The defender hit a back-pass without looking and Kean was there to capitalise, and with the keeper in no man’s land, the striker finished with aplomb to net his 15th league goal of the season and end Inter’s 17-game unbeaten run in the league.Inter will have the chance for revenge when the sides meet again on Monday at San Siro. “Congratulations to Fiorentina. It’s a deserved defeat, we didn’t put anything on the field between running, aggression and determination,” said the Inter manager, Simone Inzaghi.“Now is not the time to make dramas but it is a defeat that hurts for how it came and how it has matured,” Inzaghi told Dazn. “Now we will have three and a half days before meeting Fiorentina again. Today we didn’t put on the field what we always put in … only work can get us out of this situation.”Ferran Torres scored a hat-trick in the first 30 minutes to lead an imperiousBarcelonato a 5-0 rout ofValenciain theCopa del Reyquarter-finals. Playing in his home town against his childhood club, Torres scored from a quick counterattack in the second minute and extended the lead in the 17th minute when he fired home a rebound from a Lamine Yamal strike that ricocheted off the post.View image in fullscreenFerran Torres smashes in to seal his hat-trick and make it 4-0 to Barcelona against Valencia.Photograph: Ana Escobar/EPAFermín López scored the third in another counter five minutes later and Torres gave Barça a four-goal lead on the half-hour mark with a strike from the edge of the box. The visitors took their foot off the gas after the break but Yamal still added a fifth goal in the 52nd minute as Barça cruised into the semi-finals.“I really wishValenciathe best of luck because outside the pitch I’m just another fan,” Torres told TVE after deciding not to celebrate any of his goals out of respect for his formative club. “It’s hard to see the club of your childhood, the club of your life suffer like this ... seeing how they are going through such a hard time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Under theParis climate agreement, world leaders said they would try to prevent global temperatures rising by more than 1.5C – but the threshold was based on long-term multidecadal warming and not short-term monthly temperatures.Climate scientists had expected this exceptional spell to subside after a warming El Niño event peaked in January 2024 and conditions shifted to an opposing, cooling La Niña phase.Temperatures at north pole 20C above average and beyond ice melting pointRead moreBut the heat has lingered at record or near-record levels, prompting debate about what other factors could be driving it to the top end of expectations.Julien Nicolas, a climate scientist at Copernicus, told Agence France-Presse: “This is what makes it a bit of a surprise: you’re not seeing this cooling effect, or temporary brake at least, on the global temperature that we were expecting to see.”La Niña is expected to be weak, and Copernicus said prevailing temperatures in parts of the equatorial Pacific Ocean suggested a slowing or stalling of the move towards the cooling phenomenon. Nicolas said it could disappear by March.Last month, Copernicus said global temperatures averaged across 2023 and 2024 had exceeded 1.5C for the first time. This did not represent a permanent breach of the long-term 1.5C target under the Paris climate accord but it was a clear sign the limit was being tested.Scientists say every fraction of a degree of warming above 1.5C increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall and droughts.Copernicus saidArctic sea icein January hit a monthly record low. Analysis from the US this week showed it was the second-lowest in that dataset. Overall, 2025 is not expected to follow 2023 and 2024 into the history books: scientists predict it will rank the third-hottest year yet.Greenland ice sheet cracking more rapidly than ever, study showsRead moreCopernicus said it would closely monitor ocean temperatures for hints about how the climate might behave. Oceans are an important climate regulator and carbon sink, and cooler waters can absorb greater amounts of heat from the atmosphere, helping to lower air temperatures. They also store 90% of the excess heat trapped by humanity’s release of greenhouse gases.Nicolas said: “This heat is bound to resurface periodically. I think that’s also one of the questions: is this what has been happening over the past couple of years?”Sea-surface temperatures were exceptionally warm in 2023 and 2024, and Copernicus said readings in January were the second highest on record. “That is the thing that is a little puzzling – why they remain so warm,” Nicolas said.Scientists are unanimous that burning fossil fuels has driven long-term global heating, and that natural climate variability can also influence temperatures from one year to the next.But natural warming cycles such as El Niño could not alone explain what had taken place in the atmosphere and seas, and answers were being sought elsewhere.One theory is that a globalshift to cleaner shipping fuelsin 2020 accelerated warming by reducing sulphur emissions that make clouds more mirror-like and reflective of sunlight.In December, another peer-reviewed paper looked at whether a reduction in low-lying clouds had let more heat reach the Earth’s surface. “It’s really still a matter of debate,” Nicolas said.The EU monitor uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations to aid its calculations. Its records go back to 1940, but other sources of climate data – such as ice cores, tree rings and coral skeletons – enable scientists to expand their conclusions using evidence from much further in the past.Scientists say the current period is likely to be the warmest the planet has been in 125,000 years.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisLa NiñaEl Niño southern oscillationEuropean UnionEuropeParis climate agreementnewsShareReuse this content"

The good news is that many of the taxes already exist in some countries, making the prospect of a wide rollout less far-fetched than you may think. The even better news is that you can have your say during the public consultation stage.More on all this, after this week’s top stories.Essential readsLevels of microplastics in human brains may be rapidly rising, study suggestsClimate change target of 2C is ‘dead’, says renowned climate scientist‘It’s like solving a murder’: who dumped 30 tonnes of rubbish on Lichfield?In focusView image in fullscreenA plane approaching Heathrow airport in London.Photograph: Avpics/AlamyThe first thing to say about the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force is that it is a serious operation. It is being driven by the leaders of France, Kenya and Barbados, has members including Denmark, Senegal and Colombia, and is partnered with the UN, World Bank, G20, European Commission and African Union. It’s got clout.That matters, as the gap between the billions of dollars being mobilised to fight the climate crisis and the trillions neededis huge. The aim of the taskforce is both simple and potentially transformative: to use internationally coordinated levies to raise funds, penalise polluters and increase the fairness of the global tax system.The consultation sets out the pros and cons of each potential levy. You can read themand submit your thoughts here. The most obvious is the levy on the fossil fuels that cause global heating, but which currently enjoy$7tn in subsidies a year. The world’s five biggest oilcompanies made a combined total of $281bn in profitsin 2022-23 alone.The simplest fossil fuel levy the taskforce sets out is on extraction: $5 per tonne of CO2, rising by $5 every year to 2030. It could raise $1tn a year by 2035. Coal, oil and gas extraction is often already taxed, making it administratively simple. “The power of the fossil fuel lobby would make this hard to achieve politically,” the taskforce rightly notes. “However, each country that introduces the levy could gain a significant increase in tax revenue.”Flying – an elite, heavily polluting activity –is growing– just 1% of the world’s populationcauses half of allaviation emissions. The taskforce puts forward a tax on tickets or on jet fuel for international flights, which is barely taxed at all today.The ticket tax may raise $100bn a year, the jet fuel levy $10bn. A frequent flyer tax is also being considered, with the levy rising with each flight, but this may require each passenger to have an ID number. Several countries have already used an aeroplane ticket levyto fund the fight against Aidsand other diseases.Like aviation, the international shipping industry does not pay taxes proportional to the damage its pollution causes. But the International Maritime Organization already collects funds from operators to compensate for oil spills, and most countries already support a carbon levy. This could raise up to$127bn a year between 2027 and 2030.Plastic relies on fossil fuels, is emissions intensive and environmentally damaging, but there are currently no taxes at all levied on its producers. Ongoing negotiations on a global plastics treatyinclude a levy proposal, which would raise about $30bn a year. There are relatively few plastic producers, which would make it easier to collect this tax. The impact on people’s pockets would also be small, as the cost of primary polymers is a fraction of the price of final products.The taskforce’s ideas also include a striking billionaire tax. The ultrarich usually have extremelyhigh carbon footprints, often pay tax at far lower rates than regular workers and, frankly, can afford it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But it’s hard to imagine the levy being unpopular with ordinary citizens.Finally, the taskforce is proposing a tax on financial transactions, which it says “have benefited hugely from globalisation, without being taxed in most jurisdictions”, and on cryptocurrencies, which require huge amounts of energy to generate.A tax of 0.5% on the value of the transaction of the stocks would raise $270bn a year. Thirty countries already have a similar tax and France even earmarks part of its levy for climate and development.A 0.1% tax on cryptocurrency transactions would raise about $16bn a year, but it wouldn’t be easy to implement. “Given the anonymity and decentralised nature of crypto, there is a high possibility of tax evasion,” the taskforce says. On the plus side, Kazakhstan, a big crypto miner, already taxes the energy used.Of course, all this requires governments and companies to step up to the plate, but they are not doing so quickly enough. In the meantime, solidarity taxes could be another route to making polluters pay.Let the taskforceknow what you think.Read more:‘Morally, nobody’s against it’: Brazil’s radical plan to tax global super-rich to tackle climate crisisFormer world leaders seek $25bn levy on oil states’ revenues to pay for climate damageHow Trump is targeting wind and solar energy – and delighting big oilTo read the complete version of this newsletter,subscribe to receive Down To Earthin your inbox every ThursdayExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentDown to Earth newsletternewslettersShareReuse this content"

Earth Fund had been one of two core funders of the SBTi, with the Ikea Foundation: the twoaccounted for 61%of its total funding last year. Earth Fund’s decision wasfirst reported by the FT.Spokespeople for Earth Fund and SBTi said the$18m(£14.5m) grant had been a three-year commitment that expired as previously agreed, and Earth Fund had not made a final decision on future support. But researchers familiar with the SBTi, as well as advisers at the organisation, raised concerns that the vanishing support was part of a broader trend of wealthy individuals moving away from funding causes that the US president – who has previously called climate change a hoax – did not agree with.Prof Doreen Stabinsky, who is on the technical council of SBTi, said: “You look at Bezos and the folks he’s hanging out with in the billionaires club, and you realise this is about more than SBTi,” she said. “Bezos is bowing down to Trump in a way a bunch of billionaires are bowing down to Trump.”Stabinsky said Bezos’s decision was “not surprising at all” given he previously stopped the editorial board of the Washington Post – which he owns – taking an endorsement position on presidential candidates.It came as scientists described their “stress and fear” at Donald Trump’s executive orders to cut federal grant money. Mentions of the climate crisis have also beenremoved or downgradedacross US government websites. Stabinsky said: “Climate for Trump is just one of those things that is very visible, very on his radar, very part of his messaging – anti-climate action, anti any corporate that is doing something that is visibly about climate change.”Before Trump’s inauguration last month, the US’ssix biggest banks quitthe global banking industry’s net zero target-setting group. Kelly Stone, a senior policy analyst at ActionAid USA, said the move to no longer fund SBTi was “really disappointing, but not especially surprising at this point”, describing it as “part of a corporate wave” of abandoning green ambitions. She said: “We’re seeing a huge retreat from a lot of these climate pledges from the biggest corporate and financial actors.”The Bezos Earth fund has pumped billions into climate and nature projects. So why are experts uneasy?Read morePeter Riggs, executive director of US nonprofit Pivot Point, said he was concerned “about how this will impact green investment generally, and investments in energy transitions, because obviously the signal from Washington right now is very strong that renewable energies and other kinds of zero-carbon or low-carbon approaches are actively discouraged. It’s not even that they’re being sidelined, they’re being eviscerated.”In April last year, SBTi announced plans toallow companies to use carbon offsetsfrom the voluntary carbon market for indirect emissions, in a move some believed was influenced by the Bezos Earth Fund. It provokedinternal fury from staff, who said they had not been consulted, and warned that it opened the door to greenwashing.Riggs said: “I think there are two things at play. One is that Bezos, or the Bezos Earth Fund, ultimately decided that they weren’t in the position, or weren’t willing to endorse, the science-based standard because of the challenges in it. And second, the political climate in Washington having changed – they didn’t want to draw a lot of attention to those kinds of commitments.”An SBTi spokesperson said: “The three-year incubation grant made to the SBTi in 2021 by Bezos Earth Fund was designed to help us scale at the pace needed to meet extraordinary demand for our services. The grant expired in 2024 as originally agreed.”A spokesperson from Bezos Earth Fund said:“In 2021, the Bezos Earth Fund made a three-year grant to SBTi for capacity building, which ended in December 2024 as originally agreed. There has been no change in the relationship between the Earth Fund and SBTi. SBTi has not requested additional funding from the Earth Fund. As a result, the Earth Fund has made no decision with regard to further funding.”Explore more on these topicsJeff BezosThe age of extinctionPhilanthropyClimate crisisClimate financeClimate science scepticism and denialClimate scienceClimate aidnewsShareReuse this content"

It is being removed and catalogued. A group of Guernsey beachcombers, united under the Facebook group Found on the Beach in Guernsey, “womble” across the island’s bays on a daily basis and share their evidence with the marine biologist Richard Lord.He cleans, reinflates and collects plastic water bottles, along with other kinds of waste, in his garden shed at his St Peter Port home, less than half a mile from the sea.View image in fullscreenSome of the short lengths of polyethylene or polypropylene plastic fishing twine collected from the Guernsey sea shorePhotograph: Richard L LordHe has hundreds of different ones from all over the world. And the collection is now informing international discussions about plastic waste, with his work being referenced by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) as it seeks ways to deal with the problem.Lord first noticed the extent of plastic waste washing up in Guernsey in 2008: “I was a volunteer, helping in a missing person search. I walked around Guernsey’s entire north coast with a police officer and there was one tiny bay that was plastered with litter. I went back and began clearing it. It took ages.”His hobby, and arguably mission, has continued and in 2024 his marine shipping litter project won second place in a Guernsey Conservation Awards scheme.Lord says he has studied marine life on the Guernsey shore for well over a decade. Now, that is evolving: “I am studying plastic bottles and am developing a knowledge of plastic packaging brands.View image in fullscreenRussian plastic water bottles collected from the Guernsey sea shore.Photograph: Richard L Lord“There’s a bit of taxonomy, too, which is based on my marine biology experience of not only loving marine species but photographing them, to understand the diversity and how they are related. Now, I am using the same knowledge and skills to focus on plastic ‘taxonomy’ and plastics plaguing the oceans of the world.”He is indebted to a small group of Guernsey beachcombers and says that collecting finds for his catalogue and database of plastic waste is a team effort: “I’ve been helped by lots of people, who are incredibly generous. When they find a foreign water bottle, they call or message me and ask: ‘Do you want it?’ And I say: ‘Yes please.’”The collection of plastic water bottles is colourful and, to a certain extent, exotic. But it gives an insight into the size of the planet’s plastic pollution problem.Study finds microplastic contamination in 99% of seafood samplesRead moreLord is certain these bottles were thrown overboard by crews of merchant vessels using the shipping lanes of the Channel. The tides and winds wash them on to Guernsey’s shores.“As they approach a port, they are getting rid of their surplus rubbish. Not all of them, maybe only a small percentage, but the fact we’re getting litter from Latin America, North America, Asia, India, the Middle East, and Mediterranean countries, like Turkey and Greece, indicates to me that’s it’s not just a few ships doing it.”Data from the collection was used by a delegate who wrote a paper that was discussed by the IMO at a meeting in London in late January.The marine pollution convention prohibits litter, particularly plastic litter, from being disposed of at sea. For large ships over 400 tonnes, the ban has been in place since 1988.Despite this, Lord says the plastic waste problem is growing annually: “An association of shipowners called BIMCO [the Baltic and International Maritime Council] estimate conservatively that at least a billion plastic bottles are being used on merchant ships every year.“Even if a small percentage of those 1bn bottles are thrown overboard, that still represents a considerable source of plastic litter.”As for the dedicated volunteers, Lord says their work continues.“By collecting, we’re trying to put ourselves out of business. But I personally become disheartened when I see images of plastic devastation globally. All this human effort that goes into production and distribution, ending up as waste on our beaches.”Explore more on these topicsPollutionGuernseyPlasticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The class B investors have brought forward analternative funding deal that they say will be cheaper.The court and well over 100 lawyers, investors and other advisers have heard four days of complex arguments concerning the terms of the competing deals. The judge on Thursday extended the hearing by another day to hear further arguments.However, Maynard argued that special administration would be a better course because it would cut out hundreds of millions of pounds of fees and interest costs.Less than £500m of the £1.5bn debt would be “real liquidity actually available” to Thames Water to support its operations or maintain drains and sewers, according to estimates by Maynard’s legal team.The estimates were prepared from a combination of fees disclosed in documents in court and cross-examination of Thames Water executives.The estimate of costs includes at least £443m that would “move in a circle” straight back to the creditors in various fees. A sum totalling £245m would be used to pay interest costs for many of the same investors, while £210m would go on professional fees, the court heard.The court also heard that Thames Water had breached its duty of candour to the court by failing to properly detail the true costs of the debt package.Maynard said in an interview he was “shocked” by the alleged lack of consideration of the interests of households during the whole hearing. He said the fees and interest costs would ultimately be paid by households and business customers of Thames Water through their bills.“Why are we spending so much money to keep digging an even deeper hole?” Maynard said. “How is this in the interests of customers? It looks like it’s in the interests of one set of creditors versus another.”He said he believed that the Labour government was not stepping in because it did not want to be forced to add Thames Water’s debts to public finance figures.Thames Water argued in its closing submission that a special administration would be “value-destructive”, and added that there were “strong reasons to believe” that the company would be able to secure future equity financing. It asked the court to grant permission for the deal to go ahead.The class B creditors in their closing submissions argued that the class A creditors were seeking to gain control of the company for their own interests through a clause that would allow them to veto any future funding deal.A Thames spokesperson said: “Our plan remains the only implementable solution to putting the business on a firmer financial footing.“Its approval will not affect customer bills, but will unlock billions of pounds for investment in our network, fixing pipes, upgrading our sewage treatment works and maintaining high-quality drinking water.“Any suggestion that customers will bear costs from this process is an untrue and misleading claim that risks needlessly worrying our customers. This plan will not lead to any increases in customer bills. Ofwat has already determined the cost of bills for the next five years.”Explore more on these topicsThames WaterWater industrynewsShareReuse this content"

This is classed as “low-carbon” because the harvested trees are replaced by others that take up carbon from the atmosphere as they grow.Butmany studies have shown that wood burning harms the environment, by destroying forests, and because of the decades-long time lag between the immediate release of carbon dioxide CO2from burning and the growth to maturity of replacement trees.Drax currentlyreceives billions of pounds in subsidies from energy bill payers, at the rate of about £2m a day according to Greenpeace, but these are scheduled torun out in 2027. A government decision on whether to continue the support payments beyond the cut-off could come as soon as Monday.Campaigners fear that ministers could allow Drax unrestricted subsidies for continuing to burn biomass, which one said would be “incredibly bad news”. A further option would be to impose strict time limits on the subsidies, or require Drax to use carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which could reduce the harm to the climate but still allow widespread destruction of trees.Awarding new subsidies to Drax would be highly controversial amongLabourMPs. The Guardian has seen letters from parliamentarians sent to the Financial Conduct Authority and the Financial Reporting Council, querying Drax’s claims to environmental sustainability.Several peers and at least one MP have asked the financial regulators to open an investigation into Drax, based partly on findings from the energy regulator, Ofgem, that the company had misreported data on the origins and sustainability of imported wood pellets.Research last month from the green thinktank E3G found the government could meet its target of decarbonising the UK’s electricity sector by 2030 without Drax.Matt Williams, senior advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the Drax decision a crucial test of the government’s green plans. “If [ministers] award business-as-usual subsidies, that would be incredibly bad news for forests, and anyone who cares about them. Billions more for the UK’s single largest polluter would make it clear the government was placing all its bets on high-carbon infrastructure,” he said.“But if they put limits on the time or the quantity of subsidies, that would indicate the government was thinking twice about this, and could signal the beginning of the end [for biomass subsidies].”The row over Drax is the latest in a series of controversies that campaigners warned risked giving the impression thatLabour was sacrificing its green credentials in the pursuit of economic growth. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has given the green light to anew runway at Heathrow, and some allies are thought to want her to give the go-ahead to themassive new Rosebank oilfield in the North Sea.A Whitehall source said the Treasury was not involved in decisions over Drax.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Continuing to subsidise huge biomass imports would not be a step towards a cleaner future, but a dirty compromise with past failures.”He added: “This government stood on a manifesto to deliver clean power by 2030, and to tackle the climate emergency. Whether it’s Heathrow’s third runway or potential permitting of new oil and gas developments, the government’s commitment to stopping climate change is starting to look a little frayed around the edges. More biomass at Drax would be yet another decision that is likely to make the climate and nature crises worse, not better.”The Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory adviser on the climate, islikely to address the issue of burning biomass for power in its advice on the seventh carbon budget, which will be published on 26 February. Previous advice has strongly warned ministers to abandon biomass burning for power, unless equipped with CCS.The government refused to comment. A spokesperson for Drax refused to comment on future subsidies. He said the company had previously announced it could be using CCS from the early 2030s.Explore more on these topicsDraxEnergy industryEnergyClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsFossil fuelsBiofuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

Landlords cannot be allowed to rent out dangerous homes and shamelessly put the lives of their tenants at risk.“Our new laws will force them to fix problems quickly, so that people are safe in their homes and can be proud to live in social housing.”However, Shelter said the grace period for landlords was far too long.Polly Neate, the charity’s chief executive, said: “Awaab Ishak’s legacy must be that no other family has to witness poor housing conditions putting their child’s life at risk. The government promised to bring in Awaab’s law, forcing landlords to deal with serious hazards in social homes within clear timeframes, last autumn.“However, four years after Awaab’s death … today’s announcement means social housing tenants will have to wait years longer for this vital protection. These delays to implementation represent a real risk to the health and safety of tenants, and puts lives at risk.”Labour promised in opposition to enact Awaab’s law after it was originally proposed by the Conservatives but never passed.Raynersaid last year: “We’ll clamp down on mouldy homes by bringing in Awaab’s law into the social rented sector … to end the scandal of people living in unacceptable conditions.”On Thursday the government clarified the timetable for its implementation of the act. From October, social landlords in England will have 24 hours to make emergency repairs, including to damp and mould.Next year, they will have to make immediate repairs to a broader range of hazards, expected to include excess cold and heat, structural collapse, fire, electrical problems and hygiene hazards.Landlords will have until 2027 before having to begin fixing other hazards immediately, including asbestos, exposure to lead or radiation and contaminated water supplies.Officials said the timescale would “allow the government to test and learn so that the reforms benefit social tenants and secure the lasting legacy that Awaab Ishak’s family have fought so hard for”.Ministers have also promised to extend Awaab’s law to the private sector, but have not given a timeline for doing so.They are also consulting on new energy efficiency standards for the private sector and legislating to require social landlords to carry out electrical safety checks at least every five years.Explore more on these topicsSocial housingHousingAngela RaynerEnglandHealthCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The adverts do not display the Labour logo and are in a similar shade of blue to that used by Reform UK.The party has also set up a Facebook group calledProtect Britain’s Communitiesdesigned to highlight the government’s record on crime and antisocial behaviour. The page also does not display any Labour livery but sports a large union flag.Labour sources say the adverts are part of a broader push to target Labour voters thinking about defecting to Reform, which polls suggest are a growing group.One said: “The Tories and Reform offer nothing but weasel words, while this Labour government gets on with fixing the asylum system, which the Tories broke. We intend to let the public know about our plan for change through every available channel. It’s already seen thousands of people with no right to be here removed from Britain and tough new border security measures to reduce small boat crossings.”However, the adverts have caused upset among some Labour MPs and activists, who believe the party could be making life harder for asylum seekers in the UK.Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP for York Central, whose regional party set up the UKMigrationUpdates page, said: “I would caution the party against raising such community tensions when we know there are so many asylum seekers who have experienced persecution in their lives. I represent England’s only human rights city, where we uphold the dignity of all.”Steve Valdez-Symonds, the refugee and migrant rights director at Amnesty International UK, said: “It is seriously worrying that the government seems set on repeating the mistakes of the past – under both Conservative and Labour leadership.“For anyone wishing to see that every person’s human dignity is properly respected, and that we have a fair and efficient immigration and asylum system in the UK, public communication strategies such as this only make the situation worse.”Reform has been surging in the polls for the past few weeks, witha YouGov pollputting the party ahead of both Labour and the Conservatives earlier this week.While most of the rightwing party’s gains have come at the expense of the Tories, there is evidence it is beginning to eat into Labour’s vote share as well. The gains have caused alarm in Downing Street and among Labour MPs, with the partysetting up groupingsof MPs in Reform-facing seats to share campaign tips and polling information.As part of the push to combat Reform, the UK Migration UpdatesFacebookadvert, paid for by the Yorkshire and Humber Labour party, reads: “Breaking news: Labour hits five year high in migrant removals.”Labour North West has used the advert on a Facebook page it has calledPutting Runcorn First, which shows a large union flag but no Labour branding.The Putting Communities First page looks similar, and has mainly posted tabloid stories about government action against low-level crime and antisocial behaviour.Labour Together, a thinktank with strong links to Starmer and those around him, is also trying to work out how to reach Reform voters. Its chief executive, the former Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth, said: “It’s not about trying to ape Farage – that won’t work. But where we have a story to tell, like on the returns figures, Labour MPs should talking a lot about that.”Explore more on these topicsLabourReform UKNigel FarageThe far rightAdvertisingFacebookMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

I say: we’re going to take on the blockers so that we can build.”Speaking during a visit to the National Nuclear Laboratory’s site in Preston, Lancashire, alongside Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, the prime minister said the advent of SMRs meant progress could be swift, with planning rules changed so they could be built beyond the eight existing designated nuclear sites.“We used to be one of the world leaders on nuclear,” he said. “I’m determined we’re going to get back there. So we are the builders, and we’re going to take on the blockers.”Asked why nuclear plans so often took decades between planning and generating power, Starmer said this was not inevitable: “We built the first nuclear power station in 1956, we then built 21 in 10 years after that. The last 15 years or so have been completely stagnant. We’re going to turn that around and start building, and do it at pace.“And you’re quite right to say they take too long. That’s exactly why we’re making the announcement that we are today.”However ambitious, the project faces obstacles, including likely local opposition, despite hints from Starmer that people could get lower bills if they lived near a new reactor. The technology also remains untested, there is not a single commercial SMR operating in the world, and the sector is heavily reliant on government support.Dale Vince, a green electricity entrepreneur and a major donor toLabourunder Starmer, said even large nuclear power stations made “the most expensive power known to mankind”, adding: “And the widely understood and experienced concept of economies of scale is all about things getting cheaper as they get bigger. The opposite is true in the other direction – miniaturisation always costs more.”Doug Parr,GreenpeaceUK’s policy director, said Starmer’s plan was unrealistic. “The Labour government has swallowed nuclear industry spin whole, seemingly without applying so much as a pinch of critical scrutiny or asking for a sprinkling of evidence,” he said.“They present as fact things which are merely optimistic conjecture on small nuclear reactor cost, speed of delivery and safety, which is courageous – or stupid – given that not a single one has been built, and with the nuclear industry’s record of being over time and over budget unmatched by any other sector.”Mike Childs, the head of policy forFriends of the Earth, said nuclear power was “extremely expensive and creates a legacy of radioactive waste that lasts for thousands of years”.“The Hinkley C nuclear plant in Somerset, which is a decade late and almost £30bn over budget, makes HS2 look like a runaway success,” he said. “If ministers want to build a clean, affordable and energy-secure future they should focus on renewables, such as wind and solar, and better energy storage – not the overblown, costly hype offered by the nuclear industry.”Explore more on these topicsNuclear powerKeir StarmerGreenpeaceFriends of the EarthEnergyEnergy industryLabournewsShareReuse this content"

However, he told the reporter in no uncertain terms that he did not want to discuss it.Lord Mandelson said: “I regret ever meeting him or being introduced to him by his partnerGhislaine Maxwell.“I regret even more the hurt he caused to many young women.“I’m not going to go into this. It’s an FT obsession and frankly you can all fuck off. OK?”The pair’s connections have raised questions since a 2019 internal report on Epstein by JP Morgan bank was filed to a New York court.It found Epstein appeared to “maintain a particularly close relationship with Prince Andrew, the Duke of York and LordPeter Mandelson, a senior member of British government”.Epstein, the disgraced financier, killed himself while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in August 2019Mandelson said he was “capable of being diplomatic” and claimed he had garnered praise from the former US president George W Bush, who called him “silvertongue”.He also dismissed comments from one of Donald Trump’s advisers whodescribed him as “an absolute moron”.Mandelson said: “Some around Mr Trump see me as they view many in Europe. They see me as a leftwing progressive, somebody who might even be anti-business or somebody who might be following the sort of liberalism they’ve just defeated in America.“What they will discover is I’m not an uber-liberal, I’m not a wokey-cokey sort of person, and I’m pro-market and pro-business.”Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonJeffrey EpsteinGhislaine MaxwellnewsShareReuse this content"

They also called for the repeal of the controversial Legacy Act which offers immunity to Troubles-era crimes.Northern Ireland’s presiding coroner, Mr Justice Michael Humphreys, found that the soldiers had lied by saying there was a gun battle and they were attacking in self-defence, and that state agencies had perpetuated this falsehood.Four Provisional IRA members – Kevin Barry O’Donnell, 21, Sean O’Farrell, 23, Peter Clancy, 19, and Patrick Vincent, 20 – were shot dead by the soldiers minutes after they had carried out a gun attack on Coalisland Royal Ulster Constabulary station.Northern Ireland Office ‘should have protected’ murdered solicitorRead moreThe special forces opened fire as the men arrived at St Patrick’s church car park, in Clonoe, in a stolen lorry they had used in the police station attack. The SAS unit had been waiting behind a hedgerow for the gang to arrive after the security forces received intelligence that they would travel to the church, the inquest heard.The soldiers then fired up to 570 rounds at the lorry without warning.In statements given after the killings, the soldiers claimed there had been a gun battle and they had opened fire to protect themselves and colleagues.Humphreys, who is also a high court judge, said these statements were untrue. He found that the IRA members were attempting to get out of the lorry and run away and they could not have posed a threat.O’Donnell was shot in the back while attempting to flee and then again in the face while lying incapacitated on the ground.Humphreys rejected claims by Soldiers F and H that they had an honest belief they needed to use force.Clancy was shot when he attempted to run away and was then repeatedly shot in a crouched or kneeling position on the ground, the inquest found.Vincent was shot seated in the cab of the lorry and then again when lying incapacitated across the seat of the lorry through its open doors.O’Farrell was shot in the back while running away and then in the face while lying on the ground incapacitated.Humphreys noted there was no attempt to arrest the four men, including after they were wounded in the ambush.He also criticised state agencies, including theMinistry of Defenceand government ministers, after they “perpetuated falsehoods” about the killings.He cited an MoD document that described the ambush as “an excellent security forces success”.The judge said these falsehoods and a lack of challenge by the authorities had thwarted accountability for the incident. He said: “The reasons for putting forward such false justifications for the actions of the soldiers are obvious. This, coupled with any lack of proper challenge of their accounts by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) investigators, ensured there would be no actual accountability.”He noted that the media falsely reported that there had been a gunfight based on briefings from the authorities. Humphreys said: “No steps were taken to rectify this and ensure that the public were made aware of a true account of events.”Speaking outside the court, Vincent’s sister Marian said the ruling gave “dignity back” to all four men. She added: “We’re delighted with the result, but we are also very aware of the huge expense to us as families.“I don’t see how 514 bullets were ever warranted, especially if there could have been arrests.”Niall Murphy, a lawyer for the families, said he would “carefully consider” the verdict with a view to prosecuting the soldiers.He said: “Whereas truth has been excavated and published today, justice has not.“Today’s verdict is the reason the Tory government bought in the Legacy Act. It was conceived and legislated for to ensure that truths could no longer be published. That is why it is so vital that the Legacy Act be repealed in its totality.”Murphy also said the verdict had “ridiculed the lies that were told after these murders”. He added: “Those lies have been confounded and corrected today, and the vilification that these families have had to tolerate in the 33 years since can now be lifted from them.”Sinn Féin echoed the call for the Legacy Act to be repealed – something Keir Starmer has promised.Cathal Mallaghan, the MP for Mid Ulster, said: “These findings lay bare the rationale behind the British government’s determination to subsume all inquests within the ICRIR [Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery], whereby the British secretary of state would decide what findings or information would be released to families via a vetted report.”Explore more on these topicsBritish armyMilitaryIRANorthern IrelandMinistry of DefencenewsShareReuse this content"

She denies the charges.On Thursday, Kerr’s partner and fiancee, Kristie Mewis, told the court that Kerr was “speaking her truth” after being “treated differently” by officers when she made the comments. She accused them of “gaslighting” the couple after they doubted their account of being “held hostage” in a taxi in the early hours of 30 January 2023.View image in fullscreenKristie Mewis, partner of Australia striker Sam Kerr, outside court.Photograph: Alberto Pezzali/APMewis, who is pregnant with the couple’s child, was asked by Grace Forbes, who is defending Kerr, about her reaction when Kerr called PC Stephen Lovell “stupid and white”.“I think that, in that moment, she was speaking her truth in how she was feeling. I think that subconsciously, she felt like she was being treated differently. I’ve seen it a lot,” said Mewis, an American who is also a professional footballer.She said she had seen Kerr “treated differently multiple times” and later told the court that Kerr had “been treated differently, and spoke to differently, for her whole life. I think that she was feeling the same thing she had felt before”.Mewis became emotional twice on the witness stand. When asked how she felt in the taxi, which she said was moving “uncontrollably fast” after Kerr got sick out of the window, she teared up and said it “felt like someone else had control over me and that was obviously very scary”.Later, she was asked to describe Kerr as a person and struggled to hold back tears.Mewis said: “Sam is so loving and she’s so humble. She’s would help anybody, that’s one of the things I love about her so much, how helpful, and loving and humble she is.“She’s so inspiring, she inspires me everyday. I wouldn’t want anyone else to be the mother of my child.”Mewis described how she “immediately felt fear for my life” in a locked, speeding taxi. After a night out in London, the pair hailed a black cab back to their home. During the journey, Mewis said Kerr rolled down the windows of the cab and was sick outside. After this, she said the driver pulled over and “started yelling” before he resumed driving in a reckless manner.She said she had “never driven in a car that fast before” and “tried everything to get out”. She said, after the “initial shock wore off”, she knew she had to do “something dramatic” to save them. In the course of this, the taxi driver called the police.“I didn’t know if it was a kidnapping or if we were going to crash,” she said. Mewis said she was “kicking straight out with both feet” and broke the car’s window in a bid to escape before it parked outside Twickenham police station – on the instruction of police who answered the taxi driver’s call.When they went inside the station, Mewis said the police were “dismissive” of their claims.“It felt a little bit gaslighting,” she told the court. “Like it would just be easier for them if the whole thing was our fault.”She said the ordeal they relayed to officers would be “different” when repeated back to them. “The way he would say it back would manipulate it back to us,” she told the court.Eventually, Kerr paid the driver £900 for the damage. Mewis said they paid the sum because she wanted to “escape the situation” and that Mewis “was trying to make the US football team that summer.Earlier in the day, Kerr was cross-examined by prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones. He asked her whether she was using Lovell’s “whiteness as an insult”, which she denied.When pressed again about what “his race had to do with anything”, Kerr said: “I believed it was him using his power and privilege over me because he was accusing me of being something I’m not.”In a testy exchange, Emlyn Jones said: “Ms Kerr, if I put to you that you’re fucking stupid, that would be bang out of order wouldn’t it?”“Yes,” she responded.“I’d be insulting you?,” he said.“Yes. I expressed myself very poorly,” she said.Kerr was asked why she told Lovell she has “got all the fucking people in the world” and has “fucking Chelsea going on”. She said it was an attempt to “bluff” to “make myself feel protected”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrAustralia sportChelsea WomennewsShareReuse this content"

For two years, he smuggled USB drives filled with photographs out of Assad’s security branches, documenting the deaths of at least 6,786 people in detention.To do so, Madhan risked arrest by regime and opposition forces.“I was hiding images in my clothes, bread bags and on my person, for fear of being searched at checkpoints,” Madhan said on Thursday. Because he worked for the security services but lived in an area controlled by the Syrian Free Army, a rebel group, he created a fake civilian ID for himself in order to pass through opposition checkpoints.At one point, he said he was recognised by an opposition soldier at a checkpoint. The soldier, who he had hired before as a handyman in his house, did not stop Madhan despite his status as a regime officer. The incident left him shaken nonetheless.In 2013, Madhan decided he had collected enough evidence and endured enough risk, and took the decision to defect. He fled to Jordan and then flew to Qatar, where he worked with a law firm to use the smuggled photos to create accountability for the Assad regime’s crimes.The photos, first revealed in 2014, were the first wide-spread documentation of the Assad regime’s brutal detention system, put into overdriveto quash the country’s 2011 revolution. According to Human Rights Watch, the 6,786 victims documented by Madhan came from just five intelligence branches in Damascus.‘They were torturing to kill’: inside Syria’s death machine | Garance le CaisneRead moreAccording to Madhan, at the beginning of the Syrian revolution, about 10 to 15 bodies would be brought into the security branches where he worked. By 2013, the number had increased to about 50 bodies a day. Most had “cardiac arrest” listed as the cause of death, which came to be known throughout the course of the war as a euphemism for death by torture.Rights groups estimate the total number of detainees by the Assad regime at about 136,000. After rebels opened Assad’s prisons during their lightning offensive that culminated inthe fall of the regime on 8 December, about 100,000 prisoners remained missing.View image in fullscreenSyria’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, previously known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/ReutersThe revelations of the photographs led to the US “Caesar Act” in 2019,which imposed sanctions on Syrian officialsand any other person who engaged in “significant transactions” with the Assad regime. Though the US government said the sanctions were targeted in nature,experts have long said that they have had a chilling effect on the Syrian economy, largely affecting ordinary civilians.The new authorities in Damascus, led by the Syrian president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, previously known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, have called for the lifting of US sanctions. The US has eased sanctions with a six-month waiver on certain humanitarian sectors, while the EU said it is waiting to see if Syria’s new rulers will protect minorities and create an inclusive government.In addition to calling for the lifting of sanctions on Syria, Madhan said that he hoped that the new government in Damascus would open “national courts that will prosecute and hold perpetrators of war crimes accountable”.Explore more on these topicsSyrianewsShareReuse this content"

But they also supplement diplomatic security. Three of the four people killed in a 2012 raid on the Libyan diplomatic mission in Benghazi – Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty – were civilian security contractors.The directive does not distinguish between security staff and others. Roughly half of the bureau of diplomatic security’s contractors fall under the directive’s umbrella. Contracts cannot run for periods longer than a year, per state department regulation. But contracts can be renewed annually for up to an additional four option years.Judge temporarily limits Doge’s access to sensitive treasury payment system – liveRead moreDirect employees of the federal government have broad civil service protections, but contractors generally do not benefit from these protections. They are not considered civil service or foreign service employees, but may be considered federal employees in some cases.“All of these new contracts are to be terminated immediately or, in the case of unexercised options, must not be exercised,” states the email from Catherine Rodriguez, a senior official and career staffer at the state department’s bureau of global talent management.

Definitely, there’s a fear about this having a long term impact on tourism.”Government officials said the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, would visit the island on Friday in what was described as “a show of solidarity”.

In all, according to Adobe, consumers spent $241.1bn in those two months.“The holiday shopping season was the most successful yet for Amazon and we appreciate the support of our customers, selling partners, and employees who helped make it so,” Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, said in astatement.Despite the better-than-expected results, Amazon fell below analyst estimates when it came to next quarter’s sales. The company said it expects sales to be between $151bn and $155.5bn, while analysts estimated $158.5bn. Shares fell in after-hours trading and then bounced back to the same price as the previous market close.Wall Street has appeared to appreciate the cost-cutting measures at Amazon over the past couple of years. Jassy has been working to tighten the belt by instituting layoffs and cuts across several departments. While 2024 had less layoffs than years past, the downsizing still appears to have had positive financial gains for Amazon’s bottom line.During Thursday’s earnings, Jassy applauded various new innovations centered on artificial intelligence at the company, including a new AI chip called the Trainium2. “These benefits are often realized by customers (and the business) several months down the road, but these are substantial enablers in this emerging technology environment,” Jassy said.Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s executive chairman, has also become friendlier with Donald Trump after years of acrimony.

Asked whether fishing rights would get in the way of a security pact, he said: “No, these are different things. European defence and fisheries cannot be put on the same level. We should have common sense of what we are talking about.”He was speaking to reporters three days after Starmer outlined his ideasfor anEU-UK security pactat a dinner with EU leaders on Monday, the first time a British prime minister had attended a European Council since Brexit.Costa said that had been “a very important moment” where “everybody expressed the will that we need to strengthen our cooperation on security and defence”.Along with the European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, Costa will travel to the UK for an EU-UK summit on 19 May. The meeting is expected to yield an agreement to open negotiations in a range of areas, although precise outcomes remain uncertain.For the EU, a main concern is the post-Brexit fisheries agreement that expires in June 2026. Member states want to maintain the status quo, but the prime minister will face pressure to secure bigger quotas for British fishing fleets. According to diplomatic sources, a large majority of member states favour“a package approach”, linking all topics of the EU-UK reset, including security, fishing rights and a youth mobility deal.Striking a more emollient tone, Costa said: “What is important now is to take note of the wish of the United Kingdom to reset their relations with the European Union and our wish to have the closest relation as possible with the United Kingdom, namely on security and defence.” He added that it was important toimplement previous agreements, overcome problems, and “prevent new problems”.Senior EU diplomats view UK relations as “the easy bit” of Monday’s summit, which included talks on how to deal with a US president who has voiced open hostility to the EU, as well as a debate about funding European defence projects by incurring common debt.The EU needs to find €500bn (£418bn) for extra defence investments over the next decade, the commission has said.Asked about common debt to raise defence funds, Costa said he could not exclude any solution. The summit was “not the moment to draw red lines” but “a brainstorming” and “the moment to open green lanes to create a space to debate”, he said.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionKeir StarmerEuropean CommissionFishing industryFishingBrexitForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

In this case, multiple sites across the web include the 50-60% stat.”In a statement,Googlesaid it remade the ad to remove the error after speaking to the cheesemonger featured in the clip and asking him what he would have done.“Following his suggestion to have Gemini rewrite the product description without the stat, we updated the user interface to reflect what the business would do,” the statement added.Google’s AI tools have previously come under fire for containing errors or unhelpful advice. In May last year, its AI overviews search feature was criticisedafter it told some users to use “non-toxic glue”when they searched for “how to make cheese stick to pizza better”, while AI-generated responses said geologists recommended humans eat one rock a day.Last year, Gemini was “paused” after Googleconcededit “definitely messed up” after a slew of social media posts exposed how Gemini’s image generation tool depicting a variety of historical figures – including popes, founding fathers of the US and, most excruciatingly, German second world war soldiers –as people of colour.The images, along with Gemini chatbot responses that vacillated over whether libertarians or Stalin had caused the greater harm, prompted negative commentary from figures includingElon Musk.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingGoogleElon MuskSuper BowlNFLAlphabetnewsShareReuse this content"

During the video call she could see somebody lying still beside him and blood on his hand.The couple had planned to get married on 25 July. They had booked the venue and Elia, who moved to Sweden from Syria in 2015, had tried on her wedding dress.She still does not know what happened to him and has not received an official death notice from police.“I still want to believe that he might come home. We can’t sleep, we stand by the window waiting for him to come home. No one wants to believe that he is dead,” she told the broadcaster. “If he is not alive, we just want to see his body.”A police spokesperson said they were unable to confirm any of the names of those who had died because the identification process was continuing.Until now, police had revealed little about the victims or the gunman, other than that he was believed to have acted alone.The suspected gunman, who was among the dead, was named in media reports as Rickard Andersson, 35, aformer student of the schoolwho lived locally. He is understood to have attended some maths classes at the school a few years ago and had been unemployed for a decade.On Thursday, police again declined to confirm his identity until they had DNA confirmation. They previously said the suspect had no known connection to criminal gangs and that there was nothing to suggest he acted on ideological grounds.Police said the suspect had a licence for four weapons, all of which have been seized by police and three of which were next to him at the scene when officers secured him.Bergqvist said: “What we can say is that there is information that he may in some way be connected to the school, that he may have attended this school previously.”Police said although “the picture is starting to clear” in the investigation, they were “not ready to give detailed answers. We want to be sure before we speak”. They said they had searched the suspect’s home, examined his phones and had been scouring film and sound clips submitted by witnesses.They said officers were met by an “inferno” when they arrived at the school about five minutes after the alarm was raised at 12.33pm on Tuesday. Lars Wirén, Örebro’s police chief, said: “They [police] tell of what can be described as an inferno with dead people, injured people, screams and smoke.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have nothing to win from more division or more polarisation in our society. When we have done best in our country is when we have been able to stick together, work together and take care of each other.”She called for immediate reconsideration of gun laws. “What we already know is that there are too many guns that are available in our society, so we have to do something about that.”She also called for EU action to curb social media platforms that she said served up far too much violence to young people and children. “Not only in Sweden but all over the world, there is too much material on social media platforms that are romanticising violence. And the way the algorithm works, too many of our children, young people and others meet violence every day when they open their telephone.”Since the shooting there have been growing calls – including from the education minister, Lotta Edholm, for changes to Sweden’s culture of open schools, which can make it easy for members of the public to walk into a school without being challenged.Explore more on these topicsSwedenGun crimeSyriaEuropeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Unlike Death, listings for the other 14 titles can be found on sites including Amazon, Waterstones, and OK Comics, a comic book shop in Leeds.Nine women have now accused Gaiman of sexual misconduct. On Monday, one of the women, Scarlett Pavlovich, filed a civil lawsuit against Gaiman and his estranged wife, Amanda Palmer. The lawsuit accuses Gaiman of rape, sexual assault, coercion and human trafficking, and Palmer of “procuring and presenting” her to Gaiman “for such abuse”.In mid-January, Gaimanpublished a statementon his website stating that he had “never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone”. Gaiman’s representatives did not respond to a request for comment on DC Comics’ decision.Along with Death being pulled, orders for a DC Comics facsimile edition of Sandman #8 – due to be published on 26 February – have been cancelled. Retailers were told that the edition “will be resolicited at a later date”, though according toBleeding Cool, similar phrasing has been used for other titles that were ultimately never published. Again, DC Comics did not confirm that the decision was made because of the allegations.This follows the decision taken last month by US publisher Dark Horse Comics tocancel plansto publish future works by Gaiman. In a statement on X,the company wroteit “takes seriously the allegations against Neil Gaiman and we are no longer publishing his works”.Last week, a Kickstarter campaign that has raised more than £2m to adapt Gaiman and Terry Pratchett’s 1990 novel Good Omens into a graphic novelput out a statementsaying that “Neil Gaiman will not receive any proceeds” from the campaign and that it “will now fully be an entity run by, and financially connected to, the Terry Pratchett Estate only”.While multiple adaptations of Gaiman’s works have been cancelled, reconfigured or had their production paused in recent months, Amazon Prime’s adaptation of Gaiman’s Anansi Boys is still expected to stream later this year.Another Prime adaptation, Good Omens, will now end with one 90-minute episode instead of a full third season. Amazon did not confirm whether this decision was taken because of the allegations. According to Deadline, Gaimanoffered to step backfrom the show’s final season.A stage musical adaptation of Coraline – which was due to be performed at Leeds Playhouse, Royal Lyceum theatre Edinburgh, Birmingham Rep and Home Manchester –has been cancelled. “After careful consideration, we feel it would be impossible to continue in the context of the allegations against its original author”, said the venues in a joint statement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Activists say the moniker is associated with a crime against humanity in which millions of Africans were deported to work as enslaved people on colonial plantations.On Thursday, the Bordeaux administrative court of appeal sided with the association. The court said in a statement that the origin of the name was not clear.The court said, citing historians, that the neighbourhood previously known as “Harausta hamlet” might have been named after a “very dark-skinned woman” running a local inn. Other sources attribute the origin of the name to a Gascon expression referring to clay soil found locally, the statement said.The court ruled that, whatever the supposed origin of the name, “the term ‘La Negresse’ today evokes, in a demeaning way, the racial origin of a woman whose identity has not been formally identified.”‘Hidden in plain sight’: the European city tours of slavery and colonialismRead moreThe term is “thus likely to undermine the dignity of the human person” and may be perceived “as being offensive to people of African origin”.In 2023, a court in the neighbouring town of Pau initially rejected the association’s request.The earlier ruling acknowledged the evolution of the term “towards a pejorative connotation” but said that the names could not be seen as “an attack on the principle of safeguarding human dignity”. The association then appealed.In 2001,Franceformally recognised the slave trade and slavery as a crime against humanity.Explore more on these topicsFranceRaceEuropeColonialismnewsShareReuse this content"

Her comments have been described as“absolutely hateful” by the movie’s director, Jacques Audiard, while Gascón’s co-star, Zoe Saldana, has saidthe views expressed had saddened and disappointed her.On Thursday, Spanish media reported that Gascón – who has apologised for the comments made in old posts on X – would not be attending Saturday’s Goya awards, which are Spain’s equivalent of theOscars. It also emerged that Dos Bigotes, a publishing house specialising in LGBTQ+, gender and feminist themes, has dropped plans for a revised edition of a biographical novel that Gascón published in Mexico in 2018.Dos Bigotes said it had told the actor of its decision on Monday, informing her that the sentiments aired in her posts were inconsistent with its commitment to “equality, inclusion and diversity”. However, the publisher said that while it obviously did not share the views Gascón had expressed, it had told her that “we believe that the passage of time, and the lessons that life and time teach us, can make us better”.The previous day, two prominent leftwing Spanish politicians had weighed in on the controversy.“I feel bad about Karla Sofía Gascón’s tweets,” said the culture minister, Ernest Urtasun. “They don’t reflect Spanish society, and it pains me to say it, because her [Oscar] candidacy was very important for the country. And those tweets have tarnished that.”His colleague, the labour minister and deputy prime minister, Yolanda Díaz, was asked about the matter during a radio interview.“I was absolutely delighted when she was nominated because of the symbolism and the force of what she represents,” she told Cadena Ser. “When I read the tweets, which aren’t tweets but are reflections of what a person thinks, I was deeply upset.”Although the recently unearthed social media posts – in which Gascón called George Floyd “a drug addict swindler” and said Islam was “becoming a hotbed of infection for humanity” – are thought to have destroyed her Oscar hopes, some have questioned the scale and ferocity of the backlash the actor faces.In a column inEl País on Wednesday, the writer and journalist Sergio del Molino argued that Gascón the actor, and Gascón the person ought to be considered separately, and that she shouldn’t be penalised come Oscar night.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And if they deemed that performance prize-worthy a week ago, they still should, because the film hasn’t changed.”Another writer and journalist, Manuel Jabois,told Cadena Serthat “anyone who doesn’t feel a bit sorry for her has a problem”, while acknowledging that there was a debate to be had about how to separate Gascón’s “artistic talent from her disgusting and racist” opinions.“And there’s another debate about how far the rejection, or cancellation – by Netflix, by colleagues, by the government of this country – can go,” said Jabois. “No matter how gross I find her 10-year-old opinions, I condemn the absurd cruelty and the absurd solitude to which she’s been condemned.”Explore more on these topicsFilmEmilia PérezSpainOscarsEuropeAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

It contains examples of her own paintings, works that she collected, and also radical and joyous works that curators think she would be collecting if alive today.View image in fullscreenThis sculpture by Leilah Babirye is part of the exhibition.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianJoséphine, born 200 years ago, was an actor and performer at Paris’s Théâtre des Variétés when she met John. They fell in love and married and she became a pioneering collector and patron of the arts.She collected 15,000 objects of astonishing variety, from art by Boudin and Courbet to the finest ceramics, glassware, textiles, furniture and mechanical objects. At the time, the Bowes bought more early impressionist works than the National Gallery.Joséphine collected what she loved and hoped people would enjoy, but she was also open to advice. “She did collect things she didn’t like,” Sturrs said. “She was told by her dealers that ‘a collection of this calibre’ should really have a Goya. She didn’t like Goya.” It meant the Bowes Museum now has in its collection what has been described as“easily the greatest Goya portrait”in the UK.View image in fullscreenVisitors often wrongly assume the building was once a stately home.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianJoséphine was the driving force in creating the undeniably grand museum in Barnard Castle. The museum’s executive director, Hannah Fox, said visitors often assumed the building was once a stately home. It wasn’t. It was built as a museum “for the people” and opened in 1892, after the deaths of Joséphine and John.The exhibition aims to celebrate the “vision and the spirit” of Joséphine and includes work that curators think she would have been collecting today.All the evidence suggests Joséphine was generous and open minded. “She was much more accepting of all sorts of different people and their lifestyle than Victorian society was,” Sturrs said. “The works in the show feel authentic to the person we think Joséphine was … she would be championing these works. This is Joséphine in 2025.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Converted into a cinema in 1969, it is much loved for its screenings of hard-to-find films and counts directors Paul Thomas Anderson, John Waters and Quentin Tarantino among its fans.At the time of writing, more than 150,000 people have signeda petition launched by the cinema, who say its landlord Zedwell LSQ Ltd (owned by property developers Criterion Capital)wants to alter the lease, which would enable it to shut down the business.Six cinemagoers share their memories of the Prince Charles and tell us what makes it such a valuable institution.‘We lost it when George Lucas brought his family to see Mars Attacks!’View image in fullscreen‘The staffroom was a mini Libertines HQ’ … Louise Rodd.I worked on the box office at the Prince Charles Cinema between 1995 and 2000. Working there wasfun. I remember serving Nick Cave drinks, and not knowing who he was while everyone buzzed around him. I also embarrassed myself during a Priscilla, Queen of the Desert singalong screening. I got talking to this guy who came out for air. I asked him what he liked about the film and he responded with odd details, saying that he made the film. I, amused, did not believe him and made fun of him in my then-22 years young, gobby way. Later, my manager told me it was the director and I apologised. He was great about it.I learned how many of the greats, including Martin Scorsese, would see their films incognito in Leicester Square. We all lost it when George Lucas brought his family in to see Mars Attacks! He let the manager unashamedly take a photo with him. Natalie Portman came to see the Rocky Horror singalong and we all melted, as Léon was only recently out.The Prince Charles attracted artists, because it was £1.50 for a film matinee and £3 in the evening. Pete Doherty worked there with me too, on sweets and popcorn. I remember him telling us about his new band, and wanting to call themthe Libertines. He was so bright and recommended many great books to me. Carl Barât used to pop in after work. The staffroom was a mini Libertines HQ.View image in fullscreenLouise (third from right), her fellow ushers, and Carl Barât of the Libertines, at the Prince Charles Cinema in 1999.Photograph: Guardian CommunityThen there were the punters. They were unique and I loved so many of them. Some were in need. On very cold days, I would give a whole day’s worth of tickets to a person so they could be indoors and stay warm. We were a bit of a care hub for the local homeless and elderly people who were alone. That’s what the Charlie was about, back then.Louise Rodd, East Sussex‘Every time I return to London, I find time to visit’View image in fullscreen‘I’d skip classes to go to screenings’ … Jessica Yeung’s membership card.Photograph: Guardian CommunityI first heard about the Princes Charles Cinema from my good friend, Tom, and we often skipped film studies classes to go to screenings there between 2016 and 2019. PCC was a revelation to me as my home town doesn’t have any repertory cinema. I was introduced to great film directors such as Tati, Kurosawa, Lynch, and Friedkin. PCC also has the kindest staff with a good sense of humour. Every time I return to London, no matter how tight my schedule is, I find time to visit. Recently, it has also screened more east Asian films, which is a rarity in the UK – and very valuable for east Asian film buffs like me.Jessica SY Yeung, 36, Hong Kong‘The interruption united the audience’It was about 15 years ago, in the run-up to Christmas, and my sister and I went to see an early evening screening of Home Alone. We were expecting it to be half empty with a few families, but arrived to find them turning people away, and the cinema full of people our age (late 20s to early 30s), with hardly a child to be seen. About halfway through the film, it stopped playing, and an employee awkwardly stepped out in front of the screen. He explained that the reel we were watching was damaged; at this point he started getting heckled and I was getting a bit anxious for his wellbeing.He gave the audience two options: finishing at this point with a refund, or switching to a DVD, which wouldn’t have the same sound quality. The audience almost unanimously voted for the DVD, and we settled back in to watch the remainder, the employee leaving our screening as fast as he could. The interruption seemed to have united the audience in a strange way, because after that it became more like watching a stage production; there were audible laughs, gasps and claps as the bandits met with Kevin’s pranks, and the film closed to cheers and applause. I’ve never had a cinematic experience like it.Kat Rowles, Surrey‘We went to all-night Disney marathons every spring’I lived in London for four years during which I spent a lot of time at the Prince Charles Cinema. It was a tradition for my wife, my friends and myself to go to the all-night Disney marathons every spring, and the Muppet Christmas Carol every December. For anyone even remotely interested in film, this place is like a mecca. The vast range of films they show is astounding – from the classiest arthouse fare to absolute nonsense B-movies.Murray Rodgers, 34, Inverness‘Hundreds of people jumped out of their seats’View image in fullscreen‘When I think of that film, the Prince Charles Cinema will always be inextricably tied to it’ … Gerard Lough.Photograph: Guardian CommunityI saw a preview of the Robin Williams film One Hour Photo, which was being shown as part of the 2002 FrightFest. I’d chosen it on impulse and therefore saw it in the ideal way; going in cold with no idea of what to expect. My vivid memory of the screening was the fun of seeing hundreds of people all jump out of their seats simultaneously, when hit with the dream sequence where Williams’ eyes start bleeding profusely. Months later, the film was released, but it took years for it to be recognised for the great film it is. It is now one of my favourites and when I think of it, the Prince Charles Cinema will always be inextricably tied to it.Gerard Lough, 46, Ireland‘The audience participated with water pistols’I was a regular for many years. In the 90s the PCC used to show The Rocky Horror Picture Show at midnight every Friday. The show featured live actors and the audience was encouraged to participate with water pistols, thrown rice, cards, and costumes. It was always a great place to go after an evening in a Soho pub, especially as late licences were quite rare back then. Cinema needs imaginative programming and events to survive – it’s no longer enough to just screen a movie because I have a big screen at home and my sofa is more comfortable.Mark, São Paulo, Brazil‘One of the places that makes London worth living in’View image in fullscreen‘It shows things that nowhere else will put on’ … the Prince Charles Cinema during the Covid pandemic.Photograph: Guardian CommunityThe Prince Charles is part of the vibrant, slightly tatty but accessible Soho that seems to get smaller every year. I’ve seen such a ragbag of memorable films here (Ran; Bonnie and Clyde; The Bishop’s Wife; The Neon Demon; The Living Dead At Manchester Morgue; A Lizard in a Woman’s Skin), as well as some real rubbish. It shows things that nowhere else will put on – to packed houses – and it’s a brilliant place to catch films just before they finish their run. My son had his first cinema trip here to see Frozen, and it’s where I introduced him to the Marx Brothers. Leicester Square is an embarrassment, but the Prince Charles single-handedly redeems it. It’s one of the places that makes London worth living in.Anthony Stamp, LondonExplore more on these topicsFilmLondonFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They said the mass repetition of the same images made it “very unlikely to be random provoked pareidolia”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nor can we know for sure whether they are merely in the mind of the beholder or put there consciously or unconsciously by the artist,” they said.The Rorschach quality of Pollock’s paintings has fascinated art lovers for decades, with viewers perceiving many things in them – from scenes of classical mythology to Jungian symbols. In his book Tom and Jack, the art historian Henry Adamsclaimed Pollock hid his own signaturein his 1943 painting Mural.Jackson would cover entire canvases and used the force of his whole body to paint, often in a frenetic dancing style. His extreme form of abstraction divided critics: some praised the immediacy of the creation, while others derided its randomness, comparing it to the work of a child.But the painter remains a favourite of the art market. His works fetch tens of millions of dollars at auction, with the most expensive of all, Number 5 (1948), setting a world record when it sold for $140m in 2006.The artist died in 1956 after crashing a car while drunk.Explore more on these topicsJackson PollockPaintingArtBipolar disorderResearchnewsShareReuse this content"

And I said: ‘Are you trying to remove that?’ And she said: ‘Yes.’ And I said: ‘That doesn’t come off!”The actor had been shooting scenes which occur late in the film, in which his character, a Hungarian architect, is elderly and using a wheelchair.These scenes required considerably ageing makeup and hair dye, as well as light prosthetics. Brody said the makeup artist apologised, before adding: “This is going in my diary.”Brody is frontrunner to win the best actor Oscar for his role in the film, 22 years after his victory for playing another Holocaust survivor, in Roman Polanski’s The Pianist.Brady Corbet’s film The Brutalistis nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture, best director and acting nods for Brody’s co-stars Felicity Jones and Guy Pearce.Brody had his noseaccidentally brokenduring a fight scene on Spike Lee’s 1999 film Summer of Sam, and has broken his nose on two other separate occasions.The Brutalist makes frequent reference to his distinctive feature, with the suggestion that it was broken as a consequence of ill-treatment by the Nazis. Brody’s character, László Tóth, is not a real person, but Corbet took inspiration for him from the Hungarian postwar designer and architectMarcel Lajos Breuer.Actors have frequently donned prosthetic noses the better to resemble historical figures in awards-bait biopics. A nose also loomed large in last year’s Oscars discourse: the false one worn by Bradley Cooper as Leonard Bernstein in Maestro.Some critics felt its size was antisemitic – an accusation rejected by the conductor’s children, who collaborated on the film and said: “It happens to be true that Leonard Bernstein had a nice, big nose.”Meryl Streep’s delicately proportioned false nose as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady helped the actor take her third Oscar in 2011. Nicole Kidman’s more substantial appendage in Virginia Woolf biopic The Hours secured Kidman her first win in 2003.Announcing the win at the podium, presenter Denzel Washington said: “The Oscar goes to, by a nose, Nicole Kidman.”Explore more on these topicsFilmAdrien BrodyThe BrutalistFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Rattle’s accounts of Das Lied von der Erde and the Sixth and Ninth Symphonies have already appeared, all of them taken from performances in the Isarphilharmonie im Gasteig in Munich, and the new version of the Seventh was recorded there last November.When complete, this will be Rattle’s second Mahler survey, following his cycle with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in the 1980s and 90s (he went on to rerecord some of the symphonies with the Berliner Philharmoniker too, but not all of them). Inevitably, there are distinct differences in his approach to the Seventh across the 30-odd years that separate the Birmingham and Munich versions, as well as between this latest one and a live recording that was included ina composite box of the Mahler symphoniesissued by the Berlin Philharmonic four years ago.It’s in the outer movements that Rattle’s approach has evolved most significantly, while in the central triptych – the two spectral Nachtmusik that frame a sardonic scherzo – it’s the sheer brilliance of the Bavarian RSO’s playing that grabs the attention, every detail and instrumental effect shiveringly vivid, and all perfectly captured in sound that is so much better than either of Rattle’s earlier versions.At home with Simon Rattle: ‘There are still things I feel are beyond me’Read moreThe Munich Rattle seems to resist the temptation to micromanage every phrase in the way that the Berlin Rattle sometimes tended to, and in his reading of the opening movement of the Seventh, and especially in its usually problematic finale, that directness pays dividends. There’s no attempt to smooth over the grotesquely abrupt, almost comedic transitions in the finale, so that the movement emerges as what it is: Mahler’s most provocative challenge to the conventions of symphonic continuity. Alongside the versions by Claudio Abbado from Berlin and Lucerne, and Riccardo Chailly’s with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, this must now be one of the finest Mahler 7s on disc.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.music.apple.com.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Agood mattress improves your sleep, say mattress makers – and they would, wouldn’t they? But they’re right. The older I get, the more I know it. When I was 20, I could sleep anywhere: a friend’s floor, a filthy sofa – even a phone box one night. These days I won’t get a single one of 40 winks if I’m not lying on a decent mattress. Comfy but firm, cosy but breathable, and with loads of cool spots for my feet.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Today’s best mattresses promise all this and more. Gone are the days when your biggest decision was between a sprung double or a sprung king size. Pocket springs are still around, but they face stiff – well, medium firm – competition from hybrid mattresses that combine springs and memory foam to provide that all-important balance of comfort and support.Current in-vogue bed brands tend not to have showrooms, so you can’t normally try out their mattresses before you buy. Instead, they vacuum-shrink them in the factory for delivery straight to your door. These bed-in-a-box mattresses come with long trials, but you’re still buying blind. I’ve tried to shed some light on which are the best by trying them out for you.The best bedding brands interior designers use at home, from luxury linen to cool cottonRead moreI, along with a panel of my family members, tested six bestselling bed-in-a-box mattresses. Among them was a pocket sprung model and five hybrids (which combine memory foam with other materials), covering various degrees of firmness, features and price tags. I’ll test more – including at least one all-foam mattress – in the coming months. Meanwhile, here’s how my family got on with our top picks, including the one my dad gave up on and the one my niece didn’t want to give back.At a glanceBest overall mattress:Otty Original HybridFrom £499.99 (single) to £874.99 (emperor) at OttyBest mattress for couples:Simba Hybrid ProFrom £799 (single) to £1,349 (super king) at SimbaBest budget mattress:Ikea ValevågFrom £149 (single) to £359 (super king) at IkeaWhy you should trust meI’ve spent three decades testing products, from mattress toppers toheated clothes airers, so I’m professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically improve our lives by buying their stuff. I also have a solid background in napping, insomnia and swearing at alarm clocks, so I welcomed the chance to sleep on the job.How I testedView image in fullscreenBalancing a glass of water on the mattresses tested their motion isolation qualities.Photograph: Jane HoskynFirst, I needed some sleepers. I wanted a broad range of feedback from people of varying sizes who sleep in various positions. I asked my dad (84), my niece (22), my sister and our husbands to join my mattress panel. We each spent at least a fortnight (and sometimes months) sleeping on an allocated mattress.Before we divvied them up, my panel assembled to offer their impressions of every mattress on test. We turned our house into a mattress showroom and invited everyone to sit, bounce and lay down on every test sample, alone and together. This enabled us to compare the mattresses side by side and get an overview of their pros and cons. I collected scores out of 10 for everyone’s assessment of firmness and other factors such as breathability, motion isolation and overall comfort, then worked out our average score for each mattress.We then divided the mattresses and began the sleeping tests. To quantify sleep quality, I used thePittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, which uses a questionnaire to assess factors such as how long it takes to nod off. I used this as the basis and added questions such as whether they felt back pain or woke up in the night. Some of us also used our smartwatches to gather sleep-tracking stats.View image in fullscreenWeights measured any sinking of the mattresses.Photograph: Jane HoskynOther factors were easier to test on my own. I used dumbbell weights to measure how far each mattress sank under various weights, while an infrared thermometer and heat pad revealed how fast they could cool under a warm body. A glass of water on the surface gave an idea of how well the mattress would absorb the movement of a restless partner (“motion isolation”).Environmental credentials were another important consideration. Mattress makers are secretive about the life cycles of their products, but I discovered what I could about the materials used, their manufacture and their potential for recycling. I also checked verified reviews from paying customers and excluded any mattresses for which delivery and customer service received significant negative feedback.Read on for my guide to the best mattresses, based on these thorough tests.The mattresses sourced for this article are being donated to two charities: Southampton-based poverty support groupScratchand Hampshire-based survivors’ advocacy organisationStop Domestic Abuse.To dive deeper in to my testing process, readhow I tested mattresses for comfort, cost and sustainabilityThe best mattresses you can buy in 2025View image in fullscreen‘Wonderfully breathable’: the Ikea Valevåg.Photograph: Jane HoskynBest overall mattress:Otty Original HybridView image in fullscreenOtty’s flagship offering is a firm but cosy and supremely comfortable mattress that helped me sleep fantastically from the first night of testing. The only other that managed this was the Simba Hybrid Pro, which is hundreds of pounds more expensive.Why we love itThe Otty has an outstanding balance of support, cushioning and breathability. My husband and I slept on it for two months and were sad to see it go. It feels ergonomically supportive from edge to edge, with no dip in the middle even after several weeks.It’s not too hard for comfort, though. As a small side sleeper, I get lower back pain on very firm mattresses, but this didn’t happen with the Otty. My sleep tracker also revealed that I woke up briefly in the night (“microarousals”) less often than usual. The surface felt breathable and cooled down faster than most other hybrids in my heat-retention tests.When I asked my family to dive in, they put the Otty fourth overall on firmness – squarely at the firm end of the wide medium-firm spectrum – and gave it the highest rating for overall comfort, with an average of 8.3/10.It’s a shame that …the firmness we loved won’t be welcomed by everyone. If you’re upgrading from a well-used pocket-sprung mattress, the strong flat surface of the Otty may take some adapting to.Suitable for:anyone who wants to upgrade to a hybrid without forking out four figuresType:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 8/10Depth:25cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first 12 months, then every three monthsTrial period:100 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£40Sustainability credentials:foam is CertiPUR- and Europur-approved for environmental standardsFrom £499.99 (single) to £874.99 (emperor) at OttyBest mattress for couples:Simba Hybrid ProView image in fullscreenThis sumptuous mattress also had me sleeping soundly from the off. It’s expensive, and won’t be firm enough for some, but its wonderfully comfy surface makes you feel like you’re sleeping on a cloud – and it may even bring peace if you share your bed with a fidgety partner (or the dog, or the kids).Why we love itThe medium-firm Simba Hybrid Pro is supportive enough for most people, but it has a cosy, yielding feel that may be down to its upper layer of natural wool. The overall effect is luxurious and decidedly soporific.The Hybrid Pro had the best motion isolation in my test. The mattress doesn’t completely lack bounce, especially on a slatted base, but its foam layers absorb movement so well that it genuinely helped me and my husband sleep through each other’s tossing and turning.Temperature regulation was less impressive, and I wanted to disown my armpits a few times after waking up. The mattress also softened noticeably in the middle after several weeks of testing, but this is common with hybrids and may be welcomed by sleepers who like the way foam adapts to your body over time.Our panel’s collective firmness score was 7/10 and our comfort average was an excellent 8.1/10, although my husband and sister found it a bit too soft.It’s a shame that …the price tag is chunky, especially for a mattress that may not maintain its support consistently enough for firm-bed fans.Suitable for:couples who crave a bit of peace (but still want to share a bed)Type:hybridFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 7/10Depth:28cmCover:unzip to wash at 40CTurn or rotate:rotate once a month for first three months, then every three monthsTrial period:200 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£50Sustainability credentials: Simba is B Corp certified and aiming for net zero by 2030.

It’s not a hybrid but instead wraps its pocket springs in slim layers of polyfoam for cushioning. It feels much less robust than its pricier rivals, but it’d be a great choice for the kids or the spare room.Why we love itSimplicity has its benefits. The Valevåg expanded to full size faster than the hybrids and was much lighter. Finally, a mattress I could lift and manoeuvre by myself, including up and down stairs.For similar reasons, Ikea’s mattress is wonderfully breathable and may feel cooler in summer than a hybrid. With no memory foam to trap heat, it cooled down faster than any other mattress in my temperature-control test. Hi-tech open-cell foam is all very well for letting the air circulate, but plain old springs do the same for a lot less cash.My 22-year-old niece, Alex, slept on the Valevåg for two months and was energetically reluctant to give it back. She said it felt supportive enough without being “solid like some of the others”.It’s a shame that …the Valevåg doesn’t hide its cheapness. Our average firmness score was 6.8/10, which barely qualifies for “medium firm” (although Ikea does make a “firm” version). The bounce of the springs also means motion isolation is poor.Suitable for:young buyers starting out or for a guest roomType:pocket sprungFirmness:advertised as medium firm, panel rated as 6.8/10Depth:24cmCover:not removableTurn or rotate:not neededTrial period:365 nightsWarranty:10 yearsOld mattress recycling:£40 via theMattress Recycling PeopleSustainability credentials:2025 target of 20% recycled content in all Ikea mattress foamsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

If, like my sister Maeve and her husband, Ben, you crave the strong pushback of a solid mattress, you will love it. Lucky for them, they got to test it for two months.This gigantic, heavy hybrid also delivers outstanding temperature regulation and motion isolation. Maeve and Ben reported that the “silky surface with long dents” kept them cool without feeling cold, and after years on a pocket-sprung mattress, they declared its movement-absorbing powers to be “life changing”.It didn’t make the final cut because …this level of firmness is too hard for many, including me.

It has a solid central section that’s firmer on one side than the other, so you flip it (with a little effort) to select your level of firmness. You then zip on a thick, spongy “comfort layer” – much like a mattress topper – on whichever side you choose.My weight tests and family feedback revealed the two sides to be disappointingly similar. Both were too soft for Maeve and Ben, who slept on this mattress for a fortnight before switching to the much firmer Origin. Their daughter Alex tried it out and also found it too soft, as did my husband.The best sleep aids recommended by experts: from blue light-blockers to apps to help you napRead moreI liked the Wunderflip much more than my family did. Its supportive base layers provide strong, consistent pushback beneath the cushioned top layer, especially when you choose the “firmer” side. The foamy cushioning is brilliant at absorbing movement, and it all feels extremely robust.It didn’t make the final cut because …the “flip for firmness” idea doesn’t really work, because both sides are similarly soft – perhaps because the removable “comfort layer” is so soft. The hulking weight (more than 50kg for a double) makes it tricky to manoeuvre.

But it’s a very firm mattress that divided my family on its comfort levels.I had allocated the Panda to my dad for the sleep test, but he couldn’t get on with it, describing it as “hard on my joints”. It felt too firm for me, too. My husband and brother-in-law – both much taller than my dad and me – loved the solid support, though, and noted that it’s perfect for reading in bed sat up.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s too firm for some.

Instead of packing a takeaway in a plastic box and whizzing it to your door, companies such as Otty, Eve and Simba shrink their mattresses into metres and metres of plastic and deliver them to your home.Is it necessary? No, but like Deliveroo, it’s convenient. The downside is that you’re left with an awful lot of packaging. I mean, ahideousamount. Your recycling collection may take the huge cardboard boxes, but in most areas (including mine), they won’t take the metres and metres of polyurethane wrapping. You’ll have to take it to a household waste centre – unless you’re redecorating and need a dust sheet.Bed-in-a-box companies don’t have showrooms, so they let you sleep on your new mattress for months before you have to decide whether to keep it. My experience of these trials has been fairly smooth, with Otty and Emma both collecting mattresses and issuing refunds quickly. However, neither team was directly employed by the brands (only Ikea sent a branded van when delivering), and the Emma team didn’t know what they were collecting.No delivery teams offered to take away my old mattress. Most brands offer to recycle old mattresses for a fee of about £50, but you have to organise that in addition to ordering your new mattress. It also seems expensive given that my local council’s recycling team collects mattresses for £20.Bed-in-a-box warranties typically cover 10 years. That’s excellent, but you’ll have to be careful you don’t void your guarantee by, for example, standing on the mattress or using an electric blanket (as foam can soften and even crack under too much heat).How do I know it’s a good deal?It’sBlack Fridayall year round in mattress world. Bed-in-a-box companies seem to regard “sale” prices as the rule rather than the exception, andSimba,EmmaandDormeohave all been sanctioned by the ASA for misleading marketing tactics.There are genuine deals to be found, however.

In these fancier coffee spots, everyone’s dependable, unfussy go-to is being eclipsed by a newer import from Australia and New Zealand: the long black.Conducting an unofficial survey of coffee spots, I noticed nearly every barista had a slightly different explanation of the drink. “It’s basically exactly the same as an americano,” one whispered conspiratorially. “It’s a shorter black coffee, the same size as a flat white,” explained another. The final barista I spoke to just shook her head in quiet disappointment when I asked if long black was just a more pretentious way of asking for an americano.What is the difference between a long black and an americano? Last year, 2.1 million people watcheda viral Instagram reel from the coffee shop Tamp, in Chiswick, west London, which asked that exact question.Despite its name, a long black is shorter than an americano, but some baristas also swear by adding the espresso second, on top of the hot water. This ensures that “the hot water is slightly cooler in the cup and closer in temperature to the espresso that’s coming out of the machine”, explains Ollie Simon, of the New Zealand-founded speciality roaster Allpress. “If you’re pouring hot water straight on to espresso, you’re agitating the drink, and losing some of the more volatile aromas and flavours.”View image in fullscreenA long black is prepared at Laynes in Leeds.Photograph: LaynesLeeds speciality coffee shop Laynes also adds the espresso second. “It’s a faster way to do it, and espresso is meant to be quick,” says owner Dave Olejnik. “When you wallop a load of hot water on to an espresso, you also start to break down some of the structure, texture, and the crema, which sits across the top. Honestly, you just get a better-looking drink if you brew coffee into water.”Sales of the long black have been steadily rising in the UK. In 2023, according to one small survey, it was London’s fifth most popular coffee order, and accounted for 9% of all sales in the capital. Kaffeine, in Soho, has been selling long blacks since it opened in 2009. Owner Peter Dore-Smith was born in Melbourne, but is a long-term Londoner. Along with nearby Flat White (founded by Australians and New Zealanders, and widely credited with first popularising flat whites in the UK), his shop is a key fixture in London’s antipodean coffee scene. He also reckons that he was among the very first people to sell long blacks inLondon. “I should open a shop called Long Black, shouldn’t I?” he laughs. “That’s what everyone comes here for.”Dore-Smith ushers me behind the bar to watch Katarina, one of his senior baristas, in action. She uses an upturned espresso mug to bring everything nearer to the spout, and brews into a 5oz cup with hot water: the same size you would typically use for a flat white. Aside from size, most of these things don’t have much effect on taste, she explains, but it all helps to make your cuppa look nicer at the end. This is important when you don’t have the canvas of flashy latte art to play with.“You’ll see there’s quite a remarkable difference in the flavour profile,” Dore-Smith says. He’s right; with a long black, the flavour of the beans is clearer and much more vibrant, with notes of blackberry, caramel and nuttiness all coming through. In comparison, the americano feels weak and watery. I’m sold.View image in fullscreenKaffeine’s version of the long black.Photograph: Kaffeine“Everybody is basically like: whoa, that’s so much better,” Dore-Smith says. “I’ve noticed, working behind the bar, that the long black is increasing in popularity, and it’s much more prevalent.” Sales of the drink at Kaffeine crept up by 4% from November to mid-January, while black coffee in general is also proving more popular.“I’d liken it to people moving from big lattes down to flat whites,” says Olejnik. “Moving from big americanos down to long blacks feels like a mirror movement, if you like.”Like the flat white, the long black originated in Australia or New Zealand, depending on who you ask. The two countries are renowned for their high-quality brews; if a spot is owned by an Australian or a New Zealander, it’s usually a pretty solid indicator that the coffee will be on point.Dore-Smith attributes the influence of Australian coffee to the wave of Italians who immigrated to Australia in the 1950s and 60s and brought their knowledge of espresso-brewing with them. He also thinks the country’s geography and “very strong anti-drink-driving culture” play their part. “If you want to go out and meet a mate in London, you go to the pub, have a few pints and get the train home,” he says. But in many parts of Australia with poorer public transport, “you have to drive home,” he says. “So you go out and get a really good cup of coffee instead.”The £5 coffee is coming – but should we swallow it?Read moreNew Zealanders think along the same lines. “Public transport is not a big thing, so you catch up over coffee rather than a pint,” says Simon, who is originally from Auckland. He also offers up the theory that the coffee scene in the two countries has developed in relative isolation. “I don’t want to say it evolved in a bubble, but being so far away, it has kind of done its own thing.”“They’re far less influenced by what I would consider American cafe culture,” says Olejnik, “the Starbucks-ification of coffee, and putting a huge drink in your hand with a great big comfy sofa. That culture didn’t land down there in quite the same way.” Instead, it’s about “fine-tuning the original Italian espresso bar menu, and the notion that there’s value in high quality, as opposed to high quantity,” he says. “It has had huge implications for global coffee-drinking culture.”As Aussie and New Zealand coffee creeps on to more menus in the UK, will the long black start to become as popular as the flat white? The drink is yet to break into any of the UK’s major high street coffee chains. In 2010, Costa became the first high street chain to introduce the flat white to its menu; it is now one of the brand’s most popular orders. Still, it has no plans to introduce long blacks, a spokesperson confirmed. So the antipodeans have not yet staged a complete coup – but if you’re a seasoned americano drinker, you might consider switching your order up.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But how do we change the system to encourage people we would find more relatable into politics? My suggestion was maybe we should be treating jobs in politics more like proper jobs and paying higher wages. It seems crazy that you could be working in a general job in London with nowhere near the same responsibilities as the prime minister, but earning more money. The kind of people becoming MPs are already quite wealthy, successful; it’s like a hobby rather than an actual job.RachelI think they should be paid less! Half the problem with politics currently is it is a career path: people going into it to make money, make contacts, get into business. I think people should be going into politics to make a difference in the world and in communities. I’m not saying they should be living on a pittance, but I don’t think what should entice them in is huge salaries. I say the same about trade union leaders: there’s an argument that they should be earning the average salary.AdamIf MPs were paid more, they wouldn’t feel as if they have to have a second job. Change things so they actually can’t, with rules about gifts, bribery and lobbying. A £90,000 salary is a lot of money, but compared with other jobs in the City, it doesn’t feel very competitive.RachelI think it should be their only job. And I don’t think Farage is going to go hungry if he doesn’t do his littleCameos. Adam felt that one of the most major things you can do is manage the country, and it was similar to managing a business.

All around us, the jagged peaks of the Vanoise massif pierce the sky, glinting in the clear morning light. As we walk, Matthieu, my snowshoeing guide, points out fresh tracks – mountain hare, roe deer, fox – and on the mountainside we spy ibex: first a lone male, then a group surveying us from on high.Champagny-le-Haut, a 1,500-metre-high glacial valley in the French Alps close to the Italian border, is the gateway to theVanoise national park. In summer it offers pristine mountain hikes and waterfalls, while in winter, with snow closing the road beyond the pretty hamlet of Le Bois where I’m staying, it’s a frozen, protected wonderland. A world away from the busy ski resorts elsewhere in La Plagne, it’s perfect for a more low-key, affordable winter holiday in the heart of nature.View image in fullscreenJane Dunford snowshoeing at Le Bois.Photograph: Jane DunfordAt Friburge, the next hamlet along, we pass a tiny church, almost swallowed by snow. Icicles the size of my forearm hang from shut-up chalets. Just one family lives here year-round, says Matthieu.The sense of being engulfed by the wild is heightened at my campsite base, on the edge of Le Bois. It’s owned by Huttopia, a French family-run business known for its eco-credentials and sites deep in nature – inspired by camps in Canada’s national parks. It’s open here in winter for the first time, with eight new wooden cabins dotted beneath snow-laden larch trees. Each sleeps six, with a spacious living and kitchen area, two double bedrooms downstairs and a mezzanine in the eaves. There’s a terrace covered by the oversized gable roof, with table and benches, and nice touches like toboggans and free use of snowshoes. A restaurant opens at the weekends.Le Bois itself, on the banks of the Doron river, is picturesque, with a church, smattering of houses and theEspace Glacialisin what was the priest’s house. Interactive displays tell the story of glaciers, their shaping of the landscape and human life – and their fragility (photos show dramatic shrinking locally over recent decades). It is Unesco’sinternational year of glaciers’ preservationin 2025, and several educational events are planned here too.I’m cocooned by the silence, the mountains still visible through the trees beyond my window. It’s my kind of apres-skiChampagny is part of the wider La Plagne area – awarded a “Flocon Vert” (green snowflake) for its sustainability efforts last year, from policies to reduce carbon emissions to wildlife protection initiatives. Visitors are encouraged to come by train, and I’d travelled from London to Paris on Eurostar and onwards to Chambéry and Moûtiers (about a half-hour taxi ride from Le Bois). It takes a day, but the gentle pace, with the landscape slowly changing, suits my sleepy final destination.But while it may be laid-back, there is plenty to do. Le Bois is a centre for cross-country skiing, with 24km of clearly signposted tracks of varying difficulty weaving around the valley (different routes are earmarked for snowshoeing and hiking). At the Nordic chalet in the village centre there are maps, but ski equipment (and guides) must be booked inChampagny-en-Vanoise, further down the valley at 1,250 metres. Le Bois has an area for tobogganing too, dog sledding and horse riding can be arranged, and each year a large igloo is crafted, its icy interior intricately carved with cartoon characters.View image in fullscreenThe Champagny ice tower offers climbers a 22m high climbing challenge.Photograph: Olivier AllamandAs night falls I wander up toRefuge du Bois, a cosy chalet with restaurant and dorms, run this season by young “guardians” Emma and Antoine. The Savoyard menu features local classics and lots of cheese – the fondue is warming and filling.The next day I take the free shuttle bus back down the valley to Champagny-en-Vanoise. It’s a windy 5km drive through steep gorges with views of Courchevel in the distance. It feels like an authentic village, with little of the rampant tourist development seen elsewhere in the Alps. There’s a surprisingly large swimming pool (the roof retracts in summer for spectacular mountain views) and spa, while the Church of St Sigismond has an impressive baroque gold altar dating from 1710 (“built with money from cheese!” says my guide).From the village centre, a cable car whizzes visitors up to 1,970metres and the expansive slopes of La Plagne and Paradiski. It’s the first time I’ve skied for years, but under the patient tuition of my instructor, Bruno, I tackle the plentiful blue runs (there is something for all levels in this vast snowy playground, with great ski touring and off-piste too). Skiing developed here from the 1960s, and we pass several of La Plagne’s varied resorts, known for their distinctive retro style. We stop for lunch away from the crowds inChalet du Plan Bois, a delightful family-run place with wonderful views and cuisine to match (from salad with pear and goats cheese tocassolette d’escargotsand Savoy sausage in wine).

It’s my kind of apres-ski.Champagny-le-Haut is sheltered from the sun for most of the winter, making it the perfect location for an unusual attraction – a 22-metreice tower. Used for the UIAA Ice Climbing World Cup, it looks like a sculpture, made of steel and wood, with sprayed water frozen in cascades. It’s open for lessons to anyone over 10, and I sign up for a session with mountain guide Damien. Strapped into a safety harness, I kick into the frozen surface with cramponed feet and, using my ice pick, slowly ascend, trying to forget I’ve not got a head for heights.View image in fullscreenThe village of Champagny-le-Haut.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyCross-country skiing comes a little more naturally, and later I follow a route that passes through the campsite grounds (Huttopia’s safari-style tents must be great in summer). I glide beside streams, weaving through the forest, and manage not to fall, my limbs satisfyingly achy after a couple of hours, my face tingling from the fresh air.That night a full moon lights the valley. There’s no need for a torch as I walk up to the Refuge du Bois for dinner. Later, I sit outside my cabin beneath the trees, drinking in the beauty of it all until the cold gets the better of me, the busyness of the world a distant memory.The trip was provided byLa Plagne.

During the election campaign, Trump had suggested he would withdraw US troops from Japan, contingent on Tokyo’s willingness to make abigger financial contributionto their countries’ postwar alliance.The gambit worked. During Trump’s five-nation visit to Asia in late 2017, he and Abe, who wasassassinatedin 2022,bonded over a round of golf– a sport for which the Japanese leader had apparently developed a sudden passion – and gourmet hamburgers.For the remainder of Trump’s term, Abe supported the US administration with a fervour that eluded many of his contemporaries. US troops remained inJapan, and the bilateral security treaty – the cornerstone of Japan’s postwar foreign policy – survived unscathed.As he prepares to fly to Washington on a three-day visit, all eyes are on whether Japan’s current leader, Shigeru Ishiba, will be able to re-create Abe’s personal rapport with Trump, althoughgolf diplomacyis unlikely to play a part for the cigarette-smokingplastic-modelling enthusiast.When they sign a joint statement in Washington after their talks on Friday, Japan will be looking for familiar guarantees from Trump: that the US will defend Japan, including in any conflict with China over the disputedSenkaku islands, a commitment to stability in the Taiwan strait, and continued backing for the region’s opposition toNorth Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.And while Trump’s threats to impose tariffs have so far targeted Mexico, Canada and China, Ishiba will be aware that Japan – which has a $56bn trade surplus with the US – could also be sucked into a trade war.“We have a lot of topics to discuss,” Ishiba told MPs this week. “I hope to set priorities and get results in the limited time we have.”In return for offering security guarantees Trump will expect reciprocal action from Ishiba, a low-energy, cautious politician unaccustomed to horse-trading with the leader of the world’s biggest economy.But he will not go to Washington empty-handed. Like his recent predecessors, Ishiba wants toraise defence spendingto 2% of GDP by 2027 – a commitment that will almost certainly mean buying US-manufactured military hardware. He will remind Trump that Japan has led foreign direct investment in the US for the past five years and highlight Japanese companies’ record in creating jobs for Americans. He might also outline plans for new Japanese investments, including in a $44bn gas pipeline in Alaska.That Ishiba will be the second foreign leader, afterBenjamin Netanyahu, to meet Trump “says something about Japan’s strategic weight”, said Nicholas Szechenyi, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Japan’s foreign policy has always been ‘America First,’ and if Ishiba can deliver that message eloquently he will establish a foundation for strong alliance ties.”Szechenyi added: “Will Ishiba succeed? The media will be looking for signs of personal chemistry, and that is important in diplomacy. But the message Ishiba brings is profound, and what might at first appear to be a hastily arranged bilateral meeting could serve as a starting point for shaping the regional balance of power in favour of the US alliance network in Asia during Trump 2.0.”Tobias Harris, founder and principal at Japan Foresight, a political risk advisory firm, said Ishiba’s trip carries considerable domestic risks, as he attempts to assert control of hisscandal-riven, divided Liberal Democratic party[LDP].“How Ishiba handles his relationship with Trump will draw intense scrutiny and carry immense risks for Ishiba’s standing at home,” Harris said. “If he is overly ingratiating, he will be grilled by lawmakers in parliament.”Ishiba has also come under pressure over how he will broach the subject of Trump’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization and the Paris climate accord, as well as his administration’s now-paused tariffs on Canada and Mexico.“The Japanese media will be watching closely how Trump addresses Ishiba, what his body language looks like, and whether he uses his first name – and if he is unable to receive assurances from Trump on key issues,” Harris added.“It is a risky meeting for Ishiba. He could face tough questioning at home for not standing up for Japan’s interests, but if he fails to bring home reassurances from Trump or to forge a sufficiently cordial relationship with him, his rivals in the LDP could step up the pressure.”Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

Fighting raged for the best part of last week.“I arrived here in agony,” said Mamy Esther, 40, who suffered a pelvic injury in a bombing last week and is being treated at Kyeshero hospital.Doctors at the facility walked around examining patients, many in bandages and plaster casts, lying in beds in about 20 tents outside the hospital building.Esther said she had lost her six-year-old son in the explosion that left her initially unable to walk. “I am recovering little by little,” she said.View image in fullscreenDoctors review an X-ray showing a bullet lodged in the hand of a patient in the grounds of Kyeshero hospital.Photograph: Marie Jeanne Munyerenkana/EPAAt Virunga hospital, Chadrack Kabumba, 20, nursed bullet wounds to his knee and shoulders after he was shot four times on his way to check if his property had been vandalised, the day after M23 entered Goma. “By divine grace, I hope that I will recover,” he said, sitting on his bed. Other patients nearby screamed and writhed in pain.Esther and Kabumba are among hundreds of people in Goma wounded in the fighting who are in desperate need of blood.The fighting has caused an influx to hospitals and deepened the crisis in the city of 2 million people, a humanitarian hub for those displaced.At the start of the offensive on Goma, Kyeshero, which is supported by Doctors without Borders, mainly received patients with shrapnel wounds, the charity said. Now it mostly treats bullet wounds.On the first day the fighting eased, the hospital received nearly 140 wounded people at its triage unit, many of whom were admitted.mapThe conflict has disrupted transport routes, cutting off flows of aid, food and medical supplies. It has also made it impossible for overwhelmed hospitals to move patients to Bukavu, the capital of neighbouring South Kivu province.In response to the need for blood, Goma residents have queued in different parts of the city to donate. Among them was Prince Muhindo at HealAfricahospital, in the city centre, on Wednesday. “I realise that many people are suffering greatly from the lack of blood following the recent fighting, said Muhindo, 25, a motorcyclist. “To put an end to this situation, I resolved to save lives of my own free will.”Muhindo said some of his family members had died of bullet wounds when M23 took over the city.In Katindo neighbourhood, people sat on chairs at a blood donation centre. Masika Mireille, 38, a housekeeper, regularly donates, but this time she was doing it for a deeper and symbolic purpose, she said.View image in fullscreenA wounded woman arrives for treatment at Kyeshero hospital.Photograph: Marie Jeanne Munyerenkana/EPA“To demonstrate the resilience of our city, I give my blood to save these thousands of people who need it,” she said. “It is my responsibility as a patriot.”Innocent Gashamba, who is charge of blood collection at the provincial blood transfusion centre in Goma, said it had been running four donation sessions a day since Saturday, with a target of 200 bags a day. “There is a crying need for blood,” he said, urging the city’s residents to “participate massively”, adding “blood has no substitute”.M23, a Tutsi-led group that the DRC, UN, US and other countries say Rwanda supports, claims its aim is to protect the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities. It is one of more than 100 armed groups fighting to make territorial gains in the DRC’s mineral-rich east to fund their operations.Rwanda denies backing M23, but UN experts say there is solid evidence to the contrary, and that Rwanda uses the militia to extract and export valuable minerals.M23 declared a unilateral ceasefire “for humanitarian reasons” starting on Tuesday, as humanitarian organisations and the international community stepped up calls for the creation of safe corridors to get vital items in to Goma.But its fightersbroke the ceasefireon Wednesday, launching another offensive in eastern DRC and seizing a mining town in South Kivu province.Two regional blocs – the Southern African Development Community and the East African Community – will hold a joint summit in Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania, on Friday and Saturday to discuss the conflict.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

InOklahoma, teachers and elected leaders are fighting the passage of a proposed rule requiring schools to ask for proof of US citizenship during enrollment.“Children – they can have the capacity to learn algebra only if they have a supportive environment,” said Alejandra Vázquez Baur, co-founder and director of the National Newcomer Network, a national coalition of educators and researchers working to support immigrant children and families. “And so every teacher is already an advocate.”Amid immigration raids, now teachers also have to grapple with their students’ difficult questions and fears about deportations. “Children don’t see immigration status. Children see friends,” she added. “What happens if students see their classmates plucked out of a classroom? So how do you explain these things to them?”In Chicago, educators had started preparing months ago for the impact of Trump’s deportation agenda on public school students. Teachers and school administrators coordinated safety plans, and brushed up on their legal rights.Even so, school staff found themselves rushing to support parents and children who were suddenly terrified to leave their homes, said Ashley Perez, a licensed clinical social worker at schools in Chicago’s Brighton Park neighborhood.As images of Ice agents ramming down the doors of undocumented immigrants circulated online and in the news, Perez – who is the director of clinical services at Brighton Park neighborhood council – said children began increasingly expressing worry that their parents would be taken away. She recently visited with a family that had not come to school for more than a week after inauguration day, and coaxed them to start sending the kids in by reviewing all the ways that teachers could protect them, and offering to help walk all the kids to and from campus.“And then we all sort of sat down, the parents and the kiddos, in their dining room to process some of their feelings,” Perez said. “Because there’s so much fear right now … and schools should be a place of stability, not fear.”In Chicago’s Pilsen – a largely Mexican American neighborhood – Chalkbeat Chicagoreportedthat one high school principal told parents that though the school was doing the utmost to keep children safe, he would understand families’ decision to stay home.“Please know that while our school is safe and that our students will be protected while they are in school, I also understand that there is a lot of fear and anxiety among our families,” Juan Carlos Ocon, the principal, wrote in a message obtained by Chalkbeat.Roy, a second-grade teacher in Chicago’s south-west side, said he had already been fielding questions from his six- and seven-year-olds.View image in fullscreenA sign on a storefront in Chicago.Photograph: Vincent Alban/ReutersMany of his students are new arrivals from Venezuela, who wound up in his classroom after a long, and often traumatic migration. “Last year, one of my students who came here from Venezuela would tell me stories about people not making it in the jungle, while crossing rivers,” he said. “ I was just not prepared for that type of conversation.”Now that the Trump administration has begun targeting Chicago for large-scale raids and moved to rescind the temporary legal status that has protected thousands of Venezuelans from deportation, Roy’s students are facing a fresh wave of uncertainty and trauma. The Guardian is not publishing his full name and the school where he teaches due to concerns his students and their families could be targeted by immigration enforcement.Many of his students too young to fully understand what is going on, or why the adults in their lives have been on edge – but others are keenly aware. Not long after Trump was elected, a student from Honduras explained to all his classmates what it means to get deported. “He said, ‘If you’re from Venezuela, you’re going back there. If you’re from El Salvador you’re going back there’ And he pointed to himself, ‘I’m from Honduras, so I’m going back there.’”Horrified, Roy tried to reassure the kids that he was going to make sure that everyone could stay right where they were, that the school had security that wouldn’t let Ice in. And he tried to joke around a bit. “I said, ‘You know, if they really do send you back, I’ll come too. We’re going to go to the beach,’” he said.For older children, some of whom are also worried about what they should be doing to support undocumented parents, Stephanie Garcia – the director of community schools for the Brighton Park neighborhood council (BPNC) – said she had emphasized the importance of staying focused on school, “so that their parents don’t have anything extra to worry about right now”.At after-school programs and community events, the BPNC has also encouraged older kids and young adults to get to know their own rights and make plans with their parents. “It’s difficult to tell a high school freshman, ‘Hey, encourage your parents to have a deportation plan just in case,’” she said. “Unfortunately, here we are.”It’s a scene playing out in many cities. In New York, teachers are using encrypted group chats to alert each other of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) sightings, and residents are volunteering to escort the children of undocumented immigrants to and from school. In Los Angeles on Monday, the school superintendent, Albert Carvalho, said that attendance across the school district, the second largest in the US, was down 20%, with about 80,000 students missing. He attributed the absences to both fear and activism, as students participated in nationwide protests against Trump’s immigration policies.“We have to figure this out,” said Emma Lozano, a pastor of Chicago’s Lincoln United Methodist church and a member of the city’s board of education. “It just gets me because they are hurting our children, our babies. It just isn’t right.”Parents, too, are struggling to explain the raids to their children. “They’re sad and they’re scared,’” said Lucy, who has an eight-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son, both enrolled in a public school in Chicago’s Gage Park neighborhood. “And I have to explain racism, and how we are being profiled.”What has really helped, she said, is recruiting her kids to help her pass out “Know your rights” flyers to families after school. “They get really happy, like, ‘Mom we’re going to help so many people!’”I have to explain racism, and how we are being profiledLucyThough Lucy, her husband and her children are all US citizens, several of their extended family members, cousins and close friends have been living in Chicago without documentation for years. The Guardian is not printing her surname to protect her family from immigration enforcement.As federal agents descended on the city’s immigrant neighborhoods last week, Lucy made grocery runs for loved ones without documents who were too nervous to leave their homes, and offered to do pickups and drop-offs for parents worried about being apprehended while taking their kids to school.“I’m nervous, we’re all a little nervous,” said Silvia, a mother of four children including two that are school-aged in Chicago. “But we have the confidence that if something bad should happen to us, we have the support of the community, of the organizations here.”The Guardian is not publishing Silvia’s surname because she is undocumented, and could be targeted by immigration enforcement. Silvia herself volunteers with the Resurrection Project, an immigrant advocacy organization distributing immigrants’ rights information at local businesses, and helping connect other immigrants to legal aid.Raids have always happened, she said – this isn’t all that new. “There’s a lot of bad information being passed around right now, and it’s creating panic,” she said. “But if we have good information, we don’t have to be afraid.”She has charged her eldest son, who is 26 and has a temporary authorization to stay in the US, with taking care of her eight- and 14-year-old children should she and her husband get arrested or deported. They have also prepared a folder with all of the family’s important documents, as well as a suitcase with essentials, that their son can bring or send them to Mexico.Other than that, she said, she keeps showing up to drop her kids off at school. Her husband is still going to work. “Sometimes if we’re afraid, we end up putting fear in our children, don’t we?” she said. “So we are calm … and we’re keeping the same routine.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationChicagoIllinoisTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Displacing them against their will wouldviolateinternational laws and could constitute a war crime. It would also require neighboring Arab and Muslim states to accept millions of new Palestinian refugees, an idea they immediately and sharplyrejected.During his press conference, Trump said that the US “will take over theGazaStrip and we will do a job with it, too”.He went on: “I do see a long-term ownership position and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East,” adding: “Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land.”The idea seemed to echo comments from March last year, when Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law,said: “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable.”“It’s infuriating to listen to President Trump talk about the removal of Palestinians from Palestine and the ownership over their land, the acquisition of their territory by force, as if it was a business transaction and not a violation of very core principles of international law,” said Noura Erakat, a Palestinian American human rights attorney and professor at Rutgers.Trump’s expansionist designs would seem to flout the America First isolationism that much of his base supports. But Immerwahr noted that Trump has never really been strictly isolationist.Immerwahr added that he doubted many of Trump’s voters support these kinds of aggressive foreign policy moves, even when they concern what Trump might call the US’s backyard: “Even with Greenland, Canada, and the Panama Canal zone, it is just far from clear to me how much autonomous support there has been from the Maga base.”While the Israeli right has been thrilled about Trump’s proposal, US conservatives seemed divided orunsureof how to react – perhaps reflective of wider ideological splits between traditional Republican hawks and Republican voters tired of US adventurism overseas. Some Republican members of Congress refused to rule out the idea, while Senator Rand Paulwroteonline: “The pursuit for peace should be that of the Israelis and the Palestinians. I thought we voted for America First.”Occupying Gaza“sounds like a terrible idea for a number of reasons”, someonewrotemore plainly on a conservative forum on Reddit, “chiefly that it has zero value and [sounds like] a huge expense and I want my money in my pocket, not in the Middle East”.Immerwahr thinks that Trump is attracted to territories he believes are blank slates or can be folded into a larger white America. During his first term, Trumpmusedabout the US divesting of Puerto Rico or trading it for Greenland.‘Waterfront property’: What are Trump’s real estate interests in Palestine?Read more“If you were to ask what links the Panama Canal zone, Canada, Greenland, and a Gaza that has been emptied of Palestinians and rendered into a ‘Riviera’, I think you could say that in Trump’s fantasies these places are all symbolically white, or could be symbolically white … either because the Indigenous population seems sparse and there seems to be a lot of land for settlement or other kind of infrastructure projects, or because, in the case of the Panama Canal, that is historically a zone that was controlled by the United States and dominated by [white Americans].”Meanwhile, some elements of the so-called new right, a formerly fringe conservative intellectual movement with ties to Silicon Valley, have praised Trump’s expansionist tendencies. A recent Politico piecenotedthat some new right theorists believe that buying Greenland would revitalize the US “frontier spirit” that they believe spiritually fueled the US in previous centuries.“In terms of Trump’s bluster, Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson are the obvious parallels who kind of delight in the capabilities that come with US military might,” Immerwahr said. A better parallel might be the 19th century, however, when the US continually seized territory, but focused its colonialism on areas where white settlement seemed viable.Until as late as the 1950s, “the logic is that white settlement is the magic dust that would be sprinkled on a territory that would make it eligible for inclusion in the union.”Beinart feels that Trump’s indifference to precedents and norms, combined with a “complete lack of any moral compass”, mean that he doesn’t even see any problems with the idea of rebuilding Gaza as a US colony.“It just doesn’t occur to him that there’s something monstrous about the idea of sending US weapons to utterly destroy a territory,” Beinart said, “and then saying: ‘Oh gosh, it looks like it really sucks there now, people should have to leave.’”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

It was just totally amazing, I just couldn’t believe it,” Stein said.With the help of Stein’s son, the trio eventually found around 40 snakes, only for four of the adults to give birth during the relocation process.“There were 40 snakes, then 70, then 90,” said Kerewaro.On final count, there were five adult females and 97 babies.“The quantity is a shock. We do have red-belly snakes in the backyard – you’ll see one slither away into the creek – but not a great deal,” said Stein.The snakes are venomous, especially to young children and small animals because of their size, but are generally considered placid. Envenomation symptoms include bleeding and swelling at the bite site, nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, sweating and local or general muscle pain and weakness, according to the Australian Museum.Kerewaro said he once pulled 14 baby snakes from a wall cavity, but that Cooper now held the company – if not a state or national – record for most snakes caught on a single job.He said it was common for female red-bellies to share birthing sites, “but actually being there and the babies being born, I haven’t seen anything like that. It’s a highlight”.He said he is in touch with academics who are using data from the case in their research.“We’re contributing to helping people understand these animals – it’s pretty rewarding.”By law, the snakes must be released within 20km of the capture site. On advice from national parks, a remote area had been chosen for the release of the 102 reptiles.After Stein’s dog was bitten by a juvenile red-bellied black in December, he said it was a “relief” the snakes were no longer making his yard their home, but also happy “they’ll be released into the wild in a safe environment and preserved”.He said the final tally would climb from 102 because one female was yet to give birth.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsSydneyNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Foreshadowing Trump, he proposed moving inhabitants out “to clean it up”.As the owner of a private equity company engaged in attracting investment in property enterprises, Kushner would have a clear vested interest in Gaza real estate that was developed under the conditions envisioned this week by Trump.‘Waterfront property’: What are Trump’s real estate interests in Palestine?Read moreThis is just one of many conflicts of interest held by Kushner and members of Trump’s family, that are more prominent now in his second administration than they were in his first.This is thanks in large part to the returning president’s habit of appointing family members, including in-laws, to government roles with responsibilities that overlap their business dealings.It is also exacerbated by the fact that ties forged during Trump’s first presidency have spawned business relationships that create the potential for conflict as he embarks on his second spell.Which Trump relatives expose the administration to conflicts of interest?Jared KushnerView image in fullscreenJared Kushner attends the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump at US Capitol in Washington on 20 January 2025.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockKushner’s role as a White House adviser in Trump’s first term involved him in the Middle East, where he formed a connection with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Sulman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. It paves the way for possible conflicts that go above and beyond any putative property developments in Gaza.The relationship bore fruit after Kushner formed a private equity company, Affinity Partners, in 2021, seeking to raise $7bn. Thanks to Prince Mohammed’s intervention, he has been able to raise $2bn from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund even though the committee running it originally recommended rejecting his bid, citing the “inexperience” of the company, and its excessive fees.Last year, it wasreportedthat the company had been paid up to $157m by Saudi Arabia and other investors without returning any profit, fuelling suspicions – enumerated in a report from the Senate finance committee at a time when it was controlled by Democrats – that the company may be a foreign influence-buying operation set up to prepare for his father-in-law returning to the presidency.Days before Trump’s second inauguration, Kushner’s company struck a partnership deal with the Trump Organization, the president’s company, to build a Trump tower – housing a luxury hotel and apartment complex – in the Serbian capital, Belgrade, on the site of theformer Yugoslav defence ministry, which was damaged in the Nato bombing campaign against Slobodan Milošević’s regime in 1999.Although Kushner has no formal role in Trump’s second administration, his success in raising money from Saudi Arabia, as well as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, prompted ademandlast October from Jamie Raskin and Ron Wyden, two senior Capitol Hill Democrats, for the then attorney general, Merrick Garland, to open an investigation into his “apparent ongoing efforts to sell political influence to the highest foreign bidder”.Charles KushnerView image in fullscreenCharles Kushner arrives for the funeral of Ivana Trump on 20 July 2022, in New York.Photograph: John Minchillo/APJared’s father, Charles Kushner has been nominated as ambassador to France despite having no previous diplomatic experience. He was granted a pardon by Trump near the end of his first presidency over a 2005 conviction for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering.Potential conflict arises because of the involvement of Kushner, a wealthy property developer, in bringing a satellite of France’s publicly owned Centre Pompidou museum to Jersey City. The project has been credited as being the “brainchild” of Kushner, whoreportedly suggested the ideato the city’s mayor and proposed it be sited next to a giant apartment complex he had developed. The project is believed to involve Jersey City taxpayers paying $6m a year for the rights to the Pompidou branding, exhibitions and artworks for the next five years.Massad BoulosView image in fullscreenDr Massad Boulos, Tiffany Trump’s father-in-law, sits for a portrait at a hotel in New York on 4 September 2024.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesFather-in-law of Trump’s youngest daughter, Tiffany, Dr Massad Boulos has been named as a senior adviser to the president on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Born in Lebanon, he moved to Texas as a teenager and was engaged in Trump’s presidential campaign in reaching out to Arab American voters.Boulos has burnished a reputation as a wealthy tycoon, openly boasting that he heads a company with a value in the “billions”. Trump has added to the allure by praising him as a “dealmaker” – a moniker he often reserves for himself – and as a “highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the international scene”.However, these claims were recently undercut byNew York Times reportingbased on corporate documents, which showed no evidence that Boulos has any significant wealth based on his businesses. Instead, records indicated that he has spent the past two decades selling trucks and heavy machinery for a Nigeria-based company of which he is chief executive and which is controlled by his father-in-law. The company made a profit of less than $66,000 last year, and Boulos’s stake in it was valued at $1.53.Donald Trump JrView image in fullscreenDonald Trump Jr speaks during the AmericaFest 2024 conference sponsored by the conservative group Turning Point in Phoenix, Arizona, on 19 December 2024.Photograph: Cheney Orr/ReutersThe president’s eldest son, Trump Jr recentlyannouncedthat he is joining 1789 Capital, a venture capital firm focusing on investing in conservative companies.

Critics have wasted no time suggesting that her former political role owes much to her family connections. This became a particular embarrassment last week when Lara Trump appeared on the Laura Ingraham show on Fox News to support her father-in-law’s controversial comments on a deadly plane crash on the outskirts of Washington DC, which he blamed, without evidence, on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) hiring policies among air traffic controllers. Trump wasaccusedof hypocrisy and a lack of irony after she told Ingraham: “We should never be hiring anyone for any job other than the best person for that job.” On Wednesday, Fox Newsannouncedthat Lara Trump would be hosting a weekend show starting later this month.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsJared KushnerDonald Trump JrEric TrumpexplainersShareReuse this content"

This week alone has seen the release of the first trailers forJurassic World: Rebirth,Fantastic Four: The First Steps,and – hold your breath – a newSmurfsmovie, joining theSupermantrailer that was unveiled a few weeks ago. These are likely to be supplemented by additional Super Bowl ads for Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning and the live-action remake of How to Train Your Dragon, among others.Grumpy Harrison Ford, a mystery asterisk and AI gone wild: everything from Disney’s new slate presentationRead moreIf this all sounds familiar, well, it should. Unless Disney drops a spot for their upcoming Pixar cartoon Elio, every summer movie receiving the bigSuper Bowlpromo will be a sequel or a high-profile reboot (which is what we’ve been trained to call a remake). This is because just about every big movie coming out in summer 2025 is, yes, a sequel or a reboot of a well-known franchise. The coming attractions include Thunderbolts*, a Marvel entry that looks like a de facto sequel to Black Widow; more traditional follow-ups to Jurassic World, Mission: Impossible, and The Bad Guys; legacy sequels to The Karate Kid and Freaky Friday; reboots of the entire DC Universe (via Superman), as well as the Smurfs and The Naked Gun; a John Wick spinoff called Ballerina; remakes of Lilo & Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon; and new horror installments in the 28 Days Later, M3GAN, Final Destination, and I Know What You Did Last Summer series.It’s to the point where a new Fantastic Four movie is attracting the kind of attention typically reserved for something genuinely new and exciting – or at least something not previously adapted to the screen. In reality, this will be (yes) the fourth Fantastic Four movie in 20 years; in other words, there have been as many Fantastic Four movies during that period as Jurassic World installments or movies featuring Superman. Even the reboots are reruns, and they often seem unsure as to whether they’re targeting nostalgia, or simply short cultural memories. Remember the pop singer Katy Perry as Smurfette, the designated girl Smurf? Maybe? Well, anyway, get ready for the pop singer Rihanna as Smurfette, the designated girl Smurf, in a movie where cartoon Smurfs visit the live-action “real” world! Just like they did in the 2011 Smurfs movie and its sequel!Smurfs notwithstanding, some of these movies will surely be good; even the most dire movie summers tend to have at least one or two big-budget highlights, especially if said summers include a Mission: Impossible entry. And some of them will probably be hits, too, though it may be something of a self-fulfilling prophecy, given how few mainstream alternatives will play on 3,000 screens across North America. Just take a look at the top 20 movies at the North American box office for 2024: 17 of them were sequels or prequels. (Of the remaining three quasi-originals, all were adaptations of bestselling books, one of which was also already a smash Broadway musical with ties to one of the most popular movies of all time.)Appropriately, we’ve been here before. Sequels and remakes have been a Hollywood staple for almost as long as movies have. Even in the modern era, 2011 also had 17 franchise entries in its top 20, and that didn’t stop subsequent non-sequels like Barbie, American Sniper, Knives Out and the filmographies of Jordan Peele and Christopher Nolan from reaching the upper levels of box office success.Then again, for those successes to happen, those kinds of movies have to actually come out in theaters. This summer’s slate of mainstream originals again seems to rest with Margot Robbie, who has a romance called A Big Bold Beautiful Journey due in May (no trailer yet, though). There is also some old-school star power from Brad Pitt, whose racing drama F1 bows in June; and Leonardo DiCaprio, who has lent his selectivity to the latest from Paul Thomas Anderson, rumored to be called One Battle After Another – and also rumored to be giving Warner Bros executives agita over the fact that it’s supposedly a little on the weird side, at least for a splashy August release.Wouldn’t that have made an exciting Super Bowl trailer, though? The first glimpse of a new DiCaprio movie from a major director, with recognizable stars (Regina Hall, Benicio del Toro, Sean Penn) in support, in a story that even film nerds don’t necessarily yet have a bead on? That seems like a project that could make audiences react with some combination of “wow” and “what’s that?” rather than “oh” and “yeah, I remember that one.” Arguably the most famously impactful Super Bowl movie ad of all time was for Independence Day, a movie few people were talking about before it blew the hell out of the White House in early 1996.Of course, this is all hype-based advertising; not exactly the stuff of pure cinephilia. But for moviegoing to flourish, some of that carny-barker hype is probably necessary, and anyway, it used to be fun to catch a what-was-that glimpse of new movies in between all the ads for cars, beer and Doritos. Even in the streaming era, there’s something powerful about the idea of a trailer going live with the biggest TV event of the year (and then getting streamed and restreamed on YouTube). It’s a powerful tool that studios seem intent on shrugging their way through, hoping that, as with those ads that listlessly employ celebrities to say a familiar line to promote mayonnaise or whatever, the brand name alone will be exciting. A few more summer seasons like this one, and Super Bowl hype for upcoming movies will cease to exist – not splashily blown up like the ID4 White House, but slowly faded and eventually washed away, like a Smurf figurine left out in the rain.Explore more on these topicsFilmMarvelSuperhero moviesSuper BowlfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why were so many opportunities missed to save her?Sam WollastonThu 6 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTShareWhen Sharren Bridges talks about her daughter’s last summer, in 2021, she chokes up and has to pause. In some ways, it was a good summer. Jen Bridges-Chalkley had a boyfriend and, like most parents of teenagers, Sharren would occasionally act as a taxi driver, taking them down to the local river to swim. “She spent time with her best friends and her godmother,” says Sharren. “And, looking back, she insisted on taking photographs with them and stuff like that.”I am at Sharren’s house in Great Bookham in Surrey. We are sitting in the garden with the chickens and a couple of cockerels that haven’t yet learned the correct time of day to do their thing. Sharren works in the office of a homeless shelter and volunteers for Scouts and Guides; before that, she was a teaching assistant. Her mum, Chris – Jen’s grandma – brings out some tea.Talking about Jen’s earlier childhood is less difficult for Sharren. She smiles as she alights on happy memories. Jen loved dancing, drama, animals and especially mermaids. Her favourite TV show was the Australian kids drama H2O: Just Add Water, about three girls who are mermaids. When she turned 16, Jen took up monofin freediving, “so she could be a mermaid, too. It scared the bejesus out of me,” says Sharren. Monofin freediving involves taking to the water with both feet in a single fanned blade, a bit like a mermaid’s tail, without an oxygen tank. “Apparently, it’s very meditative and calming.”Jen’s parents split up when she was two, but otherwise Jen’s early years were stable. “If you looked into her box of life, she’s got a loving, supportive family, she lives in a nice area; it’s a fairly idyllic childhood,” says Sharren. “But that’s without seeing all the scaffolding and the Sellotape holding the box together.”Jen lit a place up, says Sharren. “I’m not just saying that because she’s my daughter; she genuinely did. She made an impact wherever she went. I don’t know if that’s a good thing, but everyone remembers Jen, even her primary school teachers.” Sharren has a disability and Jen acted as a young carer. Her self-confidence and self‑esteem were always in short supply. “She saw good in everybody, but couldn’t see it in herself. And it’s like: ‘Darling, why can’t you see yourself how everyone else sees you?’ Because she is … she’s just amazing.”Sharren often slips into the present tense when talking about her daughter. “Growing up …” Sharren begins. “Well, Jen never got to grow up.”View image in fullscreen‘She made an impact wherever she went.’Photograph: Courtesy of Sharren BridgesOn 12 October 2021, Jen killed herself at her mother’s home. She was 17. At the inquest, which concluded in April 2024, the coroner said her suicide could have been avoided if she had received the support she needed “in a timely manner”. It was “a multi-agency failure”, he concluded in the report, which is a devastating document: 81 pages of missed opportunities, bad communication and poor decision-making.“There was a failure of the agencies to work effectively together to ensure that Jen’s needs were met,” the coroner wrote. Safeguarding failure; failure by educational establishments; failure by child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs). “For much of the time between May 2018 and June 2020, she was on a waiting list for therapy from the psychology team and was awaiting assessment.” He concluded that Camhs had failed “properly to assess, diagnose and treat Jen … in order to manage her conditions and minimise her risk of suicide”.Camhs is the NHS service for children with emotional, behavioural and mental health issues. Its staff includes psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, therapists and social workers. It aims to provide support and treatment, including therapy, medication and in-hospital care. Sharren’s assessment of Camhs, provided in Jen’s case by Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS foundation trust, is simple: “It’s not fit for purpose.”Jen was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at 10 and with autistic spectrum disorder a year later. Both diagnoses had taken a long time. Sharren had originally approached her GP when Jen was five, then again when she was seven, suspecting she had ADHD (“autism was a bit of a shock,” Sharren says). Those diagnoses came from the paediatric team at Epsom general hospital.In 2015, when Jen was 11, Sharren took her to the family GP, because she was self-harming by cutting her hair with a razor and restricting her diet. Jen was worried about her Sats exams, says Sharren, and her pending move to secondary school. Sharren told the GP: “Her mental health isn’t great; I don’t know what to do about it.” The GP referred Jen to Camhs for the first time, but the psychiatrist who triaged that referral said “no moderate to severe mental health issues were identified”.Later that year, Jen moved to secondary school and struggled with the transition: the sheer number of people; the noise; the itchy uniform (Jen had sensory issues); the long days; homework and pressure. Jen was bullied. Sharren says she would often hang around at the end of a lesson to leave class with her teacher, “so she could walk out with a protector. Her self-esteem was knocked and knocked and knocked.”I was overwhelmed, not knowing what the heck to do myself and trusting these people knew what they were doingLife was better out of school. Jen did ballet, horse riding, Scouts and Guides, where she had friends, many of them younger than her. When she moved into year 9 in September 2017, she started worrying about her GCSEs and her anxiety increased. She was not put on the special educational needs register for pupils who require extra provisions and there was no written plan for her, although she was given a “Be Aware” code, so teachers were aware of her needs. An education, health and care plan (EHCP) wasn’t put in place for her until 2019. This legal document, issued by local authorities, outlines a child’s special educational needs and disabilities and the support they require. It can be requested by schools and parents, although Sharren says she was never made aware of this.The coroner highlighted the delay in the provision of an EHCP. He wrote that Jen’s special educational needs had been apparent since primary school; that there was a missed opportunity to issue a plan; and that her needs weren’t met. “This probably contributed to her rising anxiety and deteriorating self-esteem and mental state, including her suicidality,” he wrote.At home, Jen began having angry outbursts. She struggled with eating and sleeping. From the age of 14, Sharren says, she started to talk about suicide. She was receiving regular check-in chats at school from her year manager, a staff member with a pastoral role. On 15 May 2018, Jen confided in her that she was planning to kill herself.The year manager immediately phoned Camhs. Sharren and Jen attended a Camhs drop-in service that day. When asked by a mental health nurse what she thought the likelihood was of her acting on her plan to kill herself, Jen replied: “Nine and a half out of 10.” The referral was triaged as urgent.In the following days, Jen was assessed at the Camhs centre by a mental health nurse. At a multidisciplinary discussion – a gathering of health professionals to discuss a patient’s case – it was decided that Camhs needed to liaise with the school to understand more about Jen’s needs, because suicidal ideation in an autistic child did not necessarily suggest a mental illness.The consultant psychiatrist employed by Surrey and Borders trust, while accepting that the risk of suicide is higher in autistic children than in neurotypical children, told the coroner that an autistic child “might say they are suicidal; sometimes a family member might report that a young person is suicidal; a school may do similarly … That’s a term that has both specific and general usage, by which I mean it is not uncommon for an autistic child … to have limited use of language.“So what we will often do is try and work out … is that literally: ‘I am suicidal, I am going to kill myself in relation to a specific mental health need,’ or is it an expression of distress that may be attributable to other needs, for example insufficient school support or other contextual factors.”View image in fullscreen‘I miss Jen desperately every day’ … Sharren with her daughter.Photograph: Courtesy of Sharren BridgesSharren comments on this bluntly and sarcastically: “Yeah, autistic people often say they’re going to kill themselves, but they don’t mean it, because they don’t have the language skills.”While acknowledging that traditional tools for suicide-risk screening are inadequate for people with autism (which can be because of communication differences),a US study last yearinto autism and suicidal thinking produced some alarming insights. Of the nearly 400 autistic children who reported wanting to die, 35% said this started at eight years old or younger. Of those experiencing such thoughts, 18% had a suicide planned.After the assessment, Sharren says she assumed “we would see a doctor or a specialist of some sort and there’d be a plan, she would have some therapy. As Jen’s mum, I was overwhelmed, not knowing what the heck to do myself and trusting these people knew what they were doing.”In fact, Jen didn’t go on the waiting list for therapy until four months later, on 18 September 2018. Jen was on that waiting list for much of the next two years.In the meantime, they used the drop-in centre and had calls, by phone and in person, from Camhs mental health nurses. Jen had stopped going to school completely after the first referral. At the end of May, Jen had been visited at home by a Camhs primary mental health worker. Jen told her she was happier now that she had stopped going to school. The anxiety had decreased, but she was still experiencing panic attacks and thoughts of suicide.The school decided Jen needed a different kind of educational provision. A place was found at a short-stay school for students with medical needs. “It was maybe three afternoons a week in a very small class, low sensory environment, the pace of learning wasn’t really high,” says Sharren.I’m not a doctor, I’m a mum, but I knew she needed to see somebodyJen did well there, but the suicidal ideation didn’t go away. On four occasions between 2019 and 2021, when things got really bad and Jen said she didn’t feel safe at home, Sharren took her to A&E. Jen would be triaged, “then see a psychologist or psychiatrist, usually an adult one, because it was silly o’clock in the morning or really late, and then Jen was admitted to a generic children’s ward for her own safety”. It was always a generic ward – never a children’s psychiatric ward – and she was in for a couple of nights on each occasion.When it came to discharging Jen, Sharren says staff would say: “‘We’ll make a discharge plan for her, she’ll see the crisis team, they will come and visit her and then we will try and get her to see a doctor in a few weeks’ time, once the crisis team has finished with her.’ That’s the cycle we kept going through.”Except they didn’t get to see a doctor after a few weeks. “We didn’t actually see a doctor at any point apart from at A&E,” she says.Jen was discharged with a safety plan involving follow-up calls from the crisis team, in person, on the phone and by video call. But she never saw a child psychiatrist. Not only was there no therapy, but there was no clear path to therapy. There was no appointed doctor who could get to know her and make a plan for sustained and consistent support.“There was no communication between the doctors and that was really frustrating,” says Sharren. “The left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing: nobody seems to know anything, nothing is joined up, nothing marries. I’m not a doctor, I’m a mum, but I knew she needed to see somebody, because we had all these crisis interventions, we were waiting and waiting and waiting, the paediatric doctors knew she needed to see the Camhs doctors, but where is the gateway to Camhs? It’s an invisible place, where the unicorns and pixies live, it really is.”Between hospital visits, Sharren encouraged Jen to use helplines and a Camhs drop-in. “But then she saw people from school at the drop-in, there with their own issues.” In Jen’s eyes, this meant the service was no longer safe for her. Meanwhile, her wait for therapy continued. Sharren couldn’t afford to go private: “It was close to £100 a session.”An attempt in 2019 to go back to mainstream school didn’t go well. Jen’s anxiety increased even with short visits. Sharren found a place at another college for 14- to 16-year-olds who find it hard to cope in a mainstream setting, with smaller classes, core subjects in the morning, more vocational ones in the afternoon. Again, Jen did well. But then Covid hit. Jen struggled with online learning. Other things she enjoyed – like learning to freedive – also stopped.Jen turned 16 in February 2020. There were boyfriends, alcohol, some drug use. The end of one relationship led to anxiety and panic attacks. Jen had problems sleeping, her self-esteem reached new lows and her personal hygiene suffered. At one point, she said she had become pregnant, but then had a miscarriage. (Sharren says this wasn’t true, but was “her way of screaming” for help.) Sharren and Jen fell out over one of Jen’s relationships and she moved in with her dad for a while. But Sharren says Jen would still phone her when she needed to: “She had physically moved out, but mentally she hadn’t.”At 1.45am on 3 January 2021, Jen and her mum spoke to a Camhs crisis-call handler after Jen had attempted suicide. This led to the third Camhs referral. They were advised to go to A&E immediately, which they did. Jen was admitted to a children’s ward and in the morning she spoke to a mental health nurse working for the Community Crisis Intervention Service within Camhs, by video from the hospital. Jen had already seen the Psychiatric Liaison Service, which considered that she still presented as suicidal and unable to guarantee her own safety at home.Later that day, it was decided that Jen would be discharged from hospital to her mother’s home, with a seven-day follow-up and a referral to a service that offers counselling to young people. She had come off the waiting list for therapy the last time she was discharged from Camhs in June 2020. No psychiatric review was suggested.At the seven-day follow-up with the Camhs crisis team, again by video, Jen told the mental health nurse her mood was low and she got urges to self-harm but was feeling stable. Later in the month, a decision was taken for Jen to be discharged from the crisis team.View image in fullscreen‘She never got to grow up’ ... Sharren Bridges, Jen’s mother.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianIn June, Jen had a mental health review assessment, by video, with another mental health nurse employed by Camhs. Jen told him she was still struggling but was socialising more and making friends. “The sun was out,” says Sharren. “She and her dad had been to the beach, they were picking up a new puppy, everything was fine. But there are two versions of fine: there’s actually fine and there’s fine, I’m OK, but I’m not absolutely OK.”After the assessment, Jen was discharged from Camhs. “Gone, bye-bye, everything’s fine, don’t worry about it, you’re good to go,” says Sharren, clearly seething. “She was basically left to fly solo, because everything was fine.”Jen had been on a waiting list for therapy for about 18 months in total, between 2018 and 2020. Sharren loves the NHS, but thinks mental health, particularly children’s mental health, isn’t given sufficient priority: “You wouldn’t go to A&E with a broken leg for them to send you home to have a hot bath and a hot chocolate and cuddle with mummy and we’ll put you on a waiting list to fix your leg.”Figures from NHS Englandin March 2024 showed that almost 1 million children and young people had active referrals for mental health services in 2022-23. Of these, 28% were still waiting for support, while 39% were assessed and not given support. In the year to March 2024, 40,000 children experienced a wait of at least two years.Children’s emergency mental health referrals in England soar by 53%Read moreIn February 2024,a Guardian analysisof data from the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) revealed that the number of children referred to Camhs crisis care in England had increased by 53% in three years. According to a separate review of NHS figures by the Guardian, 600 mentally ill children reach crisis point each week.A workforce censuspublished by the RCP in November found that 37% of child and adolescent consultant psychiatrist posts in England are vacant. In an interview at the time, Dr Lade Smith, the president of the RCP, told the Guardian the situation requiredimmediate action from the government: “Chronic underfunding for over 15 years, alongside pressures on mental health services, has had a detrimental impact on the ability to recruit and retain enough psychiatrists.”Sharren is angry when she speaks about Camhs. “Jen is a person, she’s my daughter, she’s my everything, and she’s not here any more because people didn’t do their job. They didn’t do their job when she was five, they didn’t do their job when she was 11, they didn’t do their job when she was 14, 15, 16, 17, and now she’s not going to get older than 17.”In a statement, Graham Wareham, the chief executive of Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS foundation trust, said: “We remain deeply saddened by Jennifer’s tragic death and we have expressed our deepest condolences to her family. Our investigation into the support we provided Jennifer found that while we gave care and consideration into delivering a person-centred therapeutic approach to meet Jennifer’s mental health needs, we acknowledge that there were shortcomings.“Jennifer received therapeutic support during the time she was under the care of the trust. She also received immediate support from our 24/7 mental health crisis services when needed. We recognise that there had been a referral for specialist psychology support that had not been delivered at the time of her agreed discharge. The waiting times for psychology at that time were not what we wanted for children and young people. Our waiting times for psychology are now significantly reduced to improve the experience for children, young people and their families.”Somehow – I don’t know how – Sharren tells me about Jen’s last couple of days. Jen was staying with her boyfriend when she called Sharren. “It was late, past 11; I’d already gone to bed. She said: ‘Mummy, you need to come and pick me up.’ Every traffic diversion just happened to be there and it seemed to take a million times longer to get there than it should have done.”Jen’s boyfriend lived with his mum. When Sharren went into the house, she found her daughter “unusually calm”: “She had everything orderly and folded – and Jen was not a child who folded things.”On the drive home, Jen was texting her best friend. “I said: ‘Darling, do you think we need to go to the hospital? I can tell you’re not in a good place.’ And she said: ‘There’s no point going to the hospital – they never help, they never have, they never will.’ And so we got home and we had some really precious time together. I won’t go into the details, but I soothed her to sleep, as I did when she was at home before.”In the morning, Sharren phoned Jen’s GP and got an appointment for the afternoon. Jen signed into college online. Sharren went to work in the afternoon. At the time, she was working as a teaching assistant at a primary school, but that day she was invigilating an exam at a different school. “I said: ‘Are you sure you’re going to be OK? I absolutely don’t have to go.’ And she said: ‘It’s fine.’ I asked my mum to pop in to check on her.”At work, Sharren “had a horrible feeling that something had happened”. She got a message from the reception desk that the police were coming to pick her up. “That’s when I knew that feeling I’d had earlier was that Jen had died.“I remember getting home and it was as if somebody had got a bag of police cars and ambulances and just tipped them out in the road.” She heard the boots of the police officers upstairs in Jen’s room. ‘“I remember thinking: ‘You’re not allowed boots upstairs, not on the carpet.’”Since Jen died, Sharren has set up a charity calledJen’s Acorn, a programme of activities complementary to the school curriculum, “for less competent learners and those who need an alternative learning style”. She has also worked with Surrey county council on its autism strategy.“I’ve just tried not to sink, really. I miss Jen desperately,” says Sharren. “Every day. I put on a face that everything’s OK, but I’m just a shell, a bit like an Easter egg.

Composite: Getty/Rex/Shutterstock/Reuters/Guardian DesignBoth Xi Jinping and Donald Trump’s political careers were shaped by their formative experiences in the 1980s – and, above all, their encounters with JapanByAndrew LiuThu 6 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 10.38 ESTShareIn 2011,Donald Trumpspoke before an audience of about 1,000 in Las Vegas, teasing a prospective, if fanciful, presidential run. Halfway through a rant over Middle East policy and oil prices, he digressed for a moment on trade with Asia: “China, I said the other day – very, very hard to buy anything, outside of China. Certain other countries also, but China’s, you know, the one.“And somebody said: ‘What would you do? What could you do?’ So easy. I drop a 25% tax onChina. And you know, I said to somebody that it’s really the messenger. The messenger is important. I could have one man say: [falsetto] ‘We’re going to tax you 25%.’ And I could say another: ‘Listen, you motherfuckers, we’re going to tax you 25%!’”Over the years, Trump has flip-flopped constantly on the standard presidential topics, from the Middle East to healthcare to abortion. But give him this: he has been remarkably consistent on tariffs, a centrepiece of both his domestic and foreign agenda. “This is something that has been stuck in his craw since the 80s,” a friend and former steel executive told the New York Times. “It came from his very own core belief.” A few weeks before the 2024 election, Trump said: “To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is ‘tariff’”. During his first term, Trump’s team initiated a series of major duties on Chinese imports. Starting with solar panels and washing machines, they soon extended to steel and aluminum, then nearly half of all goods from China, worth roughly $200bn. By late 2019, the average tariff rate reached 21%. Trump had been true to his word.Trump’s tariffs have been panned by economists, who warn that they increase inflation and hurt farmers and middle-class households. But Democrats have been reluctant to undo them. The Biden administration not only maintained but expanded Chinese duties, which are now aimed at electric vehicles, silicon chips and lithium batteries. Today, anti-China policies are a rare point of bipartisan consensus. Popular opinion on China has steadily soured since the 2000s.Pew pollingshows that 81% of Americans view the country unfavourably, a historic low. Enrolments in Mandarin courses at US universities, which climbed steadily after 1978, have been falling since 2013.Trump helped set the tone when he announced his candidacy for presidency in 2015. In that speech, the first priority he mentioned was placing restrictions on Chinese trade. He also, infamously, warned of “drugs”, “crime” and “rapists”being sent from Mexico. Trump’s current brand of racism appears to revolve around these two countries. “There are no jobs,” he said, “because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.”Still, on revisiting that 2015 speech, there is a surprising appearance by a third country, sandwiched between China and Mexico:Japan. “When did we beat Japan at anything?” Trump railed. “They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn’t exist, folks. They beat us all the time.”At the time, commentators laughed at Trump’s Japan fixation. They called it “anachronistic,” “out-of-date,” and “odd”. But Japan has been foundational to Trump’s worldview, as historian Jennifer M Miller has argued, dating back to his emergence as a national figure in the 80s. In fact, Japan even provided the template for his views on China, which, decades later, hold massive consequences for the rest of the world.When Trump published The Art of the Deal in 1987, US-Japan tensions were at their height. Rising imports of Japanese durable goods, especially automobiles, had coincided with the decline of US manufacturing. In the 1970s, global oil shocks had pushed American drivers to buy leaner, more efficient cars from Toyota, Honda, Mazda and Subaru. Trump promoted his book on Larry King and Oprah Winfrey, testing out lines that sound awfully similar to his Las Vegas speech – and his rhetoric as a politician since.“We’re a debtor nation. Something’s going to happen over the next number of years in this country, because you can’t keep on losing $200bn … and yet we let Japan come in and dump everything right into our markets. It’s not free trade. If you ever go to Japan right now and try to sell something, forget about it, Oprah. Just forget about it. It’s almost impossible. They don’t have laws against it. They just make it impossible. They come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs, they knock the hell out of our companies.”Trump’s views were far from extreme at the time. In 1985, the New York Times Magazine ran a cover story by Theodore White, a prize-winning journalist who had covered the Pacific war, headlined: “The danger from Japan”. Accompanying it was an ominous full-page photograph of a Nissan sedan being unloaded at a port in Elizabeth, New Jersey.A few months later, the US hosted a summit of European, American and Japanese finance officials at New York’s famed Plaza Hotel (which Trump himself would buy in 1988). The resulting Plaza Accord came amid a flurry of bilateral deals meant to “voluntarily” reduce Japanese exports while opening Japan’s market to the world’s goods, thereby driving up domestic consumption – much like American prescriptions for China today. Under pressure from the other G5 countries – France, Germany, the US and UK – Japan’s finance ministry lowered interest rates, and banks greenlit construction projects. The easy money, combined with fewer exports, pushed Japanese businesses into speculative real estate.At the height of the ensuing bubble, a square foot in Tokyo could sell for up to 350 times as much as one in Manhattan. The Imperial Palace was nominally worth as much as all of California. From 1987 to 1994, the two richest people in the world, according to Fortune, were property magnates Tsutsumi Yoshiaki and Mori Taikichirō. And in 1989, Mitsubishi Estates purchased Rockefeller Center. That same year, when Trump was asked by a reporter about his net worth, he replied: “Who the F knows? I mean, really, who knows how much the Japs will pay for Manhattan property these days?”Since the 80s, Trump has never made much distinction between his personal business experience and his policy prescriptions. If Trump was getting a bad deal, then so was the entire nation. In a 2018 interview with the Wall Street Journal, he recalled the origins of his trade platform: “I just hate to see our country taken advantage of. I would see cars, you know, pour in from Japan by the millions.”As the centre of Asian economic dynamism has shifted to China, so has the target of Trump’s ire. “Very, very hard to buy anything,” Trump said in his Vegas speech, “outside of” Chinese goods. When he tried to purchase American-made glass and furniture for his properties, he found only Chinese factories. Before 2016 Trump had never visited China, but he had sent his children there to secure licences for his brand or to negotiate real estate deals only to be stymied each time.In 1982, at the peak of the Japan panic, two white Chrysler employees, one recently fired, confronted and killed a Chinese American named Vincent Chin in Highland Park, Michigan, near the birthplace of Henry Ford. The episode symbolised, not for the first time, the fungible threat of Chinese, Japanese and otherwise exotic Asian capital in American minds. Trump’s pivot to China has only demonstrated it more bluntly. As he told a reporter during his first term, he saw Japan as “interchangeable with China, interchangeable with other countries. But it’s all the same thing.” His embrace of tariffs has likewise been a constant, even as their target has shifted. “Where are my tariffs?” Trump said in meetings with advisers early during his presidency. “Bring me my tariffs.”In his second term, Trump has widened the tariff net to include neighbours and ostensible allies Canada and Mexico. Meantime, in his first week in office, Trump threatened tariffs of up to 50% against Colombia after two airplanes with repatriated Colombians were blocked from landing; he has brandished similar threats against Denmark in a harebrained push to purchase Greenland.Who knows how real these threats are? In December, the Republican senator Tom Cotton, a Trump surrogate, tried to reassure an audience of jittery CEOs that they were merely “an effective negotiating tactic”. Tariffs against China, on the other hand: “That’s a horse of a different colour.”In 2012, not long after Trump’s rant in Vegas, the Chinese Communist party selected a new leader, 59-year-old politburo memberXi Jinping. In histories of the current trade war, Xi will no doubt be remembered as Trump’s counterpart in nationalist escalation. But in the early years of his rise, US observers were cautiously hopeful that he would be a reformer, receptive to American-style liberalism. The Wall Street Journal reported that in 1985, during a visit to the US as a party official, Xi Jinping had stayed with a family in Muscatine, Iowa, on a tour of corn production techniques. By 2012, his daughter was attending Harvard. He liked Hollywood movies. And he had met Magic Johnson and David Beckham.Journalists also leaned on what they knew about his father, Xi Zhongxun. The elder Xi had joined the party in the 1920s, rising to high-ranking positions by the 1950s, and claimed revolutionary status to the end of his life. He was also purgedduring the Cultural Revolution, with severe consequences for his young son. In 1978, Xi Zhongxun was rehabilitated by the newly ascendant Deng Xiaoping. When he was appointed party secretary of Guangdong that year, Xi Zhongxun’s first task was to mobilise capital from Hong Kong, then still a British colony, into the southern province. He helped establish the first experimental “special economic zones” (SEZ) along China’s coasts, including the crown jewel of the SEZs, Shenzhen. He was also aligned with senior reform-minded politicians, who spearheaded political and economic liberalisation in the 1980s. No wonder US observers hoped Xi Jinping would follow in his father’s footsteps. As one veteran American businessman put it: “We all hope the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.”View image in fullscreenXi Jinping in 1988.Photograph: Xinhua/APOn the political front, Xi Jinping has not fulfilled these hopes. He has restricted political expression, spearheadedthe repression of Xinjiang, and reassertedstate control over the economyand much of everyday life. Yet on the economic front, Xi’s arc can indeed be seen as a continuation of his father’s final legacy. Returning from his trip to Iowa in 1985, Xi Jinping became deputy mayor of Xiamen, the special economic zone with the closest ties to Taiwan and Taiwanese capital. In the years that followed, as he continued to rise through the party ranks, positioned in large coastal cities, Xi was credited with helping US companies establish a foothold in China, including FedEx, Citibank and McDonald’s. From the 80s to the 2000s, Hong Kong and Taiwan were the top two sources of foreign investment in China, totalling hundreds of billions of dollars. Looking back in 2018, Xi Jinping said that China’s rise to the world’s second-largest economy “has to be chalked up to our Taiwan compatriots and Taiwan companies”.Like that of Trump, Xi Jinping’s economic worldview can be traced to formative experiences in the 1980s. Both men’s political careers were shaped by the rapid global ascent of Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. For Xi, it was the party’s turn toward exporting consumer goods across the Pacific. In coastal cities such as Shenzhen and Xiamen, officials positioned themselves as successors to the postwar Asian economic “miracles”. In discussions, they referred to the examples of Hong Kong and Taiwan, but underlying these was always the pioneering experience of Japan. For Trump, meanwhile, Japan represented a formative encounter with threatening foreign capital, a national trade deficit and the decline of American industry. He presciently seized on a national backlash against economic competition from across the Pacific, one that had emerged from the US’s own postwar alliances.In 1987, before his appearance on Oprah, Trump placed an ad in the country’s major papers that railed against US security guarantees and military aid to allies such as Saudi Arabia and Japan: “Over the years, the Japanese, unimpeded by the huge costs of defending themselves (as long as the United States will do it for free), have built a strong and vibrant economy with unprecedented surpluses. They have brilliantly managed to maintain a weak yen against a strong dollar. This, coupled with our monumental spending for their, and others [sic], defence, has moved Japan to the forefront of world economies.”The US occupation of Japan began immediately after its 1945 surrender. Early on, Gen Douglas MacArthur imposed a series of New Deal-style policies, supporting labour unions and women’s rights while dismantling the imperial war machine and the gigantic holding companies that had powered it. However, starting in 1947, state department officials intervened and reoriented US-Japan policy toward a military and economic strategy of Communist containment.What historians call the “reverse course” was not made out of consideration for the Japanese people. The priority was regional strategy. Initially, officials proposed exporting US raw goods to Japan, lowering barriers to imports, and encouraging Japan to bolster anti-Communist influence in the region – forming part of what the then secretary of state, Dean Acheson, called a “defensive perimeter” from the Aleutian Islands in the north Pacific to the Philippines in the south.The Korean war brought this vision closer to reality. The US permanently expanded its military presence in Korea, Taiwan and Japan, aided by “special procurement” orders for Japanese metals, textiles, vehicles and machinery. The spending jumpstarted Japan’s dormant industries and revived them to wartime levels. The prime minister, Yoshida Shigeru, also pushed the US to assume Japan’s military responsibilities – as Trump would later complain – freeing up the country for single-minded pursuit of economic growth.In US policymakers’ original vision, Japan’s industrial growth was a means to an end, subordinated to American security. Starting in the 1960s, however, the capitalist Asia-Pacific grew into something different altogether. From 1965 until 1990, it was by far the fastest-growing economic region in the world, led by Japan, the four “small tigers” (South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan), and the south-eastern “newly industrialising economies” (Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand).For its champions, the newly christened Pacific Rim was an “international capitalist utopia”. But whether it appeared as “miracle” or “menace”, political scientist Meredith Woo argued, observers tended to overlook the region’s military-economic dependence on the US. Japan, when pressed at the Plaza Hotel to curb its exports, had little leverage to resist. Today China so scares Washington not only because of its uncanny resemblance to the Japanese miracle, but also for its key geopolitical differences: there will be no Chinese Plaza Accord.If Trump’s China tariffs are now a bipartisan position, their intellectual backbone comes from Michael Pettis, an American finance professor at Peking University who has influenced both the Trump and Biden administrations. The root of the China problem, Pettis alleges, is the country’s excess savings, low consumption and industrial “overcapacity”, externalised into exports that are “dumped” on to the rest of the world.View image in fullscreenMichael Pettis.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesTo US observers, it is obvious that China should pivot from exporting goods to developing its home market, just as Japan did in the 80s. The Communist party’s intransigence can only result from aberrant psychology. Paul Krugman described Xi Jinping as “bizarrely unable” and “bizarrely unwilling” to shift accordingly.In the Wall Street Journal, Lingling Wei blamed Xi’s “deep-rooted philosophical objections to western-style consumption-driven growth”, which he views as “wasteful”, “welfarism” and simply at odds with China’s ambitions for global power.Pettis, however, does not see China’s strategy as bizarre. He notes that moving away from export-driven growth is risky. Any measures to “reverse” the transfer of wealth from households to government, by redirecting it to wages and welfare, would come with trade-offs. China’s manufacturing would suffer greatly in the short term, creating a painful economic contraction without any guaranteed payoff in the long term.Rather than psychology, then, explanations for Chinese political strategy can be found in recent history. Foremost are the lessons of Japan and east Asia, in both their successes and limitations. As Chinese reformers embraced export-led industrialisation in the 80s, they reasoned that because the country was still a closed circuit, efforts to promote domestic consumption – through higher wages and social welfare programmes – would come at the cost of industrial investment. Planners realised they could instead follow the model of their east Asian neighbours by using the markets of the US and other rich countries to subsidise their own growth.Chinese political thinking was long shaped by a fear of domestic inflation alongside the belief that, rather than focusing on balancing domestic consumption and investment, the key was to grow the size of the economy – and the key to growth was industry and technology. Today China prioritises innovation under the title of “new-quality productive forces” (xinzhi shengchanli), entailing clean technology, electric vehicles, semiconductors and artificial intelligence – targets of the Biden tariffs – that rely as much as possible on domestic supply chains. The strategy claimed a major victory in January, when theChinese startup DeepSeekshocked the world with an AI model that outperformed OpenAI and Meta’s own models but at a fraction of the cost. China’s government is aware that moving further into capital-intensive industries means cutting back on cheaper, labour-intensive ones such as clothes and toys. Still, Xi has emphasised to officials that the economy must first “establish the new before breaking the old” (xianli houpo).At the same time, Xi’s China is wary of the threat of “Japanification”. The credit bubble that helped drive Japan’s runaway growth in the 80s, and which so irked Trump, finally popped in 1990, and Japan’s own foreign investment contributed to the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Today Japan is in the midst of its fourth “lost decade” of sluggish growth. This is the spectre now hanging over China, which for all its impressive performance, remains nowhere near as rich per capita as 90s Japan.The 1997 Asian financial crisis largely spared China, which was not yet enmeshed in regional and global capital flows. But that would soon change. By 2001, the US helped shepherd China into the World Trade Organization, legitimising its place in the new, unipolar world order. Soon, Chinese firms were accumulating a trade surplus with the US. Once again following Japan’s path, the People’s Bank of China began to buy up US treasury bills, at times accumulating up to $1.3tn during the 2010s. The strategy was to keep down the value of the renminbi, suppressing prices and wages and ensuring the competitiveness of Chinese goods globally. Chinese credit also became a lifeline to US consumers, who, despite stagnant real wages, continued to buy cheaper Chinese goods.The 2000s were a golden age of US-China integration. Still, these years also saw signs of discontent toward globalisation, even before Xi’s and Trump’s rise to power. In the US, labour unions had opposed China’s entry into the WTO, marching in protest during the 1999 Seattle meetings. Economists estimate the US lost about 2m manufacturing jobs in the first years after the “China shock”. Meanwhile, fearing competition from US firms, China’s provincial leaders used interventionist measures to bolster local industries, technically breaking the rules of the WTO.As early as 2007, Chinese policymakers, wary of stoking international tensions, began talking about “rebalancing” toward domestic consumption. Efforts were expedited after the 2008 US sub-prime mortgage crisis, when, like the US, the Chinese government rushed out a bailout package, worth about 4tn RMB, or nearly $600bn. Here China followed the path of Japan once more, as cheap credit led to a real estate bubble. From 2011 to 2021, about a quarter of China’s GDP comprised transactions in property construction.View image in fullscreenUnfinished buildings in Zhengzhou after the Chinese property developers suffered turmoil in the early 2020s.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe bubble burst during the first year of the pandemic. Sensing danger, Beijing announced the “three red lines” policy: to access more credit, companies would have to control their ratio of debt to cash, equity and assets. The Evergrande Group, the world’s highest-valued developer, crossed all three thresholds. At its peak the company was worth more than $40bn, but with liabilities of more than $270bn. It was also a former business partner of Donald Trump, with failed plans to build a massive skyscraper in Guangzhou. Cut off from government support, Evergrande collapsed in 2021.China has thus already been burned by pivoting too hastily to domestic consumption, only to be rewarded with a crisis that has saddled the country with trillions of dollars in losses. Many fear China is already in the same trap as its Japanese neighbours, with enterprises paralysed by enormous debts. If anything, it is precisely because of the catastrophe of loose money policies that Xi has turned back to the classic east Asia model of promoting industrial innovation, including exports. Both he and Trump are doubling down on the decades-old political views that first gave rise to the Asia-Pacific trade wars. Neither appears likely to change course soon.Amajor throughline in this saga has been the automobile industry. In the 80s, Trump took his cues from the Chrysler CEO, Lee Iacocca, who had publicly attacked Japanese industries. (The two went on to become business partners.) These days, the new threat is Chinese electric vehicles.Last year, China’s industry leader, BYD (short for Build Your Dream), surpassed Tesla as the world’s top EV seller. The company is making rapid inroads in the European market, but has been banned from the US. Meanwhile, the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, has become a member of Trump’s inner circle and has the president’s ear – at least for now. On an earnings call with analysts in January 2024, Musk was already warning that BYD’s technology was “extremely good”, and that without “trade barriers” in place, the automaker would “pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world”. To Musk’s delight, Trump has since vowed even higher tariffs on Chinese EVs than those put in place under Biden.Yet today China boasts the world’s best-integrated production systems, reinforced by recent mandates to “indigenise” and insulate value chains from foreign tariffs. BYD was founded in 1995 in Shenzhen. The company first made lithium-ion batteries for smartphones before venturing into EVs. Its expertise in making low-cost, highly efficient batteries, as well as silicon chips, distinguishes it from Tesla, which buys parts from suppliers.What is becoming clear today is that Chinese exports may suffer setbacks, but they are not disappearing from the global market anytime soon. The US has already begun to import less from China relative to Mexico, Taiwan, Malaysia, India, South Korea and Vietnam. But this trend reflects, in part, the migration of Chinese capital to get around US tariffs. In 2023, the Taiwan-owned Foxconn, which had production centred in the Chinese province of Henan, opened an iPhone factory in Chennai, India. Both Chinese and US companies producing vehicles, tyres and car batteries have set up factories in Mexican cities such as Coahuila, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Tijuana.How the state runs business in ChinaRead moreThis workaround, known as “nearshoring”, worries the Trump administration, which believes China could exploit Nafta and export Chinese cars through the “back door” of Canada and Mexico. The fear helps explain Trump’s unexpected tariff threats against immediate neighbours. Meanwhile, China itself has quietly built an “alternative trade architecture”, according to the Financial Times, in which 40% of its exports now go to countries with whom it shares bilateral free trade agreements, excluding the US and EU, mostly across Asia, but also Australia, Canada and South America.Nobody can predict what happens next. But if current trends continue, we are living through a collision of economic trajectories set in motion 40 years ago: Xi Jinping’s attachment to export-driven industrialisation, pitted against Trump’s decades-long fixation on protectionist tariffs. This contradiction is the terrain on which much of the world must now manoeuvre. Something has to give, but tidy resolutions are hard to imagine. At some point, even Donald Trump’s most vocal sceptics will have to concede that his ideas, in conjunction with Xi Jinping’s, have ushered in a new economic epoch. What began as the rantings of a minor celebrity, first on 80s daytime television and later on stage in Las Vegas, now helps to shape the world.An earlier version of this articleappeared inn+1 magazineListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readDonald TrumpChinaJapanXi JinpingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That January, the New Cross Fire claimed the lives of 13 young Black people. Amid widespread suspicion that the fire had been a targeted attack by violent racists, the police concluded otherwise after a lacklustre investigation. In April came the Brixton uprising, which resulted in 279 injuries to police and £7.5m worth of damage to the area’s buildings and vehicles. While the subsequent Scarman Report acknowledged some of the hardships facing people of colour, it emphatically denied the existence of institutional racism in Britain – no surprise perhaps given Thatcher had swept to victory a couple of years previously on the back of a wave of anti-immigration sentiment.It was against this tumultuous backdrop that Donald Rodney – born to Jamaican parents and raised in Smethwick, West Midlands (a hotbed of racial tensions in the 1960s)– entered art school at Trent Polytechnic in Nottingham. “When I joined in 1980 there were no other Black students but the year after there were three or four including Donald,” says Rodney’s friend and collaborator Keith Piper. Piper, himself a young Black artist who had already begun exhibiting politically charged work, swiftly formed an alliance with Rodney. “In a sense, he was the most unlikely to pick up those ideas and run with them because he was so flamboyant,” says Piper. “He was every inch the artist – very humorous but incredibly sophisticated in his connection to contemporary art.” Looking back, Piper says it was striking how early Rodney was proselytising the genius of Basquiat and he was fascinated with how his neo-expressionist techniques might be used to make more explicitly political art.Soon, the pair’s Nottingham flat became a wellspring of ideas for the recently formed BlkArtGroup, which also featured contemporaries Eddie Chambers, Marlene Smith and Claudette Johnson. “At the time there was a lot of resistance to art being overtly political but it was an amazing time …[in] the early years of the Thatcher government, you had the miner’s strike, the struggle against apartheid, Greenham Common. It was a very political moment.”The art world’s initial focus was on the group’s groundbreaking and often confrontational depictions of institutional racism. This was evident in works such asHow the West Was Won (1982), which Rodney completed as an undergraduate student. The painting takes inspiration from 1950s and 60s western movies and prominently features text (“The only good injun, is a dead injun”). The work is emblematic of how the influence of pop culture formed a core of their unashamedly political approach.View image in fullscreenDonald Rodney, The House That Jack Built, 1987.Photograph: Sheffield Museums/The Donald Rodney EstateAnother of Rodney’s hallmarks was his reimagining of Black iconography to draw attention to racist hypocrisies and half-truths. His installationVisceral Canker(1990) exemplified this approach: two wooden plaques displaying heraldic images, connected by medical tubes pumping theatrical blood, examining how Britain’s colonial history continues to structure modern life. Similarly, Doublethink (1992), a display of 70 sporting trophies engraved with racist statements collected from media and overheard conversations (“Black sportsmen have small IQs. Black people are inadequate and bitter”), commented on society’s contradictory attitudes toward Black excellence.But as well as commenting on racism (the institutional and the everyday) the Blk Art Group was notable for their atypically vulnerable explorations of Black identity and innovative use of multimedia. For Rodney, this often meant taking inspiration from his own struggles with illness, notably by using X-ray film sheets to document his lifelong battle with sickle cell anaemia – Rodney would die of the disease in 1998 aged 36. His experiments using medical equipment began in the late 1980s, with a lot of his work from the period being completed between hospital stays.The artist’s upcoming retrospective at London’s Whitechapel Gallery encompasses most of his surviving works from 1982 to 1997, from large-scale oil pastels to animatronic sculptures and even his sketchbooks. The gallery’s director, Gilane Tawadros, was a friend of Rodney’s, even writing his obituary in the Guardian. “Materiality was really important to him,” she says. “He had a sense of artworks as objects that aren’t necessarily made to live for ever but as having a precarity and vulnerability which goes against the commodification of artwork.”For Tawadros, Rodney’s technical prowess and choice of materials are as essential to his work as the political messages which often literally adorn his creations. “Too frequently artists’ work is perceived through their biography rather than the complexities and nuances of their practice,” she says. “His work touches so many themes and issues that are acutely relevant today – it’s not reducible to the experience of young Black men in the UK at a certain moment in time.”View image in fullscreenDonald Rodney, Doublethink (detail), 1992.Photograph: The Donald Rodney EstateHis exploration of the intersection of personal suffering and racial discrimination arguably reached its zenith in his most famous work,In the House of My Father(1996-97). The piece features a photograph of Rodney’s palm holding a miniature house crafted from pieces of his own skin, held together with tiny dressmakers’ pins. The work powerfully evokes themes of vulnerability, protection and the fragility of the body and the home.Rodney’s use of his body as both medium and subject has particularly resonated with subsequent generations of creatives, notably the Black YBAs – Chris Ofili, Yinka Shonibare and Steve McQueen – but also novelists such as Caleb Azumah Nelson. In the House of My Father is directly referenced in Nelson’s acclaimed debut, Open Water, as the protagonist, a young Black photographer, reflects on vulnerability and the weight of his own trauma.Despite frequent hospitalisations, Rodney’s ambitions never abated. “He became increasingly reliant on a group of artists and curators around him who became known as Donald Rodney plc, who would help him to realise these increasingly ambitious projects,” says Piper. Perhaps his most significant collaborator during his later years was Prof Mike Phillips, who he met at the Slade School of Art in the 1980s, who was working with coding and digital media. Autoicon (1997-2000), a posthumously completed work, merged art with artificial intelligence through a Java-based AI and neural network that simulated his physical presence and creative personality. The platform engaged users in text-based conversations, drawing from a vast archive of Rodney’s documentation, medical records, interviews, images, notes and videos.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Dedicated to his late father, the show was named for the Caribbean tradition of celebrating the life of a recently deceased family member for many days after their passing. The exhibition featured Camouflage (1997), a work that subtly stitched racist slurs into camouflage fabric, making them barely legible, but attention on opening night was largely stolen by Psalms (1997), an automated wheelchair that weaved its way around the gallery. Tragically, Rodney was too ill to attend the exhibition but Tawadros recalls “this unoccupied wheelchair was like a haunting presence of Donald in the show – pointing towards his future absence because he knew his life was going to be short. It’s a work that’s not just boundary-pushing – it’s a poignant way of raising the question of what legacy we leave.”“With all artists, there are moments when the stuff they do seems to touch a particular nerve,” says Piper. And understandably given the themes of race and the body as a metaphor explored in his work, wider consciousness of Rodney’s work has grown since the global Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. “Donald was very committed to anti-racist struggle and he was very specific about using his personal experience with illness to unlock wider issues around empire, history and stereotypes,” says Piper.“Donald was an incredibly ambitious artist,” says Tawadros. “He wanted to have a wing of the Tate named after him but his longtime partner, Diane Symons, said to me: ‘[A retrospective at] Whitechapel gallery is the next best thing’.” It’s a mark of Rodney’s influence and staying power that Tawadros holds out hope that maybe one day the Tate will come round. “How many artists have wings – there’s the Turner wing! Maybe one day there will be a Donald Rodney one. too. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?”Donald Rodney: Visceral Canker is at Whitechapel Gallery, London,12 February to 4 May.Explore more on these topicsArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Leaders of both countries immediately rejected the proposal, and the Jordanian king, Abdullah II, and the Egyptian president,Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, are heading to Washington in an attempt to convince Trump to change course.“They are terrified that an Israeli policy of population transfer will actually become real,” said Neil Quilliam, an associate fellow of the Middle East programme at the Chatham House thinktank in London.Abdullah and Sisi know that they are vulnerable to Trump’s trademarktransactional style of geopoliticsas their countries’ economies and security depend heavily onhuge levelsof US aid and trade.View image in fullscreenSisi and Trump at the G7 summit in Biarritz in 2019.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/APJordan accepted large numbers of displaced Palestinians in 1948 during the wars surrounding the foundation of Israel, and in 1967 when Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza. A large proportion of Jordan’s population – probably more than half – is of Palestinian origin, with many still classed as refugees.Katrina Sammour, an independent Amman-based analyst, said: “It would be a repeat trauma of an already traumatised people. The Nakba [the displacement of 1948] is still very fresh in the collective memory of the Arab people.”The role, presence and future ofPalestinians in Jordanis one of the country’s most politically sensitive issues.‘I panic when my phone rings’: the plight of Palestinians in JordanRead moreIn 1970, armed factions of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation came close to wresting control of the kingdom from the current king’s father, Hussein. Though a repeat is highly unlikely, the events 55 years ago have not been forgotten.Jordanian officials have been warning of the consequences of displacement of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank since the beginning of the war, as violence there has increased and Israeli settlements have expanded. An effort to force Palestinians from the West Bank into Jordan – long an ambition of Israel’s right wing –would be a red lineregarded as a “declaration of war” by their militarily powerful neighbour, the officials have said.“The Jordanians are very worried that what happens inGaza[could open] the door to the annexation [by Israel] of the West Bank,” Quilliam said.Authorities in Jordan have faced months of domestic protests calling for stronger measures in support of Palestinians, and any move to comply with Trump’s demands would be seen as a betrayal of the Palestinian cause. But Jordan has a peace treaty with Israel and close military and economic ties with the US. It also receives massive and vital financial aid from Washington, giving Trump significant leverage. Officials in Amman privately refer to the “balancing act” required by the kingdom.“The questions of who counts as Jordanian and what it means to be Jordanian are highly combustible,” said Alia Brahimi, a regional expert at the Atlantic Council. “So there’s the demographic issue, but also the fact that Trump is drawing attention to King Abdullah’s ties to Israel and his alliance with and dependence on the US. Both matters have the very real potential to destabilise the Jordanian monarchy.”View image in fullscreenPalestinians burn posters depicting Trump during protests in the Israeli-occupied West Bank last week.Photograph: Ali Sawafta/ReutersAnother issue is practical. The Jordanian economy has suffered through the war and public services are stretched to breaking point. Security services have struggled to contain Islamist extremists, while support for more moderate Islamists has apparently surged.Sammour said: “A plan like this needs years of preparation … It could be a security nightmare, and Jordan would be seen as betraying the Palestinian cause.”In Cairo, security is a major concern, especially in the highly sensitive zone of the Sinai desert where some have suggested vast refugee camps could be built. Egypt hasrefused to allow Palestinians in Gaza to flee into its territoryduring the 16-month war there, fearing a massive and destabilising influx that could become permanent.Brahimi said: “Amongst a forcibly displaced population there are always going to be militants, whether Hamas or new groups looking to stand up for a new generation of brutalised and disenfranchised Palestinians. If they were to operate from Egyptian soil this would endanger and likely upend Egypt’s peace treaty with Israel, but it would also energise and embolden local militant groups that are opposed to the Egyptian regime.”Egypt also has deep economic problems, despite receiving vast amounts of aid from the US and elsewhere. “Egypt is a huge country but this would come with a huge … economic cost,” said Quilliam. “The Egyptian economy already has massive problems.”Security services in Egypt struggle to keep a lid on discontent and officials fear new instability could lead to another mass protest movement likein 2011. Brahimi said: “As with King Abdullah of Jordan, there’s the potential for political calamity too, in that neither Arab leader can afford to be complicit in the systematicethnic cleansing of Palestine. Frankly, Trump has given voice to the worst nightmares of the leaderships in Amman and Cairo.”Trump appears to disagree. In the press conference with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the US president said Abdullah and Sisi would come around to his proposal and “open their hearts [to] give us the kind of land that we need to get this done and people can live in harmony and in peace”.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaJordanGazaEgyptAfricaIsraelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Belarus, organizations like Honest People, which has worked to counter state propaganda,face immediate closureand may soon lay off more than a dozen staffers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Expropriating private property. Using G20 to promote ‘solidarity, equality, & sustainability.’ In other words: DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] and climate change,” Rubio said in apost on X. “My job is to advance America’s national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism.”Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire and Trump adviser tasked with scrutinising US government spending and staffing,including on foreign aid, replied with two American flag emojis.South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, appeared to rebuke Trump and Rubio in his annual State of the Nation address on Thursday: “We are witnessing the rise of nationalism, protectionism, the pursuit of narrow interests and the decline of common cause ... We will not be bullied.”Rubio’s snub of South Africa, which this year is chairing the G20 forum of large economies, the EU and African Union, comes after Trump said on Sunday that South Africa was “confiscating land” and that he wasstopping US funding pending an investigation.South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, last month signed a law allowing for land expropriation with no compensation in limited circumstances. Politicians have said it is similar to countries including the US, where expropriating land with “just compensation” is allowed for public projects such as road building.More than three decades after apartheid ended,land ownership remains concentratedin South Africa’s white minority. The government has bought and redistributed 7.8m hectares (19m acres), while courts have ordered a limited number of returns of land to people displaced by apartheid.“There is no arbitrary dispossession of land/private property,” South Africa’s foreign minister, Ronald Lamola, said on X. “OurG20Presidency, is not confined to just climate change but also equitable treatment for nations of the Global South, ensuring equal global system for all. We remain committed to engaging the government of the USA.”The US relationship with South Africa deteriorated under the previous US president, Joe Biden, when South Africa refused to take sides in the Russia-Ukraine war but continued to play an active part in the Brics bloc, originally made up of Brazil, Russia, India and China.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fighting raged for the best part of last week.“I arrived here in agony,” said Mamy Esther, 40, who suffered a pelvic injury in a bombing last week and is being treated at Kyeshero hospital.Doctors at the facility walked around examining patients, many in bandages and plaster casts, lying in beds in about 20 tents outside the hospital building.Esther said she had lost her six-year-old son in the explosion that left her initially unable to walk. “I am recovering little by little,” she said.View image in fullscreenDoctors review an X-ray showing a bullet lodged in the hand of a patient in the grounds of Kyeshero hospital.Photograph: Marie Jeanne Munyerenkana/EPAAt Virunga hospital, Chadrack Kabumba, 20, nursed bullet wounds to his knee and shoulders after he was shot four times on his way to check if his property had been vandalised, the day after M23 entered Goma. “By divine grace, I hope that I will recover,” he said, sitting on his bed. Other patients nearby screamed and writhed in pain.Esther and Kabumba are among hundreds of people in Goma wounded in the fighting who are in desperate need of blood.The fighting has caused an influx to hospitals and deepened the crisis in the city of 2 million people, a humanitarian hub for those displaced.At the start of the offensive on Goma, Kyeshero, which is supported by Doctors without Borders, mainly received patients with shrapnel wounds, the charity said. Now it mostly treats bullet wounds.On the first day the fighting eased, the hospital received nearly 140 wounded people at its triage unit, many of whom were admitted.mapThe conflict has disrupted transport routes, cutting off flows of aid, food and medical supplies. It has also made it impossible for overwhelmed hospitals to move patients to Bukavu, the capital of neighbouring South Kivu province.In response to the need for blood, Goma residents have queued in different parts of the city to donate. Among them was Prince Muhindo at HealAfricahospital, in the city centre, on Wednesday. “I realise that many people are suffering greatly from the lack of blood following the recent fighting, said Muhindo, 25, a motorcyclist. “To put an end to this situation, I resolved to save lives of my own free will.”Muhindo said some of his family members had died of bullet wounds when M23 took over the city.In Katindo neighbourhood, people sat on chairs at a blood donation centre. Masika Mireille, 38, a housekeeper, regularly donates, but this time she was doing it for a deeper and symbolic purpose, she said.View image in fullscreenA wounded woman arrives for treatment at Kyeshero hospital.Photograph: Marie Jeanne Munyerenkana/EPA“To demonstrate the resilience of our city, I give my blood to save these thousands of people who need it,” she said. “It is my responsibility as a patriot.”Innocent Gashamba, who is charge of blood collection at the provincial blood transfusion centre in Goma, said it had been running four donation sessions a day since Saturday, with a target of 200 bags a day. “There is a crying need for blood,” he said, urging the city’s residents to “participate massively”, adding “blood has no substitute”.M23, a Tutsi-led group that the DRC, UN, US and other countries say Rwanda supports, claims its aim is to protect the interests of the Congolese Tutsi and other minorities. It is one of more than 100 armed groups fighting to make territorial gains in the DRC’s mineral-rich east to fund their operations.Rwanda denies backing M23, but UN experts say there is solid evidence to the contrary, and that Rwanda uses the militia to extract and export valuable minerals.M23 declared a unilateral ceasefire “for humanitarian reasons” starting on Tuesday, as humanitarian organisations and the international community stepped up calls for the creation of safe corridors to get vital items in to Goma.But its fightersbroke the ceasefireon Wednesday, launching another offensive in eastern DRC and seizing a mining town in South Kivu province.Two regional blocs – the Southern African Development Community and the East African Community – will hold a joint summit in Dar es Salaam, in Tanzania, on Friday and Saturday to discuss the conflict.Explore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Another 23 people were sent back toMorocco.On Thursday, one of the survivors, known as Brice O, filed a complaint with the UN committee over Spain’s failure to investigate the use of the anti-riot equipment at the beach.“I find it incredibly dangerous that rubber bullets are being used,” said Brice O, who left his native Cameroon as an unaccompanied minor and spent years living in the Moroccan forests near Spain’s other north African enclave, Melilla. “I bear witness as someone disabled in one eye because of a rubber bullet.”The survivor said something hit his eye as he made for the beach in the inner tube of a tyre, and that he was left choking and gasping for air as projectiles hit the water around him.“Suddenly I felt an intense pain in my face, on my left side, a pain in the eye area,” he said. “I managed to get out of the water but I was really struggling to breathe.”Brice O, who was later recognised as a refugee by the office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, eventually relocated from Morocco to Canada, where he is studying cinematography and film production.Spain’s then interior minister, Jorge Fernández Díaz, said officers fired rubber bullets “at the water, not at people”, and denied that the actions of the police played any role in the deaths.Repeated attempts to secure justice for the victims have proved fruitless. In October 2015, a judgedismissed the caseagainst 16 Guardia Civil officers in connection with the incident, ruling that while there was no protocol covering the use of anti-riot equipment in “a water-based environment”, the officers had been forced to use the materials in the course of their duties.The case wasofficially shelvedby the supreme court almost three years ago.Hanaa Hakiki, the director of the border justice team at the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, described the Tarajal investigation as a farce, adding: “There was no real legal assessment of the force used by the Guardia Civil. The last 11 years have been a disgrace and Spain must fully investigate this deadly border operation.”A separate appeal brought on behalf of other victims and their relatives by a group of Spanish NGOs – including the Spanish Commission forRefugees(CEAR), the Human Rights Association of Spain (APDHE) and the Coordinadora de Barrios – is pending at Spain’s constitutional court.Elena Muñoz, of the CEAR, said the protection of migrants’ right to life at borders needed to be established “so that these terrible events do not recur and so that families finally have access to truth, justice and reparation”.Refugee files complaint to UN against Spain over 2014 border deathsRead moreQuestions over the policing of Spain’s borders intensified in June 2022 whenat least 37 people diedduring a mass storming of the border fence between Morocco and Melilla.Amnesty Internationalsaidthe “widespread use of unlawful force” by Moroccan and Spanish authorities contributed to the fatalities, while a UN working group of expertsdescribed the deathsas evidence of the “racialised exclusion and deadly violence deployed to keep out people of African and Middle Eastern descent”.Maite Daniela Lo Coco, a migration coordinator for the human rights group Irídia, said the Spanish-Moroccan border had been the site of human rights violations for decades.She said: “Both the operations at El Tarajal in 2014 and on 24 June 2022 in Melilla show how the indiscriminate use of anti-riot material, pushbacks, the claim of exceptionality and lack of effective investigations combine to create life-threatening situations causing deaths of Black people at the border.”The interior ministry said it had no comment to make regarding the complaint.Explore more on these topicsSpainMoroccoRefugeesMigrationAfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Rubio added: “Absent immediate changes, it would require the United States to take measures necessary to protect its rights.”Responding to Mulino’s comments on Thursday, Rubio said: “The United States has a treaty obligation to protect the Panama canal if it comes under attack. That treaty obligation would have to be enforced by the armed forces of the United States, particularly the US navy. I find it absurd that we would have to pay fees to transit a zone that we are obligated to protect in a time of conflict.”Most analysts believe US military action to reclaim the canal by force is unlikely, although George HW Bush’s 1989 invasion to depose Panama’s dictatorManuel Noriegasuggests it is not impossible.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Thursday, Panama’s president announced that his country’s diplomats had informed their Chinese counterparts that the Central American country was ending its involvement inChina’s “Belt and Road” initiative. The scheme is a trillion-dollar-plus development campaign through which China’s leader, Xi Jinping, hopes to boost economic growth – not to mention Beijing’s geopolitical influence – across the globe by building massive amounts of infrastructure, from railways in Thailand and Ethiopia to a recently opened “mega port” in Peru.On Wednesday a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, Lin Jian, condemned how the US had “made irresponsible remarks on the Panama canal issue, and intentionally distorted, attacked and mischaracterized relevant cooperation”. “Belt and Road” initiative cooperation had “achieved fruitful outcomes” between Panama and China, Lin claimed.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationPanamaUS foreign policyMarco RubioChinaAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A few blocks from the buyer’s location, however, their car was stopped at a checkpoint manned by navy troopers deployed on the streets after President Daniel Noboa decreed an “internal armed conflict” against organised crime.Vega’s cousin attempted a U-turn, clipping a soldier and a military vehicle. An argument broke out, and the troops opened fire. Vega was shot four times and died; his cousin survived a gunshot to the shoulder.The government swiftly labelled the two unarmed victims as“terrorists”who had allegedly attempted an “attack on a military checkpoint”. Although thepublic prosecutor’s office dismissed the claimand cleared them of any wrongdoing, the government has never apologised.“His death destroyed our family,” said Vega’s father, Carlos Vicente Vega Molina, 55.“I don’t want my son’s death to go unpunished like so many others,” said his mother, Laura Ipanaqué, 43.Vega’s case, along with that offour Black boys who died in Decemberafter being detained by the military, are the two most glaring examples of a wave ofserious human rights violationssinceNoboa introducedhismano dura(iron fist) policy a year ago in response to adramatic surgein violent crime.This Sunday, that policy and Noboa’s brief 14 months in power will be put to the test as about 13 million Ecuadorians head to the polls for the first round of the presidential election.The heir to a banana fortune, Noboa, 37, became Ecuador’s youngest president in 2023 aftersurprisingly winning a snap electionto complete the term of the former president, Guillermo Lasso, who had dissolved Congress and resigned to avoid impeachment. Noboa was one of three Latin American presidents who attended Donald Trump’s inauguration at the US Capitol, along with El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele and Argentina’s Javier Milei.“Noboa’s presidency has been marked above all by a radicalisation against human rights,” said journalist Karol Noroña, who led aninvestigation uncovering inconsistenciesin the military’s account of Vega’s death. Although she acknowledged that “human rights violations aren’t typically discussed in Ecuadorian households”, Noroña said that other issues – such as anenergy crisisthat has caused scheduled blackouts of up to 14 hours – could influence the upcoming election.For Guillaume Long, a senior research fellow at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Noboa’s government displayed “clear signs of authoritarianism and a disregard for the rule of law, constitutional practices and rights”.He highlightedthe president’s refusal to step downduring the 30-day electoral campaign period, as mandated by the constitution, and an unprecedented diplomatic incident in whichEcuadorian police and military forcesinvaded the Mexican embassy in Quito to arrest Jorge Glas, a former vice-president under the leftist Rafael Correa.View image in fullscreenSupporters of Luisa Gonzalez, Noboa’s main rival in the election.Photograph: José Jácome/EPA“Noboa also has a tendency of ruling by emergency decrees in all sorts of ways,” said Long, who was Ecuador’s foreign minister under Correa. Last year, the country was under a state of emergency for 250 days, allowing measures such as warrantless home raids and a ban on the right to assembly. Noboa has justified such steps asnecessary to fight gangs.In April, the rightwing president won a referendum supporting his security plan, but Long said that did not necessarily mean he enjoys enough popular support to have an easy ride in Sunday’s election – although polls suggest an advantage for the incumbent.“When campaigning for the referendum, Noboa said he hadn’t been able to reduce crime because his hands were tied. Nearly a year later, he still has not delivered,” said Long.Once one of the safest countries in Latin America, Ecuador saw violence soar after its ports turned into what InsighCrime has called a “cocaine superhighway” to the US and Europe. There was an initial drop in homicides when Noboa imposed his “war on drugs”, but the rates quickly returned to the previous alarming levels, making 2024 the second most violent year. Meanwhile, kidnapping and extortion continued to rise.In Cañaveral, an impoverished neighbourhood in the north-west of Guayaquil, people pay a weekly $2vacuna(extortion fee) to the local gang. “If you don’t pay, they’ll break into your house and take your things. Sometimes, the $2 is the only money I have, so I end up not buying food or water for my children,” said one resident.European officials credit Noboa’s crackdown for a significant reduction in drug shipments, yet Spain’s largest ever cocaine seizure, last November, came from a banana-loaded ship from Guayaquil.“How does a 13-tonne shipment get through the port? There is a policy of zero control at the maritime ports in Ecuador,” said Mónica Luzárraga, a former public defender in Guayaquil, who in recent years has worked on hundreds of drug-trafficking cases.“The balance of this internal armed conflict is disastrous in terms of human rights and criminal control,” she said. “Now the citizens are not only victims of criminal groups but also of the abuses committed by the armed forces.”In Vega’s case, two navy soldiers and a corporal await trial on bail. “I forgive those people because we’ve been taught about forgiveness, but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be judged for all the harm they’ve caused us,” said the young man’s mother, Laura Ipanaqué.“The truth is, the soldiers didn’t just kill my son – they killed us too,” she said.Explore more on these topicsEcuadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

During the election campaign, Trump had suggested he would withdraw US troops from Japan, contingent on Tokyo’s willingness to make abigger financial contributionto their countries’ postwar alliance.The gambit worked. During Trump’s five-nation visit to Asia in late 2017, he and Abe, who wasassassinatedin 2022,bonded over a round of golf– a sport for which the Japanese leader had apparently developed a sudden passion – and gourmet hamburgers.For the remainder of Trump’s term, Abe supported the US administration with a fervour that eluded many of his contemporaries. US troops remained inJapan, and the bilateral security treaty – the cornerstone of Japan’s postwar foreign policy – survived unscathed.As he prepares to fly to Washington on a three-day visit, all eyes are on whether Japan’s current leader, Shigeru Ishiba, will be able to re-create Abe’s personal rapport with Trump, althoughgolf diplomacyis unlikely to play a part for the cigarette-smokingplastic-modelling enthusiast.When they sign a joint statement in Washington after their talks on Friday, Japan will be looking for familiar guarantees from Trump: that the US will defend Japan, including in any conflict with China over the disputedSenkaku islands, a commitment to stability in the Taiwan strait, and continued backing for the region’s opposition toNorth Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.And while Trump’s threats to impose tariffs have so far targeted Mexico, Canada and China, Ishiba will be aware that Japan – which has a $56bn trade surplus with the US – could also be sucked into a trade war.“We have a lot of topics to discuss,” Ishiba told MPs this week. “I hope to set priorities and get results in the limited time we have.”In return for offering security guarantees Trump will expect reciprocal action from Ishiba, a low-energy, cautious politician unaccustomed to horse-trading with the leader of the world’s biggest economy.But he will not go to Washington empty-handed. Like his recent predecessors, Ishiba wants toraise defence spendingto 2% of GDP by 2027 – a commitment that will almost certainly mean buying US-manufactured military hardware. He will remind Trump that Japan has led foreign direct investment in the US for the past five years and highlight Japanese companies’ record in creating jobs for Americans. He might also outline plans for new Japanese investments, including in a $44bn gas pipeline in Alaska.That Ishiba will be the second foreign leader, afterBenjamin Netanyahu, to meet Trump “says something about Japan’s strategic weight”, said Nicholas Szechenyi, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Japan’s foreign policy has always been ‘America First,’ and if Ishiba can deliver that message eloquently he will establish a foundation for strong alliance ties.”Szechenyi added: “Will Ishiba succeed? The media will be looking for signs of personal chemistry, and that is important in diplomacy. But the message Ishiba brings is profound, and what might at first appear to be a hastily arranged bilateral meeting could serve as a starting point for shaping the regional balance of power in favour of the US alliance network in Asia during Trump 2.0.”Tobias Harris, founder and principal at Japan Foresight, a political risk advisory firm, said Ishiba’s trip carries considerable domestic risks, as he attempts to assert control of hisscandal-riven, divided Liberal Democratic party[LDP].“How Ishiba handles his relationship with Trump will draw intense scrutiny and carry immense risks for Ishiba’s standing at home,” Harris said. “If he is overly ingratiating, he will be grilled by lawmakers in parliament.”Ishiba has also come under pressure over how he will broach the subject of Trump’s decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization and the Paris climate accord, as well as his administration’s now-paused tariffs on Canada and Mexico.“The Japanese media will be watching closely how Trump addresses Ishiba, what his body language looks like, and whether he uses his first name – and if he is unable to receive assurances from Trump on key issues,” Harris added.“It is a risky meeting for Ishiba. He could face tough questioning at home for not standing up for Japan’s interests, but if he fails to bring home reassurances from Trump or to forge a sufficiently cordial relationship with him, his rivals in the LDP could step up the pressure.”Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

The petition urged the Senate to shift itself into an impeachment court to try the vice-president, “render a judgement of conviction,” remove her from office and ban her from holding public office.“Duterte’s conduct throughout her tenure clearly displays gross faithlessness against public trust and a tyrannical abuse of power that, taken together, showcases her gross unfitness to hold public office and her infidelity to the laws and the 1987 Constitution,” the complaint said.Duterte ran alongside Marcos in 2022 on a campaign battle cry of unity in a deeply divided Southeast Asian country. Both were scions of strongmen accused of human rights violations, but their strong regional bases of support combinedto give them landslide victories.Marcos is the son and namesake of the late dictator ousted in a 1986 pro-democracy uprising. The vice-president’s father and Marcos’s predecessor, Duterte, led adeadly anti-drug crackdownthat is beinginvestigated by the international criminal courtas a possible crime against humanity.The whirlwind political alliance of the campaign rapidly frayed when they took office.The impeachment complaint against the vice-president focused on a death threat she allegedly made against the president, his wife and the House speaker last year, alleged irregularities in the use of her office’s intelligence funds and her alleged failure to stand up to Chinese aggression in the disputed South China Sea.She said in an online news conference on 23 November that she had contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned wasn’t a joke.She later said that she wasn’t threatening him, but was expressing concern for her own safety. However, her statements set off an investigation and national security concerns.Allegations of graft and corruption against her also emanated from a monthslong and televised House investigation on the alleged misuse of 612.5 million pesos ($10.5m) of confidential and intelligence funds received by Duterte’s offices as vice-president and education secretary. She has since left the education post after her political differences with Marcos deepened.She has also been accused of unexplained wealth and failure to declare her wealth as required by the law. She has refused to respond to questions in detail in tense televised hearings last year.The impeachment complaint accused Duterte of undermining the Marcos government’s policies, including her description of the administration’s handling of territorial disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea as a “fiasco.” The complaint also mentioned her silence over China’s increasingly assertive actions in the disputed waters.“Her sheer evasiveness and silence on the West Philippine Sea issue, an issue that strikes at the core of Philippine sovereignty, is diametrically opposed to her being so loquacious as to other issues,” the impeachment petition said, using the Philippine name for the disputed waters.Explore more on these topicsPhilippinesAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

They follow a pattern known as “Zipfian distribution”, where the most used word in a language (like “the”) is used about twice as often as the second most common word, and three times as frequent as the third most common word and so on.All human languages – whether written, spoken or signed – share these common properties that help them be transmitted from one generation to the next.‘It just can’t be replaced’: Mallacoota’s black summer grief is still fresh after five yearsRead moreResearchers detected word-like elements while analysing eight years of humpback whale recordings from New Caledonia, finding whale song shared the same characteristic fingerprint that makes human languages learnable,publishing their discovery in Science.Dr Jenny Allen, an expert in whale song structure at Griffith University and co-author of the paper, said one of the things that made humpback whales so fascinating was how often their song changed and how quickly whales were able to learn a new song.“Human language and whale song are both culturally learned, so whales learn the songs from the other whales that they spend time with. So that’s why all the whales in one population will be singing the same song,” she said.“The only other species where you see learning on that spatial scale is in humans.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe unexpected discovery of parallel structures in human language and whale song was made possible by a unique collaboration between marine biologists, behavioural ecologists, scientists and linguists.Prof Simon Kirby, an expert in language evolution at the University of Edinburgh and co-author of the paper, said insights about infant learning were “the key that unlocked this discovery”.He said human babies used an approach called “statistical learning” in order to identify words in the continuous stream of language that they’re exposed to. “It sounds technical and complicated,” Kirby said, “but actually it’s beautifully simple.”Babies noticed that sounds within words were often stuck together, and more predictable than across word boundaries. “If you think of a word like ‘baby’, after a ‘bae’ sound, ‘bee’ is a relatively predictable continuation of that sound.”The researchers used these insights to identify the word-like sound elements in whale song.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Male humpback whales had an amazing ability to produce a variety of sounds, she said.Pirotta saidearlier researchhad found evidence of specific vocalisations and themes being transmitted between different groups and generations, and evenacross oceans.“The hottest 100 on the east coast this year might be the hottest 100 across the ditch in New Zealand the next year,” she said.Explore more on these topicsWhalesAustralian climate and environment in focusMarine lifeCetaceansWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

She denies the charges.On Thursday, Kerr’s partner and fiancee, Kristie Mewis, told the court that Kerr was “speaking her truth” after being “treated differently” by officers when she made the comments. She accused them of “gaslighting” the couple after they doubted their account of being “held hostage” in a taxi in the early hours of 30 January 2023.View image in fullscreenKristie Mewis, partner of Australia striker Sam Kerr, outside court.Photograph: Alberto Pezzali/APMewis, who is pregnant with the couple’s child, was asked by Grace Forbes, who is defending Kerr, about her reaction when Kerr called PC Stephen Lovell “stupid and white”.“I think that, in that moment, she was speaking her truth in how she was feeling. I think that subconsciously, she felt like she was being treated differently. I’ve seen it a lot,” said Mewis, an American who is also a professional footballer.She said she had seen Kerr “treated differently multiple times” and later told the court that Kerr had “been treated differently, and spoke to differently, for her whole life. I think that she was feeling the same thing she had felt before”.Mewis became emotional twice on the witness stand. When asked how she felt in the taxi, which she said was moving “uncontrollably fast” after Kerr got sick out of the window, she teared up and said it “felt like someone else had control over me and that was obviously very scary”.Later, she was asked to describe Kerr as a person and struggled to hold back tears.Mewis said: “Sam is so loving and she’s so humble. She’s would help anybody, that’s one of the things I love about her so much, how helpful, and loving and humble she is.“She’s so inspiring, she inspires me everyday. I wouldn’t want anyone else to be the mother of my child.”Mewis described how she “immediately felt fear for my life” in a locked, speeding taxi. After a night out in London, the pair hailed a black cab back to their home. During the journey, Mewis said Kerr rolled down the windows of the cab and was sick outside. After this, she said the driver pulled over and “started yelling” before he resumed driving in a reckless manner.She said she had “never driven in a car that fast before” and “tried everything to get out”. She said, after the “initial shock wore off”, she knew she had to do “something dramatic” to save them. In the course of this, the taxi driver called the police.“I didn’t know if it was a kidnapping or if we were going to crash,” she said. Mewis said she was “kicking straight out with both feet” and broke the car’s window in a bid to escape before it parked outside Twickenham police station – on the instruction of police who answered the taxi driver’s call.When they went inside the station, Mewis said the police were “dismissive” of their claims.“It felt a little bit gaslighting,” she told the court. “Like it would just be easier for them if the whole thing was our fault.”She said the ordeal they relayed to officers would be “different” when repeated back to them. “The way he would say it back would manipulate it back to us,” she told the court.Eventually, Kerr paid the driver £900 for the damage. Mewis said they paid the sum because she wanted to “escape the situation” and that Mewis “was trying to make the US football team that summer.Earlier in the day, Kerr was cross-examined by prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones. He asked her whether she was using Lovell’s “whiteness as an insult”, which she denied.When pressed again about what “his race had to do with anything”, Kerr said: “I believed it was him using his power and privilege over me because he was accusing me of being something I’m not.”In a testy exchange, Emlyn Jones said: “Ms Kerr, if I put to you that you’re fucking stupid, that would be bang out of order wouldn’t it?”“Yes,” she responded.“I’d be insulting you?,” he said.“Yes. I expressed myself very poorly,” she said.Kerr was asked why she told Lovell she has “got all the fucking people in the world” and has “fucking Chelsea going on”. She said it was an attempt to “bluff” to “make myself feel protected”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrAustralia sportChelsea WomennewsShareReuse this content"

He was freed in 2009 after his conviction for kidnapping was overturned by an appeal court.Some time around 2015 he moved to a remote house in the village of Vidaillat, in the Creuse, and established himself as a dog breeder with his British partner, Sandra Clifton.When workplace and animal welfareinspectors, accompanied by gendarmes, visited the property on 25 August 2022 to inspect the kennels after complaints from neighbours that he was running an illegal business, Hendy-Freegard allegedly drove off in his Audi A3, hitting the officers in the process.A female officer was reportedly carried 100 yards on the vehicle’s bonnet, broke her nose and was signed off work for 21 days, while her male colleague was signed off for six days.Hendy-Freegard was arrested two weeks later after his car was stopped by Belgian police on the E40 motorway at Grand Bigard near Brussels. He was originally accused of attempted murder but this was later changed to a charge of violence against public officials with aggravating circumstances.Hendy-Freegard, who appeared in court in Guéret under the name David Hendy, denied deliberately hitting the two gendarmes.The court heard that while on the run he sent a message to a French gendarme he knew, saying: “I just wanted to say that I apologise to your colleagues who jumped in front of me. I’m horrified that they might have thought I wanted to murder them.”He told the court he had been upset that day because Clifton had announced she was leaving him. “First of all, I’m sorry I didn’t stop. But I panicked … I didn’t stop because I’m a human being with emotions,” he said.He blamed the Netflix documentary for causing distress and psychological problems. “There are always two sides to every story. I made mistakes that day, but you have no idea what I went through, even though I’m not a physical victim. But none of this would have happened if the Netflix documentary hadn’t been shown,” he said.He told the hearing he and Clifton had moved to France after she saw an advertisement for the property in a remote location in Vidaillat. Asked what income he had at the time, he replied: “I’d need to clarify that point.”The court heard that the property, where the couple ran a business breeding beagles, was dilapidated and Hendy-Freegard said problems caused by Brexit had prevented them from renovating it.While at the kennels, the officers discovered Clifton living at the property. Neighbours had previously alerted the authorities about a woman they thought was being held in “awful conditions” at the house, but as the woman told police there was no cause for concern, inquiries were dropped.Clifton is believed to have since returned to the UK and declined to press charges.Hendy-Freegard, born in 1971 in Worksop, was the central figure in Netflix’s 2022 documentaryThe Puppet Master: Hunting the Ultimate Conmanand also inspired the filmRogue Agent, a fictional story starring James Norton and Gemma Arterton.The state prosecutor, Alexandra Pethieu, had requested a seven-year prison sentence, saying the escape attempt resulted in “an appalling scene worthy of Mad Max”.During an earlier hearing, Hendy-Freegard’s lawyer, Juliette Magne-Gandois, said he had “always denied any intent to kill anyone”, a charge carrying a sentence of up to 30 years. Agence France-Presse reported that Magne-Gandois had since stopped representing him.During his London trial, the court was told Hendy-Freegard lived by the motto: “Lies have to be big to be convincing.” One of his victims recalled him taking her from a supposed “safe house” with a bucket over her head, having to hide in cupboards to avoid visitors, and spending three weeks in a locked bathroom with little to eat.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The changes will be in effect for at least 90 days and could be renewed or made permanent, according to the directive.Trump has spoken about improving relations with Moscow. He has previously vowed to end the war in Ukraine, though he has not released a detailed plan.The emphasis on drug cartels comes after Trump designated many such groups as terrorist organizations, part of a crackdown on illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking.The shift also implicates enforcement of a US foreign bribery law that has led to some of the justice department’s largest corporate cases over the last decade. The unit enforcing that law, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), will now prioritize bribery investigations related to cartels, according to the memo.A wide range of multinational firms has come under justice department scrutiny over the law, including Goldman Sachs, Glencore and Walmart. Those large corporate resolutions do not typically involve cartels.“It is a radical move away from traditional FCPA cases and toward a narrow subset of drug and violent crime-related cases that have never been the focus of FCPA enforcement,” said Stephen Frank, a lawyer at law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan who worked on FCPA cases as a federal prosecutor.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationRussiaUkrainePam BondiUS politicsEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked whether fishing rights would get in the way of a security pact, he said: “No, these are different things. European defence and fisheries cannot be put on the same level. We should have common sense of what we are talking about.”He was speaking to reporters three days after Starmer outlined his ideasfor anEU-UK security pactat a dinner with EU leaders on Monday, the first time a British prime minister had attended a European Council since Brexit.Costa said that had been “a very important moment” where “everybody expressed the will that we need to strengthen our cooperation on security and defence”.Along with the European Commission president,Ursula von der Leyen, Costa will travel to the UK for an EU-UK summit on 19 May. The meeting is expected to yield an agreement to open negotiations in a range of areas, although precise outcomes remain uncertain.For the EU, a main concern is the post-Brexit fisheries agreement that expires in June 2026. Member states want to maintain the status quo, but the prime minister will face pressure to secure bigger quotas for British fishing fleets. According to diplomatic sources, a large majority of member states favour“a package approach”, linking all topics of the EU-UK reset, including security, fishing rights and a youth mobility deal.Striking a more emollient tone, Costa said: “What is important now is to take note of the wish of the United Kingdom to reset their relations with the European Union and our wish to have the closest relation as possible with the United Kingdom, namely on security and defence.” He added that it was important toimplement previous agreements, overcome problems, and “prevent new problems”.Senior EU diplomats view UK relations as “the easy bit” of Monday’s summit, which included talks on how to deal with a US president who has voiced open hostility to the EU, as well as a debate about funding European defence projects by incurring common debt.The EU needs to find €500bn (£418bn) for extra defence investments over the next decade, the commission has said.Asked about common debt to raise defence funds, Costa said he could not exclude any solution. The summit was “not the moment to draw red lines” but “a brainstorming” and “the moment to open green lanes to create a space to debate”, he said.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionKeir StarmerEuropean CommissionFishing industryFishingBrexitForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Definitely, there’s a fear about this having a long term impact on tourism.”Government officials said the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, would visit the island on Friday in what was described as “a show of solidarity”.

Her comments have been described as“absolutely hateful” by the movie’s director, Jacques Audiard, while Gascón’s co-star, Zoe Saldana, has saidthe views expressed had saddened and disappointed her.On Thursday, Spanish media reported that Gascón – who has apologised for the comments made in old posts on X – would not be attending Saturday’s Goya awards, which are Spain’s equivalent of theOscars. It also emerged that Dos Bigotes, a publishing house specialising in LGBTQ+, gender and feminist themes, has dropped plans for a revised edition of a biographical novel that Gascón published in Mexico in 2018.Dos Bigotes said it had told the actor of its decision on Monday, informing her that the sentiments aired in her posts were inconsistent with its commitment to “equality, inclusion and diversity”. However, the publisher said that while it obviously did not share the views Gascón had expressed, it had told her that “we believe that the passage of time, and the lessons that life and time teach us, can make us better”.The previous day, two prominent leftwing Spanish politicians had weighed in on the controversy.“I feel bad about Karla Sofía Gascón’s tweets,” said the culture minister, Ernest Urtasun. “They don’t reflect Spanish society, and it pains me to say it, because her [Oscar] candidacy was very important for the country. And those tweets have tarnished that.”His colleague, the labour minister and deputy prime minister, Yolanda Díaz, was asked about the matter during a radio interview.“I was absolutely delighted when she was nominated because of the symbolism and the force of what she represents,” she told Cadena Ser. “When I read the tweets, which aren’t tweets but are reflections of what a person thinks, I was deeply upset.”Although the recently unearthed social media posts – in which Gascón called George Floyd “a drug addict swindler” and said Islam was “becoming a hotbed of infection for humanity” – are thought to have destroyed her Oscar hopes, some have questioned the scale and ferocity of the backlash the actor faces.In a column inEl País on Wednesday, the writer and journalist Sergio del Molino argued that Gascón the actor, and Gascón the person ought to be considered separately, and that she shouldn’t be penalised come Oscar night.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And if they deemed that performance prize-worthy a week ago, they still should, because the film hasn’t changed.”Another writer and journalist, Manuel Jabois,told Cadena Serthat “anyone who doesn’t feel a bit sorry for her has a problem”, while acknowledging that there was a debate to be had about how to separate Gascón’s “artistic talent from her disgusting and racist” opinions.“And there’s another debate about how far the rejection, or cancellation – by Netflix, by colleagues, by the government of this country – can go,” said Jabois. “No matter how gross I find her 10-year-old opinions, I condemn the absurd cruelty and the absurd solitude to which she’s been condemned.”Explore more on these topicsFilmEmilia PérezSpainOscarsEuropeAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

The work of all three individuals has been critical of the rightwing government of Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni.A person familiar with the matter saidItalyhad breached the terms of Paragon’s contract with the government, which does not allow for journalists or members of civil society to be targeted with the spyware.Like Pegasus, the hacking software made by the rival NSO Group, Paragon’s hacking spyware, called Graphite, can infect a mobile phone without a user’s knowledge. It then gives the operator of the spyware full control and access to messages and encrypted chats sent over apps such asWhatsAppand Signal.The news has sent shockwaves across the Italian parliament, with one MP saying that, if confirmed, the story represented an “unacceptable violation of fundamental rights and an attack on democracy itself”.Paragon’s decision to terminate the contract, which was first reported by the Guardian, comesless than a week after WhatsApp announced that Paragon’s spyware had been used to target dozens of people. Like other spyware vendors, Paragon sells its cyberweapon to government clients who are supposed to use it to prevent crime. It remains unclear who all the specific government clients were behind the alleged attacks.Responding to the allegations of involvement late on Wednesday, Meloni’s office denied that domestic intelligence services or the government were behind the alleged breaches against the journalist and activists.The person familiar with the matter, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said Paragon had “out of an abundance of caution” initially suspended the Italy contract when the first allegation of potential abuse of the spyware emerged last Friday. The decision to fully terminate the contract, the person said, was made on Wednesday after Paragon determined that Italy had broken the terms of service and ethical framework it had agreed under its Paragon contract.The Guardian has contacted an Italian government spokesperson for comment.Italian opposition parties on Thursday called on Meloni to urgently address parliament amid scepticism over the government’s statement, which also revealed that it had been told by WhatsApp that the number of affected Italians “appeared to be seven”. It is unclear who the other alleged victims are.Giuseppe Conte, leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S), said: “Something doesn’t add up. The fact that journalists are being spied upon is in itself of unprecedented severity in a democratic system, and if even a company says it had to interrupt the contract for ethical reasons … this is very serious.”Barbara Floridia, an M5S senator and president of the supervisory committee for the state broadcaster, Rai, said the case “raises disturbing questions about the protection of privacy and freedom of the press in our country”.“If confirmed, this story would represent an unacceptable violation of fundamental rights and an attack on democracy itself,” she added.Sandro Ruotolo, an MEP with the Democratic party, said: “In the statement excluding its involvement in espionage, the Italian government did not answer the most important question, namely whether or not Italy purchased services from Paragon Solutions. If so, what type [of service] and for what?”Asked for comment, a Paragon representative declined to confirm or deny the development, and said it was the company’s policy to not discuss potential client matters.Francesco Cancellato, the editor-in-chief of Fanpage,a highly regarded investigative news outlet, was the first to publicly state last Friday that he was one of the 90 people who had been notified by WhatsApp that his mobile phone had been targeted, and most likely compromised, by the hacking software.WhatsApp said the 90 people who were likely to have been compromised had been added to WhatsApp group chats and been sent malicious PDFs, which then probably infected their phones. The users would not have had to click or download the pdf to be infected.WhatsApp said all of the hacking attempts had been discovered in December, in part through the help of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks digital threats against civil society. It is not clear for how long the individuals could have been surveilled or the government clients involved in each case.While it is not entirely clear why Cancellato may have been targeted, his publication last year published a high-profile investigation that exposed young fascists in Meloni’s party. The two other people who were targeted,Husam El Gomati, a Libyan activist living in Sweden, andLuca Casarini, the founder of NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans, have both been vocal critics of Italy’s alleged complicity in abuses suffered by migrants in Libya.While Paragon’s move is likely to assuage some concerns, there are still outstanding questions about dozens of other cases that WhatsApp discovered. Italy said earlier on Wednesday that it had been told by WhatsApp that those targets live in countries acrossEurope– and possibly other countries – including Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.Paragon was reportedly recently acquired by a US firm called AE Industrial Partners, which on its website is described as a private investment firm with $5.6bn of assets under management, focused on markets including national security. The company has not responded to requests for comment.Paragon agreed a $2m contract last year with Ice, the US immigration and customs enforcement agency. The contract, agreed under the Biden administration, was reportedly suspended while the administration sought to determine whether it complied with an executive order that restricted the use of spyware by the federal government. The current status of the contract is not known. Neither Ice nor Paragon has responded to the Guardian’s questions about the contract.Explore more on these topicsWhatsAppItalyEuropeHackingSurveillanceEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

Eight out of 10 Jewish Israelis support Trump’s call for the “relocation” of Palestinians from Gaza, although only half think it is a practical proposal, according to apollby the Jewish People Policy Institute.The only strong opposition to the plan came from a handful of politicians on the far left of Israel’s spectrum; some relatives of hostages still held inGaza, who said they feared the project could derail the ceasefire deal; and some activists and journalists who echoed international warnings against ethnic cleansing.“If there were a true opposition in Israel, one with a conscience, a worldview and even some sort of plan for the future, it would’ve raised a loud warning: don’t drink Trump’s potion,” Gur Megiddowrotein a column for Haaretz.“The idea of clearing an area of a specific ethnic group, even if it’s a bitter and ruthless enemy, is a concept that Jews – especially the sons of Holocaust survivors like Lapid and Gantz – must never support, no matter the circumstances.”The announcement by the defence minister, Israel Katz, of orders to the military to prepare air, sea and land options for Palestinians to leave Gaza appeared more political than practical, even if any wanted to go, because no countries have offered to host them.“The people of Gaza should have the right to freedom of movement and migration,” Katz said in a statement on X, although it was clear the journeys would only be in one direction.Before the war, Israel’s tight controls on movement in and out of Gaza made it difficult for Palestinians to travel internationally. Restrictions got even tighter after the conflict began; and after Israeli troops began operating near the Rafah crossing last May it was impossible for Palestinians to leave.Trump’s Gaza remarks are no surprise: ethnically cleansing was always the plan | Arwa MahdawiRead moreAn agreement to allow medical evacuations from Gaza was part of the ceasefire deal, andthe first group of sick children lefton Saturday, although two died before they could be taken out and others had become too sick to move.Trump’s plan to turn Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East” caused international outrage, including a warning from the UN secretary general, António Guterres, that“itis essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing”.Forced or coerced displacement is a crime against humanity, illegal under the Geneva conventions, to which Israel and the US are signatories.In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump said Israel would turn the Gaza Strip over to the US after the fighting ended and that no US soldiers would be needed there.“The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting. The Palestinians … would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region,” Trump said in a post building on his controversial comments about Gaza’s future this week. “No soldiers by the U.S. would be needed!”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their decision prompted fury in Israel, which ordered back its ambassadors and accused the countries of rewarding terrorism.Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, was quick to reject the demand. Palestinians who needed support, including urgent medical treatment, would be welcomed in Spain, but “Gaza is the land of the people of Gaza”, he said in a radio interview. “It should be part of a future Palestinian state.”Inside Israel the far right embraced Trump’s comments as vindication of their long-term call for the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza and for Jewish settlement.The legislator Limor Son Har-Melech said Trump was hailed as “original and creative” for laying out plans that had led her party leader, Itamar Ben-Gvir, to be labelled “fascist, extremist, delusional”.In a radio interview she described a vision of Jewish Israeli children playing in Gaza, Haaretz reported. Her party would only return to the coalition government, which it left in opposition to the ceasefire deal, when “we see buses coming out” of Gaza carrying its Palestinian residents, she added.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesIsraelUS foreign policyDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe, and free. No soldiers by the U.S. would be needed!”The post was Trump’s response to broad condemnation of his original announcement on Tuesday, when he said the coastal territory could be turned into a “Riviera of the Middle East” after the 2.3 million Palestinians living there were left to live in other countries.The suggestion produced shock waves across the Middle East and prompteda warning from the UN secretary general, António Guterres, against “any form of ethnic cleansing”. It also met resistance among the president’s “Make America Great Again” (Maga) base and Republican senators, some of whom stated bluntly that they would not go along with it.Trump’s latest statement came after the White House appeared to hurriedly retreat from the idea under a hail of criticism. It emerged that Trump had discussed it with few aides before publicly announcing it, while no feasibility studies had been conducted by the state department or the Pentagon, as is customary with major foreign policy initiatives.No working groups had been set up to examine details. Nor had studies been commissioned to assess how many US troops might need to be deployed to defuse huge quantities of unexploded ordnance.Defence officials, who may be called upon to occupy and secure the territory as it is rebuilt, said they first heard about the idea when Trump announced it. The Pentagon has received no formal request to draft a plan for troop deployment,the Wall Street Journal reported.No consideration appeared to have been given over how to persuade the Palestinian population to move elsewhere. Amid accusations that the proposal amounted to an endorsement of “ethnic cleansing” and could constitute a war crime, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, issued a statement on Wednesday insisting that the relocation would be “temporary” – a qualification unlikely to appease the inhabitants ofGaza, many of whom are themselves descendants of displaced refugees.Trump reportedly seized on the idea following a recent visit to Gaza by Steve Witkoff, his Middle East envoy and a billionaire property developer, who told him that it was “uninhabitable” after the large-scale destruction wreaked by Israel’s military bombardment.The proposal contradicts his publicly stated opposition to US intervention in the Middle East, for which he has criticised past administrations.WhileRepublicanshave publicly applauded Trump’s expansionist foreign policy aspirations since taking office – including proposals to buy Greenland and seize the Panama Canal – there is much less enthusiasm for an involvement in Gaza.“We love the president, but our focus in the War Room is East Palestine, not Palestine,” Steve Bannon, his former aide and one of his most vocal cheerleaders, told his War Room podcast on Wednesday, referring to a town in Ohio that suffered a serious pollution outbreak following a 2023 accident involving a train carrying hazardous waste.Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator for South Carolina and another Trump ally, said all his Senate colleagues opposed sending US troops to Gaza.‘Waterfront property’: what are Trump’s real estate interests in Palestine?Read more“All I can say is I want to destroy Hamas, but I’ve been on the phone with Arabs all day. That approach I think will be very problematic. The idea of Americans going in on the ground in Gaza is a nonstarter for every senator,” he said.The Hillquoted another Republican senator – who requested anonymity to discuss the mood of his colleagues – as saying: “The concern is who’s responsibility is it to rebuild Gaza? I think the reaction of most Americans, me included, is ‘not ours’. I think that’s the bottom line.”Daniel Shapiro, a former US ambassador to Israel under Barack Obama, said the idea was dangerous even if it was unlikely to reach fruition.“The danger is that extremists within the Israeli government and terrorists of various stripes will take it literally and seriously, and start to act on it,” hetold the New York Times. “It could imperil the further release of hostages, put a target on the back of US personnel and undercut prospects of a Saudi-Israel normalisation deal.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpGazaPalestinian territoriesUS foreign policyBenjamin NetanyahuRepublicansIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Displacing them against their will wouldviolateinternational laws and could constitute a war crime. It would also require neighboring Arab and Muslim states to accept millions of new Palestinian refugees, an idea they immediately and sharplyrejected.During his press conference, Trump said that the US “will take over theGazaStrip and we will do a job with it, too”.He went on: “I do see a long-term ownership position and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East,” adding: “Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land.”The idea seemed to echo comments from March last year, when Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law,said: “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable.”“It’s infuriating to listen to President Trump talk about the removal of Palestinians from Palestine and the ownership over their land, the acquisition of their territory by force, as if it was a business transaction and not a violation of very core principles of international law,” said Noura Erakat, a Palestinian American human rights attorney and professor at Rutgers.Trump’s expansionist designs would seem to flout the America First isolationism that much of his base supports. But Immerwahr noted that Trump has never really been strictly isolationist.Immerwahr added that he doubted many of Trump’s voters support these kinds of aggressive foreign policy moves, even when they concern what Trump might call the US’s backyard: “Even with Greenland, Canada, and the Panama Canal zone, it is just far from clear to me how much autonomous support there has been from the Maga base.”While the Israeli right has been thrilled about Trump’s proposal, US conservatives seemed divided orunsureof how to react – perhaps reflective of wider ideological splits between traditional Republican hawks and Republican voters tired of US adventurism overseas. Some Republican members of Congress refused to rule out the idea, while Senator Rand Paulwroteonline: “The pursuit for peace should be that of the Israelis and the Palestinians. I thought we voted for America First.”Occupying Gaza“sounds like a terrible idea for a number of reasons”, someonewrotemore plainly on a conservative forum on Reddit, “chiefly that it has zero value and [sounds like] a huge expense and I want my money in my pocket, not in the Middle East”.Immerwahr thinks that Trump is attracted to territories he believes are blank slates or can be folded into a larger white America. During his first term, Trumpmusedabout the US divesting of Puerto Rico or trading it for Greenland.‘Waterfront property’: What are Trump’s real estate interests in Palestine?Read more“If you were to ask what links the Panama Canal zone, Canada, Greenland, and a Gaza that has been emptied of Palestinians and rendered into a ‘Riviera’, I think you could say that in Trump’s fantasies these places are all symbolically white, or could be symbolically white … either because the Indigenous population seems sparse and there seems to be a lot of land for settlement or other kind of infrastructure projects, or because, in the case of the Panama Canal, that is historically a zone that was controlled by the United States and dominated by [white Americans].”Meanwhile, some elements of the so-called new right, a formerly fringe conservative intellectual movement with ties to Silicon Valley, have praised Trump’s expansionist tendencies. A recent Politico piecenotedthat some new right theorists believe that buying Greenland would revitalize the US “frontier spirit” that they believe spiritually fueled the US in previous centuries.“In terms of Trump’s bluster, Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson are the obvious parallels who kind of delight in the capabilities that come with US military might,” Immerwahr said. A better parallel might be the 19th century, however, when the US continually seized territory, but focused its colonialism on areas where white settlement seemed viable.Until as late as the 1950s, “the logic is that white settlement is the magic dust that would be sprinkled on a territory that would make it eligible for inclusion in the union.”Beinart feels that Trump’s indifference to precedents and norms, combined with a “complete lack of any moral compass”, mean that he doesn’t even see any problems with the idea of rebuilding Gaza as a US colony.“It just doesn’t occur to him that there’s something monstrous about the idea of sending US weapons to utterly destroy a territory,” Beinart said, “and then saying: ‘Oh gosh, it looks like it really sucks there now, people should have to leave.’”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

And, it’s true, the comments don’t seem as if they came on the back of a detailed feasibility study; White House officials spent much of yesterday trying to walk his comments back.But it’s also true that his proposal, which if enacted would amount to an unambiguous case of ethnic cleansing, tells us something about who Trump understands to be the stakeholders in Gaza’s future: not Palestinian civilians, but the United States,Israel, and the contractors who could make it happen. And the idea has so delighted the Israeli right that it is easy to see how, even if no American soldier ever sets foot in Gaza, it creates the space for serious discussion of the same project by other means.For today’s newsletter, I spoke toEyal Weizman, the founder of the research group Forensic Architecture and author ofHollow Land: Israel’s Architecture of Occupation, about the long history that informs Trump’s intervention, whether he knows it or not – and what it tells us about Gaza’s future. Here are the headlines.Five big storiesUK economy| Bank of England policymakersare poised to cut interest rates and downgrade forecasts for economic growth, underlining the risks facing Rachel Reeves’s budget plans. With inflation falling, the Bank’s monetary policy committee is expected to cut rates by a quarter point to 4.5% – the lowest level since June 2023 – on Thursday.Democratic Republic of the Congo| Hundreds of womenwere raped and burned aliveafter a Rwandan-backed rebel group entered the Congolese city of Goma last week. The female inmates were attacked in their wing inside Goma’s Munzenze prison during a mass jailbreak, according to a senior UN official.Energy| Keir Starmerwill unveil plans for a historic expansion in nuclear poweracross England and Wales, pledging to use Labour’s large majority to make new sites across the country available for new power stations. The prime minister said that he anticipated small modular reactors could be built by 2032 and could become commonplace across Britain.UK news| The families of Valdo Calocane’s victims have called for doctors responsible for his treatmentto be named and held accountable. The intervention followed the publication of a report detailing Calocane’s mental health treatment before the attacks in Nottingham in 2023.Media| A high court judgehas criticised lawyers representing Noel Clarkefor “unacceptable” allegations against Guardian journalists which “should not have been made and publicly aired without foundation”. Mrs Justice Steyn dismissed claims there had been any fabrication of evidence by them and said any deletion of documents was “not in breach of any rule or duty” to preserve them.In depth: ‘To erase Gaza is a way to continue the work of destruction by construction’View image in fullscreenDisplaced Palestinians make their way back to their homes in northern Gaza.Photograph: Ramadan Abed/ReutersAfter Donald Trump had finished talking about his concept for Gaza at the White House on Tuesday,Benjamin Netanyahulooked delighted. Trump was willing to “think outside the box with fresh ideas”, he said. “You see things others refuse to see. You say things others refuse to say.”But while American control ofGazawould be unprecedented, Trump’s proposals are, in other ways, extremely conventional – above all in the attempt to use construction to reshape political reality. “There are many examples of this thinking both in Gaza and beyond it,” Eyal Weizman said. “Trump is not only thinking well within the box on Israel’s policy in relation to refugees in Gaza – but also within the box of settler colonial practices.”His intervention should also be understood in the context of the growing consensus that a genocide is underway in Gaza, Weizman said. “There’s a clause inthe genocide conventionthat is particularly architectural: ‘Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction’. Violence is applied to the environment because the environment is what maintains life - and so the killing is indirect. To simply erase Gaza and turn it into a riviera is a way to continue the work of destruction by construction, instead.”The historical precedentsOne of the weirdest features of Trump’s second term has been his embrace of a series of eccentric causes that have a distinctly colonial and expansionist flavour. From his threat to cut funding to South Africa over Elon Musk’s claims that white farmers there are the victims of “openly racist ownership laws” to Canada, Greenland and the Panama canal, “these are the type of politics you’d expect of the British empire in the 19th century,” Weizman said.You can see similar precedents to the Gaza plan. In Kenya during the 1920s, the British colonial administration demolished “African villages” in and around Nairobi as part of an effort to segregate the city on racial lines,and only allowed locals to live thereas registered labourers in low-quality public housing. In Algiers in the 1840s, the French army was only able to subjugate guerrilla resistanceby razing entire neighbourhoods, organising the city around new roads and markets instead.“There is a long historical relationship between counterinsurgency and architecture,” Weizman said. “It rests on the idea that architecture can ‘solve’ a political problem and change one’s identity.”In Gaza, the very fact that so much of the territory is given over to refugee camps is often considered to be the source of the problem. “The refugee camp is viewed not only as the location of the insurgency, but the condition that breeds it,” Weizman said. “A camp is conceived as temporary – it is not a city. It holds within it the idea that someone there is a refugee, who has a right of return. And so the thinking is to turn someone who is a refugee into an urban dweller.”Versions of that idea in Gaza can be dated back to the 1950s anda plan to resettle tens of thousands of Palestiniansto the Sinai desert. “There were grandiose designs of a water canal from the Nile to northern Sinai with a string of villages and towns along it where Palestinians would live,” Weizman said. “But the Palestinians understood that if they left Palestine to go there they could forget about right of return.” The resulting uprising put an end to the project.The vision of the futureHong Kong.Singapore.Monaco.Dubai. EvenNEOM, the $1.5tn city that Saudi Arabia is attempting to build from scratch on the Red Sea. At some point or other, all of these places have been floated as models for what Gaza should look like.Trump’s idea that Gaza should be reconfigured as the “riviera of the Middle East” goes a step further. It even exceeds the proposal from his son-in-law Jared Kushner – who said last year that Israel should “clean up” the strip because “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable”, but stopped short of saying that residents should be permanently resettled elsewhere. But Trump’s theory also makes literal something that is implicit in all of these proposals: that Gaza should be deracinated, and modelled on one of those strange 21st-century places that seem untethered from their physical location.This kind of thinking is part of the “colonial imaginary”, Weizman said – the fantasies and narratives that occupying forces project onto others to justify their control. “They are all enclaves,” he said. “These are places which are jurisdictional or legal islands, places where you can believe you can ignite an economy through suspension of regulations. And, of course, Gaza’s weather and environment is not unlike Florida’s, and Trump’s imagination is also that of a real estate person.” His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, is also a real estate developer.Dubai and the French Riviera have something else in common, too: they are better known for whogoesthere than who’sfromthere. As Trump said at a press conference: there will be jobs “not for a specific group of people, but for everybody”.In his description of Gaza as “the site” and promise to “get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out”, he also conjured a vision of a blank canvas – a “demolition site” without specific history or significance.“We tend to think about Gaza as a concentration area for refugees or as an open-air prison,” Weizman said. “But as my friendthe Palestinian filmmaker Basma al-Sarifnever tires of reminding me, it is also a place. It is a city along one of the most ancient coastal routes in human culture. The Romans called it the Via Maris, connecting the kingdom of the Euphrates with the kingdom of the Nile. If you dig a few metres under the ground, you find the evidence of thousands of years of continuous habitation.”The practical realityTrump gave no specifics of how his idea might become a reality, but if he was trying to do so, he would have to solve a litany of apparently intractable problems: universal regional condemnation outside of Israel; the likelihood that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza would resist; the domestic political difficulty of putting American boots on the ground; and a financial burden that Andrew Miller of the Center for American Progress said would “make the $40bn foreign assistance budget that Trump and Elon Musk call a waste look like a rounding error”.Even if all of those geopolitical problems were somehow resolved, there is the question of the project itself. Even finding the architects would be a vexed process, Weizman said. “The moral nadir of architecture is when design is no longer seen as something to serve people who live in a place on their own terms,” he said. “There is an instinct to go after a project, no matter its origin. I really hope my colleagues would not jump on this.”None of this is to say that there is a neatly packaged alternative vision for Gaza. “Any plan for the future has to come from Palestinians themselves,” Weizman said. But quite apart from the monumental scale of the task, “there is a dilemma in the fact that two-thirds or more of the people in Gaza are refugees: they’re there because this is where they or their ancestors were expelled to, not where they want to stay. So there is always a need to negotiate between the political right and the humanitarian need.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The secular Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, was projected to win just one seat in the capital region, once a stronghold for it. Some individual polls, though, suggested a much tighter contest and the AAP insisted the exit polls were wrong.India is witnessing the slow-motion rise of fascism | Mukul KesavanRead more“Exit polls have never been right about the AAP. Every time, the AAP has stormed to power with a massive mandate, and this time will be no different,” AAP spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar said. In 2020, the AAP won 62 of the 70 assembly seats with the BJP capturing the remaining eight.A defeat for the AAP would mark a massive setback for the anti-establishment party and its leader,Arvind Kejriwal, an activist whose anti-corruption drive helped sweep him to power in 2015 in Delhi and who has been seeking to extend the party’s presence nationally.Kejriwal founded the party in 2012, presenting it as a crusade for theaam aadmi, or common man, and promising to improve basic services from health and electricity to water and education.Kejriwal, whose party’s symbol is a broom, has been a vociferous critic of Modi, who has been equally scathing in return. The prime minister campaigned hard against the AAP ahead of the Delhi election, speaking at many rallies.The BJP’s forecast win would be another fillip for the party after a relatively underwhelming performance in the May 2024 general elections, where itfell short of winning an outright majorityin parliament. It formed a government with coalition partners.Now, after scoring victories in the states of Maharashtra and Haryana since the national elections, the BJP’s fortunes could be decisively on the upswing. The official results are due on Saturday.During the campaign, all three parties aggressively wooed voters with promises of freebies – from free water and electricity to cash incentives.The AAP’s governance model is based on popular public welfare schemes that won wide support. The AAP also promoted itself as a “squeaky clean” political alternative to the BJP and Congress.But its second term was thrown into turmoil by corruption allegations that saw Kejriwal, who was chief minister, and his two closest ministersjailed for long stretches.The arrests stemmed from a so-called liquor scam in which the AAP was accused of accepting kickbacks in a now-scrapped excise policy. India’s central government investigation agencies alleged liquor businesses funnelled bribes to AAP leaders.AAP denied the charges and said the BJP was waging a political vendetta. But the allegations, along with the construction of a lavish chief minister’s residence that the BJP dubbed the Sheeshmahal – Palace of Mirrors – dented the party’s standing with voters.Explore more on these topicsIndiaNarendra ModiSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Katrin Ivanova (centre), Dzhambazov’s partner, is also accused.Composite: BBC newsFellow Bulgarians Gaberova, her ex-boyfriend Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, of Acton, west London, and Ivanova, from Harrow, have denied involvement.The court has heard how Gaberova was charmed by Dzhambazov in Valencia and left her boyfriend Ivanchev, unaware the older Dzhambazov was still with his partner, Ivanova.Jurors viewed extracts of the former competitive swimmer Ivanchev’s police interviews, in which Morgan suggested he had attempted to throw Gaberova “under a bus” to save himself.He blamed Gaberova for getting him involved, accused her of “manipulating” him and claimed she was used as a “shield” by Dzhambazov, jurors heard.Morgan said Ivanchev’s account was “nonsense”, asking: “Do you know the expression ‘throwing someone under the bus’?“He is trying to put you in it to save himself, isn’t he? Give the police officers a bit of information here and there to make it seem like he is the reasonable one answering all the questions, meanwhile pretending that somehow or other he was manipulated into doing all this by you. And it’s not true, is it?”Gaberova replied: “Some of this was because Biser has told me that he is sick.”The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

This is classed as “low-carbon” because the harvested trees are replaced by others that take up carbon from the atmosphere as they grow.Butmany studies have shown that wood burning harms the environment, by destroying forests, and because of the decades-long time lag between the immediate release of carbon dioxide CO2from burning and the growth to maturity of replacement trees.Drax currentlyreceives billions of pounds in subsidies from energy bill payers, at the rate of about £2m a day according to Greenpeace, but these are scheduled torun out in 2027. A government decision on whether to continue the support payments beyond the cut-off could come as soon as Monday.Campaigners fear that ministers could allow Drax unrestricted subsidies for continuing to burn biomass, which one said would be “incredibly bad news”. A further option would be to impose strict time limits on the subsidies, or require Drax to use carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which could reduce the harm to the climate but still allow widespread destruction of trees.Awarding new subsidies to Drax would be highly controversial amongLabourMPs. The Guardian has seen letters from parliamentarians sent to the Financial Conduct Authority and the Financial Reporting Council, querying Drax’s claims to environmental sustainability.Several peers and at least one MP have asked the financial regulators to open an investigation into Drax, based partly on findings from the energy regulator, Ofgem, that the company had misreported data on the origins and sustainability of imported wood pellets.Research last month from the green thinktank E3G found the government could meet its target of decarbonising the UK’s electricity sector by 2030 without Drax.Matt Williams, senior advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the Drax decision a crucial test of the government’s green plans. “If [ministers] award business-as-usual subsidies, that would be incredibly bad news for forests, and anyone who cares about them. Billions more for the UK’s single largest polluter would make it clear the government was placing all its bets on high-carbon infrastructure,” he said.“But if they put limits on the time or the quantity of subsidies, that would indicate the government was thinking twice about this, and could signal the beginning of the end [for biomass subsidies].”The row over Drax is the latest in a series of controversies that campaigners warned risked giving the impression thatLabour was sacrificing its green credentials in the pursuit of economic growth. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has given the green light to anew runway at Heathrow, and some allies are thought to want her to give the go-ahead to themassive new Rosebank oilfield in the North Sea.A Whitehall source said the Treasury was not involved in decisions over Drax.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Continuing to subsidise huge biomass imports would not be a step towards a cleaner future, but a dirty compromise with past failures.”He added: “This government stood on a manifesto to deliver clean power by 2030, and to tackle the climate emergency. Whether it’s Heathrow’s third runway or potential permitting of new oil and gas developments, the government’s commitment to stopping climate change is starting to look a little frayed around the edges. More biomass at Drax would be yet another decision that is likely to make the climate and nature crises worse, not better.”The Committee on Climate Change, the government’s statutory adviser on the climate, islikely to address the issue of burning biomass for power in its advice on the seventh carbon budget, which will be published on 26 February. Previous advice has strongly warned ministers to abandon biomass burning for power, unless equipped with CCS.The government refused to comment. A spokesperson for Drax refused to comment on future subsidies. He said the company had previously announced it could be using CCS from the early 2030s.Explore more on these topicsDraxEnergy industryEnergyClimate crisisGreenhouse gas emissionsFossil fuelsBiofuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

It now expects the economy to grow by just 0.75% this year, compared with a previous forecast of 1.5% made in November, in a fresh blow for Reeves as she battles to revive confidence.A week after the chancellor gavea major speech to restate the government’s commitment to growth, the Bank said it was cutting its forecasts to reflect fragile business and consumer sentiment and near stagnant activity after the October budget.Business leaders have blamed the sharp fall in confidence on Reeves’s decision to increase employer national insurance contributions by £25bn from April, while concerns are also rising over the global outlook as Donald Trump launches a tariff war on the US’s allies and enemies alike.Some analysts suggested the Bank’s forecasts showed the UK sliding towards “stagflation” – a toxic combination of weak growth and high inflation which is hard for policymakers to manage.Jonathan Haskel, a former Bank rate-setter, said stagflation was the right word to describe the “difficult position” Britain faced, telling the BBC: “I’m afraid it’s not very pretty, OK.”Susannah Streeter, the head of money and markets at Hargreaves Landsdown, said: “The risks of stagflation are stark.Inflationremains above the Bank’s 2% target and price pressures are piling up, but the economy is stagnating, and business confidence has taken a knock.”Keir Starmer said the reduction in borrowing costs, which should help to bring down mortgage rates, would put more money in people’s pockets. But pressed on the growth outlook, the prime minister said: “Look we’ve got more to do, we were never going to turn this around in six or seven months, so that just spurs us on.”The Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority of seven to two for an immediate cut in borrowing costs from 4.75% to 4.5%. The decision led City traders to bet that Britain’s sluggish economic prospects would force the Bank into a deeper round of rate cuts later this year.Two of the MPC’s nine members backed a more drastic half-point cut in the face of the deteriorating growth outlook.Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, said the weakness in the economy meant the central bank would take a “gradual and careful approach to reducing rates further”, as it prepared to prioritise protecting the economy despite the short-term rise in inflationary pressures.“There will be a bump in the road [from inflation] but we don’t think that bump is going to have a lasting effect,” he said.Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said further rate cuts were required to support households and businesses. “This rate cut is badly needed to help lift the economy out of stagnation. The Bank must now keep moving with further cuts,” he said.The Bank expects inflation to rise from 2.5% now to 3.7% by the summer, well above its 2% target, as household energy prices rise, as well as water bills and bus fares.The Bank’s gloomy assessment is likely to be echoed by a similar downgrade from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) when it publishes updated forecasts on 26 March.Last month Reeves came under scrutiny amid a rise in government borrowing costs, fuelled by higher-for-longer rate expectations in Britain and the US. This led to warnings that she could be forced to increase taxes or cut spending to avoid breakingher fiscal rules.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “No investment equals no growth. So what are we waiting for? There are plenty of projects crying out for public investment that will drive growth and create good jobs.”Reeves’s plan for economic growth is focused on clearing the way for private sector investment in infrastructure, includinga third runway at Heathrow.The Bank welcomed the chancellor’s policies, but said it had not upgraded its forecasts accordingly, as such changes take years to bear fruit. “Addressing those questions is critical, so we very strongly agree with the chancellor on this point,” Bailey said.He also suggested Labour’s commitment to changes and “showing real signs they are going to happen” could help to reboot animal spirits among business, in a benefit for the economy in the shorter term.The Bank said it was monitoring Donald Trump’s on-off tariff policies closely, though it had not included their impact in the current forecast.Bailey warned that Britain would not be immune to a global trade war. “Greater global protectionism would be likely to have a negative impact on world economic activity in the medium term, and lead to increased trade fragmentation,” he said.The shadow chancellor, Mel Stride, said of the reduction in interest rates: “This will be welcome news for many families and businesses who have been hit hard by Labour’s mismanagement.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)Rachel ReevesBank of EnglandEconomic policyInterest ratesInflationAndrew BaileynewsShareReuse this content"

Train details will be deleted from departure boards three minutes before they leave.Network Rail said the scheme was designed to stop passengers dashing for trains. A poster for the scheme said: “This is so everyone can board safely and keep trains running on time.”But passengers have reacted with fury, saying they should be given the information to decide for themselves.Many also fear the system will cause more rushing than it prevents. They pointed out that trains’ platform departures are often only revealed minutes before they are due to depart, so the new system could only give them seconds to react to platform announcements.Aphotograph of the posterfor the new system was shared online by an X user called Jonathan. He wrote: “This is so patronising, good grief. ‘We would prefer you missed your train than that you rushed to catch it’.” He added: “Who do you think is best placed to decide whether it’s worth the risk and exertion to catch my train? You??!?”Alexandra Wilson, an academic and writer asked: “But how soon before departure do they actually announce the platform? It’s often incredibly late, prompting a stampede.”Tony West, who commutes between London and Didcot,posted: “Doesn’t this just mean everybody will run because they won’t know exactly when the train will leave[?]”Jeremy Leggett, a rural policy adviser from Brighton, tweeted: “Not sensible to remove information from displays three minutes ahead of departures, especially when connecting trains are the norm, eg Brighton east- west. Bad policy as well as patronising. @SouthernRailUK.”MJ Simpson pointed to aflaw in the plans. He wrote: “So if you’re booked on the 5.25 and you get to the station at 5.23, there will be no sign of the 5.25 on the departure board, even though it hasn’t left yet. Have I got that right?”Speaking to the Times, which first reported the scheme, Simon Watson, a York commuter, said: “The trains are every 30 minutes and when I am heading home, which one I’m on can make the difference between being home for the children’s bedtime or not. Whether I run for the train is my decision.”He said it would force passengers to use their phones for information about departures. “Surely it’s better to rush looking at the departure boards than your phone,” he said.Last year chaotic scenes and persistent overcrowding at nearby Euston station prompted Network Rail toallow passengers to board some services early. It now allows passengers to board about 40% of Avanti West Coast services from the station 20 minutes before departure. The move came after London TravelWatch said passengers were being put in danger by high levels of overcrowding.Despite the improvements, passengers saidEuston is still a “nightmare”.Explore more on these topicsRail industryRail transportTransport policyTransportLondonNetwork RailRail travelnewsShareReuse this content"

The class B investors have brought forward analternative funding deal that they say will be cheaper.The court and well over 100 lawyers, investors and other advisers have heard four days of complex arguments concerning the terms of the competing deals. The judge on Thursday extended the hearing by another day to hear further arguments.However, Maynard argued that special administration would be a better course because it would cut out hundreds of millions of pounds of fees and interest costs.Less than £500m of the £1.5bn debt would be “real liquidity actually available” to Thames Water to support its operations or maintain drains and sewers, according to estimates by Maynard’s legal team.The estimates were prepared from a combination of fees disclosed in documents in court and cross-examination of Thames Water executives.The estimate of costs includes at least £443m that would “move in a circle” straight back to the creditors in various fees. A sum totalling £245m would be used to pay interest costs for many of the same investors, while £210m would go on professional fees, the court heard.The court also heard that Thames Water had breached its duty of candour to the court by failing to properly detail the true costs of the debt package.Maynard said in an interview he was “shocked” by the alleged lack of consideration of the interests of households during the whole hearing. He said the fees and interest costs would ultimately be paid by households and business customers of Thames Water through their bills.“Why are we spending so much money to keep digging an even deeper hole?” Maynard said. “How is this in the interests of customers? It looks like it’s in the interests of one set of creditors versus another.”He said he believed that the Labour government was not stepping in because it did not want to be forced to add Thames Water’s debts to public finance figures.Thames Water argued in its closing submission that a special administration would be “value-destructive”, and added that there were “strong reasons to believe” that the company would be able to secure future equity financing. It asked the court to grant permission for the deal to go ahead.The class B creditors in their closing submissions argued that the class A creditors were seeking to gain control of the company for their own interests through a clause that would allow them to veto any future funding deal.A Thames spokesperson said: “Our plan remains the only implementable solution to putting the business on a firmer financial footing.“Its approval will not affect customer bills, but will unlock billions of pounds for investment in our network, fixing pipes, upgrading our sewage treatment works and maintaining high-quality drinking water.“Any suggestion that customers will bear costs from this process is an untrue and misleading claim that risks needlessly worrying our customers. This plan will not lead to any increases in customer bills. Ofwat has already determined the cost of bills for the next five years.”Explore more on these topicsThames WaterWater industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Landlords cannot be allowed to rent out dangerous homes and shamelessly put the lives of their tenants at risk.“Our new laws will force them to fix problems quickly, so that people are safe in their homes and can be proud to live in social housing.”However, Shelter said the grace period for landlords was far too long.Polly Neate, the charity’s chief executive, said: “Awaab Ishak’s legacy must be that no other family has to witness poor housing conditions putting their child’s life at risk. The government promised to bring in Awaab’s law, forcing landlords to deal with serious hazards in social homes within clear timeframes, last autumn.“However, four years after Awaab’s death … today’s announcement means social housing tenants will have to wait years longer for this vital protection. These delays to implementation represent a real risk to the health and safety of tenants, and puts lives at risk.”Labour promised in opposition to enact Awaab’s law after it was originally proposed by the Conservatives but never passed.Raynersaid last year: “We’ll clamp down on mouldy homes by bringing in Awaab’s law into the social rented sector … to end the scandal of people living in unacceptable conditions.”On Thursday the government clarified the timetable for its implementation of the act. From October, social landlords in England will have 24 hours to make emergency repairs, including to damp and mould.Next year, they will have to make immediate repairs to a broader range of hazards, expected to include excess cold and heat, structural collapse, fire, electrical problems and hygiene hazards.Landlords will have until 2027 before having to begin fixing other hazards immediately, including asbestos, exposure to lead or radiation and contaminated water supplies.Officials said the timescale would “allow the government to test and learn so that the reforms benefit social tenants and secure the lasting legacy that Awaab Ishak’s family have fought so hard for”.Ministers have also promised to extend Awaab’s law to the private sector, but have not given a timeline for doing so.They are also consulting on new energy efficiency standards for the private sector and legislating to require social landlords to carry out electrical safety checks at least every five years.Explore more on these topicsSocial housingHousingAngela RaynerEnglandHealthCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

In all, according to Adobe, consumers spent $241.1bn in those two months.“The holiday shopping season was the most successful yet for Amazon and we appreciate the support of our customers, selling partners, and employees who helped make it so,” Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, said in astatement.Despite the better-than-expected results, Amazon fell below analyst estimates when it came to next quarter’s sales. The company said it expects sales to be between $151bn and $155.5bn, while analysts estimated $158.5bn. Shares fell in after-hours trading and then bounced back to the same price as the previous market close.Wall Street has appeared to appreciate the cost-cutting measures at Amazon over the past couple of years. Jassy has been working to tighten the belt by instituting layoffs and cuts across several departments. While 2024 had less layoffs than years past, the downsizing still appears to have had positive financial gains for Amazon’s bottom line.During Thursday’s earnings, Jassy applauded various new innovations centered on artificial intelligence at the company, including a new AI chip called the Trainium2. “These benefits are often realized by customers (and the business) several months down the road, but these are substantial enablers in this emerging technology environment,” Jassy said.Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s executive chairman, has also become friendlier with Donald Trump after years of acrimony.

The funding – which has been set aside from a $9bn bond that voters approved in November – includes $725m to reconstruct the almost entirely destroyed Palisades and Marquez elementary schools, and Palisades Charter high school, which was about 30% destroyed.Students from the two elementary schools have been relocated to other schools, while charter school students are attending classes online. Carvalho predicts that those students will be able to return to newly constructed campuses in 2028 but may be able to attend classes in portable classrooms at the same locations in the meantime if environmental testing and debris removal go smoothly.The district is also directing funding to prepare its other campuses for the threat of future natural disasters.“We need to accelerate these projects to ensure that our facilities are resilient to what no doubt will be atmospheric conditions, fires that will threaten our school system and our community,” said Carvalho, who noted the district is directing $200m into seismic retrofitting and asking for air purifiers and outdoor sensors for air quality particulate matter.Kiwifruit and cheese sandwiches: LA school staff pack free lunches for over 2,000 students affected by firesRead moreMeanwhile, Pasadena unified school district superintendent Elizabeth Blancotold CBS Los Angeleson Monday that the district is still in the “recovery” phase, and focused on relocating students whose campuses were destroyed by the Eaton fire to other schools or online classrooms.“We were not required to do environmental testing, but out of an abundance of caution, we did environmentally test each of the schools. The cleaning and sanitizing process was quite extensive,” she said. “We had 1,500 workers on the ground supporting our maintenance and operations team, cleaning the schools, sanitizing them and testing them to make sure that children were all coming back to safe environments.”Still, five campuses in the district were destroyed: Eliot Arts magnet middle school, Franklin elementary and the Edison, Loma Alta and Noyes charter elementary schools. The district hasresolvedto rebuild Eliot, but it is not yet clear what the budget or timeline for that or other repairs will be.In the meantime, Blanco said, Eliot students have been relocated to another middle school, where they are still functioning as a separate school in an attempt to retain the school’s identity.Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresSchoolsLos AngelesCaliforniaUS educationWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The order gives federal agencies latitude to withhold federal funding from entities that do not abide by Title IX in alignment with the Trump administration’s view, which interprets “sex” as the gender someone was assigned at birth.The NCAA policy change is effective immediately and applies to all athletes regardless of previous eligibility reviews under the NCAA’s prior transgender participation policy. The organization has more than 1,200 schools with more than 500,000 athletes, easily the largest governing body for college athletics in the US.“We strongly believe that clear, consistent and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today’s student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions,” the NCAA’s president, Charlie Baker, said. “To that end, President Trump’s order provides a clear, national standard.”The NCAA’s revised policy permits athletes assigned male at birth to practice with women’s teams and receive benefits such as medical care while practicing.Baker added that the NCAA is still committed to “protect, support and enhance the mental and physical health of student-athletes”, referring to a recent update to themental health guidelines.“This national standard brings much-needed clarity as we modernize college sports for today’s student-athletes,” Baker said.After the executive order, the Trump administration said on Thursday it was investigating potential “civil rights violations” at two universities and a high school sports league thatallowed trans athletesto compete on women’s teams. The education department opened reviews of San Jose State University, the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association and the University of Pennsylvania.Explore more on these topicsNCAATrump administrationUS sportsTransgenderDonald TrumpSports gamesnewsShareReuse this content"

Reports from Massachusetts to Idaho have described agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) spreading through communities and rounding people up. QuickGooglesearches for Ice operations, raids and arrests return a deluge of government press releases. Headlines include “ICE arrests 85 during 4-day Colorado operation”, “New Orleans focuses targeted operations on 123 criminal noncitizens” and, in Wisconsin, “ICE arrests 83 criminal aliens”.But a closer look at these Ice reports tells a different story.Thatfour-day operationin Colorado? It happened in November 2010. The123 people targetedin New Orleans? That was February of last year.Wisconsin? September 2018. There are thousands of examples of this throughout all 50 states – Ice press releases that have reached the first page of Google search results, making it seem like enforcement actions just happened, when in actuality they occurred months or years ago. Some, such as thearrest of “44 absconders”in Nebraska, go back as far as 2008.All the archived Ice press releases soaring to the top of Google search results were marked with the same timestamp and read: “Updated: 01/24/2025”.The mystery first caught the attention of an immigration lawyer who began tracking Ice raids and enforcement actions whenDonald Trumptook office. She spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the administration. At first, she was baffled when she clicked on these seemingly new press releases and they detailed Ice raids from more than a decade ago.So she set to work doing some digital sleuthing and enlisted a friend who is a tech expert to help. What they found leads them to believe that Ice is gaming Google search.‘Panic benefits Ice’: local newsrooms fight back as immigrants face misinformationRead moreIce did not return a request for comment. A Google spokesperson said: “When people do these searches on Google, they’ll find a range of sources and information, including recent news articles.” She said Google aimed to “reflect the last time a page was updated” and that its “systems are not designed to boost a page’s ranking simply because they update their timestamp”.Since the Guardian reached out to Ice and Google for comment, some of the press releases have reverted back to their original dates on Google search. Therefore, those releases are no longer appearing at the top of Google search results.Cracking down on immigration is top of the agenda for Trump. During his inaugural address, he promised mass deportations “to repel the disastrous invasion of our country”. Since then, his administration has touted that hundreds of arrests andraids have occurredin places like Los Angeles and Chicago. TV crews havefollowed Ice agents on raidsand the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, has posted videos of herself on X wearing an Ice bulletproof vest in New York City. Shecaptioned one: “Getting the dirt bags off the streets.”It is Ice’s made-for-TV moment. Inundating all forms of media, including Google search, with stories of mass arrests fits into a strategy of fearmongering, said Lindsay M Harris, a law professor at the University of San Francisco who specializes in immigration and asylum law.“All of that is intended to send a message to immigrants to be afraid and that they’re coming for you,” said Harris. “Regardless of the actual numbers, the optics of these mass arrests throughout the country have very real ramifications.”A pattern emergesAs reports of arrests poured in last month, the immigration lawyer watched in shock. Social media and listservsfilled with rumors of raidsand local news programs showed Ice apprehensions in towns as small as Cartersville, Georgia, population 25,000. “There was a lot of noise online,” she said. “And it was creating terror in the community.” She said it was hard to separate fact from fiction, so she decided to create a nationwide map that aggregated all actual Ice arrests.At the end of her workdays, she would sit down and start Googling – typing in searches like “ice arrests Nebraska” and “recent ice arrests Arizona”. Then she would plug in other states.View image in fullscreenKristi Noem wears an Ice vest as she speaks to law enforcement agents in New York last month.Photograph: @Sec_Noem/ReutersThe lawyer noticed a strange pattern. In almost every state, at least one press release from Ice’s website appeared in Google’s top results. Nebraska, for example, surfaced links for two press releases. One said “ICE executes federal search warrants in Nebraska”, the other said “ICE fugitive operations team arrests 44 absconders”. Both displayed their dates of publication as 24 January 2025 on Google search. But when the lawyer clicked through to the report, the actual dates of publication were August 2018 and June 2008, respectively.“I’ve now done it in all 50 states … and I’ve done it in multiple cities. And it’s the same thing,” the lawyer said. “They all had the last update of 1/24/2025 and they were all popping up at the front of the algorithm.”Maria Andrade, a longtime immigration lawyer in Idaho, says Ice arrests have been scant in the state so far. “We had one that didn’t result in detention,” she said. “I haven’t heard of mass arrests in any area at all.”Yet the first result for a Google search of “ice arrests Idaho” is a press release from Ice saying 22 people were arrested in an “enforcement surge”. The date of publication displayed in the search results is 24 January 2025, but the operation actually happened in July 2010. Andrade said that arresting 22 people would have been a large number for Idaho and that such incidents are extremely rare, given the minimal number of Ice agents, rural terrain and extreme weather. If so many people were arrested in one sweep in Idaho last month, she said, she would know about it.“If the objective is to scare people who look up raids in Idaho, that would be a good way to accomplish it,” Andrade said. “That would be a good way to mislead people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionConfusion and fear over Ice’s operations have real-world consequences for both immigrants and other law enforcement agencies. Panic in Idaho has hit such a fever pitch that at least one local sheriffhas made a public statementtrying to quell fears. “Rumors have circulated about ICE conducting ‘raids’ in the area,” Morgan Ballis, the sheriff for Blaine County,announced last week. “These claims were completely unsubstantiated, with no evidence to support them.”Solving the mysteryThere are several ways to game Google search to boost a website to the top of the results page, the most valuable real estate on the internet. In fact, a whole field is built around it called search engine optimization, or SEO. Google’s algorithm works by looking at various factors on a webpage to determine if it is relevant and authoritative. Government web domains already get authoritative bonus points. Other tricks to nudge the algorithm include linking back to one’s own website and updating the timestamp on a web page to a more recent date, as it appears Ice has.After dealing with all of the outdated Ice press releases, the immigration lawyer called up her tech expert friend to help get to the bottom of what was going on.The tech expert, who likewise spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said she was initially skeptical that anything unusual was happening. But she sorted through what the lawyer found, then she did her own Google searches targeted specifically for January 2025 and Ice’s website. She also tried Bing, Microsoft’s search engine. Those searches returned nearly 13,000 archived Ice press releases timestamped to 24 January 2025.“I was like, ‘OK, this is pretty weird,’” she said.Bing did not return a request for comment.She then started a forensic examination of Ice’s webpages by inspecting the front-end code to look for clues.What was interesting, she said, was that Ice had marked all of these press releases as old. The agency displayed a message at the top of every page the Guardian reviewed noting it contained “archived content” that was “from a previous administration or is otherwise outdated”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: US Immigration and Customs EnforcementBut when the tech expert looked at the code of these online press releases, she saw a new element had been added – a time stamp. “Every article was updated on the 24th, which was causing the Google SEO to interpret that as a recently updated article, and therefore rank it higher,” she said.To exhaust all possibilities, the tech expert did the same test with several other government agencies. She crosschecked with the websites of the Department of Labor, Department of Defense, Department of the Interior and Department of Veterans Affairs and found no evidence of new time stamps.“[With Ice,] these are old articles that are now appearing at the top of the Google and Bing search results as recent headlines, where no other government agency is doing this,” she said. “As someone in tech, I would interpret that as an intentional play to get more clicks, essentially on these misleading headlines.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationGoogleAlphabetTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the talks have stuttered amid tensions over the perceived imbalance between the parties.Nissan is looking for a new partner, as the talks withHondahave stalled, according to a person with knowledge of the company’s strategy.Nissan’s search for partners could broaden beyond the automotive sector to technology companies. One possible option is understood to be Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, which produces iPhones in China for Apple.Openness to a Foxconn tie-up among some board members was first reported by the Financial Times and came after the Taiwanese company sparked merger talks between Honda and Nissan with an approach to buy Renault’s stake in Nissan. However, Bloomberg reported that a US tech partner would be preferred.Nissan’s share price rose by 7.3% on Thursday. Honda’s share price fell by 4%.The Honda-Nissan merger aimed to create a larger companycapable of investing more in the transition to EV technologyas traditional manufacturers in Europe and Japan raced to respond to therising influence of China’s newer electric carmakers. However, the merger would have had to overcome several difficulties, not least the divergence of fortunes between Japan’s second- and third-largest carmakers.Honda and Nissan both have large production operations, having produced 3.7m and 3.1m cars apiece in 2024. However, Honda is five times larger by market value. Nissan has struggled with years of turmoil and slumping profits. It has been forced to offer big discounts on its ageing product lineup to attract buyers, particularly in its key North American market.“Nissan’s need for a strong partner remains, but its negotiating position is impaired by its weak profit outlook and stock price,” said Todd Duvick, the head of autos research at the rating agency CreditSights.He added that it would be understandable for Honda to seek an acquisition, which would “likely lead to a lot more Nissan job losses than a merger, especially at the executive level”.A takeover rather than a merger would also limit the scope for existing Nissan shareholders to gain from any recovery in the company’s performance. Renault’s shareholding will complicate matters further. It is a legacy of the alliance between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi that wasmasterminded by Carlos Ghosn, the former chief executivewho is now living in Lebanon after fleeing arrest in Japan. Nissan endured years of chaos and infighting and chaos after his arrest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The work of all three individuals has been critical of the rightwing government of Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni.A person familiar with the matter saidItalyhad breached the terms of Paragon’s contract with the government, which does not allow for journalists or members of civil society to be targeted with the spyware.Like Pegasus, the hacking software made by the rival NSO Group, Paragon’s hacking spyware, called Graphite, can infect a mobile phone without a user’s knowledge. It then gives the operator of the spyware full control and access to messages and encrypted chats sent over apps such asWhatsAppand Signal.The news has sent shockwaves across the Italian parliament, with one MP saying that, if confirmed, the story represented an “unacceptable violation of fundamental rights and an attack on democracy itself”.Paragon’s decision to terminate the contract, which was first reported by the Guardian, comesless than a week after WhatsApp announced that Paragon’s spyware had been used to target dozens of people. Like other spyware vendors, Paragon sells its cyberweapon to government clients who are supposed to use it to prevent crime. It remains unclear who all the specific government clients were behind the alleged attacks.Responding to the allegations of involvement late on Wednesday, Meloni’s office denied that domestic intelligence services or the government were behind the alleged breaches against the journalist and activists.The person familiar with the matter, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said Paragon had “out of an abundance of caution” initially suspended the Italy contract when the first allegation of potential abuse of the spyware emerged last Friday. The decision to fully terminate the contract, the person said, was made on Wednesday after Paragon determined that Italy had broken the terms of service and ethical framework it had agreed under its Paragon contract.The Guardian has contacted an Italian government spokesperson for comment.Italian opposition parties on Thursday called on Meloni to urgently address parliament amid scepticism over the government’s statement, which also revealed that it had been told by WhatsApp that the number of affected Italians “appeared to be seven”. It is unclear who the other alleged victims are.Giuseppe Conte, leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S), said: “Something doesn’t add up. The fact that journalists are being spied upon is in itself of unprecedented severity in a democratic system, and if even a company says it had to interrupt the contract for ethical reasons … this is very serious.”Barbara Floridia, an M5S senator and president of the supervisory committee for the state broadcaster, Rai, said the case “raises disturbing questions about the protection of privacy and freedom of the press in our country”.“If confirmed, this story would represent an unacceptable violation of fundamental rights and an attack on democracy itself,” she added.Sandro Ruotolo, an MEP with the Democratic party, said: “In the statement excluding its involvement in espionage, the Italian government did not answer the most important question, namely whether or not Italy purchased services from Paragon Solutions. If so, what type [of service] and for what?”Asked for comment, a Paragon representative declined to confirm or deny the development, and said it was the company’s policy to not discuss potential client matters.Francesco Cancellato, the editor-in-chief of Fanpage,a highly regarded investigative news outlet, was the first to publicly state last Friday that he was one of the 90 people who had been notified by WhatsApp that his mobile phone had been targeted, and most likely compromised, by the hacking software.WhatsApp said the 90 people who were likely to have been compromised had been added to WhatsApp group chats and been sent malicious PDFs, which then probably infected their phones. The users would not have had to click or download the pdf to be infected.WhatsApp said all of the hacking attempts had been discovered in December, in part through the help of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks digital threats against civil society. It is not clear for how long the individuals could have been surveilled or the government clients involved in each case.While it is not entirely clear why Cancellato may have been targeted, his publication last year published a high-profile investigation that exposed young fascists in Meloni’s party. The two other people who were targeted,Husam El Gomati, a Libyan activist living in Sweden, andLuca Casarini, the founder of NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans, have both been vocal critics of Italy’s alleged complicity in abuses suffered by migrants in Libya.While Paragon’s move is likely to assuage some concerns, there are still outstanding questions about dozens of other cases that WhatsApp discovered. Italy said earlier on Wednesday that it had been told by WhatsApp that those targets live in countries acrossEurope– and possibly other countries – including Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.Paragon was reportedly recently acquired by a US firm called AE Industrial Partners, which on its website is described as a private investment firm with $5.6bn of assets under management, focused on markets including national security. The company has not responded to requests for comment.Paragon agreed a $2m contract last year with Ice, the US immigration and customs enforcement agency. The contract, agreed under the Biden administration, was reportedly suspended while the administration sought to determine whether it complied with an executive order that restricted the use of spyware by the federal government. The current status of the contract is not known. Neither Ice nor Paragon has responded to the Guardian’s questions about the contract.Explore more on these topicsWhatsAppItalyEuropeHackingSurveillanceEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

He is no longer charged with deciding games with his arm but he will be in the booth to analyze the game for an anticipated US audience of 120 million as Fox’s lead analyst.For millions of those viewers, Sunday will be the first time they have heard from Brady since he played in a Super Bowl,was roasted on Netflixor was fodder for the tabloids. He will be tasked with navigating the longest broadcast of his career knowing that, with the Kansas City Chiefs chasing an unprecedented three-peat, his words will live in perpetuity. You can already foresee the social media outbursts and the heads slowly turning at your Super Bowl party:“Is that what Tom Brady sounds like? He is not very good at this, is he?”Brady is in the first year of a 10-season, $375m contract withFox, making him the highest-paid announcer in any sport. In his first season as a broadcaster, he earned more in the booth than all but eight of the NFL’s starting quarterbacks. But Brady’s move to the booth has been a dud. Even for a newbie on the mic, his lack of polish is startling.The Chiefs may be the Super Bowl villain but we’d be lost without oneRead moreBrady’s broadcastdebut back in Septemberwas an inoffensive mess. He was overprepared and overly eager, struggling to form coherent sentences and drenching the audience with banal cliches. Really, you were left wondering, these are the insights of the greatest to ever do it?“It was too much, too quickly, too soon, to process into clear, effortless, fluid language,” Brady wrote in his 199 newsletter. “The god’s honest truth is that, like with anything complicated, the key to comfort and competence is just more reps.”The problem is that Brady is not getting much better. There have been a scattering of improvements, but only in the way that switching from four slices of pizza a night to three improves your diet. There was a school of thought that Brady would peak towards the end of his first year. Surely, the thinking went, the league’s foremost competition-aholic will commit to being the best. But stock in Brady As A Broadcaster has taken a bigger beating than Hawk Tuah’s meme coin. He has shown few signs that he is willing or able to offer quick, detailed analysis or strong opinions, the bedrock of a solid in-game analysis. And something strange happened around the turn of the year: Brady’s performance bottomed out. As the stakes were rising, the once-great quarterback could not meet the moment.Brady has a style that is all his own. For starters, he does not have a strong voice. But even that could be offset by fluid thoughts or a knack for reading the moment. Brady has shown neither. He speaks in a monotonous, staccato rhythm. Everything is pitched at a mild yell, without any of the natural rise and fall that revs through a stadium. He has all the presence of a network sitcom; fine as background noise but lacking the punch needed for career-altering postseason moments. No matter the situation, Brady usually speaks with one tone and one pace. And then, out of nowhere, without any context, he bursts into life. You can sense the hand of the producers, sliding in a note off-camera.It’s time to up the ante, Tom.That leads to baffling moments, where after 20 droning minutes,Brady pipes up. “He looks left … he looks right … then … he throws … A DOT!”What is most startling, though, is what Brady doesnotsay. Fox is ponying up $37.5m a year for the greatest quarterback of all time. The expectation was that he could break down the game in a way none of his peers could match, or at least rise to the industry standard while being backed up by the clout of seven Super Bowl rings, three MVP trophies and his status as the sport’s certified GOAT. But Brady the broadcaster seldom brings his unique knowledge to the Fox set. At times, he seems surprised that he has been asked to talk.Brady’s most honest thoughts often come during the pauses he leaves between his words. Sloppy quarterback play grates him. But,because he is a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, and trying to maintain his polished, respectable sheen, you can hear him holding back. The best he could muster after a botched throw by Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts against Washington in the NFC championship game was a couple of deep exhales, before hitting his partner Kevin Burkhardt with: “You just have to have that play, KB.”Brady has been hit with the problem that often plagues great players turned coaches: what is intuitive to him is not intuitive to everyone else. But rather than trying to bridge that divide, he simply refreshes the viewer on what they have seen. During the Eagles-Commanders game, the most successful player in league history was relegated to the role of theguy at the bar barking at the TV. Here is a sampling of his work, from a game with a Super Bowl berth on the line:“There is a lot on the line this game for both clubs”“I always hated playing defenses that played well”“The last thing Commanders fans wanted there was a fumble”“This game is about the games within the game”“In the playoffs, things are tougher”“This team needs more juice”“What a stud”“Now here is a stud”“They just have more studs”“The Eagles are playing with more juice”“They don’t have enough juice”“In the playoffs, it’s about the Jimmies and Joes”“That’s playoff football”In one quarter, he uttered some variation of the word “juice” nine times. Given his penchant for brand deals, you would be forgiven for wondering if Brady had struck up a new partnership with Tropicana. Playing with more juice may be the shrewd judgment of a perennial champion who knows what it takes to lift a Lombardi, but having it serve as your go-to line makes for horrific TV. Once youcatch the tics– “Good job, KB!” – there is no way to ignore them.View image in fullscreenTom Brady won seven Super Bowls as a player.Photograph: Tom Pennington/Getty ImagesIn fairness, Brady’s status as Fox’s lead analyst was undermined from the jump. The network bumped the excellent Greg Olsen down to their No 2 crew to clear a path for Brady, breaking apart the Burkhardt-Olsen pairing that had quickly become the best in the business. It was telling that during the NFC title game, Olsen offered more insight into the game on social media than Brady did from the booth.Olsen was talking strategy; Brady peppered the audience with platitudes.But that has done little to dent Brady’s appeal to Fox. The network signed off on his record-breaking contract because of his value away from the games. People do not care about announcers. For the vast majority of viewers, it doesn’t matter if Romo, Shane Gillis or an AI Brady is on the call, they will still tune in. For the most part, broadcasters do not affect ratings – and Fox recognized that. Brady was brought in to be the face of the network’s sports coverage, helping Foxfend off the streaming vultureswho were looking to swipe away rights packages from the traditional networks. Adding Brady helped ensure Fox would be a go-to destination for the sport through at least 2033.“I think you start with credibility and with people that you think can bring something to the brand and the broadcast that nobody else can,” Fox executive Brad Zager told the Athletic about hiring Brady.Then and now: how do the Eagles and Chiefs compare to 2023’s Super Bowl?Read moreBrand before broadcast, as Zager says. That’s the deal the networks make: the game is not the point, but the ad breaks between the action. In that sense, Brady is providing Fox with what the C-suite wants, retaining their rights packages and helping to close outad campaigns on the golf course. But that has come at a cost to the audience. Part of Brady’s tepidness during games is because of a clear, awkward conflict of interest. Brady is not just an announcer but apart-owner of the Raiders. As the Chiefs and Eagles have been preparing to win a championship, Brady has been helping fire and hire coaches for the franchise he now partly runs. He called the Lions-Commanders playoff game around the time he was interviewing two of the Lions staff to be his head coach in Vegas. An audience deserves an announcer fully engaged in the role, and who is given the bandwidth to do the job effectively.That is not Brady. As part of rules put in place by the NFL when he took an ownership stake in the Raiders, Brady is not allowed into another team’s facility. He cannot attend other teams’ practices or participate in production meetings with coaches, players and executives of any team whose game he’s calling. Those meetings may seem trivial – he’s Tom Brady! – but it’s in those discussions that analysts glean information that can drive a game’s narrative. During the AFC championship game, Tony Romo noted that the Chiefs’ defensive staff had told him about Josh Allen’s tendency to go backward before darting to his left on quarterback sneaks. It may have seemed like a small detail, but the Bills’ inability to convert those plays became the storyline of the game. Romo handed his audience the words and rationale to go along with the gut feeling that the Bills were being outcoached. Brady will not be able to pick up any similar points before the game on Sunday.Still, no one aliveshouldbe better prepared to break down a Super Bowl. Brady played won seven of them, and he faced – and beat – most of the key protagonists for the Chiefs and Eagles as a player. Managing a Super Bowl Sunday is old hat to him. What is the best way to approach the extended half-time? What is it like to have an extra week to prepare? How do you mitigate the media circus?Fox made a sizeable bet that Brady would offer memorable answers to those questions, learn on the job and shepherd the audience through what will be one of the defining games in league history. So far, that bet has been a bust. But Brady has delivered in the clutch before. Under a different kind of pressure, can he do it again?Explore more on these topicsTom BradySuper BowlNFLUS sportsFoxUS television industryTelevision industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Every time the manager had seen “light at the end of the tunnel”, he said, it had “usually been an oncoming train”.He was talking about the club’s injury situation, the crisis that never seemingly ends, and yet the line about the train was an appropriate way to describe Liverpool, who did not so much roll into theCarabao Cupfinal, their first such showpiece under Arne Slot, as steamroll their way there. They refused to countenance any other outcome. They utterly flattened Spurs.‘We’re getting stronger’: Slot’s ominous message after Liverpool crush SpursRead moreWho can stopLiverpoolthis season? It is the question on everybody’s lips as they look down from the summit of the Premier League and eye glory in the Champions League and FA Cup, too. Nobody believed Spurs would do so here, probably not the diehards who made the trip north and possibly not even the players themselves – certainly not once the reality of what they were facing dawned on them.It was over, really, when Mohamed Salah scored from the penalty spot early in the second half to give them the aggregate lead – his 26th goal of the season. At that point, Spurs were just about still in it but by now absolutely nobody believed they were. The evidence had been mapped out in graphic detail across the Anfield turf where Liverpool were quicker, sharper, hungrier. Simply remorseless.Spurs could point to a single flicker in front of goal, the moment on 78 minutes when Son Heung-min pulled off a step-over and blasted against the bar from a tight angle. They had just five shots in total; the rest were eminently forgettable. None was on target.View image in fullscreenCody Gakpo (right) opens the scoring for Liverpool from close range in the first half.Photograph: Nick Potts/PABy then it was 3-0, Dominik Szoboszlai having added further to Cody Gakpo’s first-half opener, and there would still be time for the imperious Virgil van Dijk to add the fourth. It will beup to Newcastleto deny Liverpool in the final. Slot’s team will start as the heavy favourites.There were the inevitable “Sacked in the morning” chants for Postecoglou from the Liverpool supporters; they have tracked him for weeks and, well, he is still here.Next up for Postecoglou is Sunday’s FA Cup tie at Aston Villa. What had to hurt him was how little of the adventure and personality he demands were on show. Spurs went with a whimper. And, of course, another injury, Richarlison forced off at the end of the first half to join the 10 players who did not make the trip because of various problems.It was easy to feel that Liverpool wanted to right a couple of recent wrongs against Spurs from matches in London. There was theLuis Díaz disallowed goal farragobut more pertinently, perhaps,the first leg of this tie, when the midfielder Lucas Bergvall ought to have been sent off rather than allowed to stay on to score the only goal. They did not allow Spurs to play and how they came to do so themselves.Liverpool turned up the heat as the first half wore on. They dominated possession and their press became an increasing problem for Tottenham. Slot’s team camped in opposition territory and the breakthrough had been advertised, Szoboszlai seeing a goal ruled out for offside from a Salah pass.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is what Slot’s Liverpool do to you. The ball was worked wide to Salah and when he crossed with the outside of his boot and Darwin Núñez brought a dose of chaos in the centre, it ran for Gakpo. His feet were planted but he was able to summon the power. Should Antonin Kinsky have done more to keep out the shot? Possibly. The goalkeeper was erratic.Kinsky just about tipped a Salah volley on to the top of the bar in the 44th minute and that was when Richarlison was down at the other end with a calf problem, Liverpool playing on. Richarlison had clashed at the outset with Van Dijk, accusing him of throwing an elbow in his direction. It is fair to say that sympathy from the Kop was in short supply for the former Everton player. Postecoglou introduced Mathys Tel, his new outfield signing, having started his other one, the centre-half Kevin Danso. For both, it was a grisly welcome to the club.Liverpool make winning look easy as Slot’s machine rolls on to Wembley | Andy HunterRead moreKinsky was in the spotlight at the start of the second half. Liverpool brought still more intensity and the goalkeeper did well to repel a Szoboszlai header from a corner. And yet moments later, when Salah played a teasing ball into the area for Núñez, it was possible to foresee the disaster. Núñez was always going to be too quick, Kinsky was never going to pull out of the attempt to claim the ball. All he touched was Núñez. Salah picked out a top corner from the spot.Liverpool were in no mood to preserve what they had. Gakpo and Ryan Gravenberch both hit the woodwork before Conor Bradley played in Szoboszlai with a lovely first-time pass. The finish was never in doubt. Nor was that from Van Dijk when he rose to meet a corner. Liverpool march on.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupLiverpoolTottenham Hotspurmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But this year’s edition might just be his masterpieceOliver ConnollyThu 6 Feb 2025 12.21 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 17.12 ESTShareHowie Roseman has taken on folklore status in the NFL. Whenever the draft and free-agent seasons roll around, you hear the chorus: Howie has done it again! As general manager, Roseman has led thePhiladelphia Eaglesto three Super Bowl appearances in eight years, winning one title. But this year’s team is his magnum opus.Repeated playoff heartaches can warp a team’s self-perception. Every flaw becomes magnified. Two years after losing the Super Bowl to the Chiefs – and last season’s disappointingend-of-year collapse– Roseman tore down his roster and built a fresh juggernaut, with fewer than half of the players who played the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII remaining on this year’s roster.Roseman has been a model of stability in Philadelphia, joining the team as an intern in 2000. When Andy Reid was the head coach of the franchise, he was fast-tracked through the personnel department, becoming the team’s GM in 2010. But he soon lost a power struggle that almost saw him ushered out of the building. Owner Jeffrie Lurie turned his franchise over to Chip Kelly, a college football coaching superstar, in 2013. After Kelly oversaw 10-win seasons in his first two years, Roseman was stripped of personnel control. Lurie gave Kelly full autonomy to reshape the team, handing the coach control of the roster, player’s nutrition, sleep schedules and pre-game playlists. Roseman was left secluded within Eagles HQ, his role pared back to visiting sports conferences, filling out junior staff positions and working on contract negotiations.“As it turned out, it was probably the best thing that ever happened to me,” Roseman said onPro Football Talk in 2018. “Did I ever think I would be back in a significant position in Philadelphia? No. I don’t think that I did. But I was just determined that I was going to try to do the right thing every day and get better and learn more.”Kelly’s bungled management eventually led him to drive the franchise off a cliff. And after his time in exile, Lurie gave Roseman another crack. From there, he has proven to be one of the shrewdest executives in the league, overseeing the team’s threeSuper Bowlruns, six playoff appearances and an 83-48 record in his last seven seasons. By reaching the big dance this season, Roseman has become only the 11th GM to build three Super Bowl teams with the same franchise. Eight of those executives are in the Hall of Fame (Bill Belichick, who was the coach and GM in New England, will be the ninth). If the Eagles win on Sunday, he is likely a lock for The Hall himself. And unlike those other executives, he’s done so without being wedded to a Hall of Fame quarterback or coach.Most prolonged championship runs are built on a simple foundation: the pairing of a great quarterback and coach. But the Eagles are unusual. During Roseman’s time, the franchise has bounced between coaches and quarterbacks. He moved seamlessly from Doug Pederson, who led the Eagles to a Super Bowl win in 2017, to Nick Sirianni, who has overseen two Super Bowl trips. At quarterback, he drafted Jalen Hurts in the second round in 2020 as an insurance policy for franchise starter Carson Wentz, who ultimately flamed out in Philadelphia. Around Hurts, Roseman built one offensive machine, then reshaped it and built another. The upshot: Two NFC championship victories.View image in fullscreenIn his second second back in the general manager’s chair following a year in exile, Howie Roseman led the Eagles to their first ever Super Bowl title.Photograph: John W McDonough/Sports Illustrated/Getty ImagesWhat is fascinating about Roseman, though, is his lack of brand power. He is a quiet figure. He hasn’t sat for a tell-all documentary. There has been no insider book, plumping up his reputation with savvy branding. As far as anyone can tell, beyond beingunafraid of risk, there is no overriding philosophy or snazzy motto to stick on coffee cups. He is the salary cap guru … without any background in finance. He consistently builds the most talent-laden roster in the NFL … but entered the league as a 24-year-old law school grad. He is the Death Star in trade negotiations … who cut his teeth as an administrative intern.Front-office executives like to build a mythical status around their work. Maybe it’s their embrace of new analytics, grinding work ethic, ability to unlock an unforeseen market or their capacity as a former player to tie together the locker room with the cold-hearted nature of front office life. That makes things nice and cozy; they’re smarter and more talented than everyone. But that’s not Roseman. He did notMoneyballthe Eagles to multiple Super Bowls, exclusively. He did notTrust The Process. He has never claimed, publicly, to belight years aheadof his competitors. In the landscape of celebrity executives, Roseman does not have a manufactured persona like Pat Riley, Billy Beane, Daryl Morey or Theo Epstein. He doesn’t have an army of zealots hanging on his words. He has just gotten on with building the best roster possible, keeping the franchise in perennial contention despite bouncing between coaches and quarterbacks. His celebrity status comes from being very good at his job; to the point where other executives look sideways when he picks up the phone.“Howie and I have done some deals in the past. He’s really a bright guy … But he’s also one of those guys where I have to keep both hands in my back pockets when I’m talking to Howie,” Saints GMMicky Loomis said this year. While executing a draft day trade with the Commanders, Washington GM Adam Peters told Roseman, “You’re a pain in the ass.”Executives are never as good or bad as they appear in the moment. All have highs and lows, but Roseman has clung on through bleak days and lifted the Eagles to higher highs than at any point in franchise history. His path here has been different. He is not the traditional 21st-century sports wonk, with no wealth management or data science background. And yet, he has proven to be one of the most sophisticated GMs in managing the salary cap, performing a limbo under the salary cap to regenerate rosters that have not been good enough to feel the confetti fall. He has embraced new ideas, keying in on the minutiae of the league’s Collective Bargaining Agreement to allow the Eagles to retain talent or address needs.He has also been more aggressive than his contemporaries on the trade market, moving up and down the draft board to land needle-moving targets and swinging deals for valuable veterans. Darius Slay, DeVonta Smith, Jalen Carter and AJ Brown, cornerstones of the Eagles’ success, were all acquired via some sort of trade. In fact, his mostlasting influence on the leaguemay be valuing veterans over mid-round draft picks.Few GMs have proven better at balancing obvious moves with the abstract. To rebuild the trenches, he was happy to draft anAustralian novice in the seventh round, but equally turned to the greatest defense in college football history to sure up Philly’s defensive front. He selected Jordan Davis in the first round and Nakobe Dean in the third of the 2022 draft from the greatest defense in college football history. He then rolled it back in 2023, picking up two more defenders from Georgia’s all-world group: Carter and Nolan Smith.View image in fullscreenPhiladelphia Eagles wideout DeVonta Smith and general manager Howie Roseman speak before a November game against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Lincoln Financial Field.Photograph: Mitchell Leff/Getty ImagesEvery pick has hit. Jordan Mailata, an Australian who had never played a snap of organized football before being drafted by Philadelphia, is now one of the top left tackles in the league. Carter has become the most dominant interior defender in football. Davis is a valuable run-stuffer. Dean helped form the most malleable linebacking duo in the league before an injury ended his season early. Smith has developed into a hellacious edge defender, peaking in time for the postseason.Heading into this season, Roseman again aimed at obvious targets. The Eagles gagged away more explosive plays than any defense in the league in 2023, so Roseman drafted two cornerbacks at the top of the draft, Quinyon Mitchell and Cooper DeJean. Paired with Vic Fangio, a gruff, no-nonsense, warlock of a defensive coordinator, the results were immediate: the Eagles no longer give away deep passes and both rookies were named as finalists for Defensive Rookie of the Year, the first time since 2000 a franchise has had two players on the final ballot.Even the season-defining acquisition of running back Saquon Barkley straddled the line between obvious and philosophical. How about putting the league’s most dynamic runner behind a bruising offensive line? It felt obvious at the time – and feels downright unfair in hindsight. But the Barkley signing also cut against the grain. The Eagles handed Barkley a three-year, $37m contract in free agency at the peak of theRunning Backs Don’t Matterera. Roseman recognized that the devaluing of the position, which viewed backs as interchangeable parts, had tipped too far. Solid backs can be found anywhere, but special backs remain rare. And a special back behind an imposing line? Good luck. Barkley became the NFL’s mostdangerous offensive weapon, leading the league with 2,005 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns this season. In this postseason alone, he has 442 yards and five rushing scores.Signing high-priced free-agent stars is one thing. The top GMs, however, balance the books by finding 24-karat players for the price of 24 carrots. This year’s Eagles squad is full of cast-offs and career after-thoughts that have rounded out the most talented roster in the league: Starting guard Mekhi Becton was a first-round bust with the Jets before moving to Philadelphia in free agency; starting safety Reed Blankenship was scooped up as an undrafted free agent; Defensive Player of the Year candidate Zack Baun was a special teams ace and rotational pass-rusher with the Saints, before the Eagles nabbed him for $1m last offseason and converted him into one of the league’s best linebackers. Linebacker Oren Burks was a journeyman who has become Baun’s running mate at linebacker in the playoffs after Dean’s injury. The total cost of those starters combined: $6m, or roughly 2.5% of the cap.The Eagles earned their spot in New Orleans with smart draft picks, cunning trades, expert coaching, all-world talent, and the necessary dash of luck.If they are to dethrone the Chiefs, it will be because their offensive line controls the line of scrimmage, Barkley goes bananas, Hurts hits shots down the field and the team’s suffocating defense matches the Andy Reid-Patrick Mahomes combination blow-for-blow. Every piece of that puzzle can be traced back to Roseman. He won’t win the Super Bowl’s MVP. But if the Eagles feel the confetti this time around, no one will have been more valuable to the team’s success than their general manager.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia EaglesSuper BowlSuper Bowl LIXKansas City ChiefsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The order gives federal agencies latitude to withhold federal funding from entities that do not abide by Title IX in alignment with the Trump administration’s view, which interprets “sex” as the gender someone was assigned at birth.The NCAA policy change is effective immediately and applies to all athletes regardless of previous eligibility reviews under the NCAA’s prior transgender participation policy. The organization has more than 1,200 schools with more than 500,000 athletes, easily the largest governing body for college athletics in the US.“We strongly believe that clear, consistent and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today’s student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions,” the NCAA’s president, Charlie Baker, said. “To that end, President Trump’s order provides a clear, national standard.”The NCAA’s revised policy permits athletes assigned male at birth to practice with women’s teams and receive benefits such as medical care while practicing.Baker added that the NCAA is still committed to “protect, support and enhance the mental and physical health of student-athletes”, referring to a recent update to themental health guidelines.“This national standard brings much-needed clarity as we modernize college sports for today’s student-athletes,” Baker said.After the executive order, the Trump administration said on Thursday it was investigating potential “civil rights violations” at two universities and a high school sports league thatallowed trans athletesto compete on women’s teams.

On current form they’re the team to beat in Milan with the team event offering the potential for double gold.3) Ryan Cochran-SiegleAlpine skiingAs the son of 1972 Olympic slalom champion Barbara Cochran, the 32-year-old Vermonter carries on his family’s deep-rooted skiing tradition, which began at the small Cochran’s Ski Area about 15 miles outside Burlington. Despite a series of career setbacks, including a severe knee injury requiring multiple surgeries and a broken neck, the one-time giant slalom specialist has established himself as one of the more consistent speed skiers on the sport’s top flight, with 28 top-10 finishes across super-G and downhill. Not long after winning his first World Cup race in 2020 – in his 101st career start – Cochran-Siegle’s perseverance further paid off when heflew to Olympic silver in the super-Gin one of the major shocks of the Beijing Winter Games. Not a medal favorite, but every time he’s reached a World Cup podium has been on Italian snow.View image in fullscreenMadison Chock and Evan Bates won another world title at last year’s world championships in Montreal.Photograph: Matthew Stockman/International Skating Union/Getty Images4) Jessie DigginsCross-country skiingNo woman from outside Europe hadeverwon the overall crystal globe, cross-country skiing’s biggest prize, until Diggins four years ago. Then last year the Minnesota native won it for a second time and now sheappears on course for a thirdby the end of March. Known for her vibrant personality,trademark glitter-flecked cheeksand appetite for pushing herself to the absolute limit in races, the 33-year-old from the tiny St Paul suburb of Afton (population: 2,951) has also become a fierce advocate for mental health awareness and eating disorder recovery,sharing her strugglesto help others. Her success has been nothing short of transformative for US cross-country skiing, proving that Americans can compete with the traditionally dominant Nordic countries.5) Korey DropkinCurlingJohn Shuster has been the face of American curling since the day he skipped the United Statesto their first ever Olympic titlein Pyeongchang seven years ago. But Dropkin – along with Thomas Howell, Andrew Stopera and Mark Fenner – managed to end Shuster’s nine-year unbeaten runat the US curling championshipslast week in Minnesota. It was a fairytale outcome for the 29-year-old from Massachusetts, who moved to Duluth for college with a dream of curling at the highest level. Shuster can still become the second American to compete in six Winter Games after Nordic combined skier Todd Lodwick at next year’s Olympic trials, but Dropkin’sYoung Buckshave signaled for a changing of the guard.View image in fullscreenJessie Diggins is closing in on a third World Cup overall title, cementing herself as the world’s most dominant cross-country skier.Photograph: Anders Wiklund/TT NEWS AGENCY/AFP/Getty Images6) Laila EdwardsHockeySince becoming the first Black woman to be selected for Team USA in 2023 – whichearned her a name-checkfrom fellow Cleveland Heights native Travis Kelce – the 21-year-old forward from the University of Wisconsin has wasted no time making an impact. Less than one year after her senior international debut, Edwards finished with six goals and two assists in seven games at her first world championships to become the youngest ever tournament Most Valuable Player winner, despite the United States’ overtime loss to Canada in the final. Now the 6ft 1in Edwards, thecurrent top goalscorer in Division I, is making the transition from forward to defense for international duty.7) Alex FerreiraFreestyle skiingThe son of former River Plate forward Marcelo Ferreira, the 30-year-old halfpipe skier has one goal: to win gold and retire on top. The two-time Olympic medalist, who took silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, is coming off a historic season where he won every halfpipe competition he entered – the first clean sweep in the sport’s history – thanks in part to upgrading his run with a second double cork 1620. With plans to boost difficulty even further, Ferreira is keen to capitalize on what he believes will be his last shot at Olympic gold. He may be even better known as the star ofHotdog Hans, a popular hidden-camera video series where he disguises himself as a washed-up octogenarian skier before surprising unsuspecting onlookers with gravity-defying tricks.View image in fullscreenLess than one year after her senior international debut, Laila Edwards was named MVP of the world championships after finishing with six goals and two assists in seven games.Photograph: Eakin Howard/Getty Images8) Red GerardSnowboardingIt’s been seven years since a 17-year-old snowboarder from Rocky River, Ohio, overslept on the morning of his Olympic debut beforecoolly soaring to slopestyle goldin the Taebaek Mountains of South Korea. That made Gerard the youngest snowboarder ever to medal at the Winter Olympics, the youngest American man to win gold in 90 years and the second-youngest man to top the podium in any individual event after Finland’s Toni Nieminen, who was 16 when he won the large hill event in ski jumping in 1992. Now 24, and having finallywon the X Games crownthat had long eluded him, Gerard is eager for more Olympic hardware after a fourth-place finish in Beijing marred by controversial judging.9) Amber GlennFigure skatingIt’s been a sensational late-career revival for the pride of Plano, Texas, who skated in her first world championships at 23, won her first US national title at 24 and her first Grand Prix event at 25 and is all but a lock to make her Olympic debut next year at 26. Nearly a decade after she started competing as a senior and having overcome injuries, depression, ADHD and an eating disorder that almost derailed her career,the LGBTQ+ role modelhas gone more than a year since losing in a competition, a rich vein of form including the defense of her US national title last month after becoming the first American to win the prestigious Grand Prix final in nearly 15 years.View image in fullscreenRed Gerard became the youngest snowboarder ever to medal at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the youngest American man to win gold in 90 years.Photograph: Jamie Squire/Getty Images10) Alex HallFreestyle skiingBorn in Alaska to an American father and Italian mother, the freestyle skiing prodigy spent most of his early life in Zurich before moving back to the United States when he was 16 on a training invite from the US freeski team. Seven years later, he delivered on his long-held promiseby flying to slopestyle goldat the Beijing Olympics, putting down a spectacular opening run – including a final double cork 1080 into a 900 – for a score of 90.01 that none of his rivals could approach. Now the Park City resident will be among the favorites to retain his Olympic title in the homeland of his mother, who was born in Bologna.11) Erin JacksonSpeed skatingTheformer roller derby jammerfrom theunlikely speed skating hotbedof Ocala, Florida, surged to Olympic gloryin the women’s 500min Beijing, making history as the first Black woman to win gold inanyindividual event at the Winter Games. Roughly six years after stepping on ice for the first time in her life, Jackson completed the all-out sprint in a time of 37.04sec, ending the United States’ extended medal drought in a sport it once dominated and earning her the title of fastest woman on ice. Now 32, America’s first sprint queen since Bonnie Blair has backed up her claim as the world’s best at 500m on the World Cup circuit with a pair of season-long titles.12) Chloe KimSnowboardingThe 24-year-old from Long Beach first shot to global stardom in Pyeongchang, when she became the youngest female athlete to secure Winter Olympics gold on snowwith a transcendent halfpipe performance. She quickly found the trappings of fame – gracing the fronts of cereal boxes and magazine covers,getting shouted outin Frances McDormand’s Oscar speech – were dwarfed by her yearning for a normal life as a student at Princeton. After nearly two years off the mountain Kim picked up right where she left off, winning a world title before retaining her Olympic gold in Beijing. With her Milano Cortina prep in full swing on the World Cup circuit, Kim will go off as the hot favorite to complete an Olympic halfpipe treble.View image in fullscreenErin Jackson made history at the Beijing Olympics as the first Black woman to win gold in any individual event at the Winter Games.Photograph: Elsa/International Skating Union/Getty Images13) Ilia MalininFigure skatingThe Quad God roared to his first world championship last March in Montreal with astar-making long programset to music from Succession that was immediately hailed as the greatest athletic display in the sport’s history. Malinin became the second person ever to land six quadruple jumps in a single program, and the first to do it with a quadruple axel, the heart-stopping four-and-a-half-revolution jump that hadnever been landed in competitionuntil he came along. He’s since added anewly sanctioned backflipwhile flirting with theonce-fathomable quint. The clear favorite to retain his world title next month in Boston, it’s difficult to foresee anyone passing him before Milan.14) Auston MatthewsHockeyNHL playersare back in the Olympicsfor the first time since the 2014 Sochi Games and the California-born, Arizona-raised Matthews will lead a stacked United States side hoping to win the country’s first men’s international tournament since the World Cup of Hockey in 1996. The 24-year-old Toronto Maple Leafs center, a former No 1 overall draft pick and the league’s top goalscorer last season, was recently named captain for this month’s 4 Nations Face-Off, where the Americans will face Canada, Finland and Sweden in the first international tournament featuring the NHL’s best players since 2016.View image in fullscreenIlia Malinin became the second person ever to land six quadruple jumps in a single program, and the first to do it with a quadruple axel, at last year’s world championships in Montreal.Photograph: Joosep Martinson/International Skating Union/Getty Images15) Elana Meyers TaylorBobsleighAfter winning her fourth and fifth Olympic medals in Beijing to become the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Games history – a silver in the inaugural women’s monobob and a bronze with brakewoman Sylvia Hoffman in the two-woman event – the veteran American bobsleigh star hinted at retirement. But after sitting out the 2022-23 season for her second maternity leave, Meyers Taylor returned to become the oldest female driver to win a world championships medal with a monobob silver last year in Germany. The 40-year-old was back in the sled last month in St Moritz, where she took first in a pair of monobob races. Her goal: a fifth Olympic appearance in Italy and the gold medal that’s eluded her in the previous four.16) Kristen Santos-GriswoldShort track speed skatingAfter finally making her first Olympic team in her third trials aged 27, the late-blooming short track star settled for fourth in Beijing after aheartbreaking crashon the final lap of the 1000m final. The experience made Santos-Griswold think hard about whether she was willing to continue. It’s a good thing she did. At last year’s world championships Santos-Griswold reached the podium in all five events, including her first world title, becoming the first American to win a medal in all three individual Olympic distances (500m, 1000m and 1500m) at a single worlds since short track became an Olympic medal sport in 1992.View image in fullscreenElana Meyers Taylor has won five medals in bobsleigh across four different Olympics.Photograph: Thomas Eisenhuth/Getty Images17) Mikaela ShiffrinAlpine skiingShe’s a two-time Olympic gold medalist and five-time overall World Cup champion. But for a vast majority of Americans, the images of a tearful Shiffrin balled up on the south side of Xiaohaituo Mountain at the end ofher nightmarish Beijing Olympics– where she skied out of the slalom, giant slalom and the slalom portion of the combined and failed to win an individual medal – are their most recent memory of the Vail native. Since then she has bounced back with verve, staking her claim as the greatest ever alpine skier byeclipsing Ingemar Stenmark’s recordfor career victories by a male or female in 2023, then winning a record-tying eighth world slalom title last year despite a six-week injury layoff. The Shiffrin redemption narrative will be front and center of all stateside Olympic coverage by this time next year.18) Jordan StolzSpeed skatingA self-effacing Wisconsin native who grew up skating on a frozen pond behind his home has blossomed into the world’s best speed skater over the past two years and positioned himself to be one of the brightest stars of the entire Milano Cortina Games. The 20-year-old Stolz, who had gone more than a year since losing a race until last weekend’s homecoming meet in Milwaukee, is the two-time reigning world champion in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m and will be favored to win Olympic golds at each of those distances. That would make him only the second American to win more than two golds at a single Winter Games after Eric Heiden at the 1980 Lake Placid Games.View image in fullscreenJordan Stolz is the two-time reigning world champion in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m.Photograph: Joosep Martinson/International Skating Union/Getty Images19) Winter VineckiFreestyle skiingThe first athlete with the first name Winter to compete at the Winter Games, the aerials skier from northern Michigan rebounded from a 15th-place finish on her Olympic debut to win three World Cup events last season and finish a narrow second in the overall standings after adding triple flips to her repertoire. The high-flying Vinecki, an avid outdoorswoman who ran a marathon on all seven continents before her 15th birthday (yes,Antarctica too), will take another crack at becoming the first American woman to take home an Olympic gold medal in the aerials individual event since Nikki Stone in 1998.20) Lindsey VonnAlpine skiingNearly six years after retiring due to a battered right knee worn down by a string of gruesome crashes and multiple surgeries, Vonn made ashock comeback annoucementin November on the wrong side of 40 with a knee made of titanium to a high-risk sport where no woman has ever won a top-flight race past 34 years old. But the winner of three Olympic medals and 82 World Cup races has impressed early on: shefinished 14th in a super-Gat St Moritz, before improving tosixthandfourthin her next two races at St Anton. Incredibly, she says she feels healthier now than when she called time on her extraordinary career in early 2019. Those three starts alone suggest Vonn’s chances of competing in a fifth Olympics seem more than plausible.Ten more to knowMac Forehand (Freestyle skiing); Kaillie Humphries (Bobsleigh); Jaelin Kauf (Freestyle skiing); Isabeau Levito (Figure skating); Kaysha Love (Bobsleigh); Lauren Macuga (Alpine skiing); Maddie Mastro (Snowboarding); Emily Sweeney (Luge); David Wise (Freestyle skiing); Campbell Wright (Biathlon)Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026USA Olympic teamUS sportsSpeed skatingSkiingSnowboardingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She avoided falling and was able to stop but then grasped her arm in apparent pain. The gate pressed on her forearm, locked her elbow by her side and pushed the whole arm back with pressure on her shoulder. Spectators in the area let out a collective gasp of astonishment and grew silent with concern. Vonn skied down to the finish and waved to the crowd.“I’m OK. I hit my nerve somehow and I hit the gate and lost feeling in my arm but it’s coming back slowly,” Vonn said. The American has been dealing with cold- and flu-like symptoms.“I’m sick, I’m a little banged up. I know I skied the top well, I thought. Been playing with my material, my boots,” Vonn said. “Just I was a little too aggressive to the gate and then it happened.”Vonn stayed out to see Macuga for the podium celebration after her 22-year-old American teammate secured a medal in her first world championship race – a feat that not even Vonn accomplished 20 years ago at her first worlds.“I am really excited for Lauren, she skied amazing. I’m really proud of her,” Vonn said.Vonn retired in 2019 after winning bronze in downhill in Are, Sweden, following several injuries, but returned to the circuit this season with a new titanium right knee.The race started in mostly sunny conditions, but more clouds came in after the first half hour. More parts of the course were in the shadow when Vonn started in 30th position.The 31-year-old Venier was the 2013 junior world champion in super-G but a silver in downhill from the 2017 worlds was her only medal in a senior race before Thursday’s triumph.“It sounds unreal. I slept so bad last night, I was so nervous,” Venier told Austrian TV. “I was extremely nervous at the start, I didn’t know how to handle, but it was probably a good omen.”Venier has three career World Cup wins, including one in a super-G in Switzerland a year ago.Thursday’s opening race at the worlds took place exactly one year before the 2026 opening ceremony for the Milan-Cortina Olympics.Explore more on these topicsSkiingLindsey VonnUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The club’s Ratcliffe-led football department informed Amorim the ­position would not be open in the close ­season. Given this he was asked if the board accepted performances could become even poorer.Manchester United confirm Lisandro Martínez has cruciate ligament injuryRead moreAmorim said: “It’s a little bit harder for me to cope with that [poorer results] than the board, because the board already knows [what might happen under him]. I explained all the risks. Everything that has happened I explained to the board [before taking over], and they said the same thing: ‘We need to start now’ [him take the job].“But I understand at this moment, with a lot of losses, especially at home, the environment is really hard, but I feel the support of the board, if you’re asking that. I’m not the slightest bit worried about that, it’s just the pain of losing that is the hardest thing to cope with.”In the winter windowMarcus Rashford was loaned to Aston Villaafter Amorim refused to select him for six weeks. He was asked if the forward plays well under Unai Emery, Villa’s manager, if this would reflect badly on him as a coach.“As a journalist or a fan, you can take this in the way that you want,” the manager said. “What I say is I couldn’t put Marcus to see the way you’re supposed to play football and to train the way I see it. And sometimes you have one player who is really good with one coach and the same player with another coach is different. I just wish the best to Rashford and Unai Emery, and they can connect because he’s a very good player.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a nice moment for us to celebrate,” said Taylor. “The performance tonight really deserved that. We showed good character.”Khadija Shaw pulls out of Manchester City match after receiving abuseRead moreFowler’s first-half strike was cancelled out by Mariona Caldentey’s penalty in the second before Arsenal’s goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar saved a Fowler spot-kick two minutes after the home team had scored the equaliser. The game had looked destined for extra time, but Fowler’s bobbling effort five minutes into added time wrongfooted Van Domselaar and inflicted Arsenal’s second defeat under Renée Slegers, who said her side had had “not enough end product on the attacks”.There is no love lost between Arsenal and City. Chloe Kelly sat in the stands for Arsenal after her deadline-day loan move from City a reflection of that, following an acrimonious end to her time in Manchester, with Laura Wienroither also unable to play in the fixture having moved the opposite way on loan.There was confusion at Meadow Park as the clock ticked closer to the scheduled kick-off time of 7pm, players returning for a second warm-up as news filtered round that the start time had been pushed back by 15 minutes and then a further 15 due to a broken-down ambulance leaving the ground short of medical support.Despite the delay and eagerness to get going there was a caginess to the opening exchanges, neither side wanting to give much away early on, with the Gunners having sucker-punched City twice in the first eight minutes of Sunday’s Women’s Super League match which the Gunners won 4-3 in Manchester.“I was expecting this to be a game of fewer goals, because I think both teams were unhappy with the chances and goals conceded on Sunday,” said Slegers afterwards.View image in fullscreenMary Fowler receives the adulation of her teammates after opening the scoring.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersThis fixture was a chance for City to quickly exorcise the ghost of the frenetic defeat at the weekend. The visiting team drew first blood, with the former Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema providing the impetus, the WSL record goalscorer driving through the middle on a counterattack before playing the ball to Fowler to her right to fire beyond Van Domselaar.There was a notable absence for City, with Khadija Shaw, who was a second-half substitute in Manchester, absent entirely, having withdrawn from the squad to protect her mental wellbeing after she was subjected to racist and misogynistic abuse after the league match with Arsenal.City kept the pressure on in the second half, twice rattling the bar in quick succession, first from a ­Kerolin cross, then via a ferocious Aoba Fujino strike, but they failed to capitalise on their dominance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With Arsenal, the holders, in the ascendancy, Stina Blackstenius was released but was clipped in the box by Rebecca Knaak and Caldentey slotted in from the spot. The decision “looked a bit harsh”, said Taylor, with Knaak having got a touch on the ball before she connected with the Swedish forward.There was a chance for instant retribution when Fowler was muscled down between Kyra Cooney-Cross and Lotte Wubben-Moy but the Australia international’s spot-kick was straight down the middle and palmed away by Van Domselaar to the delight of the anxious home crowd.They would not be left ruing the miss, though, with Fowler stepping up to score her fourth goal in two games against Arsenal and send City through to the final.“I haven’t played in a final yet with the girls, so it’ll be a new feeling for me here,” said the goalscorer. “We’re ready for it, and I’m just super pumped for it.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballArsenal WomenManchester City WomennewsShareReuse this content"

Luca Ranieri arrived from outside the area, getting to the ball ahead of Davide Frattesi, and hit his shot first time low into the corner.There was little in the way of response from Inter, and Fiorentina doubled their lead nine minutes later. Dodô crossed from the right and Kean pulled away from his marker before powering a header into the bottom corner, this time leaving Sommer with no chance.With time running out, and an Inter comeback looking unlikely, Fiorentina wrapped up the win in the 89th minute, the goal coming from a Federico Dimarco howler. The defender hit a back-pass without looking and Kean was there to capitalise, and with the keeper in no man’s land, the striker finished with aplomb to net his 15th league goal of the season and end Inter’s 17-game unbeaten run in the league.Inter will have the chance for revenge when the sides meet again on Monday at San Siro. “Congratulations to Fiorentina. It’s a deserved defeat, we didn’t put anything on the field between running, aggression and determination,” said the Inter manager, Simone Inzaghi.“Now is not the time to make dramas but it is a defeat that hurts for how it came and how it has matured,” Inzaghi told Dazn. “Now we will have three and a half days before meeting Fiorentina again. Today we didn’t put on the field what we always put in … only work can get us out of this situation.”Ferran Torres scored a hat-trick in the first 30 minutes to lead an imperiousBarcelonato a 5-0 rout ofValenciain theCopa del Reyquarter-finals.

Osasuna’s goalkeeper Sergio Herrera tried to find Iker Muñoz, but Palo Marín was pressing hard and his challenge left Oyarzabal in space on the left, the goalkeeper rushing back, and a straightforward pass into the net from Brais Méndez.Four minutes later, Catena’s night was curtailed after his wild, high challenge on Méndez, which caught him just under the back of his neck. The video assistant referee intervened after a yellow card was issued, and the referee upgraded it to a dismissable offence on review.

She denies the charges.On Thursday, Kerr’s partner and fiancee, Kristie Mewis, told the court that Kerr was “speaking her truth” after being “treated differently” by officers when she made the comments. She accused them of “gaslighting” the couple after they doubted their account of being “held hostage” in a taxi in the early hours of 30 January 2023.View image in fullscreenKristie Mewis, partner of Australia striker Sam Kerr, outside court.Photograph: Alberto Pezzali/APMewis, who is pregnant with the couple’s child, was asked by Grace Forbes, who is defending Kerr, about her reaction when Kerr called PC Stephen Lovell “stupid and white”.“I think that, in that moment, she was speaking her truth in how she was feeling. I think that subconsciously, she felt like she was being treated differently. I’ve seen it a lot,” said Mewis, an American who is also a professional footballer.She said she had seen Kerr “treated differently multiple times” and later told the court that Kerr had “been treated differently, and spoke to differently, for her whole life. I think that she was feeling the same thing she had felt before”.Mewis became emotional twice on the witness stand. When asked how she felt in the taxi, which she said was moving “uncontrollably fast” after Kerr got sick out of the window, she teared up and said it “felt like someone else had control over me and that was obviously very scary”.Later, she was asked to describe Kerr as a person and struggled to hold back tears.Mewis said: “Sam is so loving and she’s so humble. She’s would help anybody, that’s one of the things I love about her so much, how helpful, and loving and humble she is.“She’s so inspiring, she inspires me everyday. I wouldn’t want anyone else to be the mother of my child.”Mewis described how she “immediately felt fear for my life” in a locked, speeding taxi. After a night out in London, the pair hailed a black cab back to their home. During the journey, Mewis said Kerr rolled down the windows of the cab and was sick outside. After this, she said the driver pulled over and “started yelling” before he resumed driving in a reckless manner.She said she had “never driven in a car that fast before” and “tried everything to get out”. She said, after the “initial shock wore off”, she knew she had to do “something dramatic” to save them. In the course of this, the taxi driver called the police.“I didn’t know if it was a kidnapping or if we were going to crash,” she said. Mewis said she was “kicking straight out with both feet” and broke the car’s window in a bid to escape before it parked outside Twickenham police station – on the instruction of police who answered the taxi driver’s call.When they went inside the station, Mewis said the police were “dismissive” of their claims.“It felt a little bit gaslighting,” she told the court. “Like it would just be easier for them if the whole thing was our fault.”She said the ordeal they relayed to officers would be “different” when repeated back to them. “The way he would say it back would manipulate it back to us,” she told the court.Eventually, Kerr paid the driver £900 for the damage. Mewis said they paid the sum because she wanted to “escape the situation” and that Mewis “was trying to make the US football team that summer.Earlier in the day, Kerr was cross-examined by prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones. He asked her whether she was using Lovell’s “whiteness as an insult”, which she denied.When pressed again about what “his race had to do with anything”, Kerr said: “I believed it was him using his power and privilege over me because he was accusing me of being something I’m not.”In a testy exchange, Emlyn Jones said: “Ms Kerr, if I put to you that you’re fucking stupid, that would be bang out of order wouldn’t it?”“Yes,” she responded.“I’d be insulting you?,” he said.“Yes. I expressed myself very poorly,” she said.Kerr was asked why she told Lovell she has “got all the fucking people in the world” and has “fucking Chelsea going on”. She said it was an attempt to “bluff” to “make myself feel protected”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsSam KerrAustralia sportChelsea WomennewsShareReuse this content"

Who knows what goes on in that world? When you’re affected by things like that it’s really really ­difficult.“I’ve not had time to have a good conversation with her about it but she knows and needs to know that the whole club are behind her in this.”In a statement released on Tuesday , the club had said: “Manchester City were appalled to learn that Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw was subjected to racist and misogynistic abuse following Sunday’s fixture.“Discrimination of any kind, either in stadiums or online, will not be tolerated and has absolutely no place inside or outside the game.“Bunny has decided not to share the messages publicly so as not to give the oxygen of publicity to the vile individuals who sent them.

An investigation will follow, and the club offers our full support to Bunny following the disgusting treatment she’s received.”The Women’s Professional Leagues Limited, the organisation responsible for the running of the WSL and ­Championship, said it was “shocked and saddened” by the abuse directed at Shaw. “Players, coaches and officials should be able to do their job without being subjected to abuse, either in person or online, and there is no place for it within women’s football or wider society,” it said.Explore more on these topicsManchester City WomenWomen's footballRacenewsShareReuse this content"

British fans cannot use the site or others like it because it is illegal to resell footballtickets in this way in the UK. The Premier League lists Vivid Seats as an “unauthorised ticket website”.Chelsea climb back into top four after comeback win over West HamRead moreThe issue has been a topic ofmuch discussion among Chelsea fans, with many on social media complaining it has become impossible for members to buy tickets to home and away games. There were already concerns within the fanbase about ticket touting, leading the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust (CST) to conduct a survey of its members about the issue.The CST found that only 17% of supporters had confidence in the club to tackle touting and anger was expressed at Vivid Seats’ connection with Boehly, who became Chelsea’s co-owner and chairman in 2022. Vivid Seats charges 10% commission, plus a service fee.Chelseahave previously denounced ticket holders who sell on their seats for profit.The CST said: “Vivid Seats ­currently lists hundreds of Chelsea FC general admission tickets at significantly inflated prices. As these tickets are not sold by the Chelsea FC website, they are considered by the club to be ‘illegal sales’.“Within the recent CST ticket touting survey, many CST members suggested that Mr Boehly’s connection with Vivid Seats is a ‘breach of trust’ and could be a conflict of interest. These recent reports are very disappointing, and it is within Mr Boehly’s best interests to investigate these issues and address supporters’ concerns. We do not believe it is appropriate for any Chelsea tickets or wider Premier League tickets to be listed on the Vivid Seats website.”The CST brought the findings of its survey to the club. More than two-thirds of fans think touts are a problem and 68% believe that not enough is being done by the club to combat it. The trust said: “The alarming findings of this survey have indicated that supporters do not have faith or trust in Chelsea FC to combat ticket touting and that the club has failed to protect its loyal supporters from the ongoing exploitation of ticket touting.“It is vital that the club provides immediate reassurances to supporters and must demonstrate that they are taking effective action to combat ticket touting through greater communication, stricter resale policies and sanctions, and additional enforcement against illegal ticket selling.“Despite warnings from the CST, the trend of data indicates that supporters have become increasingly dissatisfied with anti-touting measures in place at Chelsea FC over the past two to three years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But afteranother traumatic 2-0 lossto Eddie Howe’s side – Arsenal’s third blank in a row at St James’ Park – during which home supporters gleefully teased Arteta about his comments, it was surely not his only regret.Three times sincethe Spaniard won the FA Cupseven months after succeeding Unai Emery in 2019, Arsenal have reached a semi-final and failed to progress. On the previous occasion they reached this stage of the Carabao Cup, three seasons ago, they were also beaten 2-0 in the home leg, by Liverpool. It is a trophy they have not won since Steve Morrow’s decisive goal against Sheffield Wednesday in the 1993 final, after which the Northern Ireland midfielder was dropped by Tony Adams and broke an arm.Total Bruno sucks Arteta’s side into turf war and leaves them beaten and bruised | Jonathan LiewRead moreArsenal have lifted the FA Cup on a record 14 occasions and their two League Cup triumphs are a meagre return when compared with the rest of the big six – even Tottenham have four. Arteta’s decision to target the competition this season stemmed from his desire to end their wait for a trophy after finishing as runners-up to Manchester City in the Premier League two years in a row.“It brings belief, trust, positive energy, touching the cup, and being in the semi-final and beating somebody in the final,” he said before their quarter-final against Crystal Palace in December. “It is that energy and it creates the right path to go and do something else, particularly because of the timing and when the competition is played in this country. It gets that momentum going.”That was why William Saliba and Martin Ødegaard were introducedat half-time with Arsenal trailingto a goal from Palace’s Jean-Philippe Mateta before Bukayo Saka came off the bench with 20 minutes to play to set up Gabriel Jesus for the decisive goal. The full ramifications of that decision were not felt until a few days later when Saka pulled up with a hamstring injury in the 24th minute of Arsenal’s Premier League game at Selhurst Park. The England forward is not expected back for several weeks despite travelling with the squad on Thursday for their warm-weather training camp in Dubai.Quick GuidePremier League panel unaminously finds Lewis-Skelly's red was incorrectShowThe Premier League's Key Match Incidents Panel voted unanimously that referee Michael Oliver's decision to send off Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly in their recent victory at Wolves was incorrect. The video assistant referee for the Premier League game on 25 January, Darren England, also made an incorrect call by not to requesting that Oliver should review the incident, according to the KMI Panel findings.Lewis-Skelly tripped Wolves defender Matt Doherty (incident pictured) to prevent a counterattack and was shown a straight red card, with Oliver's decision upheld by VAR.The decision was heavily criticised by pundits and Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta after the match, while Oliver and his family have been subjected to threats and abuse since the incident. A three-match ban was overturned late last month.The KMI Panel said in its summary and review of the incident: \"The on-field red card decision was deemed incorrect … a cynical trip to stop a counterattack. The initial point of contact is high on the shin, but not forceful and with the side of the boot. This initial contact moves down quickly to the foot, meaning this foul should only result in a yellow card for a reckless challenge.\"On VAR's handling of the incident, the KMI Panel added: \"The panel deemed the VAR's decision to not recommend a review incorrect. As the challenge doesn't meet the considerations for serious foul play as there is no evidence of speed, force or full contact. One panellist felt this was not a clear and obvious error and supported the no VAR intervention as 'this should remain the referee's call'.\"PA MediaPhotograph: Nick Potts/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The first-leg defeat by Newcastle was one of nine games Arsenal played in January, when they lost Jesus to an anterior cruciate ligament injury but failed to bring in reinforcements in the transfer window. After Artetaadmitted disappointmentat the failure to strengthen and stressed that Arsenal’s dwindling list of attacking players must “make sure that they stay fit and they keep contributing”, it was another cruel twist to see Gabriel Martinelli clutching a hamstring before half-time against Newcastle on Wednesday and being swiftly substituted. Arteta said the Brazil forward would have a scan and was clearly expecting the worst.View image in fullscreenGabriel Martinelli’s injury is the latest setback for Arsenal’s dwindling list of attackers.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAAs Arsenal check in to the same base in the United Arab Emirates that served them so well last season, he will be keen to move on and refocus his players on the mammoth task ahead. Having arrived in Dubai 13 months ago on a run of one win from seven games, they won their next eight matches and scored 33 goals. But Arteta knows he has his work cut out to produce the same results given his attacking options are down to the bare bones. The exciting 15-year-old Max Dowman, who in September became the youngest player to score in the Uefa Youth League, has been given special dispensation to travel with the squad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are going at a different moment of the season, different numbers, probably the team needs a different stimulus, so we are preparing a few things and hopefully it will work like it has the last few times.”The trip was made possible by Arsenal’s elimination from the FA Cup in the third roundagainst Manchester Unitedand their progress straight to the last 16 of the Champions League. Between a trip to Leicester next Saturday and the first leg of their last-16 tie in the first week of March, Arteta’s side will face only West Ham at home on 22 February and a potentially crucial game against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground four days later. That could give his weary players an opportunity to recharge after playing two games a week for most of the campaign.Even a finale to match last season’s may not be enough given how relentless Liverpool are proving, and everyone at Arsenal is no doubt aware that only one club has finished second in three consecutive Premier League seasons. That was the fate of Arsène Wenger’s Arsenal, although he followed that by winning the Double in 2002 after Sir Alex Ferguson’s United matched Arsenal’s achievement from the 1930s of being crowned champions three times in a row. Arteta will be hoping he does not face as long a wait.Explore more on these topicsArsenalMikel ArtetaanalysisShareReuse this content"

An application to the employment tribunal for the claim against the FA to be struck out may follow. The EFL declined to comment.Crawley are understood to deny any wrongdoing, with sources at the club indicating they plan to defend the claim vigorously, although they have made one settlement offer to Reynolds.Leeds streak further ahead at summit as Piroe and Bogle wrongfoot CoventryRead moreThe FA’s position will be strongly contested by Reynolds’ legal team, who are set to argue that the governing body has a duty of care to prevent exploitative practices.“The FA has a duty of care to those employed in their partner organisations,” a source with knowledge of the case said. “They are rightly proud of their safeguarding policies in some areas so can’t duck this issue. These sorts of things happen at lots of clubs so this is a massive test case for the industry.”In his submission to the employment tribunal Reynolds cites the Modern Slavery Act and accuses Crawley of age discrimination. The 2015 Modern Slavery Act states: “Employees shall not be contractually required to work more than 48 hours per week and overtime will only be worked on an optional basis. Forced or compulsory labour is prohibited.”In his claim form to the employment tribunal submitted last month, Reynolds says Crawley tried to force him “to work excessive hours without additional pay” and this would have meant “having to work below the minimum wage threshold”.He also says: “These working practices are in line with [the] modern slavery act. Both the Football Association and English Football League are aware of these practice[s] … Crawley Town FC have also failed to follow both disciplinary and grievance procedure and have dismissed me both unfairly and without notice. I believe my age was a factor in termination.”Reynolds worked for Crawley for nine years in a variety of roles including match-day hospitality, security and ground maintenance before spending the last two and a half seasons assisting the kitman. At the start of this season a new kitman was appointed by Crawley, George Carney, with the pair told to share duties with each working an average of 48 hours a week.Reynolds claims that on 27 November he received a phone call from Crawley’s head of football operations, Lewis Timms, who told him that Carney was leaving and he would have to take on his responsibilities without additional pay. After protesting that the workload would be impossible he says he received an email from Timms the following week stating the club had accepted his resignation.“At the end of November they got rid of George – I’m not sure why,” Reynolds told the Guardian. “I just got a phone call on 27 November saying I’d be taking over. I was already struggling with the workload and doing the job on my own would be impossible.“It was 12-hour days, seven days a week, with lots of travelAnd no extra money. I’m 62 and couldn’t do it physically. So I told the club I couldn’t do it, and didn’t hear anything from them. The only contact I’ve had was an email saying they’d accepted my resignation. I contacted the club, who said the owners had told him I’d resigned. But I never did.“I’ve not heard from them since. I can’t get a job and I’ve got no money. Part of me wishes I said yes, and done the extra work for no extra money. It’s turning into a nightmare.”Reynolds claims that in his phone conversation with Timms it was made clear that if he did not accept the changes to his working conditions he would be forced to leave. Reynolds has raised a formal grievance procedure but says he has not heard from the club, other than being paid his final month’s salary and nine days’ outstanding holiday pay. He says he did not receive a redundancy payment and has yet to be sent a P45.View image in fullscreenCrawley’s Broadfield Stadium.Photograph: Neil Hood/TGS Photo/ShutterstockAfter he submitted the unfair dismissal claim Crawley are understood to have contacted Reynolds offering a settlement of less than one month’s salary, which he declined.Crawley are understood to be contesting the claim on the grounds that Reynolds voluntarily resigned while sources at the club also claim he rejected an offer from Timms to reconsider. The club declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.Crawley are owned by a group of American cryptocurrency investors who bought the club three years ago under the banner of Wagmi United, after a failed takeover bid of Bradford City, where they had aimed to use non-fungible tokens [NFTs] as their ownership model. Wagmi – an acronym for We’re All Going To Make It – launched a Crawley NFT three months after the takeover. In 2022 they became the first English club to release a kit only available to fans who had bought an NFT.The new owners have employed six different managers in less than three years, but have had success on the pitch,winning promotion to League Onelast season.Explore more on these topicsCrawley TownLeague OnenewsShareReuse this content"

I think this is the hardest Premier League for a very, very long time.’Van Gerwen had reached the semi-finals with a thrilling 6-5 win overLuke Littler, gaining some revenge for his World Championship final defeat by the teenager last month. Littler averaged 113.91 – the second-highest losing average in Premier League history – but was edged out by Van Gerwen, who averaged 105.91 in victory.View image in fullscreenMichael van Gerwen is congratulated by Luke Littler after their match, a repeat of the PDC world final.Photograph: Graham Service/ShutterstockThere was perhaps some extra needle to the contest after Van Gerwen criticised Littler for being late to a media event on Wednesday. “They need to stop treating him like a baby … he’s 18 years old now,” Van Gerwen said. Littler played down the row before the match, saying: “He’s not wrong, I was late. I did get a little telling off.”Van Gerwen carved out a 5-3 lead over Littler with two breaks of throw but wobbled at the finish line, almost allowing his opponent to snatch the win before holding throw in the 11th and final leg.Humphries, who lost to Littler in last year’s Premier League final, launched his campaign with a 6-2 defeat of Nathan Aspinall. In their semi-final, Van Gerwen outscored Humphries but was erratic on doubles, missing 11 including a match dart on the bullseye. By contrast, his opponent was clinical, landing 140 and 120 checkouts before holding his nerve in a deciding leg to edge through 6-5. “I was very fortunate,” Humphries admitted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So the first time I tell them how to bring the ball out from the back against a 7-9-11 press, they were maybe like: ‘OK.’ But the more times you face them, the more it becomes natural for you.Liverpool sweep Tottenham aside to book Carabao Cup final with NewcastleRead more“The more games you play, the more team meetings you have, the more training sessions you have, the better they know what we expect from them and what to expect from each other.“Second of all, I believe in the fact that the more games you play the physically stronger you become. Some people think you get tired but as long as you manage it well, the players will get stronger by playing a lot of games instead of getting tired.”Liverpool were remorseless against a Spurs team who were unable to show who they were, to play with any aggression or personality. The visitors managed only five shots – none of them on target. “Tottenham are always able to score a lot and create a lot,” Slot said. “That they didn’t tells you a lot about our work rate. We showed our mentality from the first to the last second.”Ange Postecoglou continues to live under immense pressure; a route to silverware now closed off, his team struggling in 14th place in the Premier League. “We didn’t give ourselves a chance to take the opportunity which is probably more disappointing,” the Spurs manager said. “I would have liked us to play more like who we are. There is a lesson in there for us that if we veer away from that it almost becomes impossible for us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Toulouse man’s absence this weekend has opened the door to Matthieu Jalibert’s first involvement in a match-day squad since leaving the national training centre at Marcoussis outside Paris midway through the autumn internationals.In November, Galthié had been somewhat evasive over the Bordeaux fly-half’s international future, saying: “He’ll continue to play for France, if he wants it.” At Thursday morning’s squad announcement, though, the former scrum-half dismissed any feelings of resentment against Jalibert: “There’s no power struggle. The only power struggle should be with our opponents, not with our own players.“We’d had a discussion which some wanted to portray as spectacular, as controversial. But that’s not the case, there was no controversy for us, it was simply a choice that we made. It was important for us to stay in contact, and for the player not to lose himself, to define his path, his priorities, his method. Matthieu has put in the work to make himself available for selection.”View image in fullscreenFabien Galthié has recalled Matthieu Jalibert at No 10 with Romain Ntamack suspended.Photograph: Nguyen Van Hai-Barbier Jean Pierre/ABACA/ShutterstockThere was scarcely any suspense in this week’s decision, given that Jalibert had worn a starter’s bib in this week’s training sessions. The head coach explained that discussions on a replacement began immediately after the Wales match. “We very quickly found the answer to the question”, Galthié said of the “obvious and logical” choice of picking the man who has already deputised for Ntamack in the 2021Six Nationsand 2023 World Cup.Also making his return for Le Crunch is Damian Penaud, who last played for France 11 months ago against England and missed the Wales match with a toe injury. The Bordeaux-Bègles winger scored the last of his 36 tries for France more than a year ago, and would match Serge Blanco’s all-time record with a double on Saturday. Galthié is keen to see the 28-year-old, who has scored nine tries in his last two Champions Cup outings, take to the international stage again: “He must be hungry, very hungry.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In his press conference, Galthié spoke of the input that the captain and the six “leaders” of the squad provide on all aspects of the France setup: “He fully plays out his role as captain, and he has my ear.”As France return to Twickenham two years on from their53-10 demolition job, Galthié is well aware that his side face an entirely different challenge as they look to cement their status as grand slam favourites: “We’re expecting a big match, with a lot of appetite and determination.” Despite the cross-channel rivals’ recent poor run of results, he insists that they are “one of the best teams in the world”.Beyond Saturday’s match, Galthié appears to see the current iteration of theXV de la Rose, as the England team are known in France, as potential long-term rivals for continental supremacy: “They’ve reigned over European rugby in the past, even over world rugby, and they want to do so again.”Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025France rugby union teamEngland rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

At a ­cricketing level, when women’s and girls’ cricket is growing rapidly around the world, it is heartbreaking that those growing up in Afghanistan are denied this opportunity, but the appalling oppression of women and girls by the Taliban goes so much further.“The board recognises there are different views and opinions on the issue of boycotting the match and has listened carefully. We have been in close contact with the government, the International Cricket Council, our England men’s players and other stakeholders to discuss this matter, as well as considering how best the ECB can support those women cricketers who have fled Afghanistan.“Following this, we remain of the view that a coordinated international response by the cricketing community is the appropriate way forward, and will achieve more than any unilateral action by the ECB in boycotting this match. We have also heard that for many ordinary Afghans watching their cricket team is one of the few remaining sources of enjoyment. As such, we can confirm that we will play this fixture.”While Afghanistan are the only ICC full member not to run a programme for women’s cricket, recent diplomatic dialogue between the Indian government and the Taliban – talks that reportedly included strengthening sporting ties – means their removal from cricket’s top table is unlikely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The $150m campus, set to open before the start of the 2026WNBAseason, will repurpose a facility formerly owned by Nike on 12 acres in Hillsboro, a city just west of Portland.Amenities will include locker rooms and lounges for both teams, two soccer fields and an additional outdoor training area, a gym that will include two basketball courts, strength training, conditioning and rehab areas, film theaters, a dining room and team offices.Denver lands 16th NWSL franchise at record $110m expansion feeRead morePortland was awarded an expansion team last September. RAJ Sports, led by Lisa Bhathal Merage and Alex Bhathal, own and operate the team. They paid $125m for the franchise.Karina LeBlanc, executive vice president of strategic growth for RAJ Sports, said Bhathal Merage set up listening sessions with athletes in designing the facility, which was announced on Thursday.“My generation that played this sport gets to look at this and be like, ‘Wow, this is better than our dreams.’ The athletes are the center of this. They get to walk into a building where they feel like they belong, and they feel like they’re seen and heard,” said LeBlanc, who was a goalkeeper for the Thorns and later served as the team’s general manager.Portland had a WNBA team, the Fire, from 2000 until it folded in 2002. That franchise averaged more than 8,000 fans when games were played at the Rose Garden.

This Sunday, when the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles, we once again bear witness to a perfect American marriage: the country’s biggest sporting event coupled with a live music gig so valuable to its megastar performers that they undertake it for free.Tom Brady’s TV career so far has been a dud. Will that change in the Super Bowl?Read moreIt is a coupling that the rest of the world has typically looked on with a quizzical smile, a tolerant shake of the head, a murmur that it “wouldn’t work for them”. After all, this is a cultural touchpoint so uniquely American that hundreds of thousands of people tune in to it just to watch the adverts.To a Brit, it can seem unfathomable. Some of us still remember Atomic Kitten’s blank reception at cricket’s first ever Twenty20 finals day in 2003. When the pop trio took to the stage between the semis and the final, the bafflement in the stands was so tangible that they found themselves singing to a tiny handful of interested parties. “This is our last song,” Liz McClarnon eventually told an otherwise unbothered Trent Bridge crowd. “Then you can all get back to your cricket.”Who needed chart-toppers, when we had Jimmy Ormond rattling out Warwickshire’s top order? But times have changed, and the goalposts are moving: quite literally, with sports stadiums developing into multiuse grounds. “Imagine Dragons play Spurs” is a two-night stop on a world tour, not a thought experiment, and technological improvements in groundskeeping have allowed arena shows to bed down quite cosily within a busy fixtures calendar, from Arctic Monkeys at Old Trafford to Neil Diamond at the Rose Bowl.Sports organisers, meanwhile, are programming ever more live musical accompaniment to the games themselves, hoping to broaden its audience base, or to get fans into the stadium earlier and spending more on food and drink. The FA Cup final includes DJ sets in its buildup. The Hundred partnered with the BBC’s “Introducing” series to platform emerging artists. The Champions League final has incorporated a pre-game show into its opening ceremonies, from Alicia Keys in Milan to the Black Eyed Peas in Cardiff.View image in fullscreenRihanna performs during the Super Bowl half-time show at State Farm Stadium, Glendale, Arizona – home of the Cardinals – in 2023Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersSoccer – like most sports – looks on admiringly at the unique engagement the Super Bowl attracts (last year’s event was the most-watched TV programme in US history, with 123.4 million viewers) and the ad spend it commands ($8m for a single 30-second advert). In September, Fifa announced that the 2026 World Cup final,to be held at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium, will be the first ever to feature a half-time show. After all, if you’re going to try it anywhere, it makes sense to make the attempt in a country that actually appreciates them.The US didn’t invent the idea of musical interludes at sporting events: their Super Bowl tradition can be traced directly to British shores. As weekend games became mass entertainment in the late 19th century, football and cricket clubs hired brass bands to keep the crowds happy during the break. The nascent American sports adopted the practice too, where it found its way into college sport and became a central part of its boosterish culture.Marching bands were the interval attraction at the Super Bowl’s inaugural edition in 1967. By the early 70s, the half-time shows incorporated stars such as Ella Fitzgerald and Andy Williams, and in the 1990s the NFL began promoting them as an event in their own right, harnessing Michael Jackson’s planetary pull to stop casual viewers turning off at the end of the second quarter. By the 2000s, they had become the ultimate watercooler event (see: Nipplegate), a must-watch that’s worth millions of dollars in sales, streams and brand value to the featured artist.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Well, we just kept marching our military bands across the Lord’s outfield, and singing in the rain with Cliff Richard at Wimbledon. It’s not that we weren’t offered something different. Sky Sports’s pioneering Monday Night Football broadcast in 1992 included the Shamenperforming their No 1 hit Ebeneezer Goode, to a half-time Highbury crowd whose team were 1-0 up against Manchester City. Unfortunately the band were accompanied by a dance troupe dressed in Tottenham colours, and soon found themselves booed off the pitch.Football fans’ scornful attitude towards interval entertainment isn’t mere snobbery, it’s also born of practical considerations. Half-time is a precious window to get to the bar, or buy your kids chips, or join the long line for the loos. But the sports industry’s attention is increasingly on the casual consumer, not the hardcore fan who just wants to get on with the game.For Fifa, the half-time show is an idea whose time has come. It has even wrapped the project in good-deed vibes: Global Citizen, a social justice advocacy organisation, will produce the gig, with Hugh Jackman, a bona fide great guy, as is its ambassador. Equally great guy Gianni Infantino announced that the partnership will “bring together the worlds of sport and entertainment to actively contribute to a better world”.What this means remains undetailed. Does Fifa plan to help world poverty by committing all the ad revenue it receives to feeding the hungry? Or will David Beckham finally broker a Spice Girls’ 30-year reunion?

The work of all three individuals has been critical of the rightwing government of Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni.A person familiar with the matter saidItalyhad breached the terms of Paragon’s contract with the government, which does not allow for journalists or members of civil society to be targeted with the spyware.Like Pegasus, the hacking software made by the rival NSO Group, Paragon’s hacking spyware, called Graphite, can infect a mobile phone without a user’s knowledge. It then gives the operator of the spyware full control and access to messages and encrypted chats sent over apps such asWhatsAppand Signal.The news has sent shockwaves across the Italian parliament, with one MP saying that, if confirmed, the story represented an “unacceptable violation of fundamental rights and an attack on democracy itself”.Paragon’s decision to terminate the contract, which was first reported by the Guardian, comesless than a week after WhatsApp announced that Paragon’s spyware had been used to target dozens of people. Like other spyware vendors, Paragon sells its cyberweapon to government clients who are supposed to use it to prevent crime. It remains unclear who all the specific government clients were behind the alleged attacks.Responding to the allegations of involvement late on Wednesday, Meloni’s office denied that domestic intelligence services or the government were behind the alleged breaches against the journalist and activists.The person familiar with the matter, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, said Paragon had “out of an abundance of caution” initially suspended the Italy contract when the first allegation of potential abuse of the spyware emerged last Friday. The decision to fully terminate the contract, the person said, was made on Wednesday after Paragon determined that Italy had broken the terms of service and ethical framework it had agreed under its Paragon contract.The Guardian has contacted an Italian government spokesperson for comment.Italian opposition parties on Thursday called on Meloni to urgently address parliament amid scepticism over the government’s statement, which also revealed that it had been told by WhatsApp that the number of affected Italians “appeared to be seven”. It is unclear who the other alleged victims are.Giuseppe Conte, leader of the Five Star Movement (M5S), said: “Something doesn’t add up. The fact that journalists are being spied upon is in itself of unprecedented severity in a democratic system, and if even a company says it had to interrupt the contract for ethical reasons … this is very serious.”Barbara Floridia, an M5S senator and president of the supervisory committee for the state broadcaster, Rai, said the case “raises disturbing questions about the protection of privacy and freedom of the press in our country”.“If confirmed, this story would represent an unacceptable violation of fundamental rights and an attack on democracy itself,” she added.Sandro Ruotolo, an MEP with the Democratic party, said: “In the statement excluding its involvement in espionage, the Italian government did not answer the most important question, namely whether or not Italy purchased services from Paragon Solutions. If so, what type [of service] and for what?”Asked for comment, a Paragon representative declined to confirm or deny the development, and said it was the company’s policy to not discuss potential client matters.Francesco Cancellato, the editor-in-chief of Fanpage,a highly regarded investigative news outlet, was the first to publicly state last Friday that he was one of the 90 people who had been notified by WhatsApp that his mobile phone had been targeted, and most likely compromised, by the hacking software.WhatsApp said the 90 people who were likely to have been compromised had been added to WhatsApp group chats and been sent malicious PDFs, which then probably infected their phones. The users would not have had to click or download the pdf to be infected.WhatsApp said all of the hacking attempts had been discovered in December, in part through the help of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, which tracks digital threats against civil society. It is not clear for how long the individuals could have been surveilled or the government clients involved in each case.While it is not entirely clear why Cancellato may have been targeted, his publication last year published a high-profile investigation that exposed young fascists in Meloni’s party. The two other people who were targeted,Husam El Gomati, a Libyan activist living in Sweden, andLuca Casarini, the founder of NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans, have both been vocal critics of Italy’s alleged complicity in abuses suffered by migrants in Libya.While Paragon’s move is likely to assuage some concerns, there are still outstanding questions about dozens of other cases that WhatsApp discovered. Italy said earlier on Wednesday that it had been told by WhatsApp that those targets live in countries acrossEurope– and possibly other countries – including Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.Paragon was reportedly recently acquired by a US firm called AE Industrial Partners, which on its website is described as a private investment firm with $5.6bn of assets under management, focused on markets including national security. The company has not responded to requests for comment.Paragon agreed a $2m contract last year with Ice, the US immigration and customs enforcement agency. The contract, agreed under the Biden administration, was reportedly suspended while the administration sought to determine whether it complied with an executive order that restricted the use of spyware by the federal government. The current status of the contract is not known. Neither Ice nor Paragon has responded to the Guardian’s questions about the contract.Explore more on these topicsWhatsAppItalyEuropeHackingSurveillanceEspionagenewsShareReuse this content"

Reports from Massachusetts to Idaho have described agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) spreading through communities and rounding people up. QuickGooglesearches for Ice operations, raids and arrests return a deluge of government press releases. Headlines include “ICE arrests 85 during 4-day Colorado operation”, “New Orleans focuses targeted operations on 123 criminal noncitizens” and, in Wisconsin, “ICE arrests 83 criminal aliens”.But a closer look at these Ice reports tells a different story.Thatfour-day operationin Colorado? It happened in November 2010. The123 people targetedin New Orleans? That was February of last year.Wisconsin? September 2018. There are thousands of examples of this throughout all 50 states – Ice press releases that have reached the first page of Google search results, making it seem like enforcement actions just happened, when in actuality they occurred months or years ago. Some, such as thearrest of “44 absconders”in Nebraska, go back as far as 2008.All the archived Ice press releases soaring to the top of Google search results were marked with the same timestamp and read: “Updated: 01/24/2025”.The mystery first caught the attention of an immigration lawyer who began tracking Ice raids and enforcement actions whenDonald Trumptook office. She spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the administration. At first, she was baffled when she clicked on these seemingly new press releases and they detailed Ice raids from more than a decade ago.So she set to work doing some digital sleuthing and enlisted a friend who is a tech expert to help. What they found leads them to believe that Ice is gaming Google search.‘Panic benefits Ice’: local newsrooms fight back as immigrants face misinformationRead moreIce did not return a request for comment. A Google spokesperson said: “When people do these searches on Google, they’ll find a range of sources and information, including recent news articles.” She said Google aimed to “reflect the last time a page was updated” and that its “systems are not designed to boost a page’s ranking simply because they update their timestamp”.Since the Guardian reached out to Ice and Google for comment, some of the press releases have reverted back to their original dates on Google search. Therefore, those releases are no longer appearing at the top of Google search results.Cracking down on immigration is top of the agenda for Trump. During his inaugural address, he promised mass deportations “to repel the disastrous invasion of our country”. Since then, his administration has touted that hundreds of arrests andraids have occurredin places like Los Angeles and Chicago. TV crews havefollowed Ice agents on raidsand the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, has posted videos of herself on X wearing an Ice bulletproof vest in New York City. Shecaptioned one: “Getting the dirt bags off the streets.”It is Ice’s made-for-TV moment. Inundating all forms of media, including Google search, with stories of mass arrests fits into a strategy of fearmongering, said Lindsay M Harris, a law professor at the University of San Francisco who specializes in immigration and asylum law.“All of that is intended to send a message to immigrants to be afraid and that they’re coming for you,” said Harris. “Regardless of the actual numbers, the optics of these mass arrests throughout the country have very real ramifications.”A pattern emergesAs reports of arrests poured in last month, the immigration lawyer watched in shock. Social media and listservsfilled with rumors of raidsand local news programs showed Ice apprehensions in towns as small as Cartersville, Georgia, population 25,000. “There was a lot of noise online,” she said. “And it was creating terror in the community.” She said it was hard to separate fact from fiction, so she decided to create a nationwide map that aggregated all actual Ice arrests.At the end of her workdays, she would sit down and start Googling – typing in searches like “ice arrests Nebraska” and “recent ice arrests Arizona”. Then she would plug in other states.View image in fullscreenKristi Noem wears an Ice vest as she speaks to law enforcement agents in New York last month.Photograph: @Sec_Noem/ReutersThe lawyer noticed a strange pattern. In almost every state, at least one press release from Ice’s website appeared in Google’s top results. Nebraska, for example, surfaced links for two press releases. One said “ICE executes federal search warrants in Nebraska”, the other said “ICE fugitive operations team arrests 44 absconders”. Both displayed their dates of publication as 24 January 2025 on Google search. But when the lawyer clicked through to the report, the actual dates of publication were August 2018 and June 2008, respectively.“I’ve now done it in all 50 states … and I’ve done it in multiple cities. And it’s the same thing,” the lawyer said. “They all had the last update of 1/24/2025 and they were all popping up at the front of the algorithm.”Maria Andrade, a longtime immigration lawyer in Idaho, says Ice arrests have been scant in the state so far. “We had one that didn’t result in detention,” she said. “I haven’t heard of mass arrests in any area at all.”Yet the first result for a Google search of “ice arrests Idaho” is a press release from Ice saying 22 people were arrested in an “enforcement surge”. The date of publication displayed in the search results is 24 January 2025, but the operation actually happened in July 2010. Andrade said that arresting 22 people would have been a large number for Idaho and that such incidents are extremely rare, given the minimal number of Ice agents, rural terrain and extreme weather. If so many people were arrested in one sweep in Idaho last month, she said, she would know about it.“If the objective is to scare people who look up raids in Idaho, that would be a good way to accomplish it,” Andrade said. “That would be a good way to mislead people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionConfusion and fear over Ice’s operations have real-world consequences for both immigrants and other law enforcement agencies. Panic in Idaho has hit such a fever pitch that at least one local sheriffhas made a public statementtrying to quell fears. “Rumors have circulated about ICE conducting ‘raids’ in the area,” Morgan Ballis, the sheriff for Blaine County,announced last week. “These claims were completely unsubstantiated, with no evidence to support them.”Solving the mysteryThere are several ways to game Google search to boost a website to the top of the results page, the most valuable real estate on the internet. In fact, a whole field is built around it called search engine optimization, or SEO. Google’s algorithm works by looking at various factors on a webpage to determine if it is relevant and authoritative. Government web domains already get authoritative bonus points. Other tricks to nudge the algorithm include linking back to one’s own website and updating the timestamp on a web page to a more recent date, as it appears Ice has.After dealing with all of the outdated Ice press releases, the immigration lawyer called up her tech expert friend to help get to the bottom of what was going on.The tech expert, who likewise spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, said she was initially skeptical that anything unusual was happening. But she sorted through what the lawyer found, then she did her own Google searches targeted specifically for January 2025 and Ice’s website. She also tried Bing, Microsoft’s search engine. Those searches returned nearly 13,000 archived Ice press releases timestamped to 24 January 2025.“I was like, ‘OK, this is pretty weird,’” she said.Bing did not return a request for comment.She then started a forensic examination of Ice’s webpages by inspecting the front-end code to look for clues.What was interesting, she said, was that Ice had marked all of these press releases as old. The agency displayed a message at the top of every page the Guardian reviewed noting it contained “archived content” that was “from a previous administration or is otherwise outdated”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: US Immigration and Customs EnforcementBut when the tech expert looked at the code of these online press releases, she saw a new element had been added – a time stamp. “Every article was updated on the 24th, which was causing the Google SEO to interpret that as a recently updated article, and therefore rank it higher,” she said.To exhaust all possibilities, the tech expert did the same test with several other government agencies. She crosschecked with the websites of the Department of Labor, Department of Defense, Department of the Interior and Department of Veterans Affairs and found no evidence of new time stamps.“[With Ice,] these are old articles that are now appearing at the top of the Google and Bing search results as recent headlines, where no other government agency is doing this,” she said. “As someone in tech, I would interpret that as an intentional play to get more clicks, essentially on these misleading headlines.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationGoogleAlphabetTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In all, according to Adobe, consumers spent $241.1bn in those two months.“The holiday shopping season was the most successful yet for Amazon and we appreciate the support of our customers, selling partners, and employees who helped make it so,” Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, said in astatement.Despite the better-than-expected results, Amazon fell below analyst estimates when it came to next quarter’s sales. The company said it expects sales to be between $151bn and $155.5bn, while analysts estimated $158.5bn. Shares fell in after-hours trading and then bounced back to the same price as the previous market close.Wall Street has appeared to appreciate the cost-cutting measures at Amazon over the past couple of years. Jassy has been working to tighten the belt by instituting layoffs and cuts across several departments. While 2024 had less layoffs than years past, the downsizing still appears to have had positive financial gains for Amazon’s bottom line.During Thursday’s earnings, Jassy applauded various new innovations centered on artificial intelligence at the company, including a new AI chip called the Trainium2. “These benefits are often realized by customers (and the business) several months down the road, but these are substantial enablers in this emerging technology environment,” Jassy said.Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s executive chairman, has also become friendlier with Donald Trump after years of acrimony.

In this case, multiple sites across the web include the 50-60% stat.”In a statement,Googlesaid it remade the ad to remove the error after speaking to the cheesemonger featured in the clip and asking him what he would have done.“Following his suggestion to have Gemini rewrite the product description without the stat, we updated the user interface to reflect what the business would do,” the statement added.Google’s AI tools have previously come under fire for containing errors or unhelpful advice. In May last year, its AI overviews search feature was criticisedafter it told some users to use “non-toxic glue”when they searched for “how to make cheese stick to pizza better”, while AI-generated responses said geologists recommended humans eat one rock a day.Last year, Gemini was “paused” after Googleconcededit “definitely messed up” after a slew of social media posts exposed how Gemini’s image generation tool depicting a variety of historical figures – including popes, founding fathers of the US and, most excruciatingly, German second world war soldiers –as people of colour.The images, along with Gemini chatbot responses that vacillated over whether libertarians or Stalin had caused the greater harm, prompted negative commentary from figures includingElon Musk.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingGoogleElon MuskSuper BowlNFLAlphabetnewsShareReuse this content"

Everyone knew that something bad was about to happen, but there was still a sense it might not be so bad. After all, Trump’s first four years had been less terrible than observers predicted. That was always a mistake: aspiring autocrats are most dangerous when they come to power a second time. But even those bracing for shocks could hardly have expected Trump to be so blatantly lawless and destructive once back in office. This approach – sabotage bureaucracies, violate the constitution, then see what happens – might now beapplied to education.Trump’s choice of education secretary, pro-wrestling billionaire Linda McMahon, seemed positively harmless compared with figures like the walking talking threat to public health known as Robert F Kennedy Jr. Though she hasan accusationof having enabled the sexual abuse of young boys in the wrestling world hanging over her, McMahon denies all wrongdoing.At least unlike Trump’s first education secretary, Betsy DeVos, McMahon seemed to have no particular investment in charter schools and predatory for-profit colleges. Perhaps nothing worse might happen than a push for conventional Republican policies, in particular voucher schemes thatend up helping wealthier parentswho are already sending their children to private schools.True, Trump’s executive orders also affirmed a desire for more “patriotic education”, possibly based on another amateur whitewashed American history as first formulated by his ill-fated1776 commission. But these are no more than bombastic sounding wishlists: the federal government does not control curricula and most spending on education is local or strictly determined by Congress.Yet, the surprise is that Trump has not pursued the strategy familiar from other far-right populists in power, namely what scholars call “autocratic legalism”: observe formal procedures when legislating, but violate the spirit of the law and, ultimately, the constitution, as you pursue a relentless concentration of power. Despite the Republican control of all branches of government, Trump (and Elon Musk) have opted for a strategy of chaos, sabotage and evident lawlessness: destroying USAid and quite possibly now trying the same with the Department of Education.Trump clearly feels emboldened to adopt the conduct long familiar from his businesses: just see how far you can push and see who will really sueAs lawyers have been shouting from the rooftops, departments cannot be undone by executive order; Congress needs to act. That was one reason why some observers suggested sitting back and relaxing before Trump came back into office; after all, he had threatened to kill the Department of Education before. In fact, the Republican party has been committed to the idea ever since the 1980s.Yet, Trump clearly feels emboldened to adopt the conduct long familiar from his businesses: just see how far you can push and see who will really sue. Of course, the imperative – break things, and if they were really important, someone else will put them back together – is also part of the worldview of his new Silicon Valley allies. And Trump might be forgiven for thinking that, after years of never having been held to account for anything – from allegedly inciting an insurrection to mishandling documents – he is the most unconstrained president ever.I didn’t think Trump’s second act would be that bad. Oh, how wrong I was | Arwa MahdawiRead moreCourtsmight eventually put a stop to Trump’s sabotage of the American state. His administration might just disaggregate some of the functions of the Department of Education, let private actors take over loans and the states be responsible for special education (all of which will make the most vulnerable kids worse off), plus get rid of whatever Musk happens not to like on a particular day and then declare victory. But a lot of damage will have been done, including the intimidation of plenty of administrators in colleges and universities and possibly schools, which will do Trump’s bidding even in the absence of valid laws. Florida has set the example; and in the face of legal uncertainty, many adapt andself-censor.One executive orderinstructed the justice department to initiate a compliance investigation of a private institution of higher education with an endowment of more than $1bn. Deans may well be inclined to obey in advance and abolish anything smacking of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) – which like critical race theory, has now been redefined into an all-purpose political weapon. The spending freeze of National Science Foundation grants, possibly followed by a devastating attack on the institution itselfthrough mass layoffsand the scramble to find the tiniest traces of DEI in existing projects –such as, God forbid, the word “women”– will have a majorchilling effect.Trump does not have the authority fundamentally to reorient education; but, as we have by now seen, lack of authority does not equate to refraining from power grabs. The shock-and-awe tactics could further radicalize rightwing activists; civil rights enforcement in schools and universities over which Trumpists will have controlmight be both weakened and weaponized. One thing is sure: as with USAid, Trump’s actions manage to inflict harm on many individuals and cause major national self-harm at the same time.Jan-Werner Müller is a professor of politics at Princeton University and is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But this time looks to be different. In his opening weeks, the US president has taken a flurry of actions he never attempted before, wieldingsweeping tariffsagainst the US’s neighbors, upending portions of thefederal workforce, and attempting to change constitutionally enshrinedcitizenship laws through executive order.The early signs on foreign policy are no exception. In hisinaugural address, Trump said next to nothing about the issues that have dominated US foreign policy for decades – matters of war and peace in Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Instead, he spoke of expanding US territory in the western hemisphere (and going to Mars), harking back explicitly to the 19th-century tradition of manifest destiny. Astoundingly, Trump mentioned China solely for the purpose ofaccusing it, inaccurately,of operating the Panama canal. When he turned beyond the Americas, Trump’s most telling line signaled restraint: “We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end – and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.”I didn’t think Trump’s second act would be that bad. Oh, how wrong I was | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThenMarco Rubio, the secretary of state, made even more pointed and intriguing remarks. Rubio ran for president in 2016 vowing to usher in a “new American century”, the mantra of post-cold war neoconservatives. But days ago, sitting for hisfirst lengthy interviewas America’s chief diplomat, he emphasized the need for a foreign policy grounded in the US national interest and said:“So it’s not normal for the world to simply have a unipolar power. That was not – that was an anomaly. It was a product of the end of the cold war, but eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet. We face that now with China and to some extentRussia, and then you have rogue states like Iran and North Korea you have to deal with.”For a US secretary of state to announce that the world is now “multipolar”, or is inevitably heading in that direction, is historically significant. Hillary Clinton also used the m-word in 2009 at the start of her tenure in the same role, but she invoked it less than affirmatively: Clintonprofesseda desire to move “away from a multipolar world and toward a multipartner world”. Rubio, by contrast, meant that a world of multiple poles or powers is to be accepted, not resisted. He also implied that US foreign policy had long been off course, having taken unrivaled American dominance to be a normal or necessary condition when in fact it was destined todisappear. At the end of the cold war, Rubio explained: “We were the only power in the world, and so we assumed this responsibility of sort of becoming the global government in many cases, trying to solve every problem.”The message: no longer.Still, no longer could lead down any number of roads. Read against theTrump administration’s Americas-centric start, Rubio’s comments have provoked dread – or excitement, depending on the perspective – that the United States will radically reduce its political-military role beyond the western hemisphere even as it asserts its power within the Americas.For traditional figures in Washington, the fear is that Trump 2.0 will give China and Russia a free hand to command “spheres of influence” in their regions, so long as they permit the United States to police its own sphere. For advocates of US restraint overseas, the hope is that Trump will deliver on his promises to end the wars inUkraineand the Middle East, shift more responsibility for defending Europe on to the shoulders of European allies, and seek to find a stable if competitive mode of coexistence with China. If Rubio thinks the world is now multipolar, presumably it follows that the United States should abandon the approach it pursued in the bygone age of unipolarity – a grand strategy of “primacy” or “hegemony”, as scholars call it.No one is safe from Trump’s racist agenda | Bakari T SellersRead morePerhaps. Rubio, though, was not nearly so conclusive. Throughout the interview, he referred to the governments in Moscow and Beijing in adversarial terms, which hardly suggest a willingness to grant them spheres of influence. Nor is there a straight line from acknowledging the loss of unipolarity to abandoning primacy. Even in a crowded, competitive landscape, the United States could try to remain militarily stronger than every rival, retain all its globe-spanning defense commitments, and maintain a large troop presence in Asia, Europe and the Middle East simultaneously. Those are the elements of primacy. Rubio did not renounce any of them. The United States, in short, could still pursue primacy without enjoying unipolarity.Indeed, in associating multipolarity with the existence of “multi-great powers”, Rubio may have meant to affirm the outlook of the firstTrump administration, which adopted “great power competition” as a watchword. For Trump 1.0, as for the Biden administration that followed, the rise of China and the assertion of Russia did not compel Washington to pare back its military commitments and presence. Quite the contrary. Over the two presidencies, Nato enlarged to four new countries, the US military presence in the Middle East (excluding Afghanistan) remained stable, and the United States deepened security cooperation with Ukraine, Taiwan and others.So far, the appearance of formidable rivals has done less to discipline US ambitions than to furnish US global primacy with a new rationale – to stand up to the aggressive and revisionist activities of America’s adversaries. As Rubio put it: “China wants to be the most powerful country in the world and they want to do so at our expense, and that’s not in our national interest, and we’re going to address it.”But Rubio did signal more restraint than a continuation of business as usual. Just after his remarks on multipolarity, he noted that the second world war ended 80 years ago and that “if you look at the scale and scope of destruction and loss of life that occurred, it would be far worse if we had a global conflict now.” Since the end of the cold war, US leaders have invoked the second world war almost exclusively to exhort the country to lead the world. Rubio, by contrast, did so to caution against the dangers of overreach. He continued:“You have multiple countries now who have the capability to end life on Earth. And so we need to really work hard to avoid armed conflict as much as possible, but never at the expense of our national interest. So that’s the tricky balance.”Quite so. In recent years, the risk of conflict between major powers hasgrown acute. The war in Ukraine – in which one major power is fighting directly on its borders and the other heavily arming its opponent – had no parallel during the cold war. A US-China military conflict over Taiwan would be ruinous. In a country unused to paying noticeable costs for foreign policy choices, and a world that no longer remembers the last general war, Rubio delivered a salutary message.The Guardian view on Donald Trump’s power grab: a coup veiled by chaos | EditorialRead moreThe policy test, however, is still to come. If the new administration is serious about avoiding catastrophic wars, without exposing core US interests to great power predation, it will make a determined, sustained diplomatic effort to end the war in Ukraine and minimize the risks of escalation if initial talks do not succeed. It will explore politically difficult ways to reach a modus vivendi with China, including by offering assurances that the United States does not seek to keep Taiwan permanently separate from the mainland, a red line for Beijing.The new administration’s opening moves suggest some intention to find a more sustainable and less confrontational approach toward the world’s major powers. But if unipolarity is dead, the lure of primacy remains very much alive.Stephen Wertheim is a senior fellow in the American statecraft program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School and Catholic UniversityExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsMarco RubioRepublicansUS foreign policyChinacommentShareReuse this content"

Now it will be easier for the government to spy on AmericansTravis LeBlancThese partisan witch-hunts and firings need to stopThu 6 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 11.09 ESTShareDonald Trumpfired me on Monday from my job as a member of the bipartisan Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board – a job he nominated me for twice. Yes, I am a Democrat. He also fired every other board member who is not a registered Republican. While most Americans have never heard of our board, which oversees national security agencies such as the CIA, NSA and FBI, we should all be concerned about the undermining of an oversight agency designed by Congress to ensure that government surveillance does not infringe our privacy and civil liberties.The board I served on was created to make sure that independent bipartisan subject matter experts – such as myself and my fellow board members – could keep a close watch on the use of new national security powers presidents were given to surveil Americans after 9/11. Our job was to look for abuses that threatened Americans’ privacy and freedom.Congress designed the board as an “independent agency” to keep it insulated from day-to-day politics. Members of the board must be Senate confirmed and are appointed to six-year terms so that they serve by law and design across two administrations. At least two of the five members must not be from the president’s political party, and in selecting those members the law requires that the president consult with the opposition party. That design helps to ensure that potential surveillance abuses – abuses that might be targeted at the opposition and not otherwise be known to Congress, the courts or the American public – are more difficult to hide behind invocations of national security and executive privilege.Despite Congress’s attempt to insulate the board from politics, I and other board members were fired before the end of our terms with no explanation. Our firings were clearly partisan, but Americans should not be fooled into thinking that board members have partisan agendas. I was nominated for my seat two times by Trump in his first term and confirmed by a Republican Senate. At a time when Democrats and Republicans were fleeing the federal government, I dutifully took up Trump’s call to serve in his first administration.My top priority while at the board was oversight of the FBI – a concern that I am confident the president shares. And since taking office, I have been criticized by Joe Biden’s national security council and earned praise from Freedom caucus Republicans for proposing reforms to ensure that federal surveillance activities are not being abused to spy on American citizens.The result of these historically unprecedented firings at our agency is that a board intentionally designed by Congress to be staffed on a bipartisan basis across administrations is now exclusively staffed by a single Republican. That Republican has previously aligned herself withMerrick Garlandand the Biden administration in defending warrantless surveillance by the FBI on average Americans – a practice that a federal court in New York ruled unconstitutional last week. And worse, the board (which requires a quorum of three members to do anything) will no longer engage in any oversight of presidential surveillance of American citizens. In other words, by firing us, the president has extinguished independent oversight of surveillance activities of the exact kind that plagued Trump and Carter Page in past years.The same story is being repeated throughout the executive branch. Trump has fired many of the inspectors general whose job is to prevent government waste, fraud and abuse. He’s fired the heads of other independent agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations Board, with many others likely to follow. And he’s undertaking a swift purge of the civil service to get rid of anyone not perceived as sufficiently loyal.These partisan witch-hunts and firings need to stop. Congress creates independent agencies and insulates civil servants from partisan firings for a reason. They provide critical non-partisan expertise to Congress, the president and the American people on a wide range of critical issues from privacy, to securities regulation, to monetary policy, to transportation safety, to protecting American consumers from corporate abuses, to the storage of radioactive materials. If this week’s actions by the president become the new normal – and partisanship overrides Congress’s design and becomes the only criteria for holding a position in a federal agency – then our financial markets will be more volatile, our consumer products more hazardous, our skies and railroads more dangerous, and our civil liberties and constitutional rights less secure.Travis LeBlanc was a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board member from 2019 to January 2025.

On the trail withDonald Trump, the billionaire Elon Musk, who financed Trump’s campaign to the tune of about $250m, pledged to cut $2tn from the federal budget, a project that promised to wreck the economy, destroy the nation’s credit, eliminate programs and institutions that structure people’s lives and create an international economic and leadership vacuum into which America’s rivals – namely, China – could step.This would have been ominous enough on its own. But because Musk is a narcissist and a nerd – because he insists on discarding solemnity and being ostentatiously irreverent and carefree as he destroys people’s lives – he named his new project the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, a juvenile reference to a years-old internet meme featuring a shiba inu.It is under this idiotic banner that Musk has upended the American system of government, seizing an unprecedented, unelected and seemingly wholly unaccountable degree of personal power. Less than three weeks into the Trump restoration, Doge is well under way.The Guardian view on Donald Trump’s power grab: a coup veiled by chaos | EditorialRead moreThe group is not a government department; Musk is not a cabinet member and has not been subjected to a Senate confirmation process. But he now reportedly has an office in the West Wing, along with one in the Eisenhower executive office building across the street. At his direction, a small group of coders and engineers – men reported to be aged between 19 and 25 years old – are fanning out across federal agencies, seizing control of their sensitive data and making proposals for massive cuts.Just days after Trump’s inauguration, Musk reportedly sent an email to all 2 million federal employees – subject line Fork in the Road – encouragingthem to resignahead of anticipated mass firings. Musk reportedly offered workers a buyout of seven months’ pay; it’s doubtful whether any of those who take him up on the offer will ever receive it.Musk and his young followers have moved to shutter specific programs that they deem wasteful – including those whose funds have been allocated by Congress – and to shutter whole departments. He has declared the closure of USAid, America’s foreign aid agency, and is reportedly looking to eliminate much of the Department of Education and the Department of Labor, along with privatizing theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He has seized control of the treasury, and specifically the treasury’s payment system, granting himself a personal line-item veto on all government spending. He also has gained access to reams of private and sensitive data and has reportedly downloaded much of it on to private servers. He can access bank accounts, medical histories, income and debt records. If he cared to, he could look up your social security number.No one elected Musk and very little of what he is doing is legal. It is Congress, not some random rich guy, who is granted the power of the purse, because the citizens deserve to have a say, through their elected representatives, in how the government spends their tax dollars. Federal civil servants are protected by law from purges, because the federal bureaucracy is supposed to serve the people of the United States, not to merely function as courtiers and enforcers of whim for some entitled foreign billionaire who nobody has ever voted for.There is a chance that Musk will be told to stop his unconstitutional dismantling of the federal government by a court order, one he might even obey; there is a chance that he will get scared, declare a hasty victory and back off. But that chance looks more and more remote. Musk, now, has seized control of many of the organs of state. There also does not seem to be any way to stop him.Trump critics have long predicted an oncoming rift between Musk and Trump, but it’s not clear, exactly, that it is from Trump that Musk is deriving his power: his gutting of federal agencies and slashing of federal expenditures seems to be coming from his own preferences and impulses, not as any direction from the man who is nominally the president.It may be Trump, that is, who sits in the Oval Office, and it may be Trump who takes to television every few days to sign yet another executive order seeking to punish and humiliate trans people. But it is Musk who controls government operations and federal spending, and so it is Musk who is running the country. The constitutional order, now, is largely window dressing. The reality is that a foreign billionaire is running the state through a shadow government, and that his power has no formal check.Another humiliation of our era: that to merely state what is happening sounds hyperbolic, even unhinged. Musk, after all, is such a morally small man – so transparent in his corrupt self-interest, so childish in his peevish self-regard – that it is hard to countenance him as such a profound agent of history.He represents not so much the banality as the imbecility of evil: how shallow and vacuous it is. Yet Musk’s personal, private seizure of state power has thrown real doubt on whether the US constitution is still in effect. How can it be, if he upends its demands so heedlessly, and with such impunity? How can it be, if the power of the people’s elected representatives can simply be wished away by a man rich enough to buy anyone?For a long time now, it has been clear that America was slipping out of a liberal democratic mode of governance and into something more vulgar and less accountable, something more like a privatized racket for the rich that extracts from and punishes the people, but never responds to their will. We knew this was coming.

The president, as you will know, has decided the US should justtake over the Gaza Strip. As for the Palestinians who are inconveniently there at the moment? According to Trump, they can just be moved somewhere else. They can be dumped in Jordan or Egypt or Saudi Arabia. They won’t mind. Those Arabs are all the same anyway.It’s not clear, by the way, exactly how many Palestinians are actually left to be moved. Fifteen months ago there were an estimated 2.1 million people in Gaza. The official death toll is nowalmost 62,000 peoplebut this is very likely a grossunderestimatethat doesn’t account for all the “indirect deaths” from disease and starvation. Writing in the Guardian inSeptember, Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, noted that according to an extrapolation of one estimate published in the Lancet medical journal, the death toll would be estimated at about 335,500 in total.Trump’s Gaza plan has staggered the world. Did he mean it? For now, that doesn’t matter | Martin KettleRead moreIt seems Trump might agree with that estimate. While waxing lyrical about his planned crimes against humanity, Trump said “we’re talking about probably 1.7 million, maybe 1.8 million” people inGazawho would need to be moved. If only reporters at Trump’s press conferences would ask him if he knows exactly how many people are dead, eh? However, it would seem that much of the US press simply aren’t that interested.There is a lot of interest in Trump’s plans to redevelop Gaza, however. The word “shocking” has been bandied around a lot to describe these very Trumpian real estate fantasies. And, yes, the fact that the president is being so blunt, so open, about what he wants to do is shocking. But the idea that the US andIsraelmight want to get rid of all the Palestinians in the strip should hardly come as a shock to anyone. This, after all, is in effect what Israel’s politicians and pundits, along with Israel’s supporters, have been saying all along: they want to make Gaza unliveable and get all the Palestinians out.In October 2023, for example, Ma Gen Giora Eiland, who is highly influential,wrotein an Israeli paper: “The State of Israel has no choice but to turn Gaza into a place that is temporarily or permanently impossible to live in.” In anotherarticle, Eiland wrote: “Gaza will become a place where no human being can exist.”Other people have been very open that they want certain types of human beings to exist in Gaza – just not Palestinians.Last March, for example, Jared Kushner salivated about the prospect of buildingwaterfront propertyin Gaza and said Israel should move Palestinians into the Negev desert while it “cleans up” the strip. Settler activists have also been scouting locations for Jewishsettlements in North Gaza.So, again, if you’re shocked by Trump’s comments about Gaza then you simply haven’t been paying attention. There are hundreds of documented statements from high-profile Israeli figures calling for the complete destruction of Gaza. And a growing list of genocide experts and human rights groups have termed what Israel has been doing in Gaza a “genocide”.Speaking to me last November, for example, thegenocide expert Omer Bartovsaid that, from the very beginning, you could see “there was a concerted effort, not only to move the population over and over again, but also to destroy everything that makes the life of a group possible.”Not many foreigners have been allowed into Gaza to see that destruction for themselves, but those that have gone in come out saying much the same thing.Last November, for example, Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, returned from a trip to Gaza and told BBC Radio the situation in the north was a “besiegement within a besiegement”. Egeland stressed: “This is not self-defence. This is the systematic destruction of Gaza.”Now that the destruction of Gaza is complete, it seems like forced displacement is about to begin. On Wednesday, after some backlash from the international community, Trump’s team did a little bit ofbacktrackingand suggested the displacement might not be permanent. “The president has made it clear that they need to be temporarily relocated out of Gaza,” Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary, said during a White House briefing.But history would suggest there would be nothing temporary about the displacement. My grandparents, who had to flee in 1948 from Haifa, were buried in the West Bank; my father was born there. He left in 1967, however, and does not have the right to return. It seems inevitable that any Palestinians leaving Gaza won’t have the right to return either.Palestinians have a clear message for Donald Trump over Gaza: ‘We are here, we won’t leave’ | Yara HawariRead morePerhaps what is most disgusting about all this is the gaslighting; Trump’s attempts to dress up his plans for forced relocation as some sort of act of humanitarianism. On the contrary, it is violation of international law. While it looks a hell of a lot like ethnic cleansing, I should note that that particular term is quite complex.There are “certain complications with ethnic cleansing itself as a phrase”, Dr John Reynolds, associate professor at the School of Law & Criminology at Maynooth University in Ireland, told me. In legal terms, “the type of mass expulsion or displacement that ethnic cleansing commonly signifies is a violation of international law, but it is criminalised as the war crime and crime against humanity of forcible population transfer”.In simple terms, however, Reynolds thinks that Trump is clearly calling for a crime against humanity. Whether it is best to call that ethnic cleansing or forced displacement is somewhat more complicated. But, again, what Trump wants to do clearly violates international law and would be a crime against humanity.Will Trump actually get what he wants? Who knows. But the fact that Trump is even voicing these plans, and many lawmakers are nodding along, speaks volumes about just how much Palestinians have been dehumanized.Responding to Trump’s comments, Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American member of Congress, said: “Palestinians aren’t going anywhere. This president can only spew this fanatical bullshit because of bipartisan support in Congress for funding genocide and ethnic cleansing. It’s time for my two-state solution colleagues to speak up.”Tlaib is quite right, but she should also have mentioned the media. Another reason Trump can spew this “fanatical bullshit” is because much of the western media have been complicit in dehumanizing Palestinians and normalizing what many experts have termed a genocide.They’ve been complicit in ignoring the fact that Gaza has become a graveyard for journalists. They’ve been complicit in ignoring the fact that Israel has refused foreign journalists to freely report from the strip. And they’ve been complicit in dressing up horror after horror in sanitizing, passive and obfuscatory language.Even now much of the media coverage of Trump’s comments omits the fact that just by meeting withBenjamin Netanyahu– who sat by Trump grinning like a Cheshire cat as he made his comments about Gaza – Trump is undermining international law. The international criminal court has an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister for war crimes and crimes against humanity. If Trump is allowed to execute his plans, it’s because the media helped pave the way for them. It’s beyond time for more of my colleagues in the US media to speak up.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionIsrael-Gaza warTrump administrationBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesIsraelGazacommentShareReuse this content"

Threats of deportation to international students who engage in legitimate protest; expansionist designs on Panama and Greenland and proposals to take over the total and forcible displacement of Palestinians in Gaza from their land are announced in quick succession. In each case, Trump makes the declaration as a show of power, testing to see whether it can take effect. The executive orders can be stopped by courts, but the deportation of immigrants has already begun, as has the re-opening of thegrotesque camps of Guantánamo.Amassing authoritarian power depends in part on a willingness of the people to believe in the power exercised. In some cases, Trump’s declarations are meant to test the waters, but in other cases, the outrageous claim is its own accomplishment. He defies shame and legal constraints in order to show his capacity to do so, which displays to the world a shameless sadism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Oh, how wrong I was | Arwa MahdawiRead moreThe exhilarations of shameless sadism incite others to celebrate this version of manhood, one that is not only willing to defy the rules and principles that govern democratic life (freedom, equality, justice), but enact these as forms of “liberation” from false ideologies and the constraints of legal obligations. An exhilarated hatred now parades as freedom, while the freedoms for which many of us have struggled for decades are distorted and trammeled as morally repressive “wokeism”.The sadistic glee at issue here is not just his; it depends on being communicated and widely enjoyed in order to exist – it is a communal and contagious celebration of cruelty. Indeed, the media attention it garners feeds the sadistic spree. It has to be known and seen and heard, this parade of reactionary outrage and defiance. And that is why it is no longer a simple matter of exposing hypocrisy that will serve us now. There is no moral veneer that must be stripped away. No, the public demand for the appearance of morality on the part of the leader is inverted: his followers thrill to the display of his contempt for morality, and share it.The shameless display of hatred, the contempt for rights, the willingness to strip people of their rights to equality and freedom by banning “gender” and its challenges to the binary system of sex (denying the existence and rights of trans, intersex and non-binary people), destroying DEI programs meant to empower those who have suffered enduring and systemic discrimination; forcible deportations of immigrants, and calls for complete dispossession of those who have survived, traumatized, the genocidal actions inGaza.If we continue to be gripped with outrage and stilled by stupefaction by each day’s new proclamation, we will fail to discern what links themRaphael Lemkin, the Polish-Jewish lawyer who coined the term “genocide”, made clear that it includes “a coordinated plan aimed at destruction of the essential foundations of life of national groups … it may be accomplished by wiping out all basis of personal security, liberty, health and dignity.” Indeed, forcible transfer of children is the fifth punishable act under the genocide convention adopted in 1948.Not all forms of Trump’s rights-stripping belong to the category of genocide, but many of them express fascist passions. Denying rights to healthcare, legal recognition and rights of expressive freedoms for trans, intersex and non-binary people attacks the very foundations of their lives. Even the conservative supreme court found that discrimination against trans and gender non-conforming people constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex (Bostock v Clayton, 2020).Hence, it makes no sense to say that trans rights threaten sex-based law: they belong to that law, and ought to be protected by it. Rounding up immigrants from schools and homes, forcibly deporting them to detention centers and ripping away their rights to due process shows not only clear contempt for those communities, but for constitutional democracy itself. The threat to birthright citizenship defies a basic constitutional protection and positions Trump as above constitutional rule and the balance of powers.If we continue to be gripped with outrage and stilled by stupefaction by each day’s new proclamation, we will fail to discern what links them. To be gripped by his statements is precisely the aim of their utterance. We are in some ways in its thrall when it captures and paralyzes us. While there is every reason to be outraged, we cannot let that outrage flood us and stop our minds. For this is a moment to grasp the fascist passions that fuel this shameless grab for authoritarian powers.Those who celebrate his defiance and sadism are as claimed by his logic as those who are paralyzed with outrage. Perhaps it is time to stand apart from these passions to see how they work, but also to find passions of our own: the desire for a freedom equally shared; for an equality that makes good on democratic promises; to repair and regenerate the earth’s living processes; to accept and affirm the complexity of our embodied lives; to imagine a world in which government supports health and education for all, where we all live without fear, knowing that our interconnected lives are equally valuable.Judith Butler is Distinguished Professor in the Graduate School, UC Berkeley.Butler’s latest book is Who’s Afraid ofGender, published by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux (US) and Penguin(UK).Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionTrump administrationGenderUS politicsUS immigrationRaceTransgendercommentShareReuse this content"

He should push for a Palestinian state insteadThu 6 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 12.22 ESTShareDonald Trump’sproposal to expelall 2 million or more Palestinians from Gaza is so mind-bogglingly outrageous that it seems designed to stun us into paralyzed acquiescence. It is the latest example of the US president’s tendency to normalize the unthinkable, to bring ideas that were rightly considered beyond the pale and force them into the realm of policy discussion. Yet there are plenty of reasons to overcome our shock and reject this appalling scheme.It does have its supporters. The Israeli far right is salivating at the proposition. It has longsoughtto “solve” the Palestinian problem by getting rid of the Palestinians. No wonder Benjamin Netanyahu, sitting next to Trump during their White House press conference, could barely contain hisglee.Palestinians have a clear message for Donald Trump over Gaza: ‘We are here, we won’t leave’ | Yara HawariRead moreMoreover, Gaza in all likelihood would be only a first step. If such ethnic cleansing ever became acceptable, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem would surelyfollow. Even the so-called Arab population of Israel might not be exempt. Far from the “Free Palestine” chants that are heard these days on college campuses, the area from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River might become Palestinian-free. That would allow Israel finally to accomplish its goal of being both a Jewish state and a democracy.Lest we forget, forcibly removing people en masse from their homeland is awar crimeand a crime against humanity. It would invite charges by the international criminal court. It would flout the recentjudgmentby the international court of justice upholding Palestinians’ right to self-determination. It is something that no democratic leader should countenance, but Trump is, obviously, no ordinary leader.Trump tried to dress up his proposal as an act of benevolence, noting the devastation of Gaza and the dangers of unexploded ordnance. But that destruction was primarily the result of Israel’s indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on Palestinian residences and neighborhoods. Suchwar crimes, and arguablygenocide, are not rectified by another huge war crime.Moreover, Trump was not proposing a brief interim relocation while reconstruction proceeds. He envisioned Palestinians’permanentdisplacement: anotherNakba. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, tried to walk that back, suggesting that Trump meant the displacement to be onlytemporary, but that’s not what Trumpsaid. Instead, he envisions building the “Riviera of the Middle East” and then repopulating Gaza with the “citizens of the world”, by which he clearly means anyone but Palestinians.Rubio called Trump’s plan “very generous”, but few Palestinians would see it that way. It is as if someone would reduce Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence to rubble and then “generously” offer to rebuild it on the condition that Trump never return.Trump wants Jordan and Egypt to take the Palestinians, but they both understandablydismissthe idea. Quite apart from not wanting to be complicit in such an enormous crime, they have their own reasons. More thanhalfof Jordanians are of Palestinian descent – a source of demographicsensitivityfor the country’s Hashemite rulers – and the Jordanian government has long rejected arguments that it could become “Palestine” while Israel emptied the occupied territory of Palestinians. Meanwhile, Egyptfearsthat a large influx of Palestinians would burden its already-sputtering economy and reignite a simmering insurgency in the northern Sinai.Trump’s plan, of course, raises the question: why not Israel? More than80% of the Palestinians in Gaza are refugees, their families having been forced from their homes in what is now Israel during its 1948 war of independence. Why should they be forced to move to foreign countries rather than allowed to return to their ancestral homes? Indeed, Israel does not allow most Gaza residents tomoveto even the West Bank or East Jerusalem – a key element of the apartheid that it maintains in the occupied territories.Or for that matter, why not the United States? It is far wealthier, much bigger, and better able to resettle Palestinian refugees, but that would run counter to Trump’s anti-immigrant fixation.Trump’s Gaza plan has staggered the world. Did he mean it? For now, that doesn’t matter | Martin KettleRead moreWho will pay for the billions upon billions of dollars required to rebuild Gaza? It should be Israel as a matter of reparations, but no one is holding their breath for that. As TrumpcutsUS foreign aid commitments, he seems to hope that the Arab Gulf states would pick up the tab, but why would they rebuild this Palestinian enclave without Palestinians? And why would their publics, even given the severe restrictions on freedom of expression under the Gulf monarchies, countenance investment in a real estate project on what they rightly see as a central part of the Palestinian homeland?Trump’s plan clashes with his desire to be a master dealmaker. Trump wants all of the hostages freed, but why would Hamas agree if that were just a prelude to mass deportation for the Palestinian people? Trump hopes to persuade the Saudi government to normalize relations with Israel, but it hasinsistedon a Palestinian state as a prerequisite, includingshortly afterTrump’s proposal. Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, all key US allies, are alsopressingfor a state.If Trump wants to be disruptive, as is his wont, there are more productive ways to proceed. Netanyahu has long refused to countenance a Palestinian state, and he has gotten away with his recalcitrance because he always knew that the US far fight – the pro-Israel Aipac lobby, the Christian evangelical supporters ofIsrael, and their Republican party allies – would have his back.But if Trump were to insist on a state, there would be few left in the United States, Israel’s primary benefactor, to whom the Israeli prime minister could turn to second his refusal. He might ultimately have to accept a Palestinian state living side-by-side with an Israeli one as the only just solution to the longstanding conflict. If Trump could pull that off, he might well merit the Nobel peace prize that he has long coveted but felt he was unfairlydenied.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

Those words carry a heavy moral burden, and so they should. Jurors hold another human being’s life in their hands, and must be convinced there is no other rational explanation for the facts presented to them than the defendant’s guilt. But what happens when those facts start to shimmer and blur, to multiply and divide confusingly before your eyes?Lucy Letby is officially Britain’s worst serial child killer, serving 15 life sentences for murdering seven babies and trying to kill seven more. But her case has become as troubling to some medical professionals as it is attractive to conspiracy theorists because of the stubbornly persistent doubts at its heart. There are things we may never know for sure about those babies’ last moments.Yet justice – for both Letby and the poor bereaved parents – requires a verdict nonetheless.This week, the Tory MP David Davis, who is convinced Letby is a woman wronged,hosted a press conferencewith Prof Dr Shoo Lee, a retired Canadian neonatologist whose work was cited by the prosecution in support of its case that Letby killed some of the babies by injecting air into them. Lee’s argument that his research on telltale signs of so-called air embolisms was misinterpreted hasalready been consideredand rejected by the court of appeal – it concluded that the unusual skin colouring his paper describes wasn’t the only diagnostic clue the prosecution relied on – but Lee doesn’t give up easily.Having assembled a panel of 14 undeniably eminent doctors to review the babies’ medical notes, he travelled from Canada to announce that Letby could not be a murderer because his panel had found no murders. All the babies, he argued, died of natural causes or “bad medical care” on a unit he felt would have been shut down as unsafe had it been in Canada.For the parents, it must be torture. One mothertold the Daily Mailshe had found “every aspect of what they are doing” profoundly disrespectful, including the drama of staging a press conference: “This isn’t a show, this is our real lives.” It would be unspeakably cruel to raise doubts unnecessarily in families who will be haunted by them.Yet if Lee is right, then Letby has been doomed to die in jail for something she didn’t do. When even the ex-director of public prosecutions Ken Macdonald – hitherto astern critic of bystanderschallenging the Letby verdict without understanding the evidence –begins arguingthat such is the public unease that the Criminal Cases Review Commission “will want to look at this very carefully”, something is afoot. This is no longer just about one conviction, but public confidence in everything from the safety of maternity units to theongoing public inquiryinto the Letby case, the effective functioning of the appeal courts and the use of medical evidence in trials. It has become a kind of test case for justice itself.Are lay juries the right people to assess incredibly complex medical evidence like this? I’ve never forgotten reporting years ago on a coroner’s inquest involving a jury, where it became obvious from the questions they were asking the coroner that some jurors were hopelessly lost. It was uncomfortable for everybody watching but agonising for the parents of the child involved, reliant for a verdict on people who didn’t seem to understand the evidence. To be blunt, that’s probably where jury cases end up more often than anyone wants to think, because the alternative to juries with all their human flaws is losing the right to trial by your peers. But this system requires expert witnesses who can boil technical evidence down into clear and simple terms, and therein lies a risk.In their forensic account of the trial,Unmasking Lucy Letby, the BBC journalists Jonathan Coffey and Judith Moritz describe the perplexing case of baby O, where the original pathologist and the prosecution’s pathologist disagreed about his cause of death. The authors commissioned a third pathologist to adjudicate, who promptly disagreed with both the others. Though it’s perfectly normal for good scientists to disagree in good faith, their anonymous expert added that “courts want people who are more absolute”, so the same very confident people get asked again and again. And since “everyone knows who the hawks are and who the doves are”, lawyers soon learn who to call, depending on the answer they need.The crucial safeguard remains the defence’s right to call its own medical experts to challenge the prosecution’s, and the biggest puzzle of this case remains that Letby’s high-powered defence team didn’t do so. They commissioned a report from neonatologist Dr Mike Hall, challenging the diagnosis in several of the cases, and drew on it in cross-examination. But they didn’t get Hall to testify, for reasons he has never understood. Instead, they focused on discrediting the prosecution’s lead witness,retired paediatrician Dr Dewi Evans, accusing him of being dogmatic and making facts fit his theory – arguments rejected by both trial judge and the appeal courts. (Letby’s new barrister, Mark McDonald, is arguing that Evans’s credibility is damaged because he changed his mind about the causes of three babies’ deaths, criticism Evans rejects as “unsubstantiated, unfounded, inaccurate”.)What is the new challenge to the evidence used to convict Lucy Letby?Read moreThe case for a miscarriage of justice would look overwhelming by now if Lee’s findings perfectly matched Hall’s misgivings, but unhelpfully it’s not that simple: in some cases, more experts seem to mean more competing accounts. How do you “follow the science” when it leads in circles?This case was never, of course, just about science. Letby was the nurse that death seemed to follow around, the only one present for every incident Evans identified as suspicious: the death rate plummeted when she was, at colleagues’ insistence, removed from the ward. As Moritz and Coffey conclude, it’s as hard to argue definitively for her innocence as for her guilt. Even Hall told them he couldn’t say whether she was culpable.But he also pointed out that strictly speaking, that’s not the question: it’s whether Lucy Letby had the fair trial to which both the guilty and the innocent are entitled, and in his view she did not. Did the jury really hear the facts, and nothing but the facts? Until that question is answered, doubts both reasonable and unreasonable cannot be laid to rest.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now Europe must stop placating themThu 6 Feb 2025 11.22 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 11.25 ESTShareDonald Trump’s proposal to evict 2 million Palestinians from Gaza is an unashamed declaration of support for ethnic cleansing. As so often, he seems ready to ignore moral and legal codes alike. “Deportation or forcible transfer of population” is listed in the Rome statute of the international criminal court as a crime against humanity. And yet a US president has put that idea on the table. Trump insists this would be in everybody’s interest. According to him, Palestinians would not want to return to their homes. “I have heard that Gaza has been very unlucky for them,” he recently said. The population is, in Trump’s words, “living in hell”, with “death and destruction and rubble and demolished buildings falling all over”. He made no mention of Israel’s responsibility for that death and destruction and rubble.More than 30 years ago, during the early months of the bloody Bosnian war that I had been reporting on as the eastern Europe editor of the Independent, the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadžić, explained to me that the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim population that was then under way was, in fact,doing the Bosniansa favour. “We let them go,” Karadžić explained with a smile, “with their luggage and everything.” Like Karadžić, Trump does not hide the fact that Palestinians who are forced to abandon their homes would have no choice in the matter. Sitting next to Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump suggested: “I don’t think they’re going to tell me no.”In 2019, Israeli election posters boasted of Netanyahu’s friendship with Trump, showing pictures of the two smiling men together. The Israeli prime minister praised the US president for “the kind of thinking that will reshape the Middle East and bring peace”. Netanyahu’s own perspectives on peace are questionable. Only two months ago, a panel of judges at the international criminal courtunanimously confirmed a requestmade six months before that by the chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, for the issue of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes against humanity, in connection with murder, starvation and intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population. (Khan also requested indictments against Hamas leaders, for the brutal and lawless attacks of 7 October.)Trump is not alone in rolling out the red carpet for someone wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes. Trump’s old friend Kim Jong-un last year defied the court by proudly welcoming Vladimir Putin to Pyongyang. But Trump takes his loathing of justice to another level. The US president wants to impose sanctions on the ICC in order to prevent it from doing its job in “balancing the scales” of justice; his ultimate goal appears to be to weaken or destroythe court itself.Trump talked of Gaza as a “Riviera of the Middle East”, thus building on his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s earlier musings about the “very valuable” potential of Gaza’s “waterfront property”. A Baedeker travel guide published in 1943 on the Nazi-occupied territories of eastern Europe boasted that some of the most attractive towns and cities in the region were nowjudenfrei, “Jew-free”. The “very valuable” Gaza real estate that gets Trump and his son-in-law so excited (and for whicharchitectural sketcheshave even been prepared)–would presumably be “Palestinian-free”.The sanest voices in Israel decry such madness – most obviously on behalf of the Palestinians, but also on behalf of Israel’s own future peace and stability. As Yasmin Levy summarised inHaaretz: “Trump’s Gaza fantasy sends Israeli rightwing pundits into rapturous delirium.”Trump’s proposals are obviously unreal, not least since he has no workable suggestion for where 2 million Palestinians should be transferred. And yet, even the discussion of such inhuman and lawless ideas only piles on the instability in the region.Netanyahu is the problem, not the solution, even if Trump refuses to acknowledge this. But it is not just Trump who has reacted with indignation on Netanyahu’s behalf. European governments, despite being co-founders of the ICC, have been reluctant to accept their obligation to arrest Netanyahuif he sets foot on European soil. European governments seem more eager to placate the dangerous bully than to confront him. It shouldn’t be left to smaller parties such as Britain’s opposition Liberal Democrats to describe the proposals as dangerous. While the latest statements by Trump are deranged, they can’t be ignored. Fudged language becomes impossible if a leading ally proposes, endorses or commits serious crimes.Steve Crawshaw is author ofProsecuting the Powerful: War Crimes and the Battle for JusticeDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was the morning after a late night with family. I was weary. Doubtless dehydrated. I’d had three strong coffees and no breakfast when I set out much later in the morning than usual for a standard five or six-kilometre jaunt with Olive the collie-cross.About half an hour in I realised I’d forgotten to take a daily medication. No harm, I thought. I’d take it when I got home, as I’d done once or twice before.My study is a bibliophile’s breakfast, the house is overrun. It’s time for the great book culling to begin | Paul DaleyRead moreAbout halfway across a long bridge, the glare stinging my eyes (in my weariness I’d forgotten sunnies and just had my Collingwood football club cap – always guaranteed to get a scowl from the many wearing Sydney Swans caps), I stopped to rewind the audiobook I was holiday-listening to – Elizabeth Strout’s wonderful Tell Me Everything.I felt suddenly woozy and very thirsty. The ground seemed to shimmer, mirage-like, when I refocused on it from my phone. The dog pulled on her lead. I staggered forward, tripped and went arse over, breaking the fall with my right elbow. Olive yelped.Cyclists and joggers had to swerve. People went “oohh”. I mean, a whole lot of people went really “oooooohhhhh”.It seemed like nothing to me. I was quickly sitting, the dog squatting on my lap alternately licking the blood from my elbow and growling at the many concerned witnesses who were asking me if I was OK and what had happened. I had to pat Olive, to calm her and let her know I was OK.“It’s OK – I’m fine. Thanks. I just kind of … tripped,” I insisted.More and more people stopped to look. But mostly they all wanted to know if I was OK. The passing traffic slowed.It wasa scene. I don’t like scenes. I don’t want to be at the centre of them. Ever. But here I was.“What happened?” a cyclist asked, one of the many worried people now circled above me, brows furrowed. “I don’t know – what’s wrong with him?” someone else said.“He had a fall. He was walking fast the other way and he just went down. Like ooof!”“Is he OK?”“Yes, I’m OK,” I said. “Thank you. I just fell is all. I’m going to get up now.”“Noooo,” came a collective chorus. “Don’t. Get. Up.”“Why not – I’m absolutely fine,” I said.I sometimes forget about how my local community is actually made up of other actual people and not just humans attached to dogs whose names I know“I’m calling an ambulance,” a woman said. “Right now.” She dialled 000.The chorus: “Yes. Good idea.”“Please don’t,” I said. “I’m good, really. I don’t need an ambulance.”Next I heard her say into the phone, “I don’t know what’s wrong with him – I think he had a fall. He seems OK … yes, actually, he looks not so old, in OK shape …” (Bless that woman.)“I just fell – too much coffee. Late night. You know,” I said.Next came a series of questions intended, I now realise, to test my acuity. Where did I live? I gave the correct address. What’s with the Collingwood cap? I explained that it was kind of like being unable to choose your family.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsWho’s the current prime minister?“Albo. For the time being.”People nodded consensus. “Yeah – I think he’s definitely OK.” They were talking about me.(This reminds me of when the gerontologist asked my then 86-year-old dad, then succumbing to dementia, in late 2007, who the PM was. “Unfortunately it’s John Howard,” Dad responded, “until we kick him out of office next week.” He was right!)Someone kindly offered me water. It helped a lot.A man gave me a hand up. This convinced the woman to cancel that ambulance. I stood against the railing. The dog, both paws protectively on my foot, looked up anxiously. The crowd dissipated.Olive and I doubled back across the bridge. We walked together with a posse of those who’d stopped to help me. One bloke made me key his number into my phone in case it happened again. Another gave me more water.One woman (a nurse) made me vow to go to the doctor. I did. I’ve done all the tests. I’m fine. Though I do feel oddly mortal in a way I’ve never quite done before, having always enjoyed robust good health, high energy levels and – being a bloke – generally considering myself bulletproof.I’m told there is an age at which falling over or tripping or whatever becomes “having a fall”. I did have a significant birthday last year. But I don’t feel nearly ready for that.Amid the odd, sometimes socially isolated pattern that is my life – work at home with my dogs, walk many kilometres alone daily, get lost in writing and books and domestic stuff, otherwise exercise alone in the neighbourhood – I sometimes forget about how my local community is actually made up of other actual people and not just humans attached to dogs whose names I know.Despite the world having done its best to promote its unfathomable capacity for human heartlessness and cruelty these past couple of years, the random kindness and concern I was shown was deeply touching, societally connecting – and even spiritually nourishing.It made me recheck my immense good fortune and, not least, my faith in the goodness of others and kindness as an end in itself.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsAgeingOpinionDogscommentShareReuse this content"

But there is too much gloss, when so many people are still sufferingThu 6 Feb 2025 08.42 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 11.16 ESTShareNow she’s an opera. Yet another myth-making apotheosis lifts Margaret Thatcher to iconic realms, crafting for her an image recalling Elizabeth I. Historian Dominic Sandbrook is writing the libretto of her story, as one Thatcher tribute act trips over the next. This week sawJames Graham’s Brian and Maggiedrama about an interview that helped tip her towards her downfall. Next week, Radio 4 brings usWhen Larry met Maggie, Tim Walker’s play imagining scenes when Laurence Olivier coached the ingenue education secretary in the art of wooing and even seducing audiences.This week marksthe 50th anniversary of Thatcher’s electionas leader of her party. I started counting but lost track of the myriad actors who have played her, some of the greatest of our time.Harriet Walter was magnificent, as ever. So wereGillian AndersonandMeryl Streep.Lesley Manvillewas just as fine, as wasPatricia Hodge, and I’m sure Frances Barber will be next week in Walker’s radio play. None but royalty of stage and screen are fit to play her.Many writers of these dramas are just as excellent, magnetically drawn time and again to delve into the nature of the leader who made herself a legend. Like Elizabeth I, she styled herself into the embodiment of an emblem, with the big gold hair, pussy bows, sculpted shoulders, well-trained deepened voice using words by her playwright speech writer, crafted into an image instantly recognisable from afar.The problem is that good writers and good actors will produce a human drama of depth, subtlety and intelligence in a character, if flawed, an audience must feel for. That’s what a work of imagination requires. Writers will instinctively lean into her well-polished creation as the almost rags-to-riches grocer’s daughter above the shop in Grantham, the many rejections to get selected for seats, the snobbery and sexism of her party’s grandees, who she triumphed over to sweep them to three great victories. But she was not quite such a ground-breaker as the daughter of a very typical Tory alderman, while her marriage to a multimillionaire greatly spurred on her political career. The man she ousted as leader,Edward Heath, came from a humbler background: the son of a maid and a carpenter who, after Ramsgate grammar and fighting in the second world war, knew rather more of the working classes than she did.Each piece of her life story has been honed into a drama, usually compelling: I watch them all with fascination. But plays can’t really do the stuff of politics: drama likes the rows, contests, defeats and conquests, but political issues are dry terrain, rapidly passed over for spicier themes. The inevitable result is that even astute and politically savvy writers such as James Graham end up whitewashing what Thatcher and her politics actually did to Britain. This 50-year marker comes at a melancholy time when her actions are rebounding on the country with a vengeance. Polls show the policies she was most famed for are those most voters now bitterly regret. Let’s look at her legacy.View image in fullscreenMargaret Thatcher at Wistow colliery, Selby, in 1980.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyThe one that most upends her claims to a grocer’s daughter’s thrift is her squandering of North Sea oil proceeds that came onstream just as she arrived in No 10. After too-cheap privatisation, she spent the tax income;had she saved like Norway, her bequest would be a sovereign wealth fund of hundreds of billions.She inherited a countrymoving markedly towards economic equality, but her 1980s policies caused top pay and wealth to soar, while the bottom deciles fell back. Inequality has stayed at that high level ever since. Her “big bang” blew the lid off grotesque financial earnings, meaning fortunes for a few, rather than economic stability. Savaging the unions,she caused a sharp drop in wages’ share of GDP. Industry and manufacturing were downgraded. Winning the bitter battle with the miners, due to NUM leader Arthur Scargill’s tragic mishandling, was not enough: she punished mining communities, leaving them to rot without other industry or training, leaving social scars that are still deep 40 years on.Other parties envied her popular sale of council homes to tenants at knock-down prices as a stroke of political genius to propel her property-owning democracy. Now with 2m council homes sold, many owned by landlords charging astronomical rents,home ownership in England has fallen from 71%at its peak to 65%, moving further from reach of young renters, with the country trapped in a housing crisis.Who now would celebrate her privatisations of water, energy, Britoil and a host of public goods at well below market price? A total of£5bn in water debts was written off, with natural monopolies never constrained by weak regulators. Railways were privatised by her successor, following her creed. All this failure on an epic scale has taken decades and serial bankruptcies to acknowledge.Bus privatisation outside London led to a welter of companies cutting routes and pay, higher fares, fewer buses and fewer people riding them. She may not actually have saidanyone on a bus aged more than 26is a failure, but that summarised her attitude.Outsourcing all manual and much administrative work from national and local authorities was done by her fiat. Lower pay and conditions were the only way the likes of Serco and Capita could profit from taking on these services, another motor driving inequality.The1982 Falklands war saved her from the lowest ever polling for a prime minister. It was a majestic success to send a flotilla to the other end of the earth and vanquish what looked like a powerfully armed Argentine dictator. However, praise for her recklessness is like applauding a child for surviving running across a road.The poll tax that brought her down was not an aberration, but sprang from a profound belief in flat taxes, as she cut top tax rates. That idea of equal taxes she had wisely kept in check until then.Most of these things inevitably slide away from plays and films. There’s a risk they will slip from national memory, as Conservative thinktanks, such as Policy Exchange, reminisce this anniversary week about “her philosophy and vision … her courage”. They can’t claim economic success for her except for the rich, with no improved national productivity.Lest we forget, the things she did are doing us immeasurable harm right now. She is not history and certainly not entertainment. She is the unfortunate lived present.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsMargaret ThatcherOpinionConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a motif repeated across a nation stripped to the boneThu 6 Feb 2025 07.47 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 10.25 ESTShareOne of the fundamentals of modern jail craft is the idea that it’s hard to convince prisoners that you care about their welfare if they’re living in squalid conditions. This has been understood for years, with fluctuating amounts of buy-in from politicians about how important it was to offender management that inmates felt cared about.Self-harm, meanwhile, has long been an issue of concern. I remember, in the 1990s and 2000s, detailed conversations with prison psychologistsabout why women’s prisons had disproportionate amounts of it: one idea, which I always found the most convincing, was that women, where they had children, were almost always the main carer, so were in a state of constant anxiety about who was looking after them. Another theory was that psychological interventions such as anger management courses had been devised for male prisoners; women responded differently to the discovery that they could have controlled their anger – by blaming themselves. That was also plausible.The one thing nobody ever debated was whether or not self-harm was the Ministry of Justice’s problem. Naturally, it is their problem; if you’re keeping people incarcerated, you have to keep them safe. On Wednesday, the chief inspector of prisonspublished a reporton women in prisons in England which found that self-harm was being driven by a “basic lack of decency” in jails. The details are tragic. Inmate calls to their children limited to one a month; remotely situated jails with no transport links so family visits are prohibitively expensive; prison uniforms designed for men; bizarre restrictions such as no underwear in the washing machines. Some of this sounds like performative cruelty, but all of it is rooted in a toxic combination of budget cuts and soaring prisoner numbers: the adult women’s prison population in England and Wales stood at 3,611 in November 2023, and is projected toincrease to4,200by November 2027, a rise of 16%.This increasingly punitive approach is completely needless; many of these women are on remand for nonviolent crimes and won’t go on toreceive custodial sentences. To put this display of toughness down to political posturing to mask a broken justice system would be speculative. What’s certain is that there have been cuts across the prison estate since 2012,resulting inovercrowding, understaffing, inexperienced staff and inhumane conditions.As Labour touts more brutal cuts to benefits, how is this different from life under the Tories? | Frances RyanRead moreWe know all that, but we’re failing to articulate the obvious: the fundamental precept of the state’s intervention in a private life is that welfare is paramount. That intervention may also be punitive, but not since Victorian times has prison been understood as punishment alone. If the government, under any circumstance, poses an active threat to your welfare, that alters the contract. Prisoners, having broken the contract already, are always the last to be heard on this (though bear in mind the point about remand – many of these women will be found not guilty).Academics David Walsh and Gerry McCartney, inSocial Murder? Austerity and Life Expectancy in the UK, explore in data and case studies the idea that policies might be causing life-threatening harm to people’s lives. They start with the data – again, it won’t come as a big surprise. Between 2014 and 2018, life expectancy, after decades of continual improvement,stopped increasingacross the UK. In some parts of the population – for instance, the poorest 20% in Glasgow –premature death increasedby between 6% and 7%.The authors then look at various policies, through a series of case studies – the changes to disability benefits and privatised work capability assessments are illustrated with the death by suicide of aprofoundly depressed manwho was found fit to work by Atos. It’s not at all complicated, tracking how cuts to local authority social care budgets, combined with more and more stringent access to personal independence payments (Pip), might lead to malnutrition, nor how the bedroom tax might cause deaths of despair – the case of one woman who killed herself after debts accrued because she had a spare room after her 16-year-old son also killed himself isbreathtakingly sad.The UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Professor Philip Alston, said of austerity afterhis visit to the UKin 2018, that “the bottom line is that much of the glue that has held British society together since the second world war has been deliberately removed and replaced with a harsh and uncaring ethos”.Which, again, we knew. But there’s something blocking the next step in this debate, almost as if we don’t want to let that next foot fall: what is your relationship with a state that doesn’t care? Is the phrase “welfare state” now wrong? Do we have to find some other way to describe such statutory provision that has not been dismantled? The concept of nations being “developing” or “developed” is understood; in the first your welfare is haphazardly overseen by a community, before reaching the nirvana of the second, in which your welfare is assured by government. But how do we understand and orientate towards a state that is developing backwards? It feels like some bizarre politeness, or a collective aversion to drama, that keeps us debating policy and society as though our welfare were paramount to it, when that is observably no longer true.Meanwhile, the Labour MPs of the “red wall”, the very seats where these life expectancy impacts of austerity and its aftermath are most obvious, call upon their leader to talktougher on immigration– as if that’s what’s driving the Reform UK vote; as if foreigners are what’s poisoning the well. It’s as if they don’t want to understand where voters’ anger is coming from, don’t want to consider its legitimacy. And yet they must. Or their politics, if you could call it that, will be swept away.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

As more gunshots rang through the air, the joyous sounds of thousands of people who had gathered in central Maputo on 9 January turned to screaming. On my video camera, I continued filming, even as I too started running.We had known this might happen. Three months earlier, Mozambicanswent to the polls in electionsthat have already changed the course of my country’s history.Frelimo, the party that has ruled Mozambique since independence from Portugal in 1975, faced losing power for the first time. Naturally, an organisation that has maintained an iron grip for half a century was not going to let go easily. When the results were announced in October, Frelimo’s candidate, Daniel Chapo, wasdeclared the winnerwith 70.7% of the vote .International observers including the EU mission noted“irregularities during counting and unjustified alteration of election results”, but did not say who they believed had won.Mozambique’s constitutional council, the highest electoral body, later reduced Chapo’s win to 65%, without giving any further explanation as to why. What’s clear is, regardless of who should have won, in any genuine democracy these elections would have been annulled given the irregularities, which civil society groups believe began in the voter registration process. As soon as Chapo was proclaimed the winner,thousands took to the streets to protest– and just as swiftly, the crackdowns started.For the following three months I covered the fallout, during which314people died and633were shot, according to the civil society group Plataforma Decide. Two of those killed were senior advisers to Venâncio Mondlane, the opposition candidate who has rallied anti-Frelimo sentiment. Mondale received 24% in the elections whose legitimacy he rejected.After his allies were killed– an estimated 10-15 bullets were fired at them as as they drove down a main thoroughfare of Maputo – Mondlane fled the country, but his popularity only grew. Broadcasting from secret locations, he used social media tocall thousands to the streets. The response was like nothing Mozambique has seen in its post-independence history, with protests frequently bringing the capital to a standstill.Borders and ports were blocked, causing immensedamage to the economy.A week before the inauguration of his rival,Mondlane returned from exile. Tens of thousands poured into the streets to welcome him, thronging Maputo’s narrow alleyways as they followed his convoy. Thepolice dispersed the protesterswith tear gas and gunfire. This was when I saw the young man shot in front of me.Seen from a wider perspectives, the events inMozambiqueform part of a trend: a wave of anti-government protests sweeping a region where youthful populations are no longer swayed by liberation-era parties. Across southern Africa, these parties have long traded on the nostalgia of being on the frontlines when Africans were throwing off the shackles of colonialism or white minority rule. But most of the population are now too young to recall those days, and in any case have more pressing concerns about soaring economic inequality and unemployment.In neighbouring South Africa, the African National Congresslost its majority in elections last Mayfor the first time since the fall of apartheid. The Botswana Democratic party, in power since independence in 1966, wasdefeated in November elections last year. And in Namibia, the liberation partySwapo clung on to its majoritybut suffered its worst parliamentary results since independence. But the violence has been most pronounced in Mozambique.As a socialist liberation party formed in 1962, Frelimo waged a bloody decade-long struggle against Portugal’s brutal colonial system. Our first post-independence president, Samora Machel, is still revered among pan-Africanists today. But as is so often the case, once in power, the liberators forgot where they had come from. The party that promised every citizen a brighter future has now presided for half a century over one of the world’s poorest nations. More than half the population, almost 19 million people, live below the poverty line.It didn’t have to be this way. Once one of the world’s fastest growing economies, Mozambique is blessed with natural gas, rubies and other mineral riches. But the “development” of these assets has been beset by corruption scandals. The so-calledtuna bonds scandalis regarded as one of Africa’s worst, and triggered a debt default that prompted the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to suspend budget lending in 2016. TotalEnergies, the French oil and gas giant, has poured money into developing a massive LNG project as part of what has been called Africa’s single biggest foreign direct investment at $20bn. Yet, even Ende, the national government-funded development agency, says more than 70% of the population in the north lives under food poverty. That has spurred impoverished young people to join an armed insurgency there.Demographics have been the biggest gamechanger across southern Africa, with young voters giving (relatively) young candidates a chance. Botswana’s new president, Duma Boko, is a 55-year-old lawyer. Mondlane, a 51-year-old pastor, makes use of social media (in contrast, Frelimo still relies on old-fashioned state television to broadcast its message). Almost daily, I turn on my WhatsApp group messages to see broadcasts from Mondlane; on Facebook, he speaks to the masses in short, sharp videos that quickly go viral.Mondlane has his critics. Some accuse him of having little by way of substantive policies – vital to rebuilding a nation that has a high unemployment rates – and say he is simply taking advantage of the disaffected youth. (He has said that he will tax corporations profiting from Mozambique’s resource wealth andmade a referenceto making the country a new Dubai.) Arguably, the tens of thousands who have marched for months have not done so under any explicitly political banner or in the name of Mondlane’s party. But their dominant refrain has been “Anamalala” (a Makhuwa term used by Mondlane, meaning “it’s over” for Frelimo).After Mondlane returned to Maputo, he held his own parallel inauguration as “the people’s president.” Thousands watched it on Facebook. He has promised to call for protests again if a series of demands, including releasing those detained for demonstrating against the election results, are not met. And while we don’t know what his political fate will be, what he has helped unleash is unmistakeable. A new political generation is rising.Estêvão Chavisso is a journalist based in Mozambique, where he is the coordinator of Lusa, Portugal’s national news agencyDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Probably not, but he’s brave to tryStephen BatesThe monarch’s new doc raises many questions. Why Amazon? Will it compete with Harry and Meghan – or Clarkson’s Farm?Thu 6 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 05.51 ESTShareSo King Charles is working on a feature-lengthdocumentaryfor Amazon Prime Video, which will apparently detail his philosophy on how to “transform people, places and ultimately the planet”. Times have changed. Before, you waited years for a royal TV project – now they all come along at once.The royal documentary of old was a rare event, eagerly looked forward to, cherished and lovingly analysed – by royalists at least – for years to come: think of the BBC and ITV’sRoyal Family in 1969. Now they’re ubiquitous, what with Harry and Meghan’s Netflix programmes – includinghow to lay a dining tablein someone else’s house in California by Meghan – not to mention Channel 5’s endless Saturday night royal documentaries.There seem to be almost as many Windsors as Kardashians on screen, with shows ranging from the gripping tale of Kate “as you’ve never seen her before” to William and Harry: “Can their bond ever be mended?” If you count Prince Andrew: “Where did it all go wrong?”, you have the whole gamut of viewing pleasure. I shouldn’t complain: I’ve been asked occasionally to appear on these types of programmes. There’s quite a cottage industry of royal watching out there.The king’s documentary will be altogether less frivolous than the fast-cut shows with talking heads. It will be an exposition of his philosophy, about how his enthusiasms and views on nature, the environment and architecture are linked and could be harnessed to transform the world. He actually wrote a book outlining these ideas 15 years ago, a lavishly illustrated coffee-table tome titledHarmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World. The then prince claimed: “This is a call to revolution. Revolution is a strong word, and I use it deliberately. The many environmental and social problems that now loom large on our horizon cannot be solved by carrying on with the very approach that has caused them.”If that was a hard sell then, how much harder it will be in this world of Donald Trump and Elon Musk – and indeed Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder. Bezos’s Prime Video channel, home to myriad delights including Clarkson’s Farm, is an interesting choice for the monarch – one that was apparently pondered hard by the king and his advisers. Rival Netflix, which has invested so heavily in Charles’s errant younger son and daughter-in-law, will certainly be put out, but Charles’scri derévolutioncould hardly be posted alongside Harry’s documentary about how much he loves polo, even though that is an enthusiasm he still shares with his father. It’s worth noting that Prime Video is the channel that last year gave us the three-part drama A Very Royal Scandal, about Prince Andrew’s car-crash interview with the journalist Emily Maitlis on his relationship with the late Jeffrey Epstein. Did Charles go to Amazon despite that, or because of it?Undoubtedly he will have been keen to get his transformational message out to the widest possible audience, and for that, he clearly needed an international outlet. It will be a carefully crafted and expensive job: filming started last month and is taking place through the summer, partly at Dumfries House, the Palladian mansion in Ayrshire that the king helped to save for the nation through a charitable grant from his foundation in 2007. The programme will be broadcast either later this year or early next.View image in fullscreenKing Charles during a visit to the BBC at New Broadcasting House, London, 11 February 2014.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesWill Charles and a revolutionary vision transfer well to the screen? He is a man who does not take direction easily, and his relationship with television has been chequered, to say the least. It’s largely forgotten now, but way back in 1994 he got into almost as large a pickle as Andrew when headmitted to committing adulterywith Camilla Parker Bowles, then his mistress and now his queen, in the course of an ITV documentary about his life by Jonathan Dimbleby.A lot of water has flowed under the bridge in the past 30 years, but the king’s relationship with the media has often been prickly: rememberhis spatin 2005 with the inoffensive Nicholas Witchell, the BBC’s then royal correspondent: “These bloody people. I can’t bear that man. I mean, he’s so awful, he really is.” Witchell had merely asked what his sons, sitting beside him, thought of their father’s forthcoming wedding to Camilla. One was less amused by journalism back then.The king is more placid and secure these days. But he is also an elderly man in a hurry: as king for only two years and having had a cancer scare, he might very well see his TV opus as a sort of testament to issues on which he has been banging a sometimes lonely drum for 50 years.The worldwide audience will be huge, but what will the men who could really make a difference – the oligarchs, autocrats and populists now running the western world – make of it? It could give Trump, for whom no oil-well is too closed or small, a private moment of discomfort when he achieves his ambition of another state visit to Britain. But don’t hope for too much: unless Charles takes his TV message to Fox News, Trump probably won’t even see it.Stephen Bates is a former Guardian royal correspondent and author of Royalty Inc: Britain’s Best-known BrandDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The minister for home affairs, Tony Burke,statedthe federal parliament would now be “putting in place the toughest laws against hate speech that Australia has ever had”.It follows a concerning recent spate of antisemitic attacks in Australia, including on Jewish places of worship, schools, businesses and homes.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailLast week, a caravan was found on the outskirts of Sydney,filled with explosives and allegedly a list of Jewish targets.Police investigations into these incidents are ongoing and understandably, there is fear in the Jewish community.The government’s decision to pursue mandatory minimum sentencing is contrary to the2023 ALP national policy platform, which states:Labor opposes mandatory sentencing. This practice does not reduce crime but does undermine the independence of the judiciary, leads to unjust outcomes, and is often discriminatory in practice.The evidence shows that Labor’s official policy platform is correct. Mandatory minimum sentencing is unlikely to help solve this issue – or any other issue for that matter. It has a poor track record of reducing crime.What is mandatory sentencing?Australian criminal laws usually set a maximum penalty for an offence. It is then the role of the courts (a judge or magistrate) to set the sentence, up to the maximum penalty.‘Waterfront property’: what are Trump’s real estate interests in Palestine?Read moreThis allows the judiciary to exercise discretion in sentencing. It means the courts can take into account a range of relevant factors when determining an appropriate sentence, guided by the sentencing laws in each jurisdiction.However, laws that demand a mandatory sentence set a minimum penalty for an offence, thereby significantly reducing the role of judicial discretion.Let’s imagine two people are appearing in court, to be sentenced for exactly the same offence.Defendant A (“Kate”) is 18 years old and has pleaded guilty. It is her first offence. She is Aboriginal, a victim of childhood domestic violence and lives on the streets. She has recently started to get help for her mental health problems.Defendant B (“Jim”) is 35. He has a long criminal history, including breaches of bail and parole. He has never been out of prison for more than six months at a time. He has pleaded not guilty and doesn’t think he has done anything wrong.The maximum penalty for this offence is five years. Under standard sentencing laws, a judge would usually give different sentences to Kate and Jim, based on their personal circumstances and future prospects. Jim would generally get a more severe sentence than Kate.Now, let’s imagine parliament decides to set a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison. This means the judge has to send both Kate and Jim to prison for at least two years, despite the differences between them, even if a community-based sentence might be more appropriate for Kate.So do mandatory minimum sentences work?Themain arguments for mandatory sentencesare that they reflect community standards, provide consistency, avoid judicial leniency, and reduce crime.The evidence for each of these is weak.A study with members of the Victorian public who had served on juries foundstrong supportfor sentencing discretion.This is confirmed byrecent researchfrom the Queensland Law Reform Commission. It found general support from the public for individualised responses, not an inflexible approach to sentencing.Mandatory sentencing yields more consistent outcomes, but denies flexibility in cases where defendants should be treated differently.The argument that mandatory sentencing reduces crime is also contested.Study after study has shown thatharsher penalties do not reduce crime.It is uncontested, however, that certainty of detection (whether you’ll get caught) is the primary deterrent factor, not the severity of the sentence (assuming that the perpetrator is aware of it).Mandatory sentencing also brings risksLet’s review the arguments against mandatory sentencing.Firstly,it underminesjudicial independence, the separation of powers (between the courts and executive government) and the rule of law: a concept based on fairness in the judicial system.RFK Jr’s claim about Black people’s immune systems is ‘unscientific and terrifying’Read moreMandatory sentencing also shifts discretion to other, less transparent parts of the criminal justice system (for example, police and prosecution services), as they frame the charges that will bring defendants to court in the first place.Secondly, a guilty plea is a mitigating factor the court considers when sentencing. Mandatory sentencing means there is little incentive for defendants to plead guilty. This increases workloads, delays, costs, and has consequent negative effects for victims.In addition, juries may be reluctant to convict if they know the minimum sentence will insist upon a prison term. This can lead to inappropriate not guilty verdicts.Undermining the right to a fair trialAustralia has previously come under fire from theUnited Nationsfor its mandatory sentencing laws.These requirements are found in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which entered into force for Australia in 1980.Indeed, the Law Council of Australia has suggested mandatory sentencing is inconsistent with the international prohibition against arbitrary detention, and undermines the right to a fair trial, given that such sentences have been somewhat predetermined.These laws can also lead to injustice. As the example above shows, mandatory sentencing can impact disproportionately on vulnerable people, such asIndigenous people, andwomen with disabilities.These cohorts are already far more vulnerable than non-Indigenous men (who account formost people who offend).Adverse effects on imprisonment ratesThehigh courtrecently stated that the mandatory minimum sentence will have the effect of lifting sentencing levels generally.But the research shows longer prison sentences are muchmore expensive and less effectivethan community-based sentencing options in reducing crime.Let’s leave the final word on this subject with theLaw Council of Australia:Achieving a just outcome in the particular circumstances of a case, while maintaining consistency across similar cases and with Australia’s human rights obligations, is […] paramount.We need effective responses to all forms of racial and religious hatred, including antisemitic hate crimes, but populist, kneejerk reactions are highly unlikely to make the community safer. Clear-headed thinking will best stand the test of time, not policy developed in anger or fear.Lorana Bartels is a professor of Criminology at the Australian National University.

It is a different story when new buildings crumble and kill people. The 1 November 2024 collapse of the concrete canopy ofa railway stationin Novi Sad, Serbia – whose restoration was completedonly months earlier, accompanied by great government pomp – killed 15 people, and has sparked continuing nationwide outrage and indignation. The mass protests haveforcedthe prime minister to resign and put the president underincreasing pressure.Initially, the powers that be downplayed the collapse and the 15 lives it claimed, relying on the usual shoulder-shrugging platitude that, despite the tragedy,“Serbia cannot stop”. No time for grief, no need for questions, as on so many previous occasions. Much has been sacrificed for this ruthless, unstoppable “progress”. The rule of law and democracy have been its cardinal victims, fostering a culture of impunity, violence, widespread incompetence and corruption. National institutions like the judiciary, long captured by the regime, turned a blind eye to the unconstitutional, usurping actions of the oligarchy in power. It seemed this would be another case where the public would receive no satisfactory explanation, and no one would be held accountable.Butthen came the students. Last month, their peaceful vigils silently commemorating the 15 victims in front of the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Belgrade wereviolently interruptedby a bunch of thugsposingas impatient drivers. It was alleged shortly after that they were closely related to theruling party, some of them its members, and the Serbian president went on national TV todefendthe provocateurs. It was revealed that people close to the regime weregiven instructions todisrupt the moments of silence. To defend the businesses of the oligarchy, violence seems to have been only allowed but also prescribed.In response, students at public universities across Serbia declared strike action, halting the operation of their schools. By the end of December, they were joined by a significant number of high school pupils. Others joined too: agricultural workers – also unhappy with the way the government had been treating them for years –backedthe students’ demands. The Bar Association of Serbiawas next. Performances in theatres ended with actors holding banners reading, “The students have risen. What about the rest of us?”. The public was not indifferent: about 100,000 peoplegatheredon 22 December at Belgrade’s Slavija Square, standing in silence for 15 minutes. Last weekend, on the three-month anniversary of the station accident, unprecedented numbersswelledinto the streets of Novi Sad, and a growing, countrywide movement now includes school teachers, cultural workers, bikers protecting the rallies, engineers and taxi drivers. Peaceful vigils took place in more than 200 towns and villages. On the protesters’ faces was a peculiar mixture of solemnity, indignation, pride and hopefulness. It is a combination that has come to represent the present moment in Serbia.View image in fullscreenEducation sector employees and students gather in front of the Ministry of Education headquarters in Belgrade, Serbia, 5 February 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe students’ demands may sound minor. They have asked institutions to demonstrate that they will do their jobs unimpeded by the regime, and in the interest of a public whose very lives are threatened by state capture. Thus, the major demand, the hardest to be met, relates to the publication of all documentation related to the Novi Sad railway station reconstruction. The second two demands – the identification of individuals responsible for attacks on students and professors during peaceful vigils and initiation of criminal proceedings against them, and the dropping of criminal charges against students arrested or detained and suspension of proceedings – are calls for justice; a justice that does not discriminate between common people and the oligarchy. The fourth demand, toincreasethe budget for higher education by 20%, is about the restoration of dignity of knowledge production.But it is not the demands themselves, simple and bold, that are the most troubling for the regime. What is so new and stunning is the students’ claim that none of these demands are under the jurisdiction of the president, Aleksandar Vučić, the most powerful figurein Serbian politics, and supported by east and thewest alike as the alleged guarantor of stability in an otherwise ever-volatile Balkans. Vučić is not the state, the protesters argue; the institutions, as well as society at large, must be decaptured.The students have not fallen into the trap of imitating the president’s authoritarianism: they operate as a plurality, without a leader, without a given representative. They are many, with different faces appearing across the few independent media that platform them. They collectively decide each step at plenary meetings through direct democratic practices of voting and harmonising their voting bodies at the level of the university, across universities. Through their actions, they oppose the distortion of the spirit of democracy, as well as its procedures.‘We are done with corruption’: how the students of Serbia rose up against the systemRead moreIn the past decade in Serbia, opposition parties have been ground down and pacified: the unions are weak, while the machinery of the ruling party appeared inviolate. The regime has managed to silence and disqualify independent voices, from intellectuals to whistleblowers, through the fearmongering, mendacious government-controlled media. Fear, apathy and resignation had long set in. Yet now, for the first time in perhaps decades, the students – who themselves have no formal representationhave begun to represent all those silenced voices. Their witty use of social media has begun to push back against the media dominance of the regime.Despite invitations from the president for sit-downs during his daily media appearances (interspersed with threats, dishonest concessions, accusations and veiled calls to violence), the students have remained steadfast: their demands are clear and straightforward, and none of them is directed to the president. No negotiation is possible. In this, they are supported by their professors and the rectors of the universities.The students have managed to rock a government that had for years either bought off the dignity of people or gagged and belittled those who dared speak truth to power. All of a sudden, no “leader” can be found to be bribed, maligned or otherwise discredited with some vague insinuation of being a foreign hireling. Crucially, the students’ response to violence is unmistakably nonviolent, something that profoundly destabilises the entire value system developed in Serbia for more than a decade. They have nowbeen nominatedfor the Nobel peace prize.Their determination ought to shake the sluggish institutions into action. Their persistence has called for courage from the public, and many have bravely responded. What the Serbian students are doing is nothing less than restoring democratic hope in a country that has seen too little of it – and at a time when it is crumbling worldwide.Adriana Zaharijević is a philosopher at the Institute for Philosophy and Social Theory, University of BelgradeExplore more on these topicsSerbiaOpinionProtestEuropeStudentsActivismcommentShareReuse this content"

In the short-term, immediate responses from America’s allies and partners are being closely watched to see what they have to say, especially its impact on the post-second world war rules-based international order that the US and Australia helped to build.An undergraduate international law analysis of Trump’s Gaza policy would highlight the following objections. Gaza is part of the occupiedPalestinian territorieswhich has been accepted as such by the UN and international court of justice. Israel is the occupying power in Gaza under which it has extensive obligations under the 1949 fourth Geneva convention. Palestinians in Gaza, and in the West Bank, are recognised as having a right to self-determination and to control their own affairs. The two-state solution is a part of this process which has widespread international support. Irrespective of how that process resolves, over 140 UN members already recognise an independent Palestinian state.Albanese and Coalition continue to back two-state solution despite Trump’s vow to ‘take over’ Gaza StripRead moreThe US has no historical territorial rights or interests inGaza. That Trump suggested the American military may be deployed to Gaza just deepens concerns over US intentions. Trump’s Gaza plan has all the hallmarks of an attempted annexation. Russian military aggression and annexation of eastern Ukraine in February 2022 was rightly roundly condemned by Australia and the international community and has profoundly affected Russia’s international reputation and has had ongoing consequences in Europe.Any forcible removal of Palestinians from Gaza raises multiple human rights issues, and more significantly the spectre of mass atrocity crimes including a crime against humanity. The international criminal court is already exercising jurisdiction over such crimes alleged to have been committed in Gaza, and there is the prospect that both Israeli and American political leaders would be subject to investigation from the court. Finally, the forced removal of Palestinian children from Gaza would trigger the genocide convention. Israel is already defending itself before the international court of justice over claims of a Gaza genocide brought by South Africa. Trump’s Gaza plan would no doubt see fresh international court of justice proceedings brought against the US.A feature to date of the Albanese government’s response to the Trump administration’s foreign policy pronouncements has been caution. This has been understandable. First, the polices have often lacked specifics. Second, when there has been detail, such as the proposed 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico, they were delayed. Third, much of the White House’s new foreign policy has affected parts of the world far distant from Australia with no direct impact. Finally, the Albanese government is well aware that the future of Aukus could be in the balance given how reactive the Trump administration may be to criticism, and how the Dutton opposition would seek to seize on any perceived mismanagement of the Australia-US relationship. While the instinct of Albanese and his senior ministers is correct in not wanting to be drawn into daily commentary of White House pronouncements, is it possible to stay silent for ever?Trump’s Gaza plan has staggered the world. Did he mean it? For now, that doesn’t matter | Martin KettleRead moreSuccessive Australian governments speak in support of the rules-based international order of which the foundation is the 1945 UN charter. The charter’s core international law obligations are framed around respect for territorial integrity, constraints on the use of force, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes. These all arose from negotiations in San Francisco which founded the UN, the headquarters of which is located in New York. The charter became the basis for the postwar international order and spurned multiple distinct international legal frameworks across areas as diverse as human rights, international trade, and the law of the sea. Australia as a middle power has benefited enormously from this legal framework and invested considerable diplomatic effort into advancing it globally, regionally and bilaterally. The pinnacle of this legal framework is the international court of justice where Australia currently has a serving judge.A feature of the Trump administration’s recent announcements has been a focus on territorial expansion. First there was Panama and Greenland, where Trump refused to rule out the use of military force to advance US interests. There has also been a constant barrage of Canada-bashing and claims that it should become the 51st state. Canadians have made it clear they are not interested. On their own, each of these proposals is illegal. Now there is Gaza, which Trump seeks to also make American. This absolutely crosses a red line. The Albanese government should make clear that it rejects Trump’s Gaza plan and that it supports the rules-based international order and compliance with international law. That has been its consistent and principled refrain throughout the whole Israel-Hamas conflict over Gaza. It should stay that course.Donald Rothwell is Professor of International Law, School of Law, Australian National UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionGazaIsrael-Gaza warAnthony AlbaneseAustralian politicsAustralian foreign policyPalestinian territoriescommentShareReuse this content"

Ten years ago I saw his photos at the Royal Academy and realised he was also a brilliant photographer; I started reading biographies and checking out the movies I’d missed. Then I wrote a fun song about him called Dennis Hopper where every line rhymed with Hopper. I thought it would be great to do an EP, because his life was so colourful, but after some of my band members secretly recorded some instrumentals and suggested I put lyrics to them, I realised it could be an album of his life.I started just before the pandemic but had all these other albums and box set projects, so I’d work intensely on Hopper then leave it and return with fresh ears. It has 25 songs. A friend of mine suggested I was doing too many voices myself – an American commentator, an old hippy and so on – and needed some guests. I used to love thoseBruce Springsteenbootlegs where he’d do these incredible narratives at the end of the songs and thought, “If we could only get Bruce … ” He had come to a Waterboys gig in Dublin 10 years ago so there was a connection, and our manager asked his. Bruce did three takes for the song Ten Years Gone and sent all three. I got to pick between them. He did it so brilliantly and brought all the drama that I’d hoped he would.View image in fullscreen‘I’m looking for people with an attitude or a character’ … The Waterboys lineup in 2019.Photograph: Shirlaine Forrest/WireImageWhat did you think of Prince’s cover ofThe Whole of the Moon– andFather Noel Furlong’s cover inFather Ted?SmilinPeterPrince did it twice. He did a solo piano version at Ronnie Scott’s in 2014, which I’ve never heard, anda version in Minneapolis in 2015 with 3rdEyeGirl. I love it when people change my songs and make them their own. He flipped the lyrics round to sing “Isaw the whole of the moon”, using the song to make a Black Lives Matter statement, which I thought was very powerful.I love theGraham Norton version on Father Tedwhere he’s playing the bonkers priest in the caravan who remembers the words wrong. There’s a gay disco version as well, byBoys of a New Age, with a killer synth riff, which is storming.In theThe Double Life of Bob Dylanbiography I discovered that you got invited to one of Dylan’s jamming sessions withDave Stewartin London. How was it?Bibliophile63It was 1985. Bob had heard The Whole of the Moon and apparently liked it, and invited us to come down to the studios. Three of us turned up – myself, Steve Wickham and Anto Thistlethwaite. Bob was really nice to us. He had a quiet word with each of us individually because he must realise that he’s precious to people and it’s nice to have a private moment with him. We played for a couple of hours. [Blondie’s] Clem Burke was on drums. The weird thing was that Bob wasn’t singing. They were creating instrumentals for which Bob would later write the lyrics, which wasn’t his usual way with a sheet of paper. In a quiet moment I leaned over and asked, “Do you still write songs the other way?” He leaned towards me with a sort of glint in his eye – as if he knew what I was implying – and said, “Yes, I do.”What is the legacy of Dennis Hopper’s generation?MachoPudCulturally we’re still only coming to terms with what happened in the 1950s and 60s. There was the march of technology, mass production and the confluence of civilisations: the Black African American experience meeting the white experience and Hispanic experience. Then the evolution of consciousness: the pill, women’s liberation. It was all in this melting pot of incredible musical and cultural progress. Jimi Hendrix’s guitar playing is a good metaphor for how ahead of its time it all was and we’re still catching up. Oddly enough, now we’ve got the backlash with Maga and all that. People are trying to turn back progress but it won’t work because humanity has to move forward, and we will.When you releasedThe Liar, did you think it possible that Trump would be electedpresident again?PaulWB1960It was written around the time of his second impeachment. When it came out in 2022 I always had this sneaking dread that Biden’s presidency would turn out to be a moment between two Trump nightmares.Would you have actually liked to have been a fisherman? Or indeed a “brakeman on a hurtlin’ fevered train”?DeJongandtherestlessThere was a moment in my life where my personal circumstances were sufficiently confusing and confounding for me to wish exactly that. Unfortunately, I didn’t go off and do it. I put it in a song instead.What are your memories of your teenage years inAyr, and have you ever thought of doing an album inspired by Burns as you did with Yeats [An Appointment With Mr Yeats, 2011]?Chriswa29Burns has been done so many times and so well that there’s not really much fresh ground for me. Yeats felt underdone. Ayr was very beautiful geographically, a great old town to be in as a teenager that taught me a lot of life lessons. My first band members were blokes from Ayr. My first girlfriends were the women of Ayr. I owe the town a lot.View image in fullscreen‘I owe the town of Ayr a lot’ … Mike Scott with band recording in 1985.Photograph: Lynn Goldsmith/Corbis/VCG/Getty ImagesMy first gig was your old band calledAnother Pretty Face. How do you look back on your Edinburgh punk days?M1keM5I was living in Edinburgh and in my first proper band. I had a job in the HMV shop to make money to buy instruments. The moment we got the sniff of a record deal I was off, but it was a golden time: great fun, uncomplicated. Me and the guitar player lived in a bedsit with an Iranian landlady and if you had any lingering guests after 10pm she would come storming up the stairs. Pity the poor interloper! I think of those times with a lot of fondness.“Your coat is made of magic / And around your table angels play”is beautiful. IsWhen Ye Go Awayabout anyone in particular?IanJamesCameronIt grew out of another song, Killing My Heart, which is on The Best of the Waterboys and the Fisherman’s Box box set. I didn’t think we had the definitive version so I stole most of the lyrics and put new music to it. Killing My Heart was about my own relationship at the time with my partner who became my first wife, a relationship going wrong for a member of the band, and one going wrong for a member of my family. But When Ye Go Away is more reflective: all the pain was left in Killing My Heart.What doesSpiddalmean to you and do you ever get back to it?Captain LSpiddal is a village on the north coast of Galway Bay in the Irish-language area [where some of Fisherman’s Blues was recorded]. I was there last summer being interviewed for a documentary about a pub called Hughes’ and everything came back to me. The charms of the place, the Atlantic light, the sense of freedom and the magic of the Gaelic-speaking world. We got a tour of a new studio there and I was smitten all over again, thinking: could we come back and make a record? It’s otherworldly and an inspirational place, so maybe something will happen.When did you first hear the phrase “a bang on the ear” and did you have to ask what it meant?strawwdogIt was a telephone conversation with a crew member of the Waterboys who had a little boy called Benji. We were joshing on the phone and as we were signing off I said: “Oh, and give Benji a clout in the head from me.” It’s not meant literally; it’s code for an affectionate “hello”. I thought, “I like that phrase. I’m going to use that.”Red Army Bluesis probably my favourite Waterboys song. You sing it with real conviction even though it’s written from someone else’s point of view. How did the song come about?wyngatecarpenterI was fascinated by the second world war and read two books that inspired that song. One was The Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer, a Frenchman of German extraction who was drafted into the SS. The other was The Diary of Vikenty Angarov, a story of a Russian who had fought in the Red Army. Because he’d seen how people lived in the west, it was threatening to Stalin’s control. So a lot of the soldiers who had fought for Russia and defeated fascism were sent to the gulags. I was very moved by both books so I put together the song from the Russian soldier’s perspective, but using place names and incidents from The Forgotten Soldier.Wikipedia says that there have beenmore than 80 members of the Waterboys, either as contributors to albums or tours. What does it take to be a Waterboy?69thAnteaterIt’s a matter of pride to me that we’ve had more members than any other band ever! I think the nearest competitor is Santana. I’m looking for people with an attitude or a character, and they have to be versatile enough to play all the different kinds of music that factor into the Waterboys’ sound. My skills as a bandleader have developed, so now I find it much easier to bring whatever I need out of the musician.View image in fullscreen‘The fiddle carries a very particular emotion’ … Mike Scott of the Waterboys.Photograph: PauI Mac ManusDid you recognise early on thatKarl Wallingerwas a talent best-suited to front his own band, and did you remain friendly after he left to formWorld Party?takinarideI always knew he was a potential band leader. The first time I went to his flat in London he had a reel-to-reel recorder and played me some songs he’d been working on and was singing. I always knew he was going to go off and make his own albums. After he left the band I didn’t see him for years. Then, when he was living in New York in the early 90s, we met up, had a meal and played each other our new records. But he had this bad habit of putting me down in interviews in a very personal way, and that didn’t really foster a good relationship.WillSteve Wickhambe in the Waterboys again?SharonProbably. He’s on one song of the Dennis Hopper album, but the fiddle has a very particular sound and carries a very particular emotion. I spent 25 years singing with an incredibly talented and brilliant fiddle player who can mirror everything I do and go everywhere with me. At the moment, it’s really a good experience for both of us to not have to work alongside each other. For me it’s a bit like life after fiddle – or more likely life between fiddle eras. We’re still best mates.Life, Death and Dennis Hopper is released 4 April. The second single from the album, Andy (A Guy Like You), is released 7 February.

In our series,My feelgood movie, Guardian writers reflect on their go-to flick, and explain why their pick is endlessly rewatchable.This list will be updated weekly with further picks.Want more options? Here is our earlier list of thebest 100 movies of the 20th centuryand thebest movies about movies.Pink FlamingosStarring: Divine, David Lochary and Mary Vivian PearceDirected by: John WatersWhy our writer loves it:“The will to create a movie for the specific purpose of appalling anyone unaware of its true meaning turned Pink Flamingos into the ultimate litmus test. You either got its sick jokes or you didn’t. But those who did got something far more lasting than a laugh. We got a one-way ticket to an underground populated by parallel dissidents, an entire community of the unruly and free. That’s a lot to gain, which is why, even decades after I first saw Pink Flamingos, I return to it whenever I need to be reminded there’s a universe of possibilities out there not reflected in the world we know now.”(Jim Farber)Read the full reviewDefending Your LifeStarring:Meryl Streep and Albert BrooksDirected by:Albert BrooksWhy our writer loves it:“Life-affirming” is perhaps an overused adjective, but few movies have successfully illuminated the human condition as well as this one. Fear is commonplace in our daily lives, but Albert Brooks’s film might hold the key to ridding the worries of anxiety-ridden people such as myself. As the new year often brings about feelings of regret and unease, Defending Your Life is the warmest hug you can receive.”(Oliver Macnaughton)Defending Your Life is available to rent digitally in the US and the UKRead the full reviewNotting HillStarring:Julia Roberts and Hugh GrantDirected by:Roger MichellWhy our writer loves it:“What is so wonderful about the film is how effortless it all seems. The story isn’t complex; there are no gunfights or CGI raccoons; the greatest jeopardy in the film involves Grant having to catch Roberts before she goes back to America – a problem that reads as plausibly insurmountable in 1999 but today would be remedied with a few WhatsApps. But, despite the illusion of effortlessness, getting everything right in this way is deceptively tricky. Has a single romcom ever managed to marry all of the necessary elements – cast, script, timing, an intangible magic – so perfectly? (No. The answer is no.)”(Ralph Jones)Notting Hill is available on Netflix in the US and Channel 4 in the UKRead the full reviewMarried to the MobStarring:Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew ModineDirected by:Jonathan DemmeWhy our writer loves it:The movie is a long list of quirky pleasures, including a “starter kit of premium 80s college rock (New Order, Pixies, the Feelies), well-placed family dog reaction shots, and an FBI agent who dresses himself like Wallace in the Wallace & Gromit shorts. Few of the laughs in the film feel like punchlines or payoffs to some heavily orchestrated joke. Demme’s approach is more low-key and breezy, cruising confidently on the assumption that his DayGlo gangland will be fun enough without him having to push too hard. He catches a rhythm and does the mambo Italiano. It feels like your feet never touch the floor.”(Scott Tobias)Married to the Mob is available on Hoopla, Kanopy and Pluto in the US and Amazon Prime in the UKRead the full reviewRush HourStarring:Jackie Chan and Chris TuckerDirected by:Brett RatnerWhy our writer loves it:“Rush Hour taps into something that stirred my heart then and now: an ease settles into the two actors, Chan and Tucker’s joviality feeling so genuine that the east-meets-west tropes evolve into characters who have something real at stake, and who are also having fun.”(Tammy Tarng)Rush Hour is available on Netflix in the US and Amazon Prime in the UKRead the full reviewFather of the BrideStarring:Steve Martin,Diane Keatonand Martin ShortDirected by:Charles ShyerWhy our writer loves it: “Why do I come back to this film again and again? As a girl and younger woman I was emphatically against marriage (though I’ve since softened) and watched it more as a comedy horror than anything aspirational. The only aspect of the Bankses’ life I’d want is the kitchen. And yet watching Franck and the family put on their ridiculous show makes me want to be part of it. I love ritual, and ceremony, andSteve Martin, and Martin Short, and Diane Keaton.”(Laura Snapes)Where to watch:Father of the Bride is available on Hulu and Disney+ in the US and on Disney+ in the UK and Australia.Read the full reviewDiggstown AKA Midnight StingStarring:James Woods and Louis Gossett JrDirected by:Michael RitchieWhy our writer loves it:“Diggstown is the perfect feelgood movie – a breezy but exciting genre mashup with enough of a hangout vibe that you can have it on in the background, but also enough stakes that you will inevitably end up giving it your full attention.”(Zach Vasquez)Where to watch:Diggstown is available on Amazon Prime.Read the full reviewBurlesqueStarring:Cher and Christina AguileraDirected by:Steve AntinWhy our writer loves it:“Many of those who panned Burlesque on its release would feel punished by this cosmically appointed choice of comfort movie. A sequined patchwork quilt of all manner of backstage musicals and melodramas from various eras of Hollywood – starring, in a naked reach for cross-generational gay fandom, dual divas Christina Aguilera andCher– the film inspired critical comparisons to A Star is Born, Cabaret and Showgirls, most of them unflattering. It made $90m at the global box office: not a flop but not a palpable hit either, least of all for a film where the feather budget alone could have funded a modest indie drama. Antin, whose long but scattered pre-Burlesque career ran the gamut from acting to screenwriting to stunt work to producing Pussycat Dolls reality shows, hasn’t directed another film since. The world, by and large, hasn’t mourned.”(Guy Lodge)Where to watch:Burlesque is available to watch on Netflix in the US, on Sky Cinema in the UK and ABC iView and Amazon Prime in Australia.Read the full reviewHead of StateStarring:Chris Rock and Bernie MacDirected by:Chris RockWhy our writer loves it:“I’ve come back to this film so many times after the election for laughs, only to wind up seeing the whole picture as a clearer allegory for Kamala Harris’s defeat than Obama’s victory. Like Harris, [Chris Rock starring as Mays Gilliam, a small-time politician turned presidential hopeful] was a party sacrifice, offered up to make a certain loss look less bad on the cards, thrown into the fray at the 11th hour, plugged into a humming campaign apparatus, and touted as a history maker. It really makes you think about how close comedy is to horror.”(Andrew Lawrence)Where to watch:Head of State is available to stream in the US on Freevee, Tubi, Paramount+ and MGM+, in the UK on Paramount+ and on Amazon Prime in Australia.Read the full reviewA Knight’s TaleStarring:Heath Ledger, Shannyn Sossamon and Paul BettanyDirected by:Brian HelgelandWhy our writer loves it:“To me, watching a feelgood film is an intensely nostalgic exercise. That’s because whenever a film is special or timely enough to take up lodging in your heart, rewatching it is also an act of remembering an old version of yourself.A Knight’s Taleis shaded by the genuine sadness of Ledger’s death only seven years after its release, but when I watch it I also remember the way it used to make me feel, as a girl who loved the jousting because her older brother did, all the while secretly cherishing an action film for being so brazenly sentimental.”(Francesca Carington)Where to watch:A Knight’s Tale is available on Amazon Prime in the US and available to rent digitally in the UK and Australia.Read the full reviewAlita: Battle AngelStarring:Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz and Jennifer ConnellyDirected by:Robert RodriguezWhy our writer loves it:“My feelgood movie for when humanity lets me down is Alita: Battle Angel, a movie where much of humanity hangs out in a city-sized junkpile. And though I don’t press play with this aspect particularly in mind, it’s nice to imagine a future where things have gone terribly wrong (that just seems realistic at this point) yet unforeseen triumphs still emerge from the tech-nightmare garbage heap. There are plenty of more time-honored films that take a more direct path to temporary bliss, including sci-fi movies better-equipped to restore faith in humanity.”(Jesse Hassenger)Where to watch:Alita: Battle Angel is available to watch on Hulu in the US, on Netflix and Disney+ in the UK and on Disney+ in Australia.Read the full reviewI Know Where I’m Going!Starring:Wendy Hiller, Roger Livesey, Pamela BrownDirected by:Michael Powell and Emeric PressburgerWhy our writer loves it:”I Know Where I’m Going! offers up such portentous moments of mystical and romantic significance lightly, alongside comical asides and colourful eccentricity. It’s a disarming strategy, which tends to leave the audience every bit as bewitched as (the film’s main character) Joan. In this corner of the universe, anything might be possible, even an ancient curse.”(Pamela Hutchinson)Read the fullreview for I Know Where I’m Going!Where to watch:I Know Where I’m Going! is available to watch on Tubi, Amazon Prime and the Criterion Channel in the US and is available to rent digitally Australia and in the UK and watch on BBC iPlayer.Read the full reviewExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood movieSteve MartinDiane KeatonHeath LedgerChris RockCherChristina AguilerafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s almost impossible to believe any of the bragging, soundbite-spewing chancers are even good at businessLouis StaplesThu 6 Feb 2025 10.17 ESTLast modified on Thu 6 Feb 2025 10.19 ESTShareThe opening scenes ofThe Apprentice– Lord Alan Sugar’s search for a new business partner – have become a yearly tradition on British TV. We meet a squad of suited and bodycon business dress-clad candidates, who seem to be competing to say the most ridiculous thing. “I’m like a lion in the business world. Fierce, hungry and ready to devour my prey,” says Chisola Chitambala, a contestant on the latest series, which is airing weekly on BBC One. “The level of competitiveness I have isdisgusting! I am the human equivalent of a tank.Nothinggets in my way,” insists meal-prep entrepreneur Mia Collins. “I can sleep when I’m dead!” proclaims Amber-Rose Badrudin, while hair-transplant consultant Carlo Brancati boasts: “What others can earn in a month takes me one hour.” (This gives rise to the question: what are you doing here, then?)The first series of The Apprentice premiered 20 years ago this month on BBC Two. The days when it felt like a genuinely exciting format are long gone, however, because it is now one of the most predictable shows on TV. Ratings have stalled, it’s beingpanned by criticsand it has grown into a high-cringe spectacle – one that symbolises a wider slide in standards in reality TV and beyond.The central appeal of The Apprentice has always been twofold. First, its scratching of a society-wide itch to see “corporate types” – professionals who are arrogant enough to think they know it all – being cut down to size; and second, the “rags to riches” element, dating from the early days of reality TV, when shows like The X Factor and Big Brother gave people who had traditionally been shut out of opportunities a shot at becoming rich and famous.This was the first problem The Apprentice encountered: it became an easy vehicle for celebrity. Contestants such as Saira Khan – a fan favourite and runner-up from the first series – launched successful media careers. Long before she ended up a far-right media commentator,Katie Hopkinswas the pantomime villain of series three, where she became the first contestant to leave the competition voluntarily. (Did she ever want the job? Or just the airtime?) The standout contestants, such as Jessica Cunningham and Luisa Zissman, soon started appearing on other reality shows, with the Apprentice-to-Celebrity-Big-Brother pipeline turning into British reality TV’s unofficial graduate scheme.View image in fullscreenMinding his own business … Lord Alan Sugar.Photograph: N/A/BBC/FremantleMedia LtdJames Hill, who was one of the breakout stars of series 10, in 2014, appeared on CBB the following year, where he was crowned the winner. He tells me that he originally went on The Apprentice “to be taken more seriously” in business and didn’t expect the lucrative TV offers that came next. “I don’t think you can go on any TV show and think, ‘I’m going to be the next David Beckham,’” he says. “You just have to run with it and see what happens.”Still, it’s undeniable that the show has leaned into casting over-the-top TV personalities, many of whom clearly want to be famous. “When it first started,” Hill says, “it was a lot more serious and the personalities weren’t as vibrant. But I think TV has changed in general. Audiences have changed – they want more of the ‘reality’ aspect. That balance of fun and professionalism has shifted.”He might be right that audiences want more drama – after all, reality TV is a conflict-heavy medium. But the balance feels skewed. We still need to be able to believe in the premise of the show: that it’s a genuine search for business talent.‘Do you want a little experience of stalking?’: what happened when Bear Grylls offered to ‘hunt’ me in a jungleRead moreThe Apprentice has always contained a heavy dose of humiliation. The often-ridiculous tasks, which usually require interaction with the public or “industry leaders”, are designed to create as many toe-curling moments as possible. But casting on the more recent series has turned up the cringe-o-meter to such an extent that the show’s very premise feels ridiculous, too.In the early years, when the contestants reached the final five, they were put through a gruelling set of interviews with some of Lord Sugar’s most trusted business associates. During these interviews, great care was taken to scrutinise their CVs. Embellishments or lies, which inevitably surfaced, represented a major scandal. Now, though, when the contestants reach the interview stage, the difference is stark. The interviewers don’t need to dig for white lies, because many of them don’t seem to have the basic knowledge of how to run a business. The “gotcha” moments are someone forgetting to include the most basic elements, such as costs or profit, in their business plan. When confronted with the fact that they are clearly out of their depth, it feels like not only a waste of time for the participants, but a waste of the viewer’s time, too, when we’ve spent weeks watching them.Some of this is down to the format. Since 2011, candidates stopped competing for a job with Lord Sugar and began fighting it out for a £250,000 investment in a business idea and a 50-50 partnership with him. Often, viewers have been put in the frustrating position where a candidate with a strong record in the weekly tasks ends up pitching a concept that is flawed, or isn’t something Lord Sugar is interested in investing in. This first happened in 2011, when Helen Milligan had an exemplary task record, but her idea of an elite concierge service didn’t spark joy. Tom Pellereau – an inventor with a far worse record in the challenges – won the investment instead. The producers can take some of the blame here, too: over time, the tasks have become more complex, to the point where the contestants are given days (or mere hours) to come up with campaigns and pitches that would normally take a team of professionals much longer. It feels as though they’re being set up to fail.The Apprentice season 19 trailer – videoThe show’s normalisation of underqualified candidates feels representative of a slide in standards that goes far beyond TV. We live in a world of personal branding and image curation, where little more than confidence and a social media profile is needed to brand yourself as a business success. The darkness of this is easy to spot in outlandish scammer stories such as those of the“Tinder Swindler” Simon Levievorfake New York heiress Anna Delvey, but it has also seeped into our culture. And as a medium that rewards those who have “the gift of the gab” (translation: chancers), reality TV is a powerful vehicle for this type of branding. Just look at Donald Trump, who co-produced and hosted the original US version of the show, rebranding himself as a business success following a string of high-profile corporate bankruptcies and failures in the 1990s. He probably wouldn’t be president today without it.Some might argue that prioritising personality isn’t the end of the world – especially on a reality show. “I think you have to remember, it is TV. It is not real life and you have viewers at home who want entertainment,” Hill says, when I ask about the declining quality of candidates. “People have been selected for the process because they’ll make good TV. But then you have people who are there because they have great business plans, so it’s finding a balance between the two.”Unfortunately, it’s been obvious for some time that The Apprentice is failing to strike that balance – to the point where it feels like we’re watching the bottom of the barrel being scraped. I want to say that viewers “deserve better” here, but while I’m still tuning in to watch such repetitive slop, I’m not entirely convinced that’s true. It used to be The Apprentice’s contestants who looked like fools. Now the viewers do, too.Explore more on these topicsThe ApprenticeTelevisionAlan SugarReality TVKarren BradyKatie HopkinsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We talk to its authorTamlin MageeThu 6 Feb 2025 00.00 ESTShareIn his heroic yet tragically short life,Elvis Presleywas many things to many people: leather-clad hip-gyrating sex symbol; corruptor of youth; symbol of the American dream; helpless addict; king of rock’n’roll; challenging husband; guzzler of banana and peanut butter sandwiches; ultra-committed Christian. But a new book argues that the singer whose looks, voice and charisma changed so much more than music was one further thing: the world’s greatest occult magician.“He was a multifaceted seeker,” says Miguel Conner, who became obsessed with the King after an ayahuasca ceremony in 2022, ayahuasca being a psychoactive drink often used in cleansing rituals. “Somebody who sought the larger questions of life. He was a man of prophecy, of experience – and my thesis is that he was the greatest magician in western civilisation.”He waved his hands to clear rain from the sky – so that his friends could play racquetball at GracelandConner makes this argument in The Occult Elvis: The Mystical and Magical Life of the King, a book that gathers material from sources including Priscilla Presley, the clique of Presley’s associates known as the Memphis Mafia, and spiritual advisers such as his personal hairstylist and guru Larry Geller. It’s difficult to tell how much Conner has his tongue in his cheek and this is also how his book plays out: as a sort of spiritual biography peppered with Conner’s own theorising and lashings of Jungian analysis.Conner is not the first to take such an approach. Presley’s spiritual life has been examined elsewhere, in books such as David Rosen’s The Tao of Elvis, first published in 2001, and Elvis: Between the Lines: His Quest for Higher Consciousness as Told Through His Notes. The latter, which was published two years ago and was written by Ingrid De La O, was a trawl through Presley’s extensive – and annotated – library of books.View image in fullscreenA long way from Memphis ... some of Jupiter’s moons.Photograph: Dotted Zebra/Alamy“Elvis read over 1,000 books about different facets of new age spirituality,” says Gary Tillery, author of 2013’s The Seeker King: A Spiritual Biography of Elvis Presley. “He was very serious about it. He wanted to leave music at one point to start his own commune – and bring young people into this new age of spirituality through kriya yoga.”In The Occult Elvis, meanwhile, we learn of Presley’s talent for weather manipulation, one day waving his hands to clear rain from the sky, so two friends could play racquetball at his Graceland court. Longtime fan Wanda June Hill also appears, with her revelation that the King divulged to her that he was not from this planet, but rather hailed from Jupiter’s ninth moon. The book also details Presley’s belief in extraterrestrials and his claim to have had several UFO encounters, once telling his bodyguard Sonny West: “If they make contact, we can’t be afraid, because they are not going to hurt us.”Conner, who lives in northern Illinois, sees Presley not so much as a David Blaine or Derren Brown, but more like a dark magus, along the lines of countercultural mid-century magician Aleister Crowley, who founded the religion of Thelema. “Do what thou wilt,” was its guiding principle. “A magician is always known by the system they leave behind,” says Conner. “With Elvis, he left us rock music.”To the sceptically minded, some of this will require not so much a pinch of salt, but a Graceland-sized helping. Yet Conner is a scholar of gnosticism, a broad field of Christian mysticism, and hosts the Aeon Byte Gnostic Radio podcast. He argues that Presley became the US’s “egregore”: in occult parlance, that is a non-physical, demigod-like manifestation that takes on a life of its own after being created by the will of a collective. From his earliest days, Conner writes, Presley was surrounded by strange happenings: he supposedly received psychic guidance from his stillborn twin brother, Jesse; and he recalled to girlfriend June Juanico that, as a boy, he would astrally project himself into the stars.Dark magus ... Aleister Crowley.Photograph: Keystone/Getty ImagesPresley’s parents had met through Pentecostalism – which, with its emphasis on direct communion with God via faith healing and rhythmic dancing, influenced musicians from Presley to Little Richard, BB King, Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Cash. “Rock music was never just a form of entertainment,” says Conner. “It was a sort of shamanistic spirituality. These guys were all Pentecostals and they were hated in the 1950s. Other Christians were saying, ‘You’re mixing sex and Jesus a little too closely.’”And of those “shamans” it produced, Presley was undoubtedly the biggest. But, although the Pentecostal movement influenced his music, he was abandoned by the church and condemned by his childhood pastor, James Hamill, who claimed the star was caught in Satan’s web. Perhaps this is what led Presley, who remained a Christian, to reject the “hellfire and damnation” approach of the church, as he once put it, and instead embrace the idea of God being in each of us, as espoused by much new age literature at the time.But it wasn’t until almost a decade after Presley began his career that an appointment with a celebrity hairdresser, Geller, caused his spiritual life to rocket. After a styling session, the two supposedly struck up a lengthy conversation about philosophy and matters of the spirit, prompting Presley to study eastern and western esoterica, from numerology to meditation. Geller said the singer spoke to him about telepathic visions he’d had with aliens when he was eight, including one featuring a future Elvis in a white jumpsuit (he didn’t know what the images meant at the time).Presley would take hundreds of books on tour, writes Conner, cloistering himself away to annotate works such as Kahlil Gibran’s Sufism-tinged collection of fables, The Prophet, or the 1947 quasi-gnostic text The Infinite Way, by mystic and lecturer Joel S Goldsmith. The singer pondered metaphysical, existential questions, and carefully read the works of mystics, including Helena Blavatsky, Manly P Hall and George Gurdjieff. It all seems a far cry from Hound Dog.“He considered himself a faith healer,” says Tillery, who recalls being “amazed” when he learned the extent of Presley’s spiritual life. The writer heard one story about a friend of Presley’s who had been in a motorcycle accident and was now in hospital dealing with excruciating pain. “Elvis visited him,” says Tillery, “and spent 30 minutes waving his hands over the guy’s back – and he said it was amazing. The pain was almost all gone. He hadn’t had any relief for two weeks.”Presley was not public about his spiritual inclinations but nor did he hide them. He was “ahead of the hippies”, says Conner, and travelled to an ashram, or spiritual retreat, in Mount Washington, New Hampshire, to hasten his spiritual evolution. He practised martial arts, in particular karate, becoming a black belt and an instructor. Not only did he meditate, adds Conner, he would read Tibetan Buddhist incantations on stage. He wore an ankh, the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol of life. Later, when he became interested in Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah – long before Madonna – he wore a chai pendant, along with his cross, once joking that he “didn’t want to be left out of heaven on a technicality”.View image in fullscreen‘The face of Stalin turned right into the face of Jesus’ … Elvis at Graceland in 1957.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesBy the 1960s, hippies had caught up and alternative spiritual systems were becoming extremely popular. Many pop stars dabbled in the occult, including David Bowie and Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, the latter purchasing Boleskine House by Loch Ness, where Crowley once lived. But, as John Lennon supposedly once said, before Elvis Presley there was nothing. Conner says rock was “led by high priests like Presley and Little Richard and so many others” and became a “form of psycho-spirituality that allowed individuals to cope with this new empire called the United States – this space-age, mass-media era we were entering”.The US empire and its obsessions came to bear on Presley himself: in the sky above the Arizona desert, Geller claimed, he saw the face of Joseph Stalin morphing into that of Jesus, a representation to the singer of both the antichrist and Christ, as well as the forces of darkness and light within him. Presley is said to have uttered: “The face of Stalin turned right into the face of Jesus, and he smiled at me, piercing my heart and every fibre of my being with his light. I’ll never have to doubt again.”Conner says: “This vision was that of the ultimate evil, Stalin – this was at the height of the cold war. But what he realised was that the evil was inside of him, too. He felt he wanted this darkness wiped away or cleansed, and if it destroyed him, he was fine with it.” After this vision, adds Tillery, Presley felt “he had a role to play in the betterment of humankind, and he could do it through music and making people feel better, and hopefully open up their minds to more spirituality”.That mission was cut short. The singer died in his bathroom at the age of 42, while reading A Scientific Search for the Face of Jesus by Frank O Adams, according to a 2022 article in the Daily Express. But a torrent of strange accounts poured forth about the King after he died, including a string of sightings taken up by the tabloids and collected in Raymond A Moody’s 1987 book Elvis After Life. “When you look at Elvis apparitions that still happen today,” says Conner, pointing to the Graceland website where visitors can record their own, normally prosaic sightings, “he’s up on the level of sasquatch, Jesus and the Virgin Mary.”The Occult Elvis by Miguel Conner is published by Simon & Schuster (£16.99) on 8 April in the UK and 22 May in the US.Explore more on these topicsElvis PresleyPop and rockReligionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

France is immensely proud of its national collection. The Louvre “renaissance” will cost an estimated €700-800m (£583-£666m). Thefive-year renovation of the Pompidou Centre, housing an extensive modern and contemporary art collection, will cost €262m. Accommodating more visitors and ensuring everyone can see the treasures of the collections is important to these French institutions and their funders.I wish there was such good news on this side of the Channel. Recent reports that the British Council has been contemplating selling its art collection have shocked us all. The British Council holds works from artists including Henry Moore, Tracey Emin, Lucian Freud and David Hockney, and shows them globally. It is our public face to the world. Yet chief executive Scott McDonald has said that due to a£250m pandemic-era emergency loanfrom the Foreign Office, with interest charged at £14m annually, the Council faces the “threat of insolvency”.Unless there is a major intervention, the Council will have to axe hundreds of staff, withdraw its presence in up to 40 countries and sell off its art collection. Half of the 9,000-item collection is protected by agreements made with artists who donated work on condition that it would never be sold. But the rest have no such restrictions. McDonald has said he offered the collection to the government in exchange for writing off the loan, but to no avail.As we wait for a resolution, the government may soon be faced with an even bigger challenge. The UK’s art collection is held not only in the great national museums in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, but in the network of local authority-funded museums, centres of civic pride. But there is a serious local authority funding crisis: many years of underfunding from government and the growing strain on their statutory services means that local authorities have precious little left over to fund cultural provision for their communities. As a result, they are being encouraged to look at their art collections as disposable assets.Selling off the “family silver” is not the solution. Everyone, everywhere in the UK, shares ownership of our public collections and we all have the right to enjoy them. They are precious assets for future generations; local authorities are the custodians of our public collections, but the owners and beneficiaries are the public.Any sell-off of the British Council’s artworks would open the floodgates for cash-strapped local authorities to have similar conversations. The precedent that would be set if the British Council sells even a few high-value paintings would be extraordinary – a government body set up to champion, collect and share British culture with the world decides it is OK to sell the most valuable works in its care in order to plug a financial hole.Art Fund was created in 1903 by a group of artists and philanthropists, prompted by inadequate government funding for museums. It has helped the UK’s museums build world-beating collections, for all to enjoy. It has also been at the forefront of ensuring everyone has the opportunity to visit public collections, successfully campaigning for free access to national museums, and creating the NationalArtPass, Student Art Pass and Teacher Art Pass.If we lose our great collections for short-term gain we will never be able to get them back. Our national collections are the true wealth of the nation, a public benefit which everyone can value and share.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 82-year-old musicianhas been in failing healthfor some years, and in January 2023resigned from his positionas the general music director of the Berlin State Opera. Although increasingly frail, he has continued to make occasional appearances as a conductor, most recently in London with his West-Eastern Divan Orchestra atthe 2024 Promsand then at theRoyal Festival Hall in November.“I know that many people have been concerned about my health and I have been very touched by the support I have received over the last three years. I would like to share today that I have Parkinson’s disease,” he said in a statement released on Thursday. “Looking ahead, I am planning to maintain as many of my professional commitments as possible. If I am unable to perform, it is because my health does not allow me to.”“As ever, I consider the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra my most important responsibility. It is essential for me to ensure the orchestra’s long-term stability and development.Barenboim, who was born in Argentina to Jewish parents, jointly founded the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in 1999 with Palestinian-American academic Edward Said. Based in Seville, the orchestra consists of musicians from around the world – of Egyptian, Iranian, Israeli, Jordanian, Lebanese, Palestinian, Syrian, and Hispanic backgrounds.The musician is a lifelong supporter of the two-state solution to the Israel Palestine conflict and a frequent critic of Israeli government policy.“You can’t make peace with an orchestra,”Barenboim said in an interview in 2008, “but one can create the conditions for understanding and awaken the curiosity of each individual to listen to the narrative of the other. The Divan was conceived as a project against ignorance. It is absolutely essential for people to understand what the other thinks and feels, without necessarily agreeing with it.”His statement continued: “I will continue to conduct the Divan whenever my health allows me to. At the same time, I will take an active role in ensuring that the Divan has the opportunity of working with other excellent conductors going forward.”“I have been navigating this new reality of mine and my focus is on receiving the best available care. I thank everyone for their kindness and well wishes.”Explore more on these topicsClassical musicDaniel BarenboimParkinson's diseasenewsShareReuse this content"

First cameInventing Anna, the story of super-scam artist Anna Sorokin (AKA Anna Delvey, brilliantly played in all her many incarnations by Julia Garner), who glided through New York high society posing as a German heiress while relieving her marks of bountiful sums of money. It was a stylishly and energetically directed tale of one woman’s fabulous chutzpah, talents and ambition put to misdirected use and eventually causing her to come a cropper. Such a tale, too, is Apple Cider Vinegar, which features an equally masterly performance fromDopesick’sKaitlyn Dever as the wellness influencer Belle Gibson, who built a lucrative empire on the back of her story about beating supposedly terminal brain cancer via healthy living. That story – and you may be ahead of me here – was false. As a different character glances at the camera to say near the start of every episode of the six-part series: “This is a true story based on a lie.” It is also stated that (unlike Sorokin) Gibson has not been paid for the re-creation of her story. “Fuckers,” adds Belle when it’s her turn to open.The spine of the show, which unfolds back and forth from around 2010, is Gibson’s growing rivalry with another influencer, Milla Blake (Alicia Debnam-Carey) – seemingly inspired by thelate Jessica Ainscough– who also promulgates alternative therapies for cancer treatment. The crucial difference between them is that Milla does have cancer and is a true believer in the non-traditional methods that appear to have saved her. A third, not wholly necessary, narrative strand follows another cancer patient, Lucy (Tilda Cobham-Hervey), who is drawn to Belle’s internet charms and implicit promises.Milla is the golden girl. She has loving and supportive parents, a good education and the wherewithal to attend retreats, where she meets her loving and supportive boyfriend. Eventually, she finds her way to the expensive Hersch Institute, which claims to cure cancer via coffee enemas and a strict fruit-and-veg diet; this appears to work for her. She also has just the right look for a burgeoning app called Instagram, and quickly gains popularity there.Apple Cider Vinegar trailer – videoBelle, we are told, is from an unhappy home overseen by a narcissistic mother, who still glories in diminishing her child wherever possible. Belle has a baby with a toxic man, then escapes – or inveigles her way – into a relationship with a much better bet, a stable older man (Ashley Zukerman). His computer skills are almost as handy as his childminding capabilities when she wants to move on from blogging to building her own app. As one of the first people to become properly suspicious of Belle puts it: “She doesn’t have friends; she has hosts.”Are you falling for wellness misinformation online? Here’s how to tellRead moreApple Cider Vinegar does an artful job of layering revelations about Belle’s past with her current actions, so that while we can never fully sympathise with her, we can never enjoy her as a pure villain either. While Milla (and her poor parents, given their heartbreaking due by a great script and superb performances from Susie Porter and Kieran Darcey-Smith) is a study in one kind of desperation and the irrationalities and ideologies it can lead us into, Belle is a study in another. Loneliness and neglect and the longing to be liked result in a repellent neediness. Combine that with thwarted ambition and overlooked talent, and you can see why those like Belle are drawn to a new technology that provides a potentially infinite source of attention. Apple Cider Vinegar beautifully walks the line between understanding and asking us to forgive this. It never forgets the harms done by the wellness industry to the desperate: those searching for hope who buy the snake oil, enriching its purveyors and potentially suffering deadly consequences (in the cases of those with illnesses like cancer).Apple Cider Vinegar is a fast, drily witty, acutely intelligent, compassionate and furious commentary on greed, need, mass delusion, self-deception, the exploitation of the credulous, and the enabling of insidious new forms of all of these by technology. If you think the script by creator Samantha Strauss is occasionally over the top (“I’m amazed that my story resonated!” says Belle to one adoring crowd, and: “In my commitment to authenticity … I’ve learned to seek out what’s raw and honest”), I suggest you go and listen to a few of her ilk online. You won’t believe your ears. Just make sure you don’t believe anything else either.Apple Cider Vinegar is onNetflixnowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionNetflixreviewsShareReuse this content"

Converted into a cinema in 1969, it is much loved for its screenings of hard-to-find films and counts directors Paul Thomas Anderson, John Waters and Quentin Tarantino among its fans.At the time of writing, more than 150,000 people have signeda petition launched by the cinema, who say its landlord Zedwell LSQ Ltd (owned by property developers Criterion Capital)wants to alter the lease, which would enable it to shut down the business.Six cinemagoers share their memories of the Prince Charles and tell us what makes it such a valuable institution.‘We lost it when George Lucas brought his family to see Mars Attacks!’View image in fullscreen‘The staffroom was a mini Libertines HQ’ … Louise Rodd.I worked on the box office at the Prince Charles Cinema between 1995 and 2000. Working there wasfun. I remember serving Nick Cave drinks, and not knowing who he was while everyone buzzed around him. I also embarrassed myself during a Priscilla, Queen of the Desert singalong screening. I got talking to this guy who came out for air. I asked him what he liked about the film and he responded with odd details, saying that he made the film. I, amused, did not believe him and made fun of him in my then-22 years young, gobby way. Later, my manager told me it was the director and I apologised. He was great about it.I learned how many of the greats, including Martin Scorsese, would see their films incognito in Leicester Square. We all lost it when George Lucas brought his family in to see Mars Attacks! He let the manager unashamedly take a photo with him. Natalie Portman came to see the Rocky Horror singalong and we all melted, as Léon was only recently out.The Prince Charles attracted artists, because it was £1.50 for a film matinee and £3 in the evening. Pete Doherty worked there with me too, on sweets and popcorn. I remember him telling us about his new band, and wanting to call themthe Libertines. He was so bright and recommended many great books to me. Carl Barât used to pop in after work. The staffroom was a mini Libertines HQ.View image in fullscreenLouise (third from right), her fellow ushers, and Carl Barât of the Libertines, at the Prince Charles Cinema in 1999.Photograph: Guardian CommunityThen there were the punters. They were unique and I loved so many of them. Some were in need. On very cold days, I would give a whole day’s worth of tickets to a person so they could be indoors and stay warm. We were a bit of a care hub for the local homeless and elderly people who were alone. That’s what the Charlie was about, back then.Louise Rodd, East Sussex‘Every time I return to London, I find time to visit’View image in fullscreen‘I’d skip classes to go to screenings’ … Jessica Yeung’s membership card.Photograph: Guardian CommunityI first heard about the Princes Charles Cinema from my good friend, Tom, and we often skipped film studies classes to go to screenings there between 2016 and 2019. PCC was a revelation to me as my home town doesn’t have any repertory cinema. I was introduced to great film directors such as Tati, Kurosawa, Lynch, and Friedkin. PCC also has the kindest staff with a good sense of humour. Every time I return to London, no matter how tight my schedule is, I find time to visit. Recently, it has also screened more east Asian films, which is a rarity in the UK – and very valuable for east Asian film buffs like me.Jessica SY Yeung, 36, Hong Kong‘The interruption united the audience’It was about 15 years ago, in the run-up to Christmas, and my sister and I went to see an early evening screening of Home Alone. We were expecting it to be half empty with a few families, but arrived to find them turning people away, and the cinema full of people our age (late 20s to early 30s), with hardly a child to be seen. About halfway through the film, it stopped playing, and an employee awkwardly stepped out in front of the screen. He explained that the reel we were watching was damaged; at this point he started getting heckled and I was getting a bit anxious for his wellbeing.He gave the audience two options: finishing at this point with a refund, or switching to a DVD, which wouldn’t have the same sound quality. The audience almost unanimously voted for the DVD, and we settled back in to watch the remainder, the employee leaving our screening as fast as he could. The interruption seemed to have united the audience in a strange way, because after that it became more like watching a stage production; there were audible laughs, gasps and claps as the bandits met with Kevin’s pranks, and the film closed to cheers and applause. I’ve never had a cinematic experience like it.Kat Rowles, Surrey‘We went to all-night Disney marathons every spring’I lived in London for four years during which I spent a lot of time at the Prince Charles Cinema. It was a tradition for my wife, my friends and myself to go to the all-night Disney marathons every spring, and the Muppet Christmas Carol every December. For anyone even remotely interested in film, this place is like a mecca. The vast range of films they show is astounding – from the classiest arthouse fare to absolute nonsense B-movies.Murray Rodgers, 34, Inverness‘Hundreds of people jumped out of their seats’View image in fullscreen‘When I think of that film, the Prince Charles Cinema will always be inextricably tied to it’ … Gerard Lough.Photograph: Guardian CommunityI saw a preview of the Robin Williams film One Hour Photo, which was being shown as part of the 2002 FrightFest. I’d chosen it on impulse and therefore saw it in the ideal way; going in cold with no idea of what to expect. My vivid memory of the screening was the fun of seeing hundreds of people all jump out of their seats simultaneously, when hit with the dream sequence where Williams’ eyes start bleeding profusely. Months later, the film was released, but it took years for it to be recognised for the great film it is. It is now one of my favourites and when I think of it, the Prince Charles Cinema will always be inextricably tied to it.Gerard Lough, 46, Ireland‘The audience participated with water pistols’I was a regular for many years. In the 90s the PCC used to show The Rocky Horror Picture Show at midnight every Friday. The show featured live actors and the audience was encouraged to participate with water pistols, thrown rice, cards, and costumes. It was always a great place to go after an evening in a Soho pub, especially as late licences were quite rare back then. Cinema needs imaginative programming and events to survive – it’s no longer enough to just screen a movie because I have a big screen at home and my sofa is more comfortable.Mark, São Paulo, Brazil‘One of the places that makes London worth living in’View image in fullscreen‘It shows things that nowhere else will put on’ … the Prince Charles Cinema during the Covid pandemic.Photograph: Guardian CommunityThe Prince Charles is part of the vibrant, slightly tatty but accessible Soho that seems to get smaller every year. I’ve seen such a ragbag of memorable films here (Ran; Bonnie and Clyde; The Bishop’s Wife; The Neon Demon; The Living Dead At Manchester Morgue; A Lizard in a Woman’s Skin), as well as some real rubbish. It shows things that nowhere else will put on – to packed houses – and it’s a brilliant place to catch films just before they finish their run. My son had his first cinema trip here to see Frozen, and it’s where I introduced him to the Marx Brothers. Leicester Square is an embarrassment, but the Prince Charles single-handedly redeems it. It’s one of the places that makes London worth living in.Anthony Stamp, LondonExplore more on these topicsFilmLondonFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And I said: ‘Are you trying to remove that?’ And she said: ‘Yes.’ And I said: ‘That doesn’t come off!”The actor had been shooting scenes which occur late in the film, in which his character, a Hungarian architect, is elderly and using a wheelchair.These scenes required considerably ageing makeup and hair dye, as well as light prosthetics. Brody said the makeup artist apologised, before adding: “This is going in my diary.”Brody is frontrunner to win the best actor Oscar for his role in the film, 22 years after his victory for playing another Holocaust survivor, in Roman Polanski’s The Pianist.Brady Corbet’s film The Brutalistis nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture, best director and acting nods for Brody’s co-stars Felicity Jones and Guy Pearce.Brody had his noseaccidentally brokenduring a fight scene on Spike Lee’s 1999 film Summer of Sam, and has broken his nose on two other separate occasions.The Brutalist makes frequent reference to his distinctive feature, with the suggestion that it was broken as a consequence of ill-treatment by the Nazis. Brody’s character, László Tóth, is not a real person, but Corbet took inspiration for him from the Hungarian postwar designer and architectMarcel Lajos Breuer.Actors have frequently donned prosthetic noses the better to resemble historical figures in awards-bait biopics. A nose also loomed large in last year’s Oscars discourse: the false one worn by Bradley Cooper as Leonard Bernstein in Maestro.Some critics felt its size was antisemitic – an accusation rejected by the conductor’s children, who collaborated on the film and said: “It happens to be true that Leonard Bernstein had a nice, big nose.”Meryl Streep’s delicately proportioned false nose as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady helped the actor take her third Oscar in 2011. Nicole Kidman’s more substantial appendage in Virginia Woolf biopic The Hours secured Kidman her first win in 2003.Announcing the win at the podium, presenter Denzel Washington said: “The Oscar goes to, by a nose, Nicole Kidman.”Explore more on these topicsFilmAdrien BrodyThe BrutalistFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

As with TV spend, spending in the UK film production market is coming mainly from the US.Photograph: Dreamworks Skg/Sportsphoto/AllstarAs with the high-end TV market, almost 90% of this spend came from the main Hollywood film studios such as Disney and Universal. In total, 191 productions were completed or started last year – 131 fewer than in 2023 and the fewest since 2020.The BFI said the figures showed the impact of the long-runningHollywood actors and writers strikesin 2023. “As a consequence of the strikes, many film and high-end TV productions were paused or start dates were postponed, which impacted UK production spend over [three quarters of 2023] as well as rescheduling production starts in 2024,” it said.Overall, the combined spend on film and high-end TV production in the UK last year was £5.6bn, up significantly on the £4.7bn in 2023.Explore more on these topicsTelevision industryDramaBBCITVChannel 4Channel 5NetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

Gascón has since deleted her X account and offered apologies, but has nonetheless been cold-shouldered by the film’s director, Jacques Audiard,who said on Wednesdaythat he had not spoken to her and didn’t want to, and its studio, Netflix.It is understood that the streamer has removed the film’s star from campaigning materials, will no longer provide funds for her to attend events and ceremonies, and is no longer in direct contact with her.Saldaña remains frontrunner for the best supporting actress award and has sought to distance herself from her co-star without suggesting complete ostracisation.In an interview with Variety’s awards-focused podcast, Saldaña said the situation had left her “sad. Time and time again, that’s the word because that is the sentiment that has been living in my chest since everything happened.“I’m also disappointed. I can’t speak for other people’s actions. All I can attest to is my experience, and never in a million years did I ever believe that we would be here.”Audiard’s cartel musical broke records last month when it wasnominated for 13 Oscars– three more than any other contender this year, and three more than any other foreign-language film ever. But the disgracing of its star has left cast, crew, and the PR firms handling the release, scrambling to recalibrate.The rise and fall of Emilia Pérez: how did it all go so wrong for the Oscar-nominated film and its star?Read moreIn a CNN Español interview at the weekend, Gascón said that Saldaña and co-star Selena Gomez “support me 200%”. Speaking to Variety, Saldaña did not comment on the claim directly, instead taking what the publication describes as “a long blink”, before reiterating comments made in London last weekend, in which she denounced bigotry and racism.“I do not support any negative rhetoric of racism and bigotry towards any group of people,” she said. “That is what I want to stand for.”Saldaña said she hoped the film’s legacy of inclusivity and diverse storytelling would endure past the current controversy and that she was trying to retain the positive memories she had of the shoot.“I’m allowing myself to still experience that joy because we did come together as a team,” she said. “But we are also individuals who are responsible for everything that we say and everything that we do.”She added that she found a considerable difference between the person Gascón appeared to be on social media and the person she worked with on set. “I can’t attest to what people do in their private time with their private handles,” she said.Explore more on these topicsEmilia PérezZoe SaldañaOscarsIslamophobiaNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

And that’s my problem.“When fans tell me to do my album a certain way, I’ll do it the opposite way,” he added, and referred to the title of his hit song Can’t Tell Me Nothing. He mentioned his friend and former manager Don C, saying: “It’s been so hard on him because he loves me. It’s so difficult for them, because this is like a grown man – you can’t take control of his bank account, you can’t control what I’m saying on Twitter.”Autism is not a mental illness. Butin 2020Kim Kardashian, then West’s wife, similarly acknowledged the difficulty of managing West’s mental health. “Those that understand mental illness or even compulsive behaviour know that the family is powerless unless the member is a minor. People who are unaware or far removed from this experience can be judgmental and not understand that the individual themselves have to engage in the process of getting help no matter how hard family and friends try.”West himself referred to his diagnosed bipolar disorder in numerous tracks, while the cover of his 2018 album ye features the jokey words: “I hate being Bi-Polar it’s awesome”.West said: “A lot of what was sending me into those episodes … the constant feeling of not being in control spun me out of control,” citing the breakdown of his deal with Adidas, which ended its lucrative collaboration with the musician in 2022 after he made a series of antisemitic remarks.West said he no longer takes medication for his mental health; as autism is not an illness, it is not medicated. “I haven’t taken the medication since I found out that bipolar wasn’t the right diagnosis. It’s finding stuff that doesn’t block the creativity, obviously that’s what I bring to the world. It’s worth the ramp-up, as long as y’all get the creativity.” He said he is watchful for episodes of poor mental health. “I watch for it beforehand – but if you get to the point it goes, you’re going to stay in that position for a while. It might go for three days, four days, a week. Some people if they get into it, you’ve got to put them in a place that’s not in public.”Elsewhere in the interview, West said that his new album Bully would be released on his daughter North West’s birthday, 15 June. He said he has reconciled with Mike Dean, the producer who was one of his chief creative foils and appeared on all of his studio albums until a dispute between the pair meant Dean was not part of West’s two Vultures albums.West said of Bully: “I feel like it is my Miseducation [of Lauryn Hill], my Gnarls Barkley album.”He also said that the White Stripes were a major inspiration for a series of solo tracks, namely how Seven Nation Army would be chanted at football games. “I tried two times to do it: the first time was Black Skinhead. The second time was All Day – Paul McCartney wrote that melody [on his Wings song When the Wind Is Blowing].” West then repeated the chant motif on Carnival, his Vultures I single which topped the US chart in March 2024, making him the only rapper to have a US No 1 in three separate decades.West also offered his thoughts on the beef between Kendrick Lamar and Drake – West and Drake previously had a dispute that ran across a number of tracks and public statements: “I was like: man, [Lamar] killed my nemesis!” West compared Drake to a superhero who “just goes away for a couple of films”, but said that it was only “for now … Drake added something to the algorithm, to our frequency, he advanced us. Future advanced us, now Kendrick has advanced the frequency … if you don’t really learn as a professional rapper, as a sport, what Kendrick is doing, you might be wiped out.“I’m the greatest that ever existed, and other people shouldn’t feel that, because I’m here … But if you’re going to rap against Kendrick, you will lose.”The exposure of Bianca Censori’s body is contrasted with the enigma of her mind | Moira DoneganRead moreWest caused controversy this week after he turned up to the Grammys alongside Censori, the latter wearing a revealing sheer minidress. The outfit was seen as unnecessarily provocative by some, while others suggested it was a form of coercion by West. West himself framed it as a collaboration, writing on X: “We tailored that invisible dress 6 times and just like magic poof we disappeared”, and cited her “rightful strength”.Asked about the couple’s appearance, Raj Kapoor, executive producer of the Grammys acknowledged that the “artistic black tie” dress code at the awards is “open to interpretation”, adding: “Obviously there is a dress code for anybody actually performing on the show that we have to adhere to standards and practices. But as far as people attending and nominees attending, that would be something the Academy would have to answer.”Explore more on these topicsKanye WestRapnewsShareReuse this content"

He got his wish posthumously when the theatre was founded in 1963 under the director Laurence Olivier.Funding cuts and the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have pushed the venue towards fewer plays with extended runs, often featuring a high-profile name in order to fill seats – a move which Hare decried as “terrible impoverishment”.‘I’m bursting with ideas’: Michael Sheen launches new national theatre for WalesRead more“Once the NationalTheatredrops repertory, which it appears to have done, you really are eroding the culture in a profound way,” Hare told BBC Radio 4’s This Cultural Life.He said: “The National Theatre is meant to present the world’s drama, and it doesn’t at the moment. It does semi-commercial runs, angling for theWest End, one play after another. That’s not repertory theatre. That’s not art theatre.“Shaw and Granville-Barker created the idea of the National Theatre for art theatre. The National now generates so few plays and all in runs and no repertory. So the days in which you could go and see six plays in a week have gone and I think that’s terrible impoverishment.”Hare referred to himself as “a creature of postwar repertory” and recalled how the former artistic director Sir Peter Hall committed to putting on his play, Plenty, in 1978 despite unimpressive reviews and being instructed by the board to close it. The play was later adapted into a 1985 film starring Meryl Streep.He said: “By the end [of the run], it was full to standing ovations because he allowed the audience to get at it. Who curates plays like that now? Who is able to have the money to curate plays?”On the same show, he said similarly cautious regional theatres were at risk of missing the next Harold Pinter.He said it was “very hard” for artistic directors in the regions “to risk failure”, adding that subsidy to the regions would go some way to addressing this.“If they believe that a particular writer was the writer who that region should be hearing, or the whole of the country should be hearing, it’s very, very hard for them to back that single writer to the degree which we once backed John Osborne or Edward Bond or Harold Pinter as the voices of their time. That kind of backing is what’s missing at the moment.”Granville-Barker was an acolyte of Shaw, and performed in many of the latter’s productions before turning to writing and direction himself. He wrote the Blue Book with critic William Archer in 1904.Shaw once said: “Do the English people want a national theatre? Of course they do not. They never want anything. They got the British Museum, the National Gallery, and Westminster Abbey, but they never wanted them.“But once these things stood as mysterious phenomena that had come to them, they were quite proud of them, and felt that the place would be incomplete without them.”The National Theatre said it now “stages more new plays and new adaptations than at any point in its history, written by a larger and broader pool of playwrights than ever before, across all three theatres”.“The move to ‘straight runs’ rather than playing in repertory has been a necessary change in the post-Covid financial climate but this has not changed the number of productions staged each year – which has stayed the same,” it said. “The National Theatre’s commitment to writers and new writing is steadfast.”Explore more on these topicsNational TheatreTheatreOlivier awardsWest EndAwards and prizesBBC Radio LondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Gotti’s representatives had confirmed last August he had suffered a “minor stroke” in early 2024, saying at the time: “He’s been successful in making a full recovery.”​Def Jam, the record label of which Murder Inc was an imprint, issued a statement on Wednesday night saying it was “deeply saddened” by Gotti’s death.“His contributions at Def Jam, as both an A&R executive and in partnership with Murder Inc, helped pave the way for the next generation of artists and producers, a force that reshaped the soundscape of hip hop and R&B,” it wrote.Gotti was born Irving Lorenzo, one of eight children in a Queens family, in 1970.Pop: ‘When you’ve got the formula for success, it’s simple’Read moreHe rose to prominence as a tastemaker in the 90s, working at Def Jam to break artists including Jay-Z – who christened him Gotti – and DMX. He had an early credit on Jay-Z’s 1996 debut album, featuring as DJ Irv on the track Can I Live.The next year Gotti helped sign DMX to Def Jam before executive producing the rapper’s first album, It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot – a record which debuted at No 1 on the Billboard charts, sold 5m copies worldwide, and immediately established DMX as a major MC.Gotti’s early success led to the formation of his label, named after the early 20th-century New York organised crime group. Murder Inc, which Gotti founded with his brother Chris, released its first album in 1999: Ja Rule’s debut, Venni Vetti Vecci. Like DMX’s debut, Venni Vetti Vecci quickly made Ja Rule a hip-hop star; Gotti executive produced and had a credit on every track.By the early 2000s Gotti’s label was a commercial success, transitioning from a cult hip-hop sound to more mainstream, radio-friendly pop rap. It produced two more smash albums by Ja Rule as well as signing Ashanti and releasing her self-titled debut. This topped the Billboard chartsand won Gotti a Grammy.Gotti collaborated Jennifer Lopez, Eve and Alicia Keys. “People get confused because it sells like pop music,” Gotti toldthe Guardianin 2002. “But we make black music first and foremost, and all our records is ‘hood first’.”His image was tarnished by Ja Rule’s long-running feud with 50 Cent and a raid in 2003 of his label’s offices by federal agents who suspected it of laundering drug money.Two years later Gotti and his brother were charged with money laundering but they were acquitted of all charges.Amid the controversies, Gotti rebranded Murder Inc as The Inc. In the late 2000s it signed Vanessa Carlton and continued to release albums by Ashanti and the R&B singer Lloyd but the label struggled as artists left and distribution deals fell through.Gotti created BET’s hip-hop anthology television series Tales, as well as having producing credits on several Kanye West tracks.Lyor Cohen, a music entrepreneur who held several executive roles at Def Jam from 1988 to 2004,told the Hollywood Reporterthat the label “has lost one of its most creative soldiers who was hip-hop”.“When we were on bended knee, he brought the heat and saved our asses,” Cohen said. “It’s an honor and a privilege to have known him. Irv, you will be missed.”Explore more on these topicsMusicHip-hopRapnewsShareReuse this content"

From the frontline, she receives a phone call to say that he “has not been captured”. She passes a beggar on the street who stresses that she doesn’t need money as she and her children are happy and well-nourished.Viewers soon realise that this Russia is an inverted world in which words and statements mean their opposite and the truth can only be surmised by reversing lies – the sort of place where a president might call invasion of a sovereign nation “a special military operation”. By the time a judge tells Alya that she has “done nothing wrong” and a doctor sardonically reassures her that she is “not dying”, there is a chill in an audience that has learned this warped talk.Although the title of Vanya Is Alive invokes a classic Russian drama, Natalia Lizorkina’s 2022 play has no direct connection with Uncle Vanya, though there may be an influence from Chekhov’s early satirical sketches. The biggest debt, though, is to the satires of Gogol and Bulgakov, applied to enduring targets – state militarism, lying leaders – and new ones. A Russian podcaster protects himself by dropping hours of complete silence, although the tactic is doomed to fail in this dystopia as saying nothing clearly implies what would be said if the speaker dared.There are narrative, characters and ideas enough for a full-length, populous play but Lizorkina has confined them to a one-hour multi-voice monologue, compellingly performed by Nikolay Mulakov under the direction of Ivanka Polchecnko, who also translated the piece. The story is told in reported speech (“the policeman says …”), with minimal ventriloquism of the speakers, giving Mulakov the sound of an ominous oracle. A moment when he shouts has the shock of gunshots and and interludes of silence, which may be podcast extracts, suggests what happens once speech becomes unbelievable.The piece’s brevity may limit its appeal beyond festivals and small venues but, when its theatrical potential is spent, Vanya Is Alive should surely be recorded and preserved online as an account of the perversion of language and logic by tyrannies in Russia and elsewhere.At theOmnibus theatre, London, until 8 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreRussiareviewsShareReuse this content"

Four years ago, his ever-escalating success seemed assured: his brilliant performance as Ritchie, the lead character in Channel 4’s lockdown hit It’s a Sin, had been garlanded with award nominations; his band Years and Years, who had scored a string of huge hits in the 2010s, had been repurposed as his solo vehicle; and he was a star turn at the 2021 Brit awards, reclining on Elton John’s piano and singing the Pet Shop Boys song that gave the series its name, surrounded by drag queens and queer clubland luminaries.But the subsequent Years and Years album, Night Call, met with a muted response – it wasn’t a flop, but nor was it anything like as successful as its two predecessors – and last year Alexander gamely entered a Eurovision song contest that became mired in controversy over the presence of Israel. His song wound up coming 18th, provoking yet another round of why-oh-why handwringing about the UK’s dismal record in the contest, in which the Daily Telegraph excelled itself, opining that Alexander’s performance failed because it was too gay, thus presumably upsetting the many viewers who annually tune into Eurovision expecting a feast of unreconstructed heterosexuality.From sure-fire success to placing 18th at Eurovision: clearly, Polari is an album that needs to redress the balance.It’s produced by Danny L Harle, an impressive name to snare – his CV spans everything from Yeule to Liam Gallagher to Dua Lipa. Harle hails from the same PC Music collective as Charli xcx’s chief collaborator AG Cook, and at its best, Polari feels a little like Brat’s gay BFF, also shooting decades-old club music through a modern pop lens. But while Brat reworked the sound of the mid-00s illegal rave scene where Charli xcx began her career, Polari sets its sights further back, before either Alexander or Harle were born, to the music that predominated in mid-80s gay clubs and the mainstream pop it influenced.The four-on-the-floor beats and relentless low-end throb of Cupid’s Bow or Shadow of Love feel less rooted in house than the Hi-NRG that preceded it as the queer clubbers’ soundtrack of choice. As an added period detail, the latter track comes decorated with clanking, ominous electronics that recall the sound of Depeche Mode circa Some Great Reward (former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke actually turns up on Polari, producing Make Me a Man, although its combination of synthesiser and acoustic guitar more closely recalls his latterday outfit Erasure). The chugging Miss You So Much carries a distinct whiff of Italo disco. The album’s vocal effects eschew Auto-Tune in favour of the old-fashioned “n-n-n-n-nineteen” stammer: a sound that, like Polari’s preponderance of blaring, echoing synth stabs, automatically evokes the era when samplers first became widely available. It feels like a ballsy move to includeDizzy, the song with which Alexander came to grief in Eurovision – a fainter heart might have cut it from the album, as if the whole business in Malmö never happened – but its Pet Shop Boys and lyrical nods to Dead or Alive’s You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) make more sense in this context.View image in fullscreenCover art for Polari.Photograph: Richie TalboyBut context can’t make Dizzy a better song, which leads us to the first of Polari’s problems. There are really good things here: the writhing sound of Cupid’s Bow perfectly complements its lyrical exploration of cruising; Whisper in the Waves is a fabulously icy ballad; Miss You So Much has a far less cheesy melody than a lot of the Italo-disco records that inspired it. But other songs feel slight in comparison with their musical setting. Blaring synth stabs, stammering sampled vocals, rhythms that recall Hi-NRG … these are brash, bold sounds that need big melodies, but you get the feeling that Harle and Alexander were enjoying themselves so much deploying the former that sometimes they forgot to come up with the latter. Worse, there are points where the pair seem to lose faith in their vision and pull back into a more familiar space: When We Kiss and Heal You are worryingly close to the amiable but unremarkable 21st-century pop with which Radio 2 DJs pad out their shows.Alexander obviously wants the music he makes to have a certain edge – hence the collaboration with Harle – but clearly hankers after the kind of mainstream audience that prefer their pop edgeless: you don’t agree to Eurovision unless you’re after the aforementioned Radio 2 crowd. Squaring the two impulses isn’t impossible, but it’s undoubtedly difficult. Polari has its moments, but inthe languagethat gives it its title, it’s bona, rather than fantabulosa.This week Alexis listened toUwade – Call It a DrawThe Nigeria-born, North Carolina-raised sometime Fleet Foxes collaborator returns, marking out an entirely charming space between pop, alt-rock and the sparkling guitars of highlife.Explore more on these topicsOlly AlexanderAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Five years later, with an almost entirely different cast, it’s finally set for the full run this entertaining show deserves.You’ll look in vain for much of the upstairs-downstairs tension that made Mozart’s opera, and the Beaumarchais play it was based on, so edgy in 1786, when violent revolution was around the corner. That’s a loss – but in this multifaceted opera, not a dealbreaker. Instead, Hill-Gibbins focuses on the individual characters and the web of their shifting alliances.View image in fullscreenEasy to enjoy … Mary Bevan, Hanna Hipp and Nardus Williams in The Marriage of Figaro.Photograph: © Zoe MartinJohannes Schütz’s set is just a long, rectangular box with four white doors, which rises up for the scene in the Countess’s room and recedes for the garden act, lit in neon queasiness by Matthew Richardson. On one hand it’s a stylishly simple frame that focuses our attention on the characters; on the other, we might be in a farce set in a hotel corridor. You never know who’s waiting behind a closed door, or hiding behind one that’s wide open – but why would it be so scandalous for two of the characters to be caught alone together here?Still, if there’s little sense of claustrophobia or intimacy in the surroundings, the cast provides it in the way they stand next to each other, too close and too handsy, or crawl around the white walls in physical contortions that seem to embody their characters’ embarrassments. And the jokes land, thanks largely to the clarity with which almost everyone delivers Jeremy Sams’ snappy translation of Da Ponte’s libretto.Making his house debut, the conductor Ainārs Rubiķis keeps the orchestra sounding warm and fleet-footed, though there are moments when the music’s elastic stretches and doesn’t quite spring back into shape. The cast is led by David Ireland’s exasperated Figaro and Mary Bevan’s almost bullish Susanna, both stylishly sung. Putting on an English accent that’s one part Bullingdon to three parts Victor Meldrew, the US baritone Cody Quattlebaum captures all the Count’s entitlement, but the line of his singing is uneven and some syllables get lost. Hanna Hipp is a sparky Cherubino, her lovestruck song to the Countess a dreamily silly set piece with its own little dance routine. The supporting cast is strong, with stalwarts Neal Davies and Rebecca Evans well matched as Bartolo and Marcellina, Hubert Francis as a wide-boy Basilio and Ava Dodd as Barbarina, all micro-mini and Instaface.View image in fullscreenStylish singing … David Ireland as Figaro and Mary Bevan as Susanna.Photograph: © Zoe MartinCarrying herself like a swan among so many seagulls,Nardus Williamsis once again in glorious voice as the Countess, her two arias glowing centres of gravity amid the whirl of the story, though Bevan runs her close in the final act.

We Do Not Part is one of those books. Published last year in Swedish translation, it helped to secure Korean writerHan Kangthe 2024 Nobel prize in literature.Those who know Han’s work will recognise previous themes and methods here. Like the eponymous character in The Vegetarian, the narrator of We Do Not Part, Kyungha, is fragile and resilient. She finds it hard to sleep or eat, suffers from summer heat and winter cold, and endures terrible physical suffering for reasons that can be hard to understand. Both stories feature video artists, sisterly bonds, and nightmares of murder and bloodshed set in Korean woodlands.There are structural similarities, too.The Vegetarian(whose three distinct sections were originally published separately) moves from one to another point of view around the central, finally starving, figure of Yeong-hye. In We Do Not Part, each section gives way to something that feels stylistically very different, though there is only one narrator and the action takes place over the course of a few days. Each new movement is a shift in consciousness as the novel moves, not around some central mystery (why will Yeong-hye not eat?), but relentlessly towards a terrible historical truth. In order to open her character to the facts, Han needs to break her first, pushing her through suffering and difficulty into a new psychic space.After a small, searing accident, Kyungha’s friend Inseon asks her to travel to her home on Jeju Island to save her pet bird Ama from starvation. Kyungha, who lives a lonely life, immediately undertakes this tiny, sacred mission. She travels through a snowstorm, as the power grid fails and the transport system shuts down, her mind always on the flickering edge of a migraine. So extreme is the journey that, as she arrives at Inseon’s house, she seems to cross into a different reality, a world of shadows and of ghosts so real that Kyungha does not know if she herself is alive or suffering “the illusions of a dead soul”.Few writers are so unremitting on the subject of pain, which is, for Han, the truth of our mortalityThe facts that are so unsparingly uncovered in this shamanistic space concern the aftermath of the 1948 uprising on Jeju Island when 30,000 civilians were killed by anti-communist troops during the search for what Han describes as “one hundred guerrillas in the hills”. This was followed, she writes, by the murder of “two hundred thousand people” on the mainland the next summer, in a series of “exterminations” in the lead-up to the Korean war. The bodies of the slain were washed out to sea, hidden in a cobalt mine, or they remain curled in pits under the modern runway of the island airport. Those who sought the bones of their dead were severely punished. In its insistence on speaking of these things, We Do Not Part resemblesHuman Acts, Han’s third book to appear in English translation, which told of the May 1980 massacre in Gwangju, when student protests were suppressed during a period of martial law. In both books, atrocity yields, on the page, to images of the human soul as bird and shadow.Few writers are so unremitting on the subject of pain, which is, for Han, the truth of our mortality. Her impulse is compassionate, but it is bound to a concern with beauty and coldness. LikeThe White Book, which opens with the tragic death of a newborn, We Do Not Part enters a whiteout and it layers many images of blankness, as if to rehearse the chill and nonexistence of death itself.If this sounds daunting, it reads wonderfully well. The first two movements of the book are a masterclass of poetic control. We are given some facts about Kyungha’s friend, Inseon; their work together, the accident in her workshop, the trip to the hospital. Only as you read deeper into the book do you realise how carefully placed these details were, how each will become freighted with meaning, until their thematic promise is almost unbearably fulfilled. Nothing is wasted or left undone. Each image settles lightly, but the cumulative weight makes it hard to breathe.“I walk, feeling a strange compulsion to match my steps to the pace of the drifting snow, which itself seems synchronised to the passage of time.” The passages about snow work by repetition, variation and slow accumulation: dangerous tricks that in other hands might lapse into the meaningless or the banal. Here they are relentlessly beautiful, increasingly terrible, and always simple. It is a relief to know that the slow fall of this section will not last for ever. “If the distance between the clouds and the ground were infinite,” she writes, “the snowflakes too would grow to infinity, but in reality the descent never takes longer than an hour.”Kyungha describes how spaces within the snow crystal absorb and trap sound, how by reflecting light in myriad directions “it appears colourless, it appears white”. Han’s palette is perfectly controlled. We see white snow, white waves, white thread, a ground crosshatched by the ink strokes of handwriting and by trees stained with “gradations of black”. Clothing is “the colour of rice”, 15 years without sunlight leaves a man “pale as a mushroom”, night is “a sea of ink”, light is blue-grey, pewter and ashen. This field of muted colour is slashed by a shocking series of reds: the blood of Inseon’s relatives frozen on the ground, the glowing slits in a wood stove, red silk wrapped around boxes of files, the earth of a ransacked village stained with burst pots of gochujang sauce. When Kyungha finally asks what the soldiers needed “to exterminate”, the answer comes as political colour: “The reds.”We Do Not Part is both act of witness and a beautiful poetic object. There are repeated images of birds, candle flame, trees. Even as family relationships become tangled or undone, the novel is bound together by a secret web of lines, of nerves “like silk” and cotton threads, and this lacework expresses the theme of connection in the title. At one point in her journey, Kyungha encounters a blank-eyed older woman, and their separation leaves an emotional mark: “She is neither kin nor acquaintance. She’s only a stranger I happened to stand beside at a bus stop. Why then do I feel in turmoil, as if I have just bid someone farewell?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Though people leave, their presences remain, and these ghosts are everywhere. Trees have fronds “like sleeves”. The massacred crowd becomes a forest of blackened trunks that are also seen as “pillars of ash”. They have “bodies spun from wind”, that pierce Inseon like thousands of needles, producing a “profound, uncanny euphoria”: grief working close to transcendence as pleasure is to pain.In the newspaper clippings and research files she finds in the Jeju house, Kyungha senses “something oozing from the page”. Blood runs “beneath the numbers” of the dead. A presence “like the faintest of voices” emanates from the text. This last made the hair stand up on the back of my neck: I thought for a moment that the book in my hand was haunted. It is a rare privilege to read a masterpiece so recently crafted, to know that the new prose you are reading (too fast!) will endure.

She’s blowing out her cheek with the effort and the wallpaper stripes march by as regular as her slaps. She’s looking out at us from the picture and her one hand raised could almost be waving hello. Everything is rendered plain as a picture book, with flat, coloured-in outlines and not much modelling. The longer I look, the stranger Noah Davis’s Bad Boy For Life feels.The artist was 24 when he painted it. He’d already been painting seriously since his teens in Seattle. A year later he painted The Architect, in which the eponymous figure sits on the far side of a model of some grandiose architectural scheme, which looks like a pile of bricks set on a ziggurat. Based on a photograph of celebrated Black architect Paul Revere Williams, the work has him leaning forward, as if explaining his model to a client, but his head is veiled by swipes and drools of white on the painting’s surface, which dribble down over the model. There’s something cartoonish, like an exploded “thinks …” bubble, in the air between us and the architect, his thoughts and explanations spattering the air.View image in fullscreenBroken promise … 40 Acres and a Unicorn.Photograph: Photo: Anna Arca/Courtesy The Estate of Noah Davis and David ZwirnerThat unsettling strangeness never left Davis’s work. He was enormously prolific. In a career that was all too brief, sometimes you think he’d just got going when he died of a rare form of soft tissue cancer at 32. Davis left more than 400 paintings and a slew of curatorial projects, exhibition plans and unrealised ideas. What he was really good at was the telling, fundamentally mysterious image. A man rides a unicorn, instead of a mule, across the blank black terrain of those 40 acres of land freed Black slaves were promised but never got. In the gloom of early evening, an ensemble of ballerinas dance in the open spaces between the buildings in an LA housing project, and an orchestral conductor stands on a chair in the gloom, conducting nothing.Whether he was painting a man walking to work, people waiting for the lights at a crossing or a Black girl wearing a white Halloween mask sitting on her bed in a room with a lurid red wall, Davis imbued everything with a kind of painted-ness that redirects us into a labyrinth. Full of humour and observation, social commentary, and innumerable cultural and autobiographical references – from the ritual bear pit humiliations of reality TV shows to Egyptian mythology, from the novels of Richard Brautigan to a scene borrowed from Hitchcock – Davis’s work is full of jump-cuts and diversions.Shuttling between figuration and high abstraction – snatches of Mondrian, Fellini-esque fantasies played out amid poor housing and trashed yards – even the simplest of Davis’s paintings are brimming with ideas. The details snag you. A girl whose long white socks have been painted in a thick impasto of patterings and daubs reminds me of early Robert Ryman. The walls behind the guy on the sidewalk are softened, thinned-down humming rectangles, reminiscent of mid-period Rothko. There are echoes everywhere.View image in fullscreenConstantly working … Davis inLos Angeles, 2009.Photograph: Patrick O’Brien-SmithDavis looked to painters of an earlier generation while finding his own voice. Marlene Dumas, Luc Tuymans and Peter Doig were significant in the mix of his developing art. Television and movie stills, found photographs and art history, have played significant roles in the work of all of them, Davis included. Nothing comes out of nothing, and Davis was clearly voracious, and more than a fanboy. His paintings are unmistakably his own.View image in fullscreenFull of humour and social commentary … Pueblo del Rio: Arabesque.Photograph: Kerry McFate/Courtesy The Estate of Noah Davis and David ZwirnerDavis also responded to the particular moment. During the campaign leading up to Barack Obama’s first presidential win in 2008, Davis adopted a mandarin modernist pose, painting flat, quasi-geometric shapes floating on bare linen backgrounds, the forms all taken from the shapes of battleground swing states (Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico) during the previous presidential race in 2004, the peachy purple colour of the forms a mix of Democratic blue and Republican red. Only one of these paintings survive (he painted over the canvases of two of them), and it hangs in a bay in the Barbican’s upper gallery. Bright rectangles of light projected on the adjacent walls signal the missing paintings. This, I think, is a curatorial misstep in an exhibition that is already complicated by its desire to show the breadth of Davis’s work, including his curatorial projects and source material.Another single painting occupies a different bay, hanging against midnight blue walls. The reference here is much more personal. It is night. A man stands in a cleft in the rocks, a kerosene lamp dangling from his hand. He’s on the verge of something, looking out into a night spangled with stars.Paintingfor My Dad (2011) was made while Davis’s father was dying from cancer.View image in fullscreenPersonal tribute … Painting for My Dad.Photograph: Kerry McFate/Courtesy The Estate of Noah Davis and David ZwirnerA year later, with money from his father, Davis and his wife Karon, a sculptor and performer, founded the Underground Museum, a storefront space in Los Angeles’s Arlington Heights district. Davis painted and showed his work here, and hung out, often with his elder brother, filmmaker Kahlil Joseph, with whom he had previously worked on a spoof of highflown art magazine October, which they calledFeb Mag.Joseph showed his acclaimed double screen music video with Kendrick Lamar, Good kid m.A.A.d. city at the Underground Museum in 2014. Wanting to bring culture to the predominantlyBlack and Latinx neighbourhood, Davis lobbied museums to lend artworks to the space and was met with a resounding refusal. In 2013 he decided to improvise, and remade works “in imitation” of things he wanted to borrow. He used standard strip lights in imitation of Dan Flavin, a regular bottle rack stood-in for a Marcel Duchamp readymade, and a Hoover vacuum cleaner (bought on eBay) placed in a fluorescent-lit vitrine emulated a work by Jeff Koons.There was a fake Robert Smithson (using sand and mirrors from a hardware store) and his own version of an On Karawa date painting. The show was called Imitation of Wealth, and has been faithfully – or perhaps unfaithfully – recreated at the Barbican. Already ill, Davis met Helen Molesworth, the then-chief curator of the LA Museum of ContemporaryArt, who championed his mission to borrow and show works from the museum’s collection, and his first project (Davis devised 18, but the Underground Museum foundered after his death) was a showing of white South African artist William Kentridge’s 2003 Journey to the Moon, a film combining live action and animation, the everyday and the fantastical. This too is given a space of its own at the Barbican.View image in fullscreenThe artist is incomplete … Untitled, 2015.Photograph: Kerry McFate/(c) The Estate of Noah Davis Courtesy The Estate of Noah Davis and David ZwirnerDavis’s current retrospective covers a mere eight years, the last works made during the final months of the artist’s life. A large group of photo-collages, with snatches of paint, were made from his hospital bed (he made 70 during his stay), and he went on to make a number of large paintings in his final months, including one depicting a funeral, another of an intimate domestic scene with a pair of young Black women on a couch, and a seated male figure cropped by the painting’s edge. We only see his trousers and sneakers, and something like a blanket over his knees. Like the veil in front of The Architect’s face, the white paint dribbles over the surface. The figure is on the way out, incomplete.It is impossible to look at Davis’s work without the intrusion of his early death. Inevitably, it gives this exhibition a sense of poignancy. Davis is forever a young artist on his way, caught up in the middle of things, when everything seemed possible.Explore more on these topicsPaintingBarbicanArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

The adults withhold the children’s original names, and call them after birds. Nightingale’s watchfulness is notable among her peers. She understands the children’s situation: “They are nothing now, and they are nowhere.”Flash forward more than two decades to 1894 London, and the reader encounters Inspector Cutter, his sergeant, Gideon Bliss, and their ally, journalist Octavia Hillingdon. Just as Nightingale is moulded by her isolated, nameless environment, so London shapes Cutter, Bliss and Hillingdon. As Cutter puts it: “London is the belly of a beast that has flung its claws too wide. Its treasures are heaped on a midden, where bodies with hatchets in their backs have been piling up for a thousand years.” His language elsewhere – “You creeping streak of nursling’s shite” – could land him a role in a Victorian version of The Thick of It.O’Donnell’s virtuosic style, a mashup of Henry James and Frankie Boyle, is worth the admission price aloneCutter declares that he might soon be London’s latest victim: “Within the next hour, Bliss, someone of our acquaintance will come through that door. He will be coming to give me the name of a dead man, and that name might well be my own.”Instead, the victim is Sir Aneurin Considine, one of several high-profile Londoners who turn up dead. Is it the privileged offing the privileged? “There is nothing our betters enjoy more than knifing each other.” Enter Mrs Lytton, niece of Considine, who fancies herself one of the “people of consequence”. She is blunt about how one becomes consequential. “We have our places, because we whored out the right daughter, or we lay still under the right dotard, or we paid for the right war.” O’Donnell’s virtuosic style, a mashup of Henry James and Frankie Boyle, is worth the admission price alone.Cutter, Bliss and Hillingdon press on with the investigation, pursued as much as pursuing. After a clandestine journey, the three arrive at the Natural History Museum’s gallery of birds. Here life-and-death movements take place in the shadows, in obscured alcoves, with double-quick speed, preventing even those present being certain of exactly what has happened. The murderer “pivots like a vane in a storm”, possessing a “gift for going unseen”.If only abuse of women and children by employers, politicians, the wealthy and entitled were fictional rather than perennial. The novel speaks to the present as well as the Victorian era; the 47th US president once said: “When you’re a star … you can do anything.” Nightingale retorts: “It always comes down to mastery with men of that kind. Nothing ever left untouched.”Bruce Krajewski is translator and editor of Salomo Friedlaender’s Kant for Children.The Naming of the Birds by Paraic O’Donnell is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson (£20).

Avalanche (1978)Like many a Hollywood star, Farrow took part in a 1970s disaster movie. In this Roger Corman production she’s in a love triangle with Rock Hudson, whose ski resort lies under an avalanche-prone mountain, and environmentalist Robert Forster, whose warnings are ignored. What happens next won’t surprise you.19. John and Mary (1969)View image in fullscreenZero chemistry … Mia Farrow and Dustin Hoffman in John and Mary.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyHot off Rosemary’s Baby and Midnight Cowboy, respectively, Farrow and Dustin Hoffman team up for a one-night stand, with the getting-to-know-you part coming after the sex. John Mortimer’s screenplay tries to channel the permissiveness of late-1960s Hollywood, but fails miserably, not helped by zero chemistry between the two leads.18. The Omen (2006)Billie Whitelaw in the 1976 original is a hard act to follow, but Farrow turns her scary dial all the way up to 11 as Mrs Baylock, the nanny from hell. She’s part of a classy cast that makes this needless remake more than just tolerable.17. September (1987)From Interiors onwards,Woody Allenexpunged all comedy from his “serious” oatmeal-hued homages to his heroes, Ingmar Bergman and (as here) Anton Chekhov. Farrow plays a suicidal woman whose plans to sell her holiday home in Vermont are scuppered by her mother, a former actor with a dark secret. Uncle Vanya is a lot funnier.16. A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy (1982)In 1906, half a dozen rich folk gather in upstate New York for amorous shenanigans. The first of Farrow’s 13 films with Woody Allen is a pastiche of Ingmar Bergman’s Smiles of a Summer Night. It’s sophisticated fluff, but as Ariel, free-spirited fiancee of a much older geezer, Mia has rarely looked lovelier.15. Alice (1990)After her supporting role in Crimes and Misdemeanors, Allen bumped Farrow up to leading lady again in a whimsical chamber piece about a spoilt socialite for whom a Chinese herbal remedy has drastic side effects. Minor Woody, but a reminder thatmost of his career was spent writing nuanced female characters, as opposed to the dimwitted bimbos ofhis later oeuvre.14. Death on the Nile (1978)View image in fullscreenHigh-camp larks … Peter Ustinov and Mia Farrow in Death on the Nile.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyForget the 2022 remake, which never comes close to reproducing the high-camp larks of this ace Agatha Christie mystery. Peter Ustinov does Poirot duties when an heiress is murdered on a paddle steamer. Farrow is part of an all-star cast of suspects that also includes Bette Davis and Angela Lansbury.13. Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989)Allen plays a documentary-maker with a crush on a TV producer, played by Farrow, but their story feels like a featherweight afterthought next to the other half of his darkest film, in which an opthalmologist takes out a hit on an inconvenient lover.12. Full Circle (1977)This adaptation of an early Peter Straub novel begins with Farrow giving an acting masterclass in panic as she botches a breakfast-table tracheotomy on her daughter. Afterwards, the traumatised mother starts thinking her London house is haunted by the child’s ghost. But no, it’s worse, and characters start dropping dead as a malevolent force kicks in.11. A Dandy in Aspic (1968)View image in fullscreenIngenuous … Laurence Harvey and Mia Farrow in Anthony Mann’s A Dandy in Aspic.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyFarrow received third billing, after Laurence Harvey and Tom Courtenay, for her role as a perky, Pierre Cardin-clad photographer in Anthony Mann’s film of Derek Marlowe’s existential spy thriller. (Harvey took over as director after Mann died of a heart attack before the end of filming.) Her relentless ingenuousness only adds to the antihero’s paranoia.10. Another Woman (1988)Allen’s film about middle-aged female regret is very much the Gena Rowlands show, photographed by Sven Nykvist in shades of beige. She is sensational as a 50-ish philosophy professor, but the tremulous vulnerability of Farrow’s voice plays a pivotal role since it’s the prof’s eavesdropping on her therapy sessions that makes her re-evaluate her own life.9. Blind Terror (1971)In 1970, Farrow married conductorAndré Previn, gave birth to twins and acted on the London stage. Somehow she also found time to play a blind woman who gropes her way around her uncle’s house, only to find everyone dead. There’s a killer on the loose! A straightforward thriller that delivers the goods, with Mia the epitome of a woman in peril.8. Husbands and Wives (1992)View image in fullscreenEnd of an era … Judy Davis (left), Woody Allen and Mia Farrow in Husbands and Wives.Photograph: Ronald GrantThis portrait of a disintegrating marriage marks the end of a golden run of collaborations between Farrow and Allen, but has acquired extra piquancy since their bust-up. In their earlier films, she was winsome; here, she is a passive-aggressive manipulator. One thing is clear: since 1992, neither has come anywhere near to recapturing the magic of their work together.7. The Great Gatsby (1974)Jack Clayton’s film of F Scott Fitzgerald’s novel gets drunk on its own 1920s period detail, and Robert Redford is more like a film star on sabbatical than a man with a shady past. But Farrow is perfect as shallow Daisy, looking so adorable in beaded headgear and flapper frocks (loose-fitting enough to hide her pregnancy during filming) that you can understand his fixation on her.6. Zelig (1983)View image in fullscreenPioneering ... Mia Farrow and Woody Allen in Zelig.Photograph: ScreenProd/Photononstop/AlamyA chameleonic mystery man crops up in old newsreel footage from the Jazz Age to Yankee Stadium in Allen’s pioneering found-footage mockumentary. Farrow co-stars as his psychiatrist, Dr Eudora Fletcher, who uses hypnosis to explore his condition, falls in love with her patient, and rescues him from Nazi Germany.5. Secret Ceremony (1968)Her marriage to Frank Sinatra was on the rocks when Farrow put on a long dark wig to play the unstable Cenci in Joseph Losey’s mad gothic arthouse melodrama filmed in a fabulous London location:Debenham House. Elizabeth Taylor plays a sex worker who becomes her surrogate mother, while Robert Mitchum is a sleazy uncle. It flopped, but has accrued a following over the years.4. Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)View image in fullscreenMatriarchal … Mia Farrow (left), Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest in Hannah and Her Sisters.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/AlamyOne of Allen’s most perfectly balanced films, this revolves around Farrow, at her most matriarchal as the den-mother bossing her family around at Thanksgiving, but unaware her own husband (Michael Caine) is lusting after her sister. Offscreen, meanwhile, Mia was busy giving birth to or adoptingchildren, some with Woody’s help, and would end up with 14 of them.3. Broadway Danny Rose (1984)Farrow comes out blasting as a brassy gum-chewing mob widow involved with a has-been lounge singer in Allen’s poignant comedy about a two-bit talent agent who cares, almost too deeply, for his oddball acts. This was the film that showed definitively there was more to Mia than the waiflike characters she had been playing, on and off, since 1964’s Peyton Place.2. The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)Allen gave Farrow her most heartbreaking role in this bittersweet romantic fantasy set during the Great Depression. A mousy waitress seeks escape from her abusive marriage by going to the movies, until one day the leading man steps out of the screen and woos her in the real world. It’s impossible not to start blubbing during Mia’s exquisite final closeup.1. Rosemary’s Baby (1968)When she was cast as the lead in Roman Polanski’s adaptation of Ira Levin’s novel, Farrow was already Hollywood royalty (her parents were Maureen O’Sullivan andJohn Farrow), for her role in TV’s Peyton Place, and for her marriage to Sinatra, who served her with divorce papers on set. As the nice Catholic wife forced to bear the devil’s baby, she draws us into every aspect of her psychological and physical ordeal, pausing only to get one of the most famous pixie crops in cinema history. One of the all-time great horror film performances.Explore more on these topicsRankedMia FarrowWoody AllenDrama filmsRosemary's BabyShareReuse this content"

All around us, the jagged peaks of the Vanoise massif pierce the sky, glinting in the clear morning light. As we walk, Matthieu, my snowshoeing guide, points out fresh tracks – mountain hare, roe deer, fox – and on the mountainside we spy ibex: first a lone male, then a group surveying us from on high.Champagny-le-Haut, a 1,500-metre-high glacial valley in the French Alps close to the Italian border, is the gateway to theVanoise national park. In summer it offers pristine mountain hikes and waterfalls, while in winter, with snow closing the road beyond the pretty hamlet of Le Bois where I’m staying, it’s a frozen, protected wonderland. A world away from the busy ski resorts elsewhere in La Plagne, it’s perfect for a more low-key, affordable winter holiday in the heart of nature.View image in fullscreenJane Dunford snowshoeing at Le Bois.Photograph: Jane DunfordAt Friburge, the next hamlet along, we pass a tiny church, almost swallowed by snow. Icicles the size of my forearm hang from shut-up chalets. Just one family lives here year-round, says Matthieu.The sense of being engulfed by the wild is heightened at my campsite base, on the edge of Le Bois. It’s owned by Huttopia, a French family-run business known for its eco-credentials and sites deep in nature – inspired by camps in Canada’s national parks. It’s open here in winter for the first time, with eight new wooden cabins dotted beneath snow-laden larch trees. Each sleeps six, with a spacious living and kitchen area, two double bedrooms downstairs and a mezzanine in the eaves. There’s a terrace covered by the oversized gable roof, with table and benches, and nice touches like toboggans and free use of snowshoes. A restaurant opens at the weekends.Le Bois itself, on the banks of the Doron river, is picturesque, with a church, smattering of houses and theEspace Glacialisin what was the priest’s house. Interactive displays tell the story of glaciers, their shaping of the landscape and human life – and their fragility (photos show dramatic shrinking locally over recent decades). It is Unesco’sinternational year of glaciers’ preservationin 2025, and several educational events are planned here too.I’m cocooned by the silence, the mountains still visible through the trees beyond my window. It’s my kind of apres-skiChampagny is part of the wider La Plagne area – awarded a “Flocon Vert” (green snowflake) for its sustainability efforts last year, from policies to reduce carbon emissions to wildlife protection initiatives. Visitors are encouraged to come by train, and I’d travelled from London to Paris on Eurostar and onwards to Chambéry and Moûtiers (about a half-hour taxi ride from Le Bois). It takes a day, but the gentle pace, with the landscape slowly changing, suits my sleepy final destination.But while it may be laid-back, there is plenty to do. Le Bois is a centre for cross-country skiing, with 24km of clearly signposted tracks of varying difficulty weaving around the valley (different routes are earmarked for snowshoeing and hiking). At the Nordic chalet in the village centre there are maps, but ski equipment (and guides) must be booked inChampagny-en-Vanoise, further down the valley at 1,250 metres. Le Bois has an area for tobogganing too, dog sledding and horse riding can be arranged, and each year a large igloo is crafted, its icy interior intricately carved with cartoon characters.View image in fullscreenThe Champagny ice tower offers climbers a 22m high climbing challenge.Photograph: Olivier AllamandAs night falls I wander up toRefuge du Bois, a cosy chalet with restaurant and dorms, run this season by young “guardians” Emma and Antoine. The Savoyard menu features local classics and lots of cheese – the fondue is warming and filling.The next day I take the free shuttle bus back down the valley to Champagny-en-Vanoise. It’s a windy 5km drive through steep gorges with views of Courchevel in the distance. It feels like an authentic village, with little of the rampant tourist development seen elsewhere in the Alps. There’s a surprisingly large swimming pool (the roof retracts in summer for spectacular mountain views) and spa, while the Church of St Sigismond has an impressive baroque gold altar dating from 1710 (“built with money from cheese!” says my guide).From the village centre, a cable car whizzes visitors up to 1,970metres and the expansive slopes of La Plagne and Paradiski. It’s the first time I’ve skied for years, but under the patient tuition of my instructor, Bruno, I tackle the plentiful blue runs (there is something for all levels in this vast snowy playground, with great ski touring and off-piste too). Skiing developed here from the 1960s, and we pass several of La Plagne’s varied resorts, known for their distinctive retro style. We stop for lunch away from the crowds inChalet du Plan Bois, a delightful family-run place with wonderful views and cuisine to match (from salad with pear and goats cheese tocassolette d’escargotsand Savoy sausage in wine).

It’s my kind of apres-ski.Champagny-le-Haut is sheltered from the sun for most of the winter, making it the perfect location for an unusual attraction – a 22-metreice tower. Used for the UIAA Ice Climbing World Cup, it looks like a sculpture, made of steel and wood, with sprayed water frozen in cascades. It’s open for lessons to anyone over 10, and I sign up for a session with mountain guide Damien.

I glide beside streams, weaving through the forest, and manage not to fall, my limbs satisfyingly achy after a couple of hours, my face tingling from the fresh air.That night a full moon lights the valley. There’s no need for a torch as I walk up to the Refuge du Bois for dinner. Later, I sit outside my cabin beneath the trees, drinking in the beauty of it all until the cold gets the better of me, the busyness of the world a distant memory.The trip was provided byLa Plagne.

In these fancier coffee spots, everyone’s dependable, unfussy go-to is being eclipsed by a newer import from Australia and New Zealand: the long black.Conducting an unofficial survey of coffee spots, I noticed nearly every barista had a slightly different explanation of the drink. “It’s basically exactly the same as an americano,” one whispered conspiratorially. “It’s a shorter black coffee, the same size as a flat white,” explained another. The final barista I spoke to just shook her head in quiet disappointment when I asked if long black was just a more pretentious way of asking for an americano.What is the difference between a long black and an americano? Last year, 2.1 million people watcheda viral Instagram reel from the coffee shop Tamp, in Chiswick, west London, which asked that exact question.Despite its name, a long black is shorter than an americano, but some baristas also swear by adding the espresso second, on top of the hot water. This ensures that “the hot water is slightly cooler in the cup and closer in temperature to the espresso that’s coming out of the machine”, explains Ollie Simon, of the New Zealand-founded speciality roaster Allpress. “If you’re pouring hot water straight on to espresso, you’re agitating the drink, and losing some of the more volatile aromas and flavours.”View image in fullscreenA long black is prepared at Laynes in Leeds.Photograph: LaynesLeeds speciality coffee shop Laynes also adds the espresso second. “It’s a faster way to do it, and espresso is meant to be quick,” says owner Dave Olejnik. “When you wallop a load of hot water on to an espresso, you also start to break down some of the structure, texture, and the crema, which sits across the top. Honestly, you just get a better-looking drink if you brew coffee into water.”Sales of the long black have been steadily rising in the UK. In 2023, according to one small survey, it was London’s fifth most popular coffee order, and accounted for 9% of all sales in the capital. Kaffeine, in Soho, has been selling long blacks since it opened in 2009. Owner Peter Dore-Smith was born in Melbourne, but is a long-term Londoner. Along with nearby Flat White (founded by Australians and New Zealanders, and widely credited with first popularising flat whites in the UK), his shop is a key fixture in London’s antipodean coffee scene. He also reckons that he was among the very first people to sell long blacks inLondon. “I should open a shop called Long Black, shouldn’t I?” he laughs. “That’s what everyone comes here for.”Dore-Smith ushers me behind the bar to watch Katarina, one of his senior baristas, in action. She uses an upturned espresso mug to bring everything nearer to the spout, and brews into a 5oz cup with hot water: the same size you would typically use for a flat white. Aside from size, most of these things don’t have much effect on taste, she explains, but it all helps to make your cuppa look nicer at the end. This is important when you don’t have the canvas of flashy latte art to play with.“You’ll see there’s quite a remarkable difference in the flavour profile,” Dore-Smith says. He’s right; with a long black, the flavour of the beans is clearer and much more vibrant, with notes of blackberry, caramel and nuttiness all coming through. In comparison, the americano feels weak and watery. I’m sold.View image in fullscreenKaffeine’s version of the long black.Photograph: Kaffeine“Everybody is basically like: whoa, that’s so much better,” Dore-Smith says. “I’ve noticed, working behind the bar, that the long black is increasing in popularity, and it’s much more prevalent.” Sales of the drink at Kaffeine crept up by 4% from November to mid-January, while black coffee in general is also proving more popular.“I’d liken it to people moving from big lattes down to flat whites,” says Olejnik. “Moving from big americanos down to long blacks feels like a mirror movement, if you like.”Like the flat white, the long black originated in Australia or New Zealand, depending on who you ask. The two countries are renowned for their high-quality brews; if a spot is owned by an Australian or a New Zealander, it’s usually a pretty solid indicator that the coffee will be on point.Dore-Smith attributes the influence of Australian coffee to the wave of Italians who immigrated to Australia in the 1950s and 60s and brought their knowledge of espresso-brewing with them. He also thinks the country’s geography and “very strong anti-drink-driving culture” play their part. “If you want to go out and meet a mate in London, you go to the pub, have a few pints and get the train home,” he says. But in many parts of Australia with poorer public transport, “you have to drive home,” he says. “So you go out and get a really good cup of coffee instead.”The £5 coffee is coming – but should we swallow it?Read moreNew Zealanders think along the same lines. “Public transport is not a big thing, so you catch up over coffee rather than a pint,” says Simon, who is originally from Auckland. He also offers up the theory that the coffee scene in the two countries has developed in relative isolation. “I don’t want to say it evolved in a bubble, but being so far away, it has kind of done its own thing.”“They’re far less influenced by what I would consider American cafe culture,” says Olejnik, “the Starbucks-ification of coffee, and putting a huge drink in your hand with a great big comfy sofa. That culture didn’t land down there in quite the same way.” Instead, it’s about “fine-tuning the original Italian espresso bar menu, and the notion that there’s value in high quality, as opposed to high quantity,” he says. “It has had huge implications for global coffee-drinking culture.”As Aussie and New Zealand coffee creeps on to more menus in the UK, will the long black start to become as popular as the flat white? The drink is yet to break into any of the UK’s major high street coffee chains. In 2010, Costa became the first high street chain to introduce the flat white to its menu; it is now one of the brand’s most popular orders. Still, it has no plans to introduce long blacks, a spokesperson confirmed. So the antipodeans have not yet staged a complete coup – but if you’re a seasoned americano drinker, you might consider switching your order up.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
