You’d have thought that after their experience of the last week in which they were forced to make not one, but two U-turn concessions to secure the support of MPs over the welfare bill,Labourwould have been after a little down time. A chance to build bridges with its own backbenchers. A moment to regroup and hope the media can run stories about something other than where it all went wrong for Labour in its first year. Or just a chance to run down the clock to recess in a fortnight’s time. Then everyone in Westminster can go home for six weeks. Give us all a chance to forget.But that’s not the style of this government. No sooner has one row ended – well, just about; there may still be some on both sides who want afters – than Labour opens up another one. This time, the target isn’t adults, it’s children. Which makes the education secretary,Bridget Phillipson, either very brave or very stupid. As a general rule, picking on kids is not a vote-winner.No matter. On her media round on Sunday, Bridget very deliberately refused to guarantee there would be no cuts in her planned changes to special educational needs and disability (Send) provision. When the early years education minister, Stephen Morgan, was asked the same questions on Monday he too refused to rule out any changes.Now, Send is not perfect. The bill is getting bigger by the year, thanks both to better diagnosis and to some parents gaming the system. But it is essential for many children who benefit from education, health and care plans, and parents are worried sick they might lose out. In the absence of any clear direction from theDepartment for Education, many disability campaigners are fearing the worst. That children will be treated as cost centres to be downsized. That children diagnosed in the future won’t be entitled to the same benefits as children with the same level of disability are now. This one will now run and run well into the autumn.The Guardian view on special needs reform: children’s needs must be the priority as the system is redesigned | EditorialRead moreTo be fair, going for pensioners over winter fuel allowance, then adults with disabilities over personal independence payments and now children over Send probably wasn’t high on anyone’s radar for Labour values. Then, what do we know? But one party most definitely living its values is Reform. Its policy for migration is one in and one out. Which is exactly the same policy it seems to adopt in regard to its parliamentary party.At the last election, Reform won five seats. That then dropped to four when Rupert Lowe lost the party whip for either – take your pick – threatening to be more popular than Nigel Farage or being too obviously unpleasant to foreigners. Then Reform went back to five as Sarah Pochin won the Runcorn byelection. Now it’s back down to four as James McMurdock has resigned the whip while some Covid loans he took out are investigated. Who could possibly have guessed Reform’s vetting procedures might not be totally fit for purpose?Not that Nige was taking any personal responsibility for Young James. Rather, he was throwing him and his long-suffering sidekick, Dicky Tice, to the wolves as he made a visit to see how his councillors in Kent were getting along. James was nothing to do with him, he said. Dicky had been running the party at the start of the last election campaign and he had had nothing to do with vetting candidates. It was all Dicky’s fault. Everything always is. Dicky’s job is to be Nige’s punchbag. His reward to enjoy brief moments of reflected glory.Luckily for the Tories, they have currently ditched most of their values – certainly the ones around credibility and responsibility – and so are free to do whatever they want, whenever they want. So on Monday afternoon, the shadow chancellor,Mel Stride, was in the Commons to ask an urgent question of his opposite number about the government’s performance against the fiscal rules.To everyone else, this appeared the height of cheek. Not to say hypocrisy. After all, the Tories had raced through seven different sets of fiscal rules in 14 years as they ran the economy into the ground. But the Melster is yet another of the current breed of politicians who lives entirely in the present. He thinks a year of failing to apologise for bankrupting the nation is more than enough. So no more shows of fake contrition from theConservatives. He now demands to be seen as the voice of reason, even though he knows and understands little about macroeconomics. Though he is the best the Tories currently have.So Mel gabbled out his questions. How was Labour planning to fill the £6bn black hole it had dug for itself during last week’s welfare U-turn? Did it even know or was it just keeping it a secret? What followed was one of the more pointless 45 minutes anyone has spent in the Commons recently. Because we all learned precisely nothing. As was always going to be the way. If the roles had been reversed, it would have been the Tories saying nothing.As it happened, Rachel Reeves had decided to go awol for this UQ. Maybe she felt it was too soon to return to the Commons. Or just didn’t fancy wasting her time. So in her place, we got the chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones. In opposition, Dazza appeared to be the real deal. Sharp, bright and always ready to hold the government to account. In office, he’s become many of the things he used to dislike. Condescending among them.There are ways of saying that you have no intention of engaging with the details of any question. That it is government policy not to comment on day-to-day performance and that all spending commitments will be revealed in the autumn budget. But Darren managed to do so with a lack of grace. It could have been the time for humour. To remind the opposition of the damage that Liz the Lettuce had done. Instead, he chose just to be boorish and patronising. Let’s hope this is a one-off. Not a new Labour value.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsThe politics sketchBridget PhillipsonSpecial educational needsDepartment for EducationLabourReform UKMel StridecommentShareReuse this content"

In nearby Montpelier Square in Knightsbridge, less than a 10-minute walk from Harrods department store, nine houses are on the open market.Huge price reductions do not appear to be working either, with some homes lingering unsold for months and even years despite repeated reductions. One six-bedroom Chester Square townhouse has been on the market since 2022, despite its price being slashed by £4m – almost a quarter of its original £17.5m listing.One possible reason for this luxury property glut has been echoing loudly in City boardrooms and the offices of Mayfair advisers in recent months: the world’s footloose super-rich are starting to lose interest in the UK, put off by Labour’s tax changes. After Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 halted the flow of wealthy Russians, some claim Labour’s non-doms tax has sent the global elite fleeing the UK for cities such as Milan, Singapore, Geneva and Dubai.At the heart of their complaint is the abolition of the centuries-old non-dom regime, which allowed wealthy foreign people to avoid paying tax on money they were earning outside the UK, and avoid paying inheritance tax on their global assets.ChartSuch is the concern that Rachel Reeves is reportedly consideringsoftening changes to the inheritance tax aspect of the non-doms clampdown. But that comes amid speculation about more tax rises in the autumn budget,after Labour’s U-turn on its welfare bill left a£5bn hole in the chancellor’s fiscal plan- with wealth taxes increasingly popular among some campaigners and theleft of the party.A colonial era relicIt was under the lastConservative government that Jeremy Hunt laid out plans to replace the 225-year-old non-doms system, a relic of Britain’s colonial era.Introduced under King George III in 1799, it allowed subjects who had been born in Britain’s colonies to live in England without paying tax on their foreign rents and stocks so long as the money remained abroad.After winning last year’s election, Labour went a step further by also exposing their overseas assets to the UK’s inheritance tax. The death duty is levied at a rate of 40% and, although it comes with a basket of allowances and exemptions, it is one of the highest in the world.Under the new regime, non-doms’ foreign income and gains are subject to UK tax after four years rather than the previous 15. A new residence-based system means also that their global assets are subject to inheritance tax after 10 years.It is this inheritance tax element that has been the “emotional trigger” for non-doms, tax experts and chief executives say. One financial services CEO said older wealthy clients in particular were relocating abroad to escape the death duty.Several prominent non-dom departures have captured headlines: Shravin Bharti Mittal, an heir of one of India’s richest families; Nassef Sawiris, the Egyptian investor; and Richard Gnodde, a veteran Goldman Sachs banker.One Indian non-dom, who has been living in the UK for the past five years, said she was considering moving her family to Switzerland as a result of the tax changes.“We love England. We feel very much at home here,” she said. “We want to pay fair tax as members of society. But the biggest pain point was inheritance tax … it is not just ours, but my grandfather’s and my parents’ wealth that would now be taxed by the UK. That feels deeply unfair as the money was not made here.“The current philosophical approach seems to be shrinking everyone’s pie instead of enlarging the pie, bringing more investment, employability and wealth to the country.”View image in fullscreenSome claim non-doms are quitting London for cities such as Milan.Photograph: Audrius Venclova/AlamySean Cockburn, of the advisers Forvis Mazars, said while many non-doms were unhappy with the changes, most of his clients were staying in the country.“There has been an acceptance of higher income and capital gains but the emotional trigger has been inheritance tax. That seems to be the motivator for those moving. But not everyone is leaving the UK entirely.“Yes some people have left, some people are considering it, but some people have decided to stay and are broadly accepting of the new rules. In the media there have been very high-profile, very wealthy people leaving who receive a lot of coverage. I personally have not had many clients leaving.”As well as Reeves considering a reversal of her decision to charge UK inheritance tax on global assets of non-doms, Nigel Farage has promised Reform UK would “bring back” wealthy foreigners who have left Britain by giving them a full exemption from taxes on their overseas assets in return for a once-a-decade £250,000 fee.Is there really an exodus, and what might it cost?The UK counted about 74,000 non-doms when the regime ended in April. After the government announced its changes to the tax policy, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated it could lead to a 12% to 25% decrease in the population of non-doms without trusts.Collectively they paid just under £9bn in tax in 2023, according to figures from HMRC. About £6bn of that came from income tax, £2.3bn from national insurance contributions and £400m from capital gains tax.ChartJohn-Paul Marks, the new permanent secretary and chief executive of HMRC, told MPs in June that official data would only start to come through in January 2027, when self-assessment tax returns were due.Still, in the absence of official figures, reports with estimates have emerged, often commissioned by interested parties such as the investment migration companyHenley & Partners, and campaign groups such as Land of Opportunity and Foreign Investors for Britain.Research commissioned by Henley found the UK could lose a net 16,500 “dollar millionaires” this year, those with at least $1m (£736,000) in liquid investable wealth, which includes assets such as cash, bonds, stocks and gold. But the figures are disputed, with the campaign groupTaxJustice Network criticising the report’s reliance on social media platforms, such as LinkedIn, as a measure of where millionaires live or reside. A spokesperson for Henley & Partners said the report relied on multiple sources, not just LinkedIn.A spokesperson for New World Wealth, the company that conducted the research, said the report also used sources such as investment migration programme statistics from across the world, its in-house database, company registers and property registers, among others.Stuart Adam, a senior economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a thinktank, emphasised that until official data from the UK government arrives, there simply is not enough information to draw conclusions about how many non-doms have left, or would leave as a result of the changes.“Scraping people’s LinkedIn pages and their changed location is extrapolating massively,” he said. “A change in location may not correspond with a change in tax residence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a hot topic so people will put out what they can. But it will be one or two years, or even longer, when data becomes available.”A study co-authored by Arun Advani, a tax economist at the University of Warwick, found previous patterns would suggest the loss of the tax break will result in a “significant” but “temporary” exodus.But he has said he expects a bigger backlash this time, particularly because of the change to inheritance tax rules. Non-doms, who previously did not have to pay inheritance tax on their global assets (including businesses they had built in their homeland), now have to pay the levy on these assets if they have been resident in the UK for 10 of the past 20 tax years.“It was always a mistake to have the IHT rate for foreigners jump from 0% to 40% overnight when they get to 10 years in the UK,” he told Bloomberg.The OBR had forecast that the changes to the non-dom regime would generate £33.8bn in revenue for the Treasury over the next five years. However, there is considerable uncertainty around those numbers.A report from the Centre forEconomicsand Business Research found that if a quarter of non-doms left the UK, the net gain to the Treasury would be zero. That research was commissioned by Andrew Barclay, the co-founder of the property platform Yopa, grandson of one of the billionaire Barclay brothers.Barclay now runs the Land of Opportunity Campaign, a lobbying effort that intends to recreate Britain’s economy in the image of the US.The non-dom lobby group Foreign Investors for Britain has also been highly active in the area, with research conducted by Oxford Economics on its behalf finding that nearly two-thirds of non-doms were planning to leave the UK or considering doing so because of the changes. That was based on surveys responded to by 73 non-doms and 42 tax advisers. It also found that inheritance tax changes was a key motivator for 83% of non-doms in any relocation decision.View image in fullscreenDubai is a popular destination for the super-rich because of its zero personal income tax policy.Photograph: Prashant NaikEd Bussey, the chief executive of Oxford Sciences, a builder of UK technology spin-outs from Oxford University, said he was increasingly hearing from non-UK investors, who have historically funded companies in the UK, but who are now leaving the country because of the changes to inheritance tax.“While they don’t want to leave they can’t justify having their worldwide assets – which they often grew before coming to the UK – now being taxed at 40%, while other European and Middle East countries are charging little or no inheritance tax,” he said.“There is simply not enough UK domiciled investment capital to fund the innovation-led companies that we’re building and the high dependency on foreign capital is critical.”He said the same issue was also deterring international entrepreneurs from coming to the UK to build their companies.“We should be rolling out the red carpet to this highly sought-after global talent pool, not ‘incentivising’ to go to Italy, Greece or Dubai instead – all of which are now seeing substantial inflows of the investment capital that we’ve lost,” he said.Donald Trump has certainly taken the view that wealthy individuals should be welcomed with open arms. The president has drawn up plans for a “gold card” that rich foreigners can buy for $5m that would grant them permanent US residency.But Paul Donovan, the chief economist at the wealth management arm of the Swiss bank UBS, added that the population of truly “nomadic” wealth owners is “perhaps smaller than popularly supposed”.“Certainly in conversations with UK clients, the issue of changing tax rules has come up more often, as you would expect,” he said. “To date there is very little evidence to suggest the idea of an exodus.“You will always have high-profile nomadic wealth owners who will move and change their location.”More tax pleaseFor all the noisy departures, there are lower-profile non-doms who wish to stay in the UK, prizing its robust rule of law, elite schools system and world class museums, galleries and restaurants.Giorgiana Notarbartolo, an impact investor who helps to run her family office,is one former non-dom who plans to stay in the country. Born in Italy, she has been in the UK since 2016. “I have been uncomfortable not paying tax off the wealth I make in Italy,” said Notarbartolo, a member of Patriotic Millionaires. “Who wants to raise their kids in a two-tier system?“There are many single millionaires, if that, who are also non-doms. Some are staying and some are leaving, but not all are citing tax as their main reason, it’s something that might tip them off the edge if they were thinking about leaving anyway. Education andhigher private school feesare a big reason.”Paolo Fresia, also native to Italy and an impact investor who lives in London, said he has been “appalled by the media coverage” on the subject. In fact, he said, although he claimed non-dom status, he felt “a bit guilty” and now felt “relief” that the system was no longer in place.“I first moved here for educational reasons, not for tax. There are so many reasons to be here, not just tax, but education, meritocracy and the rule of law. There is even a new four-year regime for people.”“None of my friends or colleagues are moving,” added Fresia, also a member of Patriotic Millionaires. “Some parents of friends are leaving but those are the ones who are coming to the end of their lives, do not work or invest and were already thinking about leaving. I am happy to pay tax here.”Explore more on these topicsThe super-richTax and spendingInheritance taxTaxEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They feel as if they are improving. They are not.This pause soon gives way to “a relentlessly progressive and quite frightening rapid deterioration into multiple organ failure”.“The body’s different organ systems essentially shut down and the patient is extremely unwell, at a very high risk of dying,” the director of intensive care at Austin Health, Dr Stephen Warrillow, told Erin Patterson’s triple murder trial.Erin Patterson’s hospital visit – and what the beef wellingtons really looked like: mushroom murder exhibits revealedRead moreAt times it seemed almost an afterthought, during an extended trialsubject to ghoulish fascination, that Don Patterson, Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson died terrible deaths.Ian Wilkinson barely escaped the same fate, but he was watching in court as Warrillow gave his evidence. Not five metres to Ian’s left was the woman who allegedly tried to kill him.There was no dispute that Patterson poisoned him and the others with death cap mushrooms, that the blame for their deaths fell at her feet. But had she meant to do it?On Monday, a Victorian supreme court jury convicted Patterson of murdering her estranged husband’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt, Heather Wilkinson. The 12-person jury also found Patterson guilty of attempting to murder Heather’s husband,Ian Wilkinson.The difficulty in proving Patterson’s intent – as the defence made sure it repeatedly emphasised – was that the prosecution could not say why she killed three people and tried to kill a fourth.Despite the law being clear that no motive was required, this was no small thing for a jury: how to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a mother of two, with no criminal history, is guilty of triple murder, when nobody can tell you why she did it?View image in fullscreenDon and Gail Patterson died in hospital after eating the beef wellington meal served by Erin Patterson.Patterson said the deaths were due to the most trivial thing, a slight reorganisation of her pantry. At some point, she put foraged mushrooms that she did not realise were death caps in the same Tupperware container as mushrooms bought from an Asian grocer.She started foraging around the start of the pandemic, Patterson told the jury, and continued the habit for the next three years every autumn, picking mushrooms that grew on her properties and in public spaces including botanic gardens.Patterson bought a dehydrator in April 2023 because she loved wild mushrooms, but they didn’t keep for long. Drying them meant they would last longer.A few days earlier, Patterson said, she bought dried mushrooms from an Asian grocer in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs. They were too “pungent” for the dish she was making, so she removed them from their packet and put them in a different Tupperware container.This container was stored in her pantry at her home in Leongatha in May and June. At about this time, Patterson said she put wild mushrooms that she foraged and dehydrated in that same container.Patterson said none of this was clear to her until Simon confronted her in Monash hospital three days after the lunch and asked whether the dehydrator was “how you poisoned my parents”.“Did that comment by Simon cause you to reflect on what might have been in the meal?” Patterson’s barrister, Colin Mandy SC, asked her on 4 June.“It caused me to do a lot of thinking about a lot of things, yeah,” Patterson answered.She went on: “It got me thinking about all the times that I’d used [the dehydrator] … how I had dried foraged mushrooms in it weeks earlier, and I was starting to think, ‘What if they’d gone in the container with the Chinese mushrooms? Maybe – maybe that had happened’.”Patterson said she had started to feel scared, responsible, worried her children would be taken away, because “Simon seemed to be of the mind that maybe this was intentional”, the court heard.This conversation with Simon was the fulcrum, where the wheel started to turn, as Mandy put it, where Patterson decided to cover up her foraging, the Covid habit turned deadly.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignShe dumped the dehydrator the next day, lied to police repeatedly in an interview about foraging and the dehydrator three days later still, and remotely reset her phone to conceal evidence of both those parts of her life from homicide squad detectives, the court was told.But there was a significant point of contention about Patterson’s version of events: Simon said the conversation at Monash hospital never happened.According to the prosecution, Patterson bought the dehydrator as a murder weapon on 28 April 2023, soon after she travelled to the township of Loch to source death cap mushrooms.She bought it for the sole purpose of disguising death caps so she could fatally poison the lunch guests, not to preserve wild mushrooms so she could cook with them year-round, the court heard. This was no pantry error, the prosecution said, but a murderous plot, weeks in the making.Even the fact Patterson was in Monash hospital was, on the prosecution case, a ruse: she was pretending to be sick so as not to arouse suspicion about why the others were fatally unwell and she was not.A lot turned, therefore, on what the jury made of Patterson’s account about these weeks before the lunch.What in general did they make of her, a self-confessed liar, urging them to believe her now? Is someone more believable once they admit their untruths? Or are they damned as a liar?Mandy told the jury that Patterson was not on trial for lying, but the conclusions they made about her lying could help them reach a verdict.Patterson’s evidence bookended by tearsPatterson could have taken the stand regardless of the advice of her lawyers. There was much about her extended period in the witness box that may have caused them anxiety.Her eight days in the stand left their mark on Patterson; she was in tears soon after she started, and in tears as she ended, but it did not seem to harm her case. Whether she came out, as Mandy said, unscathed, or as the prosecutor Nanette Rogers SC said, with yet more lies attached to her name, was a matter for the jury.What certainly emerged was a fuller picture of her, edges and shape, the third dimension to the flat picture of her seen on screens and in the dock.Tears, disagreements and dried mushrooms: how Erin Patterson responded over eight days in the witness boxRead morePatterson said she was a binge eater who had struggled with her body image since she was a child whose mother forced her to weigh herself, she said. The day of the lunch, she binge ate two-thirds of an orange cake brought by Gail, then vomited it up – a plausible explanation, the defence said, for why she was less unwell than her guests later.She also described regularly consulting “Dr Google” to understand health ailments and admitted to having overstated health complaints including cancer to elicit sympathy.Patterson spoke of the camping trips and the religious epiphany at Ian’s church that occurred in the years after she met Simon, while they were working for the same suburban council.She had owned a bookshop in Western Australia, worked as an air traffic controller, then had no need to work at all because of inheritances worth several million dollars. Her plans for 2023 included studying a bachelor of nursing and midwifery, but she had deferred before the lunch.Nothing appeared to define her more than motherhood, however: her 16-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter were the centre of a universe that included their doting grandparents, Don and Gail.Patterson’s five days of cross-examination were punctuated by revelations, but without moments of genuine shock. Rogers said the “starkest lie” which emerged was that Patterson claimed she was having gastric bypass surgery, when she had no such appointment.There was probing of whether Patterson was “two-faced” – the loving daughter-in-law who helped in church every second Sunday and stayed part of her estranged husband’s family eight years after they separated, and the woman who vented “fuck ’em” about the same family to her friends online.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rogers asked Patterson more than 200 questions that ended with the words “agree or disagree” or “correct or incorrect”, and others still ended with just one of those words.Patterson was not asked whether she tried the duxelles after, in her telling, she accidentally added death cap mushrooms to a bland dish. Is this not what any home cook would do, after adding an ingredient to improve a meal? Mandy told the jury they could infer she did just that.Indeed, many details about how Patterson said this accident happened remained inexact, including when and where she picked the mushrooms; why she had not used them in other meals before, given they were there for some weeks and her love of mushrooms; why she combined different types of dried mushrooms in the same container, including button mushrooms from Woolworths when one of these varieties, had been too “pungent” for a dish; what exactly did the container look like and could Patterson identify it, given police took dozens of photos of her kitchen.There were other questions, too, that were not asked about Patterson’s conduct after the lunch.Patterson was asked countless times about her bowel movements, the phrase, “poo your pants” and variances a common occurrence, but not about why she was wearing white pants at a time she said she was suffering diarrhoea.Patterson was the final witness in her trial. Her estranged husband, Simon, was the first. Between them were about 50 others, police and doctors and family and mycologists, some linked to the case in intimate, life-altering ways, others seemingly perturbed about being dragged into it.Patterson watched these witnesses closely from her seat in the dock, mostly with her chin slightly raised, reading glasses on or close by, ready to be used should an exhibit appear on the screen to her left.From her seat, Patterson could see through a large window, covered with translucent blinds, facing south. As the trial dragged on through the end of autumn and into winter, she could watch as leaves withered, turned the colour of the terracotta roofs below, and were blown loose.Occasionally, one flitted against the window, an almost startling reminder that life outside court number four went on.A travelling circusBeyond Morwell is the Hazelwood open-cut coalmine, and further still, the foothills of the Strezlecki Ranges. They are a barrier between the Latrobe Valley, where the trial was held, and South Gippsland, the region where Patterson and the guests are from.There is little in common between Leongatha, where Patterson lived, and Morwell, where she opted for the trial to be held, despite them being only 60km apart.As there was barely a link between the towns, there was a sense that the trial was a travelling circus: everybody would soon pack up and leave, without any lingering sense of loss or trauma in Morwell.And a circus, at times, it was: people were chased out of court after trying to take selfies with Patterson or, at one point, reaching out to touch her hand. Another man was marched out after directing a protest at Justice Christopher Beale. An article that was to be about the “media circus” breached a suppression order, as did multiple other publications.Other media outlets, and a juror who was dismissed, could yet face further proceedings resulting from the trial.On the days Patterson gave evidence, a handful of people waited outside from about 6.30am, four hours before court started, in single-digit temperatures.Many of those who crammed into court throughout the trial appeared not unlike Patterson herself: middle-aged women with an interest in true crime.Some watchers were obsessed because it was an alleged poisoning case, others because they were from South Gippsland and wanted to see it.There was a man with rainbow-coloured hair and a matching coat who runs a business giving people “unicorn manes”. A woman who runs a popular true crime Instagram account shared the front row with novelist Helen Garner.There was no other way for the public to follow the case: you had to be in that room, or otherwise dip into the seemingly endless content produced about it (almost all of those in the gallery did both).It is hard to know exactly what made it so popular. It would perhaps be easier to identify what wasn’t compelling about it.Surely, a significant element was that this was a woman accused of the unthinkable and judged on different standards, someone who in public sentiment did not grieve in a genuine way, who must be mad or sad or bad or some combination of the three.Of the roughly 40 seats inside court, about half were free for the public, with the rest taken by the Patterson and Wilkinson families, media and other people associated with the case. Only one supporter of Patterson, her friend and power of attorney, regularly attended court.View image in fullscreenHeather Wilkinson and her husband, Ian Wilkinson, the sole surviving lunch guest.Photograph: FacebookPatterson spent week nights inside the Morwell police cells. Every day of the trial, she walked about 30 steps along a passageway, no wider than three metres, from the back of the station into the court building.Above her, and to her right, was the patio outside court, where feverish coverage whirred on: witnesses and lawyers and the detective in charge of the investigation, Stephen Eppingstall, ran a gauntlet of photographers and camera operators to get into court every day; reporters completed live crosses; court watchers, having saved a seat upstairs, ducked out for a final smoke before the hearing started.Patterson walked in open-toed rubber sandals, a seemingly curious choice for late autumn and winter in the Latrobe Valley, until you considered how rare it was for her to be outside.On Fridays, she was taken by prison van from Morwell to the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre, a prison on the dusty and flat western outskirts of Melbourne.As she left Morwell, and when she returned on Mondays, photographers reached high to firmly press their lenses against the van’s tiny compartment windows, not knowing which of these compartments Patterson was in.After the jury retired to consider its verdict, temporary fencing wrapped in black plastic appeared around Patterson’s house, where the lunch was held.It seemed an odd thing to have preoccupied Patterson when she was awaiting a verdict on charges of triple murder, to take steps to preserve a sliver of privacy should she walk from court, but the case is nothing if not odd.On Monday, she again made that walk from the police station into court along the concrete passageway, took the lift to the first floor and, flanked by two corrections officers, stepped through a door into the dock.She would not have to wait long to learn if the jury would send her back the way she came or whether she would be free to walk into court, to head back to her dream home, to tend her three acres behind her rudimentary fence.Ian Wilkinson, the only guest who sat for lunch at Patterson’s dining table on 29 July 2023 and lived, the Baptist Church pastor who stared death in the face, did not come to court to see it.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsVictoriaCrime - AustraliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

So she picked up her first proper camera and was soon spending 20 hours a week in the field, and winning awardsPaula CocozzaMon 7 Jul 2025 01.55 EDTShareAfew weeks ago, Michelle Jackson was in the Peak District, hiding beneath a camouflage net with her camera, waiting for badgers to emerge at sunset. For more than two hours she watched the skylarks and curlews, her hopes intensifying during the 45-minute window in which the light was perfect.At last the heather moved. A badger’s head appeared. “Their eyesight is poor, but they can smell you,” Jackson says. At 66, she has won national and international awards as a wildlife photographer. Although the desire to get the shot “drives” her, for a while she simply watched. “You want to embrace what’s there. It’s so special to see wildlife up close.”View image in fullscreenThe badger at sunset.Photograph: Michelle JacksonAt least two of the shots Jackson took that evening are “competition-worthy”. Yet she didn’t pick up a camera, beyond a simple point-and-shoot, until she was 61.Jackson, who lives in Derbyshire, England, spent most of her working life as an engineer in the rail industry. In 1978, she was one of the first two women taken on by British Rail as design engineers. She designed carriage systems for the Channel tunnel trains, and regards the British Rail Class 91 high-speed electric locomotive as “my baby”; she managed its emerging weight and balance.View image in fullscreenJackson’s shot of a kestrel on the edge of bluebell woods.Photograph: Michelle JacksonIn 1994, she and her husband, also an engineer, moved from the UK to Sydney, Australia. She worked, or spent time with their two daughters. “I didn’t put aside time for myself.”Jackson retired at 56 when her hearing became impaired. “Meetings were very social. Cafe environments, hard surfaces, clitter-clatter, people talking in the background. I realised I was missing too much. I didn’t want to embarrass myself or the organisation I worked for. So I decided to give up,” she says.She didn’t ask for adjustments to the meetings?“I probably didn’t want people to know.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m besotted with British wildlife.’Photograph: Michelle JacksonIn 2018, she and her family returned to England. “What am I going to do now?” she thought. “The emails went from 550 to 50, and 20 of them were junk. I needed something to stimulate me.”The following year, at 61, she bought her first DSLR camera and joined a local walking and photography group; then, when Covid hit, she enrolled in an online photography and Photoshop course. A history of pneumonia meant she had to shield, so she photographed whatever she could find indoors – still life, flowers, pets. “If I’m going to do something, I’m going to do it properly.”Jackson publishes under the name “Emmabrooke”, after years of being presumed male in engineering and mistakenly being called Michael. But she brings to her camera “an engineering brain … I do everything in manual”.View image in fullscreenAn osprey fishing.Photograph: Michelle JacksonShe has always loved nature. In her 20s, she hiked long distances, including the 268 miles of the Pennine Way in northern England. “Nature, seeing the big picture of landscapes, has always been there. But I didn’t use a camera,” she says. It was only after retirement that the camera became “a means to capture what I’d seen. The things you take for granted.” Even planning a boat trip to see humpback whales, “I didn’t consider buying a decent camera. I was just enthralled by seeing: the fact you could see them, rather than have a photograph to remember them by.”Maybe there is a connection between hearing loss and wanting to “capture” the environment she witnessed? Jackson’s images are sharp and crisp, and the result of an acutely focused anticipatory vision. “I have a mind’s eye of what I’d like to get,” she says. She once waited hours for two gannets to bring their heads together in the shape of a heart.View image in fullscreen‘I get excited each time.’Photograph: Michelle Jackson“When you lose a sense, other senses get stronger,” she says. “I’ve got my eyesight.”Jackson is preparing for her Master Craftsman award with the Guild of Photographers. She achieved her associate level with the Royal Photographic Society last year and is now aiming to achieve fellowship. She spends at least 20 hours a week in the field. “I’m besotted with British wildlife. I get excited each time,” she says. Whether she is photographing badgers, ospreys, kingfishers or a golden eagle in the snow, she says: “It’s the thrill of them turning up. If you really want to seek them out, you’ll find them.”You can see Michelle Jackson’s workon her website,onInstagramand onBlueSkyTell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60PhotographyWildlifeDeafness and hearing lossfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 27-year-old resident of Tuba, one of the dozen or so villages that make up Masafer Yatta in the arid south Hebron hills of the occupiedWest Bank, had been up all night watching as a masked Israeli settler on horseback circled his family home.“When we saw the masked settler, we knew he wanted violence,” said Awad, his eyes bloodshot. They were lucky this time: the settler disappeared into the darkness before police could show up.The men in Masafer Yatta rarely sleep these days. They take turns standing watch at night, fearful that nearby Israeli settlers will attack under the cover of darkness.Daylight brings little respite. Residents work with an ear pricked up for the sound of approaching vehicles, scanning the horizon for Israeli bulldozers which could signal their homes are next to be demolished.Israel designated Masafer Yatta a military training zone – named firing zone 918, where no civilians can live – in 1981. It has been working since to push out the roughly 1,200 residents who remain. These residents have been fighting in Israeli courts for more than two decades to stop their expulsion, a battle which has slowed, but not stopped, the demolition of Palestinian homes there.A map of Palestinian villages within firing zone 918Recently, an Israeli administrative body issued a decision which legal experts and activists have said could remove the last remaining legal barriers for the demolition of homes in Masafer Yatta. The decision could lead to the forcible transfer of 1,200people, something the UN warned could be a war crime.“This would amount to forcible transfer, which is a war crime. It could also amount to a crime against humanity if committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack,” theUN human rights office saidon 26 June.On 18 June, the civil administration’s central planning bureau, the Israeli military agency that issues construction permits in occupiedPalestinian territories, issued a directive that all pending building requests in Masafer Yatta be rejected.Map shows the occupied West Bank, with the area od Masafer Yatta highlighted in the south.Previously, residents could file building planning requests and, while they were being examined, their structures could not legally be demolished. By cancelling all pending requests, the new directive dismisses all previously submitted cases without examining their particularities and gives demolitions the green light.The decision was made at the same time as Israeli authorities are pursuing sharply increased numbers of demolitions across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, destroying 933 structures since the beginning of the year, a record-breaking pace, according toUN data. As structures are demolished, more Palestinians are killed in the West Bank, with at least 950 killed and 9,000 injured by Israeli forces and settlers since the start of the war in Gaza on 7 October 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities.The new directive cites a military planning document issued a day earlier, which said that firing zone 918 was necessary for combat preparedness and that the presence of civilian structures prevented training exercises.MapThe document says: “The practical condition for such [military training] access is the removal of the unauthorised constructions, thus enabling the IDF to conduct its training … No construction in the firing zone can be permitted.” It adds that for live-fire exercises to be conducted, the area needs to be “sterile”.According to a lawyer representing residents of Masafer Yatta, Netta Amar-Shiff, the new directive bypasses a previous legal ruling and abrogates local laws, and could rapidly expedite the destruction of villages.“If this directive is activated, it means planning institutions can dismiss building requests under military auspices, so no civilian construction and development can be approved. It’s easier for them to eliminate entire villages,” Amar-Shiff said.View image in fullscreenAli Awad, a resident of the Palestinian village of Tuba, in the firing zone 918, in Masafer Yattah.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianHumanitarian organisations have long accused Israel of establishing firing zones as an excuse to push Palestinians off their land and expand settlement construction. About 18% of Area C, the parts of the West Bank under full Israeli control, has been designated as firing zones.According to government meeting minutes in 1981, the then agriculture minister and future PM, Ariel Sharon, proposed the creation of firing zone 918 with the purpose of forcing Palestinians out of the area.In themeeting, Sharon told the IDF he wanted to expand shooting zones “in order to keep these areas … in our hands”, pointing to “the expansion of the Arab villagers” in the area.In a comment, the Israeli military said the civil administration was “holding ongoing discussions regarding villages built within the boundaries of firing zone 918” and that the military had a “vital need for the area”.“As a general rule, no approval will be granted for construction within the firing zone, which is designated as a closed military area,” the Israeli military said in a statement to the Guardian, adding that building permit requests were subject to approval by military command.To Awad, last week’s decision is the latest attempt in a long line of court decisions and policies by the Israeli government to expel the residents of Masafer Yatta from their homes.In May 2022, Israel’s high court ruled that the residents could be expelled and the land repurposed for military use, as it said villagers were not permanent residents of the area before the firing zone was declared. Residents and lawyers, relying on expert testimony and literature, said they had inhabited the area for decades.“This decision was a clear way of cutting the last nerve of life that these people had,” said Awad, calling it part of a larger policy of “ethnic cleansing of Palestinians”.View image in fullscreenNasser Shreiteh stands in what was his kitchen of in the Palestinian village of Susyia. Israeli settlers set his home on fire in an attack.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianAwad and the other residents of Masafer Yatta have spent more than two decades filing petitions, appeals, proposing master plans and submitting documents to try to fight the destruction of their community.“We tried for many years to supply different documents and proofs and plans to the courts. But, after years of this, a commander in the army says no and that’s enough,” said Nidal Younis, head of the Masafer Yatta council, in a press briefing late last month.As the residents navigate Israel’s labyrinthine bureaucracy to stave off demolition orders, settlers have acted as the extrajudicial vanguard of displacement, making daily life nearly intolerable for Palestinians.Almost every single resident has a story about being harassed or attacked by nearby settlers, whose presence has been slowly growing, with new outposts popping up on the area’s hilltops.Middle East crisis: Trump calls for Gaza hostages release ahead of Netanyahu meeting at the White House – as it happenedRead moreIn the early hours of 25 June, settlers set fire to Nasser Shreiteh’s home in the town of Susiya, burning his kitchen and a bedroom almost entirely, running off as he tried to extinguish the fire.“They want to evict everyone, they want everyone to disappear. But I am here, if they burn my house down, I will stay here, I have no other place to go,” said Shreiteh, a 50-year-old with seven children, as he overlooked the charred remains of his kitchen.As he spoke, an Israeli military patrol passed and behind it roared a beaten-up sedan driven by settlers, swerving in circles as the car’s trunk swung open. They pulled up to Shreiteh’s driveway and made an obscene hand gesture before driving off.Incidents of settler violence in the area have sharply increased since the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 and the subsequent war in Gaza. The rise of the far-right, extremist ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir has provided political cover, allowing settlers to act with virtual impunity.Many settlers have been called to military reserves, where they serve around their settlements. Residents of Masafer Yatta said settlers would often walk around in military dress, such as combat trousers, which made it impossible to tell whether they were dealing with settlers or soldiers.View image in fullscreenSouad al-Mukhamari with three grandchildren in Sfai. She said one of her granddaughters was attacked by a settler.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianSettler violence has escalated the tighter residents have clung to their land. In late January, settlers torched Awad’s car, which he had used to transport children to school and residents to legal hearings.Souad al-Mukhamari, a 61-year-old resident of Sfai, another village in Masafer Yatta, complained that one of hergranddaughters, a child, had been beaten and pepper-sprayed by a settler a month earlier. Her own home overlooked the debris of a school that was demolished in 2022.Palestinians can do little to protect themselves from settler violence, and are severely punished if they attempt to do so. They complain that Israeli authorities fail to protect them and do not follow up on their complaints.Legal advocates have said they expect little protection from Israel’s legal system, but instead are looking to the international community to increase pressure on Israel to halt settlement construction and protect the rights of Palestinians.“We don’t see any possibility of internal change within Israel to protect these communities,” said Sarit Michaeli, an international advocacy officer at the Israeli human rights group B’tselem. “The only way to stop this is whether there is clear international action to clarify to Israeli policymakers that actions have consequences,” she added.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Ayub family look on during a demolition in Khirbet al-Fakheit.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianThe Trump administration has expressed little interest in addressing illegal settlement construction and violence, lifting Biden-era sanctions on settlers. Instead, Michaeli said the EU could play a role in pressuring Israeli officials, especially as itannounced at the end of Maythat it is reviewing its association agreement with Israel over human rights compliance concerns.As residents of Masafer Yatta wait for international action, they live under the constant threat of displacement and settler violence, their means of resistance all stripped away one at a time. Still, they are determined to stay.“Just mentally we are preparing for more demolitions. There’s nothing more on the ground we can do, besides putting our words in the media so they can reach farther than we can scream,” Awad said.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesIsraelWest BankMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

They openedpop-up shopsand announced collabs with Levi’s, Adidas and Next. The results are plain to see on the streets of Cardiff the afternoon before the long-awaited gig. If they say you are never more than six feet away from a rat in a city, here you are never more than six inches away from that famous Oasis Helvetica Black Oblique logo.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s on bucket hats, football shirts, tracksuit tops, T-shirts and, every so often, someone’s face. The fanbase goes across generations and demographics. There are those who were there the first time, and teenagers who grew up on their music. Some have travelled for miles – from Italy, Spain, Portugal and the US. If the crowd is largely white, there’s a contingent of fans from east Asia.Put together, the hordes marauding on the streets ofCardiffbefore the 74,500-capacity sell-out gig at the Principality stadium are united by their love – as one fan described, it’s like going to a football match where everyone supports the same team.Diversity in the fanbase reveals itself in different ways through what they wear. There are the merch fans, who have bought T-shirts on the day. That’s true of Ash Park, Marcus Long and the fortuitously named Joe Gallagher, three friends who have long talked about a potentialOasisreunion.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Ash Parker, Marcus Long and Joe Gallagher in their brand new T-shirtsGallagher – who paid £600 for his ticket – says he won’t wear the T-shirt beyond the gig but he’ll frame it instead. “It’s historic,” he says. Long, meanwhile, is contemplating a tattoo – “it would probably be something like that,” he says, pointing to the logo with the date of the gig on his T-shirt. Helen Durbin, who is wearing a matching T-shirt to her friend Nicky Thomas, says it will likely have the same fate as a lot of music merch – something to wear to bed.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Helen Durbin, Paul Durbin and Nicky ThomasHelen’s husband Paul, meanwhile, is in a different design, with the Gallagher brothers looking moody on the front. “I prefer this one,” referring to the logo’d one his wife has. “[But] I thought it would be a little bit too sweet [to match].”Oasis’s own look – or that of the Gallaghers, anyway – has remained set for decades. Part football terrace classics, part Mod, part 90s, its simplicity – and roots in familiar tropes of British menswear – is why it’s so influential. It has familiar components that are easy to put together: parkas, shirts, anoraks, Adidas track tops, baggy jeans, football shirts and – of course – the bucket hat.There’s a sector of the fanbase that endeavours to bring something of the Gallagher look into their own. “Cool” is a word mentioned a lot, along with – to quote the band – “biblical,” as Ricardo Riquier puts it. With his mop of hair and parka from Liam Gallagher’s fashion labelPretty Green, Riquier, who travelled from Lisbon, says his style was formed in the 90s.View image in fullscreenRicardo Riquier from Portugual“I never had another hairstyle since I was 15,” he laughs. “I’ll die with this hair.” The parka was a non-negotiable. “I didn’t know how hot or how cold it was going to be, but I’m like ‘I’m taking my parka, otherwise I’ll look like an idiot.’”Chris Taylor has travelled from Falkirk. He also loves a parka – he says it is “the best way to cut about”.View image in fullscreenChris Taylor from ScotlandToday, he signals his long-term fandom with a ‘Who the fuck is Liam Gallagher?’ T-shirt, from a solo tour around 14 years ago. “It’s vintage, and I keep it in my collector’s box,” he says. Taylor appreciates the Gallagher style for its “arrogance. They do it and others follow.” They certainly do.Sergio Cid and Jairo Velas have travelled from Madrid, and wear the outfits of those who have followed a band for decades – Cid’s first gig was Oasis in 1997, when he was 12. He wears a vintage Manchester City shirt similar to one the Gallaghers were photographed wearing in 1994, a bucket hat and – crucially – a denim jacket fastened with a single button at the neck, as worn by Liam for the Familiar to Millions gig in 2000.View image in fullscreenSergio Cid, left, and Jairo Velas“He knows more than me about the details,” says Velas (Cid speaks little English). “That’s why we are really disappointed about the hair. Liam has a shaved head. We’re like ‘No, you need to bring 2002 back.’”Ethan Besant is also keen on the classic style – he’s showing that through an outfit which is dominated by Pretty Green, from the logoed polo shirt to the green parka and the badges on the bucket hat. What does he like about Liam’s style? “He’s just cool, isn’t he?” he says. Besant appreciates the fact that what the singer wears has not differed hugely for years. “It’s all pretty consistent,” he says. “I guess when you find your style, you stick to it.”View image in fullscreenEthan BesantWith the Oasis tour one of the events of the summer, their look is something of a fashion moment too – TikTok is full of videos of users showcasing their outfits. Sportswear retailerJD sayssearches for “oasis fashion” were up 913% in June, while Depop says searches for bucket hats are up 61% since last year and – perhaps improbably in a heatwave – searches for parkas are up 1,850%. This take on Oasis style is very much present in Cardiff too – on those who take their style as a jump-off point to make their own look.Tamara Sims bought her denim jacket on Vinted for £20 – with copies of 90s Oasis patches covering it. “You say what patches you want and they make it for you,” she says. Did Sims want a “look” to come to the concert? “I wanted a bit of Adidas,” she says, pointing to her socks, “and I just bought my bucket hat now.” Jae In Yoo, who has travelled from South Korea, wears her zip-up merch track jacket oversized – “I like it big” – with a long gingham skirt. She’ll add a bucket hat when she goes into the gig.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTamara Sims; and Jae In YooJulia Bussi, seen in the main image, has travelled from Italy with three friends. She cut her tour T-shirt into a crop top (“I prefer,” she says) while her friend Eduardo Pane finishes his look with sunglasses that are “part Matrix, part young Liam”.Lucy Barnett and Ellie Thomas both wear T-shirts from Next, tied at the waist, with lace bubble skirts. “We wanted it to be feminine but comfy at the same time,” says Barnett. Are Oasis cashing in with all these collabs? “100%,” she says.View image in fullscreenLucy Barnett, left, and Ellie ThomasFootball shirts – whether real ones, mostly Man City or Oasis merch styled to look like football shirts – are everywhere. Which makes sense: the fact that the football shirt is nowan established part of young people’s wardrobeis the ripple effect of Oasis style. An image of the brothers in striped Man City shirts in 1994 is familiar to anyone who looks at Britpop style accounts on Instagram. The connection has even gone full circle – as well as the football shirt in the Adidas collaboration, Man City’s fourth kit for 24/25 was designed with Noel Gallagher.Those wearing them today appreciate the connection between football and music. Brandon Woodman and Jamie Winter have travelled from Edinburgh – with Woodman wearing the busy Scotland away kit from the 1990 World Cup, and Winter in the 90s Man City shirt. “We like the way they bring football into a rock’n’roll setting,” says Winter.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBrandon Woodman, left, with Jamie White; and Jennie ConnelyOr sometimes it’s just a look. Jennie Connely wears a football-like shirt, with Supersonic written across it in Oasis’s font, fromMama Established, a brand that makes unofficial merch for everyone from Sam Fender to Pedro Pascal. Although she supports Middlesbrough, she “wouldn’t dare” wear a Boro shirt today. “I wanted to feel comfortable, but I wanted to feel part of this. It’s 16 years in the making, but it feels like it’s brand new,” she says.Kent Garrison, who travelled from Dallas, committed to a look – he wore that Man City fourth kit complete with the socks. “I came with a plan to wear the full kit,” he says. “I was a little nervous, but I said, ‘You know what?

This sector of the crowd, in their teens and early 20s, are perhaps the most creative with the Oasis look.

Seventeen-year-old Charlie Jenkins, with a blond crop and bright blue braces, likes the Gallaghers’ look as “football hooliganism, masculine, real life.

As the Guardian has reported on widely, this is not an issue confined to high-profile individuals or the most powerful organisations.“The use of NDAs to cover up abuse and harassment is growing – and sadly amongst those in low-income or insecure employment across multiple industries and workplaces.“This cannot go on. That is why we are stamping out this practice and taking action to ban any NDAs used for this purpose. My message is clear: no one should suffer in silence and we will back workers and give survivors the voice that they deserve.”NDAs should be banned to curb music industry ‘culture of misogyny’, says new parliament reportRead moreThe legislation represents the biggest overhaul of workers’ rights in a generation, introducing day one rights, establishing collective bargaining bodies in vital sectors and strengthening family-friendly entitlements, as well as going further on bereavement leave and tackling “fire-and-rehire”.Over time NDAs have become the default solution for many organisations, corporations and public bodies to settle cases including sexual misconduct, racism, and pregnancy discrimination.Their original purpose was to protect intellectual property or other commercial or sensitive information, but reports have shown they have become commonly used to prevent people speaking out about horrific experiences in the workplace.There have been many high-profile cases of NDAs being used to prevent victims from speaking about crimes, often forcing women and vulnerable individuals to feel stuck in unwanted situations, through fear or desperation.They have proliferated especially in lower-income, insecure employment including sectors such as retail, hospitality and accommodation, with non-disparagement clauses also typically attached.A report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) last year found the use of NDAs was relatively common, with 22% of respondents to a survey of 2,000 employers saying their organisation used them when dealing with allegations of sexual harassment.In contrast, 44% said they did not use NDAs in this way and a further 34% did not know, highlighting that awareness around their use in some organisations may be low.The CIPD also found that most employers would not strongly object to the removal of NDAs in the workplace. Nearly half (48%) of employers would support a ban, with just 18% opposing, while 20% were ambivalent, and a further 14% did not know.Zelda Perkins, a former PA to Harvey Weinstein who spearheads the campaign group Can’t Buy My Silence, said of the government’s plans: “This is a huge milestone, for years we’ve heard empty promises from governments whilst victims have continued to be silenced.“To see this government accept the need for nationwide legal change shows that they have listened and understood the abuse of power taking place.“Above all though, this victory belongs to the people who broke their NDAs, who risked everything to speak the truth when they were told they couldn’t. Without their courage, none of this would be happening.View image in fullscreenZelda Perkins, who worked for Harvey Weinstein as an assistant in the 1990s, called the changes ‘a huge milestone’.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer“This is not over yet and we will continue to focus closely on this to ensure the regulations are watertight and no one can be forced into silence again. If what is promised at this stage becomes reality, then the UK will be leading the world in protecting not only workers but the integrity of the law.”Louise Haigh, a former cabinet minister who led the parliamentary campaign to ban NDAs alongside Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, said: “Victims of harassment and discrimination have been forced to suffer in silence for too long. Today’s announcement will mean that bad employers can no longer hide behind legal practices that cover up their wrongdoing and prevent victims from getting justice.”Moran, who began campaigning when a victim from Oxford University shared their story with her, added: “This would not have been possible without the brave students and victims who have shared their heartbreaking stories with me over the years.“It has been a privilege to work alongside Zelda, Louise, and countless others to bring their voices to Westminster and raise awareness of the truly devastating impact misused NDAs can have on people’s lives.”Legislative changes have already been made in Ireland, Canada and the US so that NDAs cannot prohibit disclosure of sexual harassment, discrimination or bullying without it being the expressed wish of the employee.A landmark survey of sexual harassment at work has found that one in four women have suffered work-related sexual assault.Britain’s largest trade union, Unite, polled approximately 300,000 female members on whether they had experienced sexual harassment at work, travelling to work or from a colleague in or out of work hours.Of the 6,615 respondents, 25% said they had been sexually assaulted and 43% had been inappropriately touched. More than 3,000 said they had been the recipient of sexually offensive jokes and/or experienced unwanted flirting, gesturing or sexual remarks.And 28% had been shared or shown pornographic images by a manager, colleague or third party, while 8% had been a victim of sexual coercion – when a person pressures, tricks, threatens or manipulates someone into engaging in sexual activity without genuine consent – at work.While the perpetrator in the bulk of these incidents was a member of public in the workplace, such as a patient or a passenger, 3% said they had been sexually assaulted by a manager and 6% by a colleague.Explore more on these topicsEmployment lawSexual harassmentDiscrimination at workWork & careersAngela RaynernewsShareReuse this content"

It alsodirectly contradictedclaims made hours earlier by the office of Israel’s military chief, which said in a letter that Palestinians were only displaced inside Gaza for their own protection.“(Katz) laid out an operational plan for a crime against humanity. It is nothing less than that,” Sfard said. “It is all about population transfer to the southern tip of theGazaStrip in preparation for deportation outside the strip.“While the government still calls the deportation ‘voluntary’, people in Gaza are under so many coercive measures that no departure from the strip can be seen in legal terms as consensual.“When you drive someone out of their homeland that would be a war crime, in the context of a war. If it’s done on a massive scale like he plans, it becomes a crime against humanity,” Sfard added.Katz laid out his plans for Gaza shortly before Netanyahu arrived in Washington DC for meetings with Donald Trump, where he will be under heavy pressure to agree a ceasefire deal to end or at least pause the 21-month war.Work on the “humanitarian city” at the heart of Katz’s plans could start during a ceasefire, the defence minister said. Netanyahu is leading efforts to find countries willing to “take in” Palestinians, he added.Speaking from the White House on Monday, Netanyahu said the US and Israel were working with other countries who would give Palestinians a “better future.”“If people want to stay, they can stay, but if they want to leave, they should be able to leave,” Netanyahu said, as he prepared to have dinner with Trump.Israeli politicians including the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, have also been enthusiastic advocates of new Israeli settlements in Gaza.Plans for the construction of camps called “humanitarian transit areas”, to house Palestinians inside and possibly outside Gaza, had previously been presented to the Trump administration and discussed in the White House, Reuters reported on Monday.The $2bn plan bore the name of the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), Reuters said. GHF denied it had submitted a proposal and said slides seen by Reuters, which laid out the plan, “are not a GHF document”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is not what they have in mind. It will not be a livable place, just as the ‘safe areas’ are unliveable now.”Katz’s plan also raised the immediate question of what would happen to Palestinians who refused to follow Israeli orders to move into the new compound, said Goldberg.He added: “What will happen if the Palestinians will not accept this solution and revolt, because they are not completely helpless?”Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

No increases will take place on Wednesday, however, after he extended a previous pause.White House officials also signaled that new blanket rates – charged on all goods imported from certain markets – would incorporate, rather than be imposed on top of, existing duties charged on certain sectors, such as cars.Posting copies of letters addressed to world leaders on social media,Trump announcedthe following new US tariff rates:Goods from Bangladesh: 35% US tariffBosnia and Herzegovina: 30%Cambodia: 36%Indonesia: 32%Japan: 25%Kazakhstan: 25%Laos: 40%Malaysia: 25%Myanmar: 40%Serbia: 35%South Africa: 30%South Korea: 25%Thailand: 36%Tunisia: 25%He also signed anexecutive orderon Monday extending a 90-day pause for a slate of so-called “reciprocal” tariffs first introduced in April – in effect pushing back the deadline of trade talks back to 1 August.Asked if the deadline was firm, Trump said: “I would say firm, but not 100% firm. If they call up and they say we’d like to do something a different way, we’re going to be open to that.”The press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a press briefing that more letters would be sent later this week.Trump was “close” on other deals, she added, but “wants to ensure these are the best deals possible”.Trump officials initially suggested they would strike dozens of deals with key economies by 9 July, but have since indicated that they would seek an extension to continue talks.The letters were largely identical and informed the leaders that there will be no tariffs if their countries “decide to build or manufacture product within the United States”.Trump also threatened higher tariffs if the countries place additional tariffs on US exports. “If for any reason you decide to raise your tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto that 25% we charge,” he wrote.In an earlier post on Truth Social, Trump also threatened an extra 10% levy on countries working with Brics nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) after the bloc’s leaders issued a statement on Sunday expressing “serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff” measures.Trump initially announced a slate of so-called reciprocal tariffs in April, on what the White House dubbed “liberation day”, with some countries facing rates as high as 50%The US has so far settled deals with three countries: the UK, China and Vietnam, and Bessent said there were over a dozen countries the US is still trying to negotiate with.The new August deadline for countries without a deal amounts to a further three-week reprieve, but also triggers fresh uncertainty for importers because of the lack of clarity around the tariffs.As the July deadline has approached, Trump’s officials have been racing to broker deals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump on Friday said it is “much easier to send a letter” and that the offers are “take it or leave it”.On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 sank by 0.8% after Trump posted his first letters on Monday.

We have heard extensive evidence from parents, from organisations that represent parents, from professionals and from others who are deeply involved in the system, which is failing so many children and families at the moment.“One of the consequences of that failure is that parents really have so little trust and confidence in the Send system at the moment. And the government should take that very seriously as it charts a way forward for reform.”Aletter to the Guardianon Monday, signed by dozens of special needs and disability charities and campaigners,warned against government changes to the Send systemthat would restrict or abolish EHCPs.Labour MPs who spoke to the Guardian are worried ministers are unable to explain essential details of the special educational needs shake-up being considered in the schools white paper to be published in October.Downing Street has refused to rule out ending EHCPs, while stressing that no decisions have yet been taken ahead of the white paper.Keir Starmer’s deputy spokesperson said: “The system is not working and is in desperate need of reform.

She said it was a “serious and complex area” that “we as a government are determined to get right”.The education secretary said: “There will always be a legal right to the additional support of children with Send need, and we will protect it. But alongside that, there will be a better system with strengthened support, improved access and more funding.”Dr Will Shield, an educational psychologist from the University of Exeter, said rumoured proposals that limit EHCPs – potentially to pupils in special schools – were “deeply problematic”.Shield said: “Mainstream schools frequently rely on EHCPs to access the funding and oversight needed to support children effectively. Without a clear, well-resourced alternative, families will fear their children are not able to access the support they need to achieve and thrive.”Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “Any reforms in this space will likely provoke strong reactions and it will be crucial that the government works closely with both parents and schools every step of the way.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsDavid BlunkettBridget PhillipsonLabourEnglandSchoolsChildrenShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, the Texas senator ensured the Republican spending bill slashed funding for weather forecasting, only to then go on vacation to Greece while his state was hit by deadly flooding, a disaster critics say was worsened by cuts to forecasting.Cruz, who infamouslyfledTexas for Cancun when a crippling winter storm ravaged his state in 2021, wasseenvisiting the Parthenon in Athens with his wife, Heidi, on Saturday, a day after a flash flood along the Guadalupe River in central Texas killed more than 100 people,includingdozens of children and counselors at a camp.The Greece trip, firstreportedby the Daily Beast, ended in time for Cruz to appear at the site of the disaster on Monday morning to decry the tragedy and promise a response from lawmakers.“There’s no doubt afterwards we are going to have a serious retrospective as you do after any disaster and say ‘OK what could be done differently to prevent this disaster?’” Cruz told Fox News. “The fact you have girls asleep in their cabins when flood waters are rising, something went wrong there. We’ve got to fix that and have a better system of warnings to get kids out of harm’s way.”The National Weather Service has facedscrutinyin the wake of the disaster after underestimating the amount of rainfall that was dumped upon central Texas, triggering floods that caused the deaths and around $20bn in estimated economic damages. Late-night alerts about the dangerous floods were issued by the service but the timeliness of the response, and coordination with local emergency services, will be reviewed by officials.But before his Grecian holiday, Cruz ensured a reduction in funding to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (Noaa) efforts to improve future weather forecasting of events that cause the sort of extreme floods that are being worsened by the human-caused climate crisis.Cruz inserted language into the Republicans’ “big beautiful” reconciliation bill, prior to itssigning by Donald Trump on Friday, that eliminates a $150m fund to “accelerate advances and improvements in research,observation systems, modeling, forecasting, assessments, and dissemination of information to the public” around weather forecasting.A further $50m in Noaa grants to study climate-related impacts on oceans, weather systems and coastal ecosystems was also removed. Cruz was contacted by the Guardian with questions about these cuts and his trip to Greece.Environmental groups said the slashed funding is just the latest blow to federal agencies tasked with predicting and responding to disasters such as the Texas flood. More than 600 employees have exited the National Weather Service amid a Trump administration push to shrink the government workforce, leaving many officesshort-staffed of meteorologists and other support workers.Around a fifth of all full-time workers at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), meanwhile, are also set to depart.“Ted Cruz has spent years doing big oil’s bidding, gutting climate research, defunding Noaa, and weakening the very systems meant to warn and protect the public,’ said Cassidy DiPaola, communications director of Fossil Free Media.“That’s made disasters like this weekend’s flood in Texas even more deadly. Now he’s doubling down, pushing through even more cuts in the so-called big beautiful bill. Texans are dead and grieving, and Cruz is protecting big oil instead of the people he’s supposed to represent. It’s disgraceful.”Cruz, who has previously cast doubt over the scientific reality of the climate crisis, said that complaints about cuts to the National Weather Service are “partisan finger pointing”, although he conceded that people should’ve been evacuated earlier.“Some are eager to point at the National Weather Service and saying that cuts there led to to a lack of warning,” the Republican senator told reporters on Monday. “I think that’s contradicting by the facts and if you look in the facts in particular number one and these warnings went out hours before the flood became a true emergency.”The Trump administration, too, has rejected claims that the service was short-staffed, pointing out that extra forecasters were assigned to the San Antonio and San Angelo field offices. The service’s employees union has said the offices were staffed adequately but were missing some key positions, such as a meteorologist role designed to coordinate with local emergency managers.“People were sleeping in the middle of the night when the flood came,” said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary. “That was an act of God; it’s not the administration’s fault the floods hit when it did.” Leavitt said any blame placed upon Trump for flood forecasting is a “depraved lie”.Resources for weather forecasting, as well as broader work to understand the unfolding climate crisis, could be set for further cutbacks, however. The Trump administration’s2026 budget proposalseeks to dismantle all of Noaa’s weather and climate research labs, along with Noaa’s entire research division. This would halt research and development of new weather forecasting technologies and methods.This planned budget, which would need to be passed by the Republican-held Congress to become law, comes as the threats from extreme weather events continue to mount due to rising global temperatures.“We have added a lot of carbon to the atmosphere, and that extra carbon traps energy in the climate system,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University.“Because of this extra energy, every weather event we see now carries some influence from climate change. The only question is how big that influence is.“Measuring the exact size takes careful attribution studies, but basic physics already tells us the direction – climate change very likely made this event stronger.”Explore more on these topicsTexas floods 2025Ted CruzExtreme weatherNatural disastersClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

She was suspicious of your actions.“When you went to the bathroom, she took the opportunity to look under the mattress.”The woman found some tablets hidden under the mattress, the court heard.Colbeck said: “The complainer then carried out an internet search for abortion tablets and confronted you over your actions.”He added: “You planned out what you did to your victim using resources available to you as a paramedic.”Defending, Mark Stewart KC said: “I express Mr Doohan’s deep sorrow and regret for the actions he is now in the court charged with.“His position is that he is filled with remorse for the harm he has caused, and the breach of trust his actions represented.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandGlasgowEdinburghnewsShareReuse this content"

But do I regret some of the decisions they’ve made? Absolutely I do. And I think they could have done so much better.”Senior Labour figures have suggested the party should introduce a wealth tax on rich people in the budget. The former Labour leaderNeil Kinnock said on Sundaysuch a gesture “in the direction of equity fairness would make a big difference”.But Caudwell said a wealth tax combined with other measures Labour had introduced would be a major disincentive for investors, even if he would personally be happy to pay.“I would be very in favour of a wealth tax if it was global,” he said. “The rich-poor divide is the evil of society and how do we fix that?”But he said that changes to agricultural property relief, changes to workers’ rights and increases to the minimum wage and employers’ national insurance was creating a more difficult climate for business.“I think you can do some of those things, but you just can’t do everything,” he said. “You introduce a wealth tax on top of that and it just isn’t going to work. I know people that are leaving as we speak. They’re going to Monaco, they’re going to Dubai.“I bet 10 people in the last three or four months have said, ‘Why don’t you go to Dubai?’ Well, I don’t want to go to Dubai, I’m British, I love it here. I don’t mind paying my taxes.“I want to influence rich people to do more philanthropically and to pay taxes. A wealth tax would be very destructive on top. I don’t say that because I’m trying to protect my money – because I’m giving it away.”Caudwell said Starmer should be bolder in his second year as prime minister. “I’d be a bit like a [version of] Trump who’s smart and who’s humanitarian. And I’d force things through. You wouldn’t do any of the same things [as Trump], but it is what we need.”The businessman has previously been a guest of Farage on GB News and said the pair agreed on a lot of topics. But he ruled out backing Reform, calling Farage a “climate sceptic” and said the climate crisis was “the most crucial thing we’re facing”.‘We need real change, not fiddling at the edges’: voters on Labour’s first yearRead more“I would be concerned that he’s too much of a Trumpite … and that would not be healthy for Britain at all. But a lot of what he says makes a lot of sense to me,” he said. “He’s able to talk very directly to people’s concerns.”Caudwell said he would continue to urge a focus on young people and how investment in prevention would save billions in the long run for the justice system and the NHS.“I think social media is disastrous for people’s mental health,” he said. “AI is going to be completely disastrous. Even up until probably four or five years ago, if I watched a video, I’d know it was real.“Now the kids are going to see this stuff, they’re not going to have a clue what’s real.

This process has been seen in Iceland, an unusual island that sits on a mid-ocean tectonic plate boundary. But the research inChileis one of the first studies to show a surge in volcanism on a continent in the past, after the last ice age ended.Global heating caused by the burning of fossil fuels is now melting ice caps and glaciers across the world. The biggest risk of a resurgence of volcanic eruptions is in west Antarctica, the researchers said, whereat least 100 volcanoeslie under the thick ice. This ice isvery likely to be lostin the coming decades and centuries as the world warms.Volcanic eruptions can cool the planet temporarily by shooting sunlight-reflecting particles into the atmosphere. However, sustained eruptions would pump significant greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide and methane. This would further heat the planet and potentially create a vicious circle, in which rising temperatures melt ice that leads to further eruptions and more global heating.Pablo Moreno-Yaeger, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, US, who led the research, said: “As glaciers retreat due to climate change, our findings suggest these volcanoes go on to erupt more frequently and more explosively.”The research, which waspresented at the Goldschmidt geochemistry conferencein Prague, and is in the final stages of review with an academic journal, involved camping high in the Andes, among active and dormant volcanoes.Detailed work on one volcano, called Mocho-Choshuenco, used radioisotope dating to estimate the age of volcanic rocks produced before, during and after the last ice age, when the 1,500-metre-thick Patagonian ice sheet covered the area. Analysis of the minerals in the rocks also revealed the depth and temperature at which the rocks formed.This data revealed that thick ice cover had suppressed the volume of eruptions between 26,000 and 18,000 years ago, allowing a large reservoir of magma to build up 10-15km (6.2-9.3 miles) below the surface. After the ice melted, from about 13,000 years ago, the pressure on the magma chamber was released, gasses in the liquid or molten rock expanded and explosive eruptions followed.“We found that following deglaciation, the volcano starts to erupt way more, and also changes composition,” said Moreno-Yaeger. The composition changed as the magma melted crustal rocks while eruptions were suppressed. This made the molten rock more viscous and more explosive on eruption.View image in fullscreenIceland has experienced eruptions linked to the melting of its glaciers and ice caps.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“Our study suggests this phenomenon isn’t limited to Iceland, where increased volcanicity has been observed, but could also occur inAntarctica,” he said. “Other continental regions, like parts of North America, New Zealand and Russia, also now warrant closer scientific attention.”Previous research has shownvolcanic activity increased globallyby two to six times after the last ice age, but the Chilean study was one of the first to show how this happened. A similar phenomenon was reported via the analysis of rocks ineastern Californiain 2004.A recent review by scientists found there had been relativelylittle study on how the climate crisis had been affecting volcanic activity. They said more research was “critically important” in order to be better prepared for the damage caused by volcanic eruptions to people and their livelihoods and for possible climate-volcano feedback loops that could amplify the climate crisis. For example,more extreme rainfallis also expected to increase violent explosive eruptions.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisVolcanoesIcePolar regionsGlaciersGeologyChilenewsShareReuse this content"

During that time judicial organs were attacked as “bourgeois” and the nascent court system was largely suspended.China tops list of countries trying to silence exiled dissidents over past decade, study showsRead moreRen is one of hundreds of human rights lawyers to have been targeted since the “709 incident”, a nationwide crackdown on lawyers and activists that started on 9 July 2015. According to human rights groups and the US government, about 300 people from the loose collective of a burgeoning rights defence movement, known asweiquan,were targeted in the round-up. At least 10 were convicted of crimes such as “subversion of state power” and given jail terms, while dozens more have been subjected to surveillance, harassment and the revocation of their professional licences in the years since.Modern China has never welcomed human rights lawyers. But in the relatively open years of the early 2000s, with the rise of the internet and China’s increasing desire for approval on the world stage, the space for civil society grew to a degree that is now almost unrecognisable. Lawyers scored wins for defendants in cases ranging fromtainted baby milk formula scandalsto the abuse of migrant workers.View image in fullscreenRen QuanniuPhotograph: supplied“It’s hard to say we achieved success – we can only say that the services we provided have made it more difficult for the authorities to persecute certain groups,” saidJiang Tianyong, a 54-year-old former human rights lawyer known for taking on cases involving religious and ethnic minorities who served two years in prison for “inciting subversion of state power”.But the nascent movement that Jiang was part of was suppressed soon after Xi Jinping, China’s leader, took power in 2012.A suppression that is less visibleAlthough someweiquanlawyers were also interested in political reform, most were focused on working within the existing Chinese system. The daily grind was not about promulgating foreign ideas, said Ren. It was about defending ordinary citizens “based on the existing laws of China itself, the laws of the Chinese Communist party’s own legal system. Yet even within that framework, the lawyers were not allowed to help.”Under Xi’s rule,activists have been rounded up, independent law firms and NGOs have been reined in, and any kind of organised activity outside the auspices of the Communist party (CCP) has been tightly restricted.View image in fullscreenLawyer Ren Quanniu, representing Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan who reported on Wuhan’s Covid-19 outbreak, in 2020.Photograph: Leo Ramirez/AFP/Getty Images“The Chinese government under Xi Jinping has sought to eradicate the influence of lawyers who defend people’s rights,” said Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch.Ten years on from the crackdown, human rights workers say that the suppression of independent lawyers has become more systematic, and less visible, than rounding up individuals. Those affected by the 709 incident describe living under conditions of harassment and surveillance, and are often blocked from leaving the country. Jiang hasn’t seen his wife and daughter, who left China, in over a decade.More broadly, lawyers working on cases that the CCP considers sensitive have been stripped of their professional credentials, while legal and political reforms have strengthened the role of the CCP in law firms.Ren escaped the first wave of reprisals after the 709 incident. For a few years, he tried to keep on taking up sensitive cases, including that ofZhang Zhan, the citizen journalist who was jailed after reporting from Wuhan on the early days on the Covid-19 pandemic.In 2021, his licence was revoked.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenJiang Tianyong, who appeared in court in 2017 (top).Photograph: AFP/Getty Images/ suppliedAccording to data gathered by Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a US-based NGO, between 2017 and 2019, there were 29 cases of law firms or lawyers having their licences revoked or suspended, compared with nine cases between 2014 and 2016.At the same time, China has expanded the provision of legal aid, which the government says will “benefit more people in need”. According to a Chinese study published in 2022, 60% of defendants with legal representation would receive government-sponsored legal aid. But the legal aid law states that its aim is to “uphold the leadership of the Chinese Communist party” and critics say that the changes, which include the insertion of Xi Jinping Thought into the charter of the All-China Lawyers Association, have narrowed the space for independent lawyers.“The Chinese government has been increasing ideological control throughout the legal profession while also increasing the provision of public legal services, and at the same time requiring those legal services be provided by lawyers who are loyal to the party,” said Wang.Many of China’s human rights lawyers say their work has been pushed underground. Those without licences try to offer informal advice to people in need, but their ability is severely limited.Under these conditions, “no one is truly safe,” said Xie Yanyi, a lawyer detained in the 709 crackdown. “Human rights belong to everyone, and the rule of law protects everyone.”Still, Xie remains hopeful for the future. “Although the year of the 709 incident marked a major regression in the rule of law in China … people, I believe, are gradually building resilience, maturing and becoming stronger.”China’s Ministry of Justice and Public Security Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsChinaHuman rightsAsia PacificFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

Families and campaigners say waiting times for assessment are too long and children’s needs are going unmet, with many pupils out of school because the specialist support they need is unavailable.Local councils, meanwhile, have built up debts running into hundreds of millions of pounds that have pushed many authorities to the brink of bankruptcy as demand for specialist support has rocketed while the system has long been underfunded. The government says it inherited a system “on its knees”.Costs are huge. Funding for Send pupils in England increased by £4bn (59%) between 2015 and 2024, taking total funding to £12bn in 2025. However, it is still insufficient to meet demand, hence the government’s desire to overhaul the system.What are EHCPsand why do they matter?Education, health and care plans were introduced under the 2014 legislation – replacing the old system of “statements” – and provide Send pupils with a legal entitlement to the specialist educational support they need in order to secure the best possible outcomes across education, health and social care.A reportby the Institute for Fiscal Studies found the number of schoolchildren with EHCPs increased by 180,000 (71%) between 2018 and 2024 to the point where almost 5% of pupils in England now have EHCPs.They provide for children with the highest needs and local authorities are legally bound to cover the cost of the provision set out in a child’s plan. For families desperate to get their children the support they need, EHCPs provide some statutory certainty in a system that is overstretched and underfunded.What is the government planning?We don’t yet have any firm details, and that is part of the problem. The government’s proposals for change are expected to be set out in a schools white paper that is due to be published in October.What we know so far is that ministers want to build greater inclusion in England’s mainstream schools, so they are able to offer the right expert support to meet children’s special needs.The government’s hope is that, in meeting more children’s special needs in mainstream, fewer will need to go to specialist schools that are oversubscribed, often independent and as a result extremely expensive.Why are parents and campaigners concerned?Although they agree the system is not working and is in urgent need of reform, they are worried that the government’s changes could make things a whole lot worse for children with Send.From families’ point of view, one of the most concerning proposals the government is understood to be considering, is restricting access to – or even abolishing – EHCPs that more than 600,000 children and young people rely on for individual support.The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, questioned over the weekend, failed to reassure anxious parents that EHCPs would be protected and retained within the new system. The most she could offer was that no decisions on EHCPs had yet been made.Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsEducation policyPrimary schoolsSecondary schoolsDepartment for EducationEnglandLabourexplainersShareReuse this content"

Your hate-watch of the summer is hereFrom moaning about the truffle to complaining their towels are too smooth, everyone is absolutely awful in this wild reality show about the super-rich and their minions. Prepare to lap it upLucy ManganMon 7 Jul 2025 16.55 EDTShareWho among us, as the summer months and dreams of sun and cloudless skies begin and the visions of holidays and freedom take on solid form, does not think: where oh where is my hate-watch of the season?Well, fear not,mes chéris– the wait is over! Billion Dollar Playground has arrived and it is a feast for all. Imagine thatThe White Lotus’s characterswere real, but worse, and that none of them – increasingly unbelievably – ended up murdered. One reprobate complains that the bath towels in their luxury beachfront rental in Sydney are “too smooth”. Another derides the chef for putting smoked salmon in her caviar and asks: “Is that the same truffle as yesterday? Then definitely not.” Mo’ canapes, mo’ problems.That has got your glands juicing, hasn’t it? Feel that vitriol start to pump! Remember what it feels like to be truly alive! And I have barely started. Because, unlike at The White Lotus, below stairs isn’t much better.But I am getting ahead of myself. Let’s start at the beginning. Alex and Tom are an Australian husband-and-wife team who own Luxico, a company that manages A$1bn-worth (£480m-worth) of wildly opulent properties for wildly rich people who rent them out to other wildly rich people while, presumably, the owners are staying at one of their other wildly opulent properties. We do not warm to Alex and Tom (“Pressure makes diamonds – and rich people love diamonds!” he says of the efforts his minions must make to serve the wealthy guests), but they are not around enough to hate, so save your energy. We have much to be getting on with.The team whose job it is to prepare the house before a group of self-made millionaires arrive for a girls’ weekend is headed by the chief concierge, Salvatore. He can spot a misaligned chair or a rucked rug at 50 paces and needs everyone to follow orders – and a minutely detailed timetable – at all times so the endeavour doesn’t collapse into a heap of dust and rouse the ire of the vile, whining people (“I thought the beach was private?”) they are gathered to serve.Unfortunately, one of his team members is Heaven. She loves to be around money and doesn’t see why she should be “disrespected” by being required to follow instructions. She sets up great events for the guests – such as getting them exclusive access to the amusement park Luna Park, so it can serve as the backdrop to dessert for their first meal – but doesn’t follow through on details, such as bringing crockery and cutlery. Everyone else must abandon their jobs to save the guests’ night (and Heaven’s backside).Of course, she is endlessly grateful for this. Just kidding. She takes responsibility for nothing and is a piece of work. Her life plan seems to involve finding a sugar daddy then “being able to afford Salvatore” herself. Smashing.Elsie is the housekeeper. She has a robust attitude to the job. When confronted with the problem of four bottles of Dom Pérignon missing from a guest’s luggage, she suggests serving whatever the house already holds. “They won’t be able to tell the fucking difference.” We warm to Elsie.Jay is the maintenance man and driver. He is all teeth and abs. He has a second job as a cover model for spicy romance novels. No, really. He enjoys his life.Matt and George are handsome brothers and chefs. They enjoy their lives, too, and are sanguine about being wheeled out to distract guests with their hotness any time disaster looms. Especially Matt.Nicole is a trainee concierge, keen to do well, but, one suspects, on a collision course to either Jay’s or Matt’s bed – she just has to decide whether she wants a blinding grin or a nice meal afterwards.Jasmine is the new deputy concierge, rapidly promoted to chief when Salvatore – goaded by Heaven’s inability to understand that she is not the centre of the universe – leaves abruptly. This makes him almost as bad as Heaven in my book, but no one is listening to me.JB is the butler. He fancied being the chief concierge himself. By the end of the first two episodes, he is showing signs of being a Gallic Machiavelli. He is also the chief cocktail supplier and a backup hottie to the chefs.The guests? I have spent enough time and words on them already. I wish them nothing but repeat truffles, smooth towels, salmony caviar and painful ends.In short, it’s a winner. Your new escapist watch is here. Next week, it’s tech bros. Enjoy.Billion Dollar Playground airs on BBC three and is available on BBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsReality TVTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Sometimes that’s liberatingAshton ApplewhiteMon 7 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 14.36 EDTShareIstarted learning aboutageingand ageism – prejudice and discrimination on the basis of age – almost 20 years ago, as I entered my 50s. That’s when it hit me that this getting older thing was actually happening tome. I was soon barraged by advice on how to age well. Many concepts, like “active ageing”, were obvious. (Don’t be a couch potato.) Some, like “successful ageing”, were obnoxious. (In my opinion, if you wake up in the morning, you’re ageing successfully.) One, “ageing gracefully”, was intriguing.Although I’ve written a wholebookabout ageism, I wasn’t sure I knew how to go about ageing gracefully. For starters, it didn’t seem as though I qualified. When I was speaking at a conference a few years ago, a woman in the elevator recognized my name from my badge. “Are you the one talking about ageing gracefully?” she asked. “If that’s what you’re looking for, you’ve got the wrong person,” I blurted. My clumsiness, like my bluntness, is legendary.Still, I liked the sound of it. Grace refers to more than the physical realm, of course. We can encounter it in a relationship, through worship, in nature, or while listening to music. Grace can be transformative.So I embarked on a quest to find out what it means to age gracefully. I consulted my bookshelves, friends and colleagues, and the internet. For a synthesis, I even ran the phrase past ChatGPT, which told me “ageing gracefully” means “embracing one’s age without excessive resistance or denial, nurturing overall wellbeing, and cultivating purpose, joy, and connection”. Sounds great!But that doesn’t seem to be what it means in practice. In our hypercapitalist, youth-centric western culture, ageing well tends to mean spending money and time trying to look and move like younger versions of ourselves. Unsurprisingly, many “cope” with growing older by leaning heavily on denial. It’s not much of a strategy, but it’s human. It’s also why the landscape is strewn with euphemisms, like “mature” and “seasoned”, to avoid the dread “old”.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’“Ageing gracefully” is one of those euphemisms. When I queried beauty culture critic and Guardian US columnistJessica DeFinoabout the phrase, she called it a “particularly nefarious euphemism, because it implies that anti-ageing shouldappear to be effortless”. In fact, it’s anything but, she told me over email: “‘Ageing gracefully’ demands an incredible amount of effort, then demands even more effort to conceal said effort.” What’s more graceful, after all, than the ballerina whose apparent weightlessness draws on decades of grueling schooling?The contradictions are everywhere. Embrace ageing, but appear to not age. Stay positive but accept limitations. Be authentic, but conform. Some of this reflects the very real complexities of ageing: the need to adapt as bodies change and roles evolve while also staying as active and engaged as possible.View image in fullscreen‘Athough I’ve written a whole book about ageism, I wasn’t sure I knew how to go about aging gracefully,’ says Ashton Applewhite.Photograph: Adrian BuckmasterTo some, “ageing gracefully” means letting nature take its course: “embracing the natural signs of ageing without visiting a board-certified plastic surgeon along the way”, as plastic surgeon Stephen Bresnick writes on hiswebsite. He calls this approach “outdated” and urges potential patients to consider facelifts, tummy tucks and breast lifts. In avideotitled “Stop telling women to AGE GRACEFULLY!!”, TikTok influencer Kitchen Killa Lisa likewise advises against accepting age-related changes. “I’m so tired of people telling women how they should live their lives!” she rants. “Get the Botox. Get the filler. Get the Botox. Get the facelift, the eyelift.Lift them titties, bitch!”One thing’s for sure: the phrase isgendered. There’s plenty of advice for men on staying fit and looking good in midlife and beyond. But a search for “ageing gracefully” yields a sea of female faces, punctuated occasionally by George Clooney’s or Jake Gyllenhaal’s. Girls learn early on to conform to gender stereotypes that encourage compliance and “likability”. Girls also learn to be each other’s harshest critics, and the policing never stops. As in the workplace – where women are too sexy, then too fertile, then neither – the standards for ageing while female are impossible to meet.“Ageing gracefully” is also ageist, because it implies there’s something wrong with ageing past youth. But the kids aren’t alright either. Campaigns are targeting ever-younger demographics in pursuit of lifelong customers. In 2023, Carson Bradley, a teen TikTok influencer, went viral with avideoof her 25-minute skincare routine “to slow the ageing process as a 14-year-old”. A search for “baby botox” – smaller injections than regular Botox and not actually for babies, phew – yields an astonishing91mresults. In the hands of the beauty and wellness industries, “ageing gracefully” is just another faux-positive phrase used to sell anti-ageing products, like luxury skincare firmEstée Lauder’s campaign to “reframe the conversation from anti-aging to visible age reversal”. At any stage of life, the message is clear: ageing is to be feared and fought.Then there’s the ableism. Over time, balance deteriorates and bodies work less well. It gets harder to stay mobile, let alone graceful. How’s a person to adapt? Reluctantly, without complaint and ideally in private. Many older people refuse to use walkers or wheelchairs because the stigma is so great, even if it means never leaving home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sometimes that’s liberating. Sometimes it’s a response to being ignored or condescended to. Graceful it ain’t. “Ageing gracefully” is “a way to say ‘sit down and shut up’”, snaps educator Barbara Osborn, a colleague whose opinion I’d solicited. “Don’t struggle. Don’t explore. Don’t call for change.”Analternative?“Age disgracefully” – aphrasethat’s been gaining traction in the media and popular culture since the turn of the century. Defy “age appropriate” expectations for what to say or wear and where to do it. Reject modesty and restraint! Be yourself! In other words, hit that club, wear that miniskirt, ignore age stereotypes. Think Iggy Pop and Mick Jagger, or the fashion icons ofAdvanced Style. More power to these octogenarian rockers and fashionistas; ageing is utterly individual, and they personify the fact that we grow more different from each other over time. They’re having a fine time, and they’re not about to shuffle obediently offstage.I’m not defying the same way they are. I’m not taking up pole dancing or skateboarding. And I’ll never be among the gracefuls, no matter how hard I try. Ageing is complicated, and we each have to find our own way through it.My path lies in rejecting this culture’s ageist, sexist, ableist drumbeat: the mainstream narrative that the way to relate to ageing is to resist it. I’ve discussed this with countless friends over the years, and asked quite a few what they thought it meant to age gracefully. My favorite response came in conversation with organizer Julia Rhodes Davis. “The more we turn and face the truth – that we are all ageing, that death is coming for us all – the more alive we become,” said Julia. “That’s my definition of ‘ageing gracefully.’”I’ll take it. To me, it means growing older unapologetically, truthfully and in community. I’ll call it ageing with grace.An internationally recognized expert on ageism,Ashton Applewhiteis the author ofThis Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageismand a co-founder of theOld School HubExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyThe joys of ageingWomen (Life and style)HealthPlastic surgeryAgeingWomen (Society)featuresShareReuse this content"

But insiders and scientists warn that hidden within it is a mix of household and industrial chemicals such asPfas(“forever chemicals”), pharmaceuticals, pesticides, hormone-damaging chemicals and microplastics, threatening the long-term health of the land.Every year, 768,000 tonnes of this byproduct of wastewater treatment is spread over 150,000 hectares of agricultural land inEngland. The practice is banned in some countries, such as Switzerland, but in the UK it continues with little scrutiny and has become a covert route for dumping toxic industrial waste, experts say.“It’s a Trojan horse,” said a water sector insider. “Pfas, pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors and microplastics hidden in sludge threaten the long-term sustainability of humanity’s farmland.” These pollutants are not tested for under current regulations, which only require screening for a handful of heavy metals.Spreading sludge is incentivised because it is the cheapest disposal method. “It would cost water companies a lot to get rid of it themselves,” said anEnvironment Agency(EA) officer, who asked to remain anonymous. “So they’re happy to give it to farmers cheaply or for free.”For farmers, rising fertiliser costs make it appear a win-win. “It’s a closed loop where everyone absolves themselves of costs,” the officer said.Industries also benefit by sending liquid waste to wastewater plants, which is cheaper than incineration or other methods.“Some water companies have made big business decisions around taking industrial wastewater and getting paid for it,” said a second EA insider. Both sources are concerned about using sewage works to dispose of hazardous waste – especially landfill leachate, which is often added to systems unequipped to treat it.“As soon as you let industrial waste into your sewer network, your sewage becomes hazardous waste,” said the first EA officer. “Masking it as sludge and calling it fertiliser is a problem.”The result is a system that financially benefits water companies, farmers and industry – but not the public or the environment.“If it’s seen to be given away it could be viewed as a waste, and they absolutely abhor the waste label,” said the second EA source. “The water companies say they can make a profit from it but they are very reluctant to give us any hard data – they claim commercial confidentiality.”Dr David Tompkins, a soil and waste expert at the consultancy WSP, said: “It’s what’s in it – and what we don’t remove – that’s the problem. We’re dealing with Pfas, microplastics, flame retardants and other hazards.”Regulations set in 1989 are no longer fit for purpose, the second EA source said. “Metal levels have dropped, so the system says ‘great, we’re fine’ – but everything else is ignored.”Oversight is weak, they said. “We won’t know when or how much sludge is going to be spread. Records are kept by the water industry, and they like it that way.”“Digesters are continuous systems and are designed to remove pathogens, not these chemicals,” said a water expert. Even then, “new sludge mixes with old, and some is removed before it’s fully digested”, they said. “A portion of what goes to land is not properly treated.”Scientists suspect thesecontaminants are entering the food chain. “We’ve seen Pfas and pharmaceuticals accumulate in crops and livestock,” said the expert. But there is no requirement to test food for these substances and therefore little data on it.The EA haslong known sludge contains pollutants. A 2017 internal report warned of physical contaminants “potentially resulting in soils becoming unsuitable for agriculture”. That information was not shared with farmers.“Quite the opposite,” said Georgia Elliott-Smith of the campaign group Fighting Dirty. “In 2022, farmers were incentivised by Defra to spread sewage sludge as part of the sustainable farming initiative.” Defra says it encouraged organic matter use generally, without specifying sludge.“At a time when British farming is on its knees,” Elliott-Smith added, “the government has again prioritised corporate interests. Farmers now face a hopeless choice: cheap but toxic sludge, or costly agrochemicals.”In Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, sludge spreading on farmland has been reduced or banned. Switzerland incinerates all its sludge and stores the ash for phosphorus recovery. Tompkins noted: “They know it’s expensive. But they’ve decided it’s necessary.”In the UK, political will is lacking. “It’s regulation by inertia,” Tompkins added. “The Environment Agency is working within tight budgets that can limit its monitoring capacity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It’s time for the UK government to set tough standards to stop this chemical pollutant ending up on farms, along with action to cut down on these harmful chemicals at their source.”For Tompkins, “we need to price food and water properly. Regulations tend toward the minimum baseline. If we want better, we’ll have to pay for it. Sludge has value but the way we manage it destroys that value.”Critics also point to the voluntary “safe sludge matrix”, a guide developed by industry and consultants, as a fig leaf. “There is nothing safe about the safe sludge matrix,” said one industry expert.“It’s a PR exercise,” said the second EA insider. “It was designed to protect [water companies’] access to the land bank. They don’t want retailers or farmers losing confidence in spreading.”The consultants ADAS were involved in the creation of the matrix. A spokesperson said it was introduced to address food safety and human health risks from microbial pathogens after a year of intensive consultations. The agreement was made between Water UK and the British Retail Consortium, and included inputs from a range of interested parties including the EA, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as well as the National Farmers’ Union, Country Land and Business Association, food manufacturers and food processors, it said.Martin Lines, the CEO of the Nature FriendlyFarmingNetwork, said: “Farmers want to protect their soils and grow safe food, but they’re being put in a tough position. Sewage sludge is being spread with little testing or transparency. Contaminants like Pfas and microplastics shouldn’t be anywhere near farmland. Without proper regulation, this isn’t a circular economy – it’s a failure of oversight.”A long-promised regulatory overhaul through environmental permitting regulations was due in 2023, but the deadline passed with no new date in sight.Experts say a better system would start upstream, controlling what enters treatment plants. New EU rules will require pharmaceutical and personal care product makers to pay 80% of waste treatment costs, but the UK has no such mechanism.“We’re not in control of the life cycle of the molecules we create,” said a water expert. “They go out into the biosphere and build up. All these substances are accumulating.”Some argue the legal tools already exist. According to Tompkins, “there’s a clause that could be interpreted to say ‘anything hazardous’ should be checked. So if we wanted to look for all these other things, we could.”Ultimately, said the first EA source, “once you let industrial waste into your works, what comes out isn’t sewage sludge. It’s hazardous waste.”Water UK said spreading bioresources was a longstanding, regulated practice that helps farmers and reduces reliance on chemical fertilisers. While some contain Pfas or microplastics, it said, legal standards and test methods were lacking and had to be set by government. It said water companies were supporting research and trialling uses like biofuels.The Environment Agency said sludge must not harm soil or water and that it enforced strict rules, with thousands of farm inspections each year. Defra said it wanted sludge to be used safely and sustainably and had launched an independent water commission to review the rules.Explore more on these topicsPollutionEnvironment AgencyWasteFarmingPfasEnglandPlasticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He wanted to put a flexi-disc on the cover and said: “Can we use Suspect Device?” That was going to be Still Little Fingers’ debut single so I told him he couldn’t have that, but I would write him a song.It’s the old adage – write about what you know. The opening line is: “There’s nothin’ for us in Belfast.” It couldn’t have been more teenage – “God, I’m bored.” Then the second verse referenced the army being on the streets. But that was actually what contributed to the boredom. Because of the situation inNorthern Ireland, bands wouldn’t come and play. The only honourable exception, prior to punk, was Rory Gallagher, who came every year without fail.Gordon Ogilvie, our co-manager, changed a couple of lines and we were good to go. These days, I could knock it up in my home studio and let Gavin hear the rough. But to hear it back then, he had to come to our next live show. We were all excited about what we thought – well, I certainly thought – was a good song. But at the bar afterwards, he told me he thought it was crap!View image in fullscreen‘Lightning in a bottle’ … the cover of Alternative Ulster.Photograph: TheCoverVersion/AlamyThings were happening fast for us because John Peel was playing Suspect Device into the ground. Island, the record label, flew us to London to record some demos. We really thought we’d hit the big time. Ed Hollis was producing – this was a man who had just had a Top 10 hit with Eddie and the Hot Rods’ Do Anything You Wanna Do. But he insisted on hiring in all this equipment we weren’t au fait with, so the demos weren’t very representative of how the band sounded. Unsurprisingly, Island passed.We were thrown into limbo. We’d gone so far down the path with Island that we had quit our jobs. Then out of the blue, we got a phone call from Tom Robinson, who was looking for an opening act. We started to feel a bit of pressure in terms of needing something to raise our profile, and then the Rough Trade label suggested it put out Alternative Ulster.In the interim, Gordon had managed to get the demo tapes from Island. We didn’t have the money to re-record it, but Rough Trade did pay for a remix. The single’s cover photo was taken by Milton Haworth, who had happened to be at a disturbance somewhere. In the midst of it all, he saw the soldier crouched down by a pillar with his gun and thislittle kid on top of the pillar laughing. It was lightning in a bottle in terms of photography.We do an outdoor show every year in Belfast. We always finish with Alternative Ulster and it’s such a unifying call. I find it so pretentious when you say stuff like this – but when you stand on the stage and watch the audience’s reaction, it’s humbling.View image in fullscreenGeoff Travis in the Rough Trade shop, London, circa 1977.Photograph: Estate Of Keith Morris/RedfernsGeoff Travis,producer and Rough Traderecord shop and labelfounderJohn Peel playing Suspect Device was the beginning of everything. We contacted Gordon Ogilvie and started buying large quantities of it to distribute. That’s how we got to know the band. Rough Trade had The Cartel [a record distribution organisation] and the idea was to bypass the existing conventional mechanisms and let the independent sector grow.I never really knew the full story of what happened with Island. We did so well distributing Suspect Device that we simply asked if we could do the next single as a Rough Trade release, a one-off. Alternative Ulster was remixed by me with the engineer, Doug Bennett, at Olympic Studios in London. I didn’t do that much, but maybe made it a bit more lively. That was the first time I’d ever been in the studio. It was quite amusing.What gave me the gall to do that without experience? I guess I just knew how I wanted it to sound. That was the beginning of my producer career. It was the times, it was the whole punk ethic where you just went and did stuff.I’ve said this many times, but I just love Henry Cluney’s rhythm guitar. The way he played, it’s like a bar of steel or something. That was a big part of their sound. And Jake had that really great voice, played great guitar. He meant it – he was convincing. We were quite young ourselves. We didn’t really know huge amounts about SLF’s culture at that time, but we were learning. There wasn’t really time to sit down for a few hours and discuss politics, discuss the future of the world, discuss aims and aspirations. We just did stuff.Alternative Ulster has been rereleased as part of Rough Trade 45s: Volume 1.

Because of power cuts?It’s unclear.How would it even work? Wouldn’t the eggs fallthrough the bars of the grill?Again, that’s unclear.

The politicians now peddling division should read itMon 7 Jul 2025 11.20 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareToday, at 8.49am, the teeming mass coursing through King’s Cross station inLondonfell silent. It continued to move, because the world must turn, but the hubbub ceased. Moments earlier, a strangely quiet, sombre loudspeaker announcement marked the moment the 7/7 terrorist bombs exploded in that station and elsewhere in the capital in 2005, killing 52 people and injuring more than 770.The capital moves on, butthe capital remembers. I stood still for a minute underneath the glowing light of a digital clock. People offered knowing glances and nods as they passed to catch their trains. At the time of the bombings, I covered London and the London mayoralty for the Guardian. I remember being called by colleagues asking for information about what they had been told in the initial moments was a giant electrical failure on the London underground. I had been warned that week about the fears in official circles that some sort of terrorist attack was possible, if not likely. I rang a contact. “It’s not an electrical incident, is it?” “No,” they replied gravely, “it isn’t.”Some things I have forgotten, but others stayed with me. The calm in those stations, even amid the horror, even when no one knew if there were more bombers, more devices. The relative calm on the streets. City dwellers are like dysfunctional families, and no less in Britain’s capital. They bicker over nonsense and trivialities, but pause all that when something serious occurs, when they need to find the ties that bind.Thirteen people died when the youngest bomber detonated his device on a No 30 double-decker bus not far from King’s Cross, in Tavistock Square. All buses stopped that morning, but by the afternoon, they were running again and Londoners were boarding them.One thing I remember acutely is the reaction of the then London mayor,Ken Livingstone. He was a controversial figure throughout his time in public life, first as a two-fingered salute to the Thatcher government during his leadership of the Greater London council and then as the lefty mayor that righties never liked, but, in the early years at least, could never quite dislike.For a time, he was formidable. It didn’t last, and by the end of his time in politics, he had pretty well obliterated goodwill and overshadowed his political accomplishments with shocking, recurring comments referencing Hitler and disgraceful remarks rightly condemned as antisemitism. He resigned from the Labour party in 2018,having been suspended two years earlierover his comments, which were exacerbated by his denials of any antisemitism in the party. Livingstone apologised for any offence, and insisted his comments were not antisemitic. In 2023, it was announced that he had Alzheimer’s and has retired from public life.When Livingstone was clever and sensible, I praised him. When he was stupid and offensive, I said that too. The Boris Johnson-supporting London Evening Standard, my former employer, onceimplied I was an uncritical Livingstone crony, pointing to an independent research project commissioned by City Hall I had worked on. But a multitude of my stories critical of Livingstone gave easy lie to that.So this is not a blithe attempt to rehabilitate Livingstone. But 20 years ago, on the day of 7/7, as London mayor, he gave an example of political leadership in the face of trauma and despair. It was just what was needed at the time, but it also highlights the inadequacy of the community stewardship we too often accept as normal in our national politics, and the current primacy of an approach that actively creates division as its modus operandi, seeking incremental gains regardless of the collateral damage.View image in fullscreenKen Livingstone boards an underground train during the morning rush hour in London as police urged Londoners to get back to work, 11 July 2005.Photograph: Paul Hackett/ReutersIn a hastily called press conference, in a dark suit, in a steady voice, but with eyes slightly watering,Livingstone said: “I want to say one thing specifically to the world today. This was not a terrorist attack against the mighty and the powerful. It was not aimed at presidents or prime ministers. It was aimed at ordinary, working-class Londoners, black and white, Muslim and Christian, Hindu and Jew, young and old. It was an indiscriminate attempt to slaughter, irrespective of any considerations for age, for class, for religion, or whatever.”That isn’t an ideology, he said: “It isn’t even a perverted faith – it is just an indiscriminate attempt at mass murder and we know what the objective is. They seek to divide Londoners. They seek to turn Londoners against each other. I said yesterday to the International Olympic Committee [London had just secured the 2012 Olympics] that the city of London is the greatest in the world, because everybody lives side by side in harmony. Londoners will not be divided by this cowardly attack. They will stand together in solidarity alongside those who have been injured and those who have been bereaved and that is why I’m proud to be the mayor of that city.”Finally, he said: “I wish to speak directly to those who came to London today to take life. I know that you personally do not fear giving up your own life in order to take others – that is why you are so dangerous. But I know you fear that you may fail in your long-term objective to destroy our free society and I can show you why you will fail.“In the days that follow look at our airports, look at our sea ports and look at our railway stations and, even after your cowardly attack, you will see that people from the rest of Britain, people from around the world will arrive in London to become Londoners and to fulfil their dreams and achieve their potential. They choose to come to London, as so many have come before, because they come to be free, they come to live the life they choose, they come to be able to be themselves. They flee you because you tell them how they should live. They don’t want that and nothing you do, however many of us you kill, will stop that flight to our city where freedom is strong and where people can live in harmony with one another. Whatever you do, however many you kill, you will fail.”From swim schools to eye clinics: how families of 7/7 victims used heartbreak to help othersRead moreIt is hard to reconcile how pitch-perfect that was with his later, awful treatment of one of London’s cherished communities. But on that day, he took an approach that absolutely chimed with me and many others. It said, we are London, we are diverse, we are fiercely unapologetic about who we are and how we live. You, the attackers, don’t like it – and, by the way, we don’t really care; we reject you. London salutes its dead and wounded. London moves on.And it’s not just London: up and down the country, there are, for all the challenges and difficulties of doing so, communities seeking to live that way, preyed upon by extremists who, for their own ends – be they political, social, ideological or criminal – seek to achieve exactly the opposite. Twenty years on, reject them too.Hugh Muir is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As a special needs parent, I can tell you: it’s terrifyingMon 7 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 07.41 EDTShareWhat will Keir Starmer and his colleagues learn from the disaster of theirattempt to cut benefits? Most speculation so far has been focused on the prime minister’s prospects, and other ministerial careers. But there are soon going to be more big decisions to make, which will have massive consequences for people’s lives.One policy area in particular is about to return the political conversation to the subject that defined last week’s fiasco: disability. Once again,LabourMPs from all wings of the party are feeling anxious and restless. Campaign groups and charities – not to mention the huge numbers of people who will be directly affected – fear the worst. With the wounds from the welfare bill fiasco still raw, there is a grim sense of a possible reprisal of the same story.And this is why. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, wants to reform England’s system of provision for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities, or Send. Long years of Conservative failure – not least, reformsintroduced a decade agothat were lamentably underfunded, and an exodus of children from mainstream to specialist schools – have resulted in ballooning costs amid disappointing outcomes. The councils that administer everything arecrying out for help. The Treasury, meanwhile, surveys the mess and demands action.A new education white paper will be published in the autumn. Phillipson says the government needs to “think very differently”. She wants to reverse a trend that took root in the Tory years and prioritise the inclusion of Send kids in mainstream schools.There is talk ofsomehow “making sure that all teachers are teachers of special educational needs [sic]”. A newneurodivergence task and finish groupthat will “work alongside the department to drive inclusive education” has been created;£740m of capital fundingis being spent on “adapting classrooms to be more accessible and for creating specialist facilities”.On the face of it, these moves are very welcome. But self-evidently, it will take much more – and a lot of time – to meaningfully turn things around. One of the big teaching unions has already said that without a commensurate increase in day-to-day schools spending, the plans could put “extreme pressure” on teachers. And there is an even bigger tension at the heart of the government’s plans.Since Labour won the election, rising noise has been coming from Whitehall and beyond about drastically restricting the legal rights to dedicated provision that underpin the education of hundreds of thousands of children and young people. Those rights are enforced by the official Send tribunal, and embodied in education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which set out children’s needs and the provision they entail in a legally binding document. Contrary to what you read incertain news outlets, they are not any kind of “golden ticket”: parents and carers used to unreturned phone calls and long waits still frequently have tofight their local councilsfor the help their plans set out. But – and as a special needs parent, I speak from experience – they usually allow stressed-out families to just about sleep at night.For about 40 years, such rightshave been a cornerstoneof the Send system. But their future is now uncertain: councils, in particular, are franticallylobbying ministersto get parents and their pesky rights out of the way. Late last year, a government sourcequoted in the Financial Timesheld out the prospect of “thousands fewer pupils” having access to rights-based provision. Despite the fact that EHCPs are most sorely needed in mainstream schools, a senior adviser to the Department for Education recently said that a consideration of whether EHCPs should no longer apply to children in exactly those settings is “the conversation we’re in the middle of”. There are whispers about families who currently have EHCPs being allowed to keep them, while in the future, kids with similar needs would be waved away, something that threatens a stereotypical two-tier model, another element with worrying echoes of the benefits disaster.View image in fullscreenBridget Phillipson leaves Downing Street after attending the weekly cabinet meeting, 24 June 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAs a result, parents and carers – and many teachers – are terrified. Whenever ministers are asked about what is going to happen next, they tend to come out with the response: “no decision has been made”. On Sunday, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg challenged Phillipson on whether she is about to “get rid” of EHCPs, which was met with vague words about improved support in schools, familiar claims that the current system is too “adversarial”, and no specific answer. This, needless to say, is not exactly allaying people’s fears.Just under483,000 children and young peoplein English schools now have an EHCP, up 11% on the previous year’s figure. Their numbers have risen partly because ad hoc, informal special needs provision in schools has become so unreliable that the only way of having any chance of securing what a child needs is to apply for one. Official data shows that themajority of applications for EHCPsare initiated by schools and colleges, often as a last-ditch move. In short, many children desperately need them. Without the support such plans are meant to guarantee, even more pupils would either exit mainstream into specialist provision that is often eye-wateringly expensive, or end up joining the increasing numbers of kids who are not in formal education at all.For the foreseeable future, because even an optimist would have to agree that improvements promised by the government will take years to really kick in, all that will remain the case. So the safest and most humane option would be to leave children’s legal entitlements in place, and start to improve Send provision as Phillipson wants, on the basis that boosted ad hoc help will naturally bring down EHCP numbers and costs. Instead, her most vivid move could be an awful rights grab, which would surely heighten the impression that this Labour party has an ingrained problem with issues around disability.A new campaign titled Save Our Children’s Rights was launched over the weekendwith a letter in the Guardiansigned by leading figures from charities and lobby groups, including Disability Rights UK, the National Autistic Society and Mencap – as well as such high-profile Send parents as the broadcasters Christine McGuinness and Carrie Grant, along with the TV naturalist and neurodiversity campaigner Chris Packham (full disclosure: I am helping out, and I was one of the signatories). For the second time in less than six months, are these really the kind of people ministers want to argue with on Good Morning Britain, 5 Live and BBC Breakfast?Schools in England ‘need complex changes’ to take more pupils with special needsRead moreAs I watched the benefits fiasco unfolding, knowing that the special needs story would soon explode, it brought one big thought to mind. Labour needs to stop sowing fear and dread among people whose lives are already full of those things. Instead of picking on vulnerable parts of the population who already view the future with deep anxiety, they should maybe go after much more powerful interests, who might be compelled into helping the government with its financial woes. Instead, fear is swirling around parts of society that are already unable to cope. Labour governments are meant to make people feel less scared, not more. If there is going to be yet another “reset”, this is where it should be focused.There is one point that may yet bring clarity to the government’s thinking. Governing politicians habitually pretend they will win future elections. But there is now every chance that Reform UK might end up in power, possibly in partnership with whatever remains of the Conservatives. Judging by his recent pronouncements, Nigel Farage hasvery questionable viewsabout special needs and disabilities. There is strong evidence that thesame is true of Kemi Badenoch. The current fashion on the political right for nonsense about savagelycutting back the statewould have deep implications for Send families. If Labour takes away so many children’s basic educational rights, it may well end up leaving them at the mercy of politicians who will then vandalise their lives. “No decision has been made,” say ministers. It is time they took the only morally and politically right one, and fast.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsOpinionLabourWelfareDisabilityBenefitsKeir StarmerBridget PhillipsoncommentShareReuse this content"

That, at any rate, is the narrative that has taken hold since Donald Trump’s retreat from the postwar global security order and the urgent pressure to rearmEurope.But to frame the dilemma facing Europe in this way is a big mistake. History teaches us that the political choice has never been about guns or butter, but rather guns or taxes.The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s seemed to close almost a century of global ideological conflict, but it was also supposed to make us all richer. With the end of the cold war, Europeans would no longer need to uphold an expensive military apparatus for territorial defence. Governments ditched conscription and walked back defence outlays. Cashing in on that so-called “peace dividend”, governments could spend on the domestic priorities of their liking, boosting non-military investment.Last month’s Nato summit in The Hague showedhow this tide has been dramatically reversed. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Trump’s uncertain commitment to Nato means that European governments have no choice but to invest more in their own mutual defence. The peace dividend, asKristalina Georgieva, the head of the IMF, stated, “is gone”.Europe’s Nato memberspledged to increasespending on “hard defence”, such as tanks and military salaries, from 2% to 3.5% of GDP by 2035.The question now is how to finance it. Forsome experts, the only way to build a warfare state that can deter Russia is to slash social spending. After all, goes the misleading argument, governments in the 1990s splashed the savings from defence on expensive welfare promises.Even before the Nato agreement in The Hague, the public were being softened up for the new reality. In a TV address in March, the French president,Emmanuel Macron, warnedcitizens that in a “more brutal” world, they would have to make budget sacrifices. Macron ruled out higher taxes. Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, decided toscrap a public holidayto finance higher defence spending. The UK has cut savagely into its international development aid budget for the same reason.But Europe would be drawing the entirely wrong lessons from history if it weakened the welfare state to build up the military state. There is another way: instead of slashing social spending, Europe’s governments should raise taxes on corporations and capital to finance deterrence.View image in fullscreenDenmark’s prime minister Mette Frederikse, France’s president Emmanuel Macron and Finland’s president Alexander Stubb attend a Nato summit in The Hague, Netherlands, 25 June 2025.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersLet’s look at what actually happened in the 1990s. While cutting defence spending after the collapse of the Soviet Union allowed governments to increase social spending, it mostly gave them room to cut taxes and budget deficits, which they did with great zeal, as the 1990s neoliberal consensus took hold and tax competition intensified.Yes, the “peace dividend” helped to financebig increasesin social spending, but with ageing societies it was mostly devoted to pensions, health and longterm care. Social protection for the working age population hasfallenacross Europesince the end of the cold war.But from the mid 1980s to 2023,corporate income tax ratesfell by around half within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Capital gains tax rates also dropped significantly: from up to 53% in the early 1990s to26% today in Germany, or from up to 30% to up to 24%today in the UK for the same period. The “peace dividend” was in fact a boon for the wealthiest in Europe.Savings in defence not only went to the private sector via tax cuts, but also via reduced fiscal deficits. Germany’s adoption of its contentious constitutional “debt brake” in 2009 helped it to achieve a balanced budget; something that would have been impossible without cutting defence spending to the bone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More public debt, as Germany has now committed itself to, will be necessary. But debt is often a regressive tax, weighing more on the poorest, as the wealthy own a large share of the debt. Moreover, if EU members don’t agree to common borrowing to finance the defence surge, as happened during the pandemic, financial markets may not let EU countries with a high debt load, such as Italy or France, increase deficit-spending on defence.The “new normal” of higher defence spending should thus also be funded by increasing taxes, especially on corporate income, high wealth and capital gains. This won’t be possible without limiting tax competition at a Europe-wide level.Indeed, the idea that some European tax havens continue to suck up corporate tax resources from others while they free-ride on their defence spending will become increasingly difficult to sustain. France and Germany have long pushed for the harmonisation of corporate taxes across the EU’s 27 members. The EU must now rein in tax-dumping countries such as neutral Ireland. Europe cannot achieve better defence without better tax revenues.And only a defence buildup that is supported by the wider public across Europe can run beyond the short-term momentum and thus develop into a credible deterrence.The experience of “military Keynesianism” globally, and across history, has never been about gunsorbutter, but gunsandbutter. In a war, you not only need weapons, but also a supportive population to operate them. Keeping the peace on the home front is just as important as holding the line in the trenches. Rather than slashing the welfare state to build up the military state, Europe’s leaders should think about how to improve and modernise social spending. Only the prospect of a better and fairer world will keep our societies united and capable of fighting.Shahin Vallée is a senior research fellow at the German Council for Foreign Relations.

Eighty years after the defeat of fascism and the creation of the UN, “we have witnessed an unparalleled collapse of multilateralism”, the Brazilian president told leaders. “Hard-won advances, such as climate and trade regimes, are under threat.” The autonomy of the Brics group was being challenged, he warned.Donald Trump has slapped hefty tariffs on several Brics nations andthreatened even higher penaltiesif the group continues to seek alternatives to the use of the dollar for international trade.Military tensions are rising. The US has launched missile attacks on one Brics nation, Iran, which Lula denounced along with the “genocide carried out by Israel in Gaza”, the attack on Ukraine (by Russia, a founder member of Brics) and Nato’s decision to allocate 5% of GDP to military spending. “It is always easier to invest in war than in peace,” he said. “The fear of a nuclear catastrophe has returned to everyday life.”Brazilian diplomats see the Brics alliance as part of an emerging new world order. With Trump pushing the US towards a more insular “America first” outlook, they see an opportunity for the old superpower hegemony to give way to a more equitable, multipolar system of global governance.And in theory, the Brics grouping should have the heft to drive through changes. Its 11 full members account for 40% of the global population and economy, and more than half of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions – on all of these counts, putting it ahead of the G7 group of the world’s richest, and ideologically capitalist, countries, mostly from the global north. But Brics nations are divided and unbalanced. China has roughly the same GDP and CO2output as all of the other Brics members combined.Hence the dismay when President Xi Jinping declined to attend the talks in Rio this week. His first no-show at a Brics summit was not well explained,prompting speculationthat China’s enthusiasm for the organisation may have diminished.“Internal tensions within Brics have increased markedly since 2014,” said Oliver Stuenkel, an associate professor at the School of International Relations at the Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) in São Paulo. “And it has become even more difficult since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.”Vladimir Putin only joined virtually, apparently due to the international criminal court warrant for his arrest. Other notable absences were Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, who was due to attend the summit before the US and Israeli attacks on his country in June and was deputised by his foreign minister.The 31-pageRio de Janeiro declaration, which was issued by the leaders on Sunday, condemned the military strikes on Iran, the attacks on Gaza and tariffs, but the language was relatively muted, and there were also soothing reassurances about theimportance of the dollar. Analysts said Brazil does not want to reappear on Trump’s tariff radar or to antagonise other countries ahead of Cop30. “There was a general sense of ‘let’s keep this as low key as possible,’” Stuenkel said. “Brazil sees Cop30 as the most important encounter of the year. It has identified climate change as a topic where it can play a leading role.”The Brics bloc sees itself as a voice for the global south, which issuffering disproportionately from the climate crisis. This provides a strong incentive to try to re-engage the wealthier parts of the world in a multilateral approach to a shared problem. The group was credited with a positive role in the Paris agreement 10 years ago.Before the conference, the environmental NGO Greenpeace urged Brics leaders to fill the climate leadership vacuum left by the US. “This is a seismic opportunity to drive bold, collaborative global south leadership. Brics nations, several of which are among the most climate vulnerable, must seize this moment and take a decisive stand for people and the planet,” said Anna Cárcamo of Greenpeace Brazil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They called for “accessible, timely and affordable” climate finance to ensure a just energy transition. And they welcomed Brazil’s plans to launch a fund at Cop30 aiming to secure long-term financing for conservation. Who will pay remains vague. “We encouraged potential donor countries to announce ambitious contributions,” the statement said. Brazil has reportedly asked China and Brics member states in the Middle East to be among the seed funders. But the bulk of the money is expected to come from wealthy northern-hemisphere nations, which are most to blame for the climate crisis.There was also pushback against the EU. The statement lamented what it called “discriminatory protectionist measures under the pretext of environmental concerns”, such as carbon border adjustments and moves to encourage deforestation-free trade – both of which are promoted by the EU. There was no mention of a timetable for phasing out oil, coal and gas. Instead, the statement acknowledged “fossil fuels will still play an important role in the world’s energy mix”. Brics now includes several of the world’s biggest oil and gas producers, though it remains behind the G7 – particularly the US, Canada and Australia – when it comes toplans for increased production.Brics leaders appear most united in their frustration at double standards and exclusionary practices. Rewriting the rules of global governance is the central goal of Brazil, which has called for an overhaul of the UN to make it “more democratic, representative, effective and efficient” and to increase the representation of developing countries in its key decision-making bodies. This has been high on the Brics agenda for many years and partly aligns with recent calls by scientists and civil society groups for a shake-up of UN structures, particularly in the climate process, which was slammed last year as overrun by fossil fuel lobbyists and “not fit for purpose”.But if this week’s summit was any indication, there is little appetite for accountability or transparency inside Brics. On the first day, media access to national delegations was severely restricted. Civil society groups were absent, perhaps deterred by rows of military vehicles equipped with water cannon and hundreds of troops on closed-off streets, carrying assault rifles.Brazil, which has always been a great champion of multilateralism, has papered over cracks inside and outside the conference this week, but it will face a still great chasm at Cop30 in November. Preparatory talksin Bonnlast month almost came unstuck over money because the EU and other wealthy nations refused to make up the missing climate funds left by the abandonment of the US. This issue – and the widening of war zones – looks likely to haunt the gathering in Belém, when the global south may be left wondering whether the new world order is an opportunity or an illusion.Explore more on these topicsBricsView from the AmazonClimate crisisBrazilAidGlobal economycommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a political timebombTim WhiteWe’ve been living in a great experiment: can finance provide basic human rights such as housing? The answer is increasingly noMon 7 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 12.08 EDTShare“The housing crisis is now as big a threat to the EU as Russia,” Jaume Collboni, the mayor of Barcelona, recentlydeclared. “We’re running the risk of having the working and middle classes conclude that their democracies are incapable of solving their biggest problem.”It is not hard to see where Collboni is coming from. From Dublin to Milan, residents routinely find half of their incomes swallowed up by rent, and home ownership is unthinkable for most. Major cities are witnessingspiralling house pricesand some have jaw-dropping year-on-year median rent increases ofmore than 10%. People are being pushed into ever more precarious andcrampedconditions and homelessness israpidly rising.As Collboni asserts, housing lies at the heart of surging political disfranchisement across mainland Europe. The crisis isfuelling the far right– linked, for example, to the support for Alternative für Deutschland in Germany and the recentvictory of the Dutch anti-Islam Freedom party. Housing has become a primaryengine of inequality, reinforcing divisions between the asset-haves and have-nots anddisproportionately affecting minority groups. Far from offering security and safety, for many in Europe housing is now a primary cause of suffering and despair.But not everyone is suffering. At the same time it is robbing normal people of a comfortable and dignified life, the housing crisis is lining the pockets of a small number of individuals and institutions. AcrossEuropein recent decades the same story has unfolded, albeit in very different ways: power has shifted to those who profit from housing, and away from those who live in it.Councils in England face ‘impossible decisions’ to build or repair homesRead moreThe most striking manifestation of this shift is the large-scale ownership and control of homes by financial institutions, particularly since the 2008 global financial crisis. In 2023,$1.7tnof global real estate was managed by institutional investors such as private equity firms, insurance companies, hedge funds, banks and pension funds, up from $385bn in 2008. Spurred by loose monetary policy, these actors consider Europe’s housing a particularly lucrative and secure “asset class”. Purchases of residential property in the euro area by institutional investorstripled over the past decade. As a London-based asset managerputs it: “Real estate investors with exposure to European residential assets are the cats that got the cream,” with housing generating “stronger risk-adjusted returns than any other sector”.The scale of institutional ownership in certain places is staggering. In Ireland, nearlyhalfof all units delivered since2017 were purchased by investment funds. Across Sweden, the share of private rental apartments with institutional investors as landlords has swelled to24%. In Berlin,€40bnof housing assets are now in institutional portfolios,10%of the total housing stock. In the four largest Dutch cities, aquarterof homes for sale in recent years were purchased by investors. Even in Vienna, a city widely heralded for its vast, subsidised housing stock, institutional players are now invested inevery 10thhousing unit and42%of new private rental homes.Not all investors are the same. But when the aim is to make money from housing it can mean only one thing: prices go up. As Leilani Farha, a former UN special rapporteur, points out, investment funds have a “fiduciary duty” to maximise returns to shareholders, which often include the pension funds on which ordinary people rely. They therefore do all they can to increase prices and reduce expenditure, including via “renoviction” (using refurbishment as an excuse to hike rents), under-maintenance and the introduction of punitive fees. When the private equity giant Blackstone acquired and renovated homes across Stockholm, it increased rents on some of the homes by up to 50%, the economic geographer Brett Christophersfound. “Green” retrofits in the name of sustainability are also an increasingly commontactic.The corporate capture of our homes has not sprung out of thin air. Decades of housing market privatisation, liberalisation and speculation have enabled the financial sector to tighten its grip on European households. From the 1980s in places such as Italy, Sweden and Germany, government-owned apartments were transferred en masse to the private market. In Berlin, for example, vast bundles of public housing were sold overnight to large corporations. In one single transaction, Deutsche Wohnen purchased 60,000 flats from the city in 2006 for€450m; just €7,500 per apartment.With the role of welfare states in housing provision dismantled, many countries reached for demand-side interventions such as liberalising mortgage credit. This fuelled widespread speculation, pushed up house prices and encouraged extreme levels of household indebtedness. The resulting financial crisis of 2008 provided fresh opportunities for investors. Countries such as Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland became a treasure trove of “distressed” assets and mortgage debt that could be scooped up at bargain prices. Despite the widespread devastation caused by the crisis, Europe’s dependence on the financial sector for housing solutions only intensified in the years that followed.As power has shifted to investors and speculators, and governments have become ever more reliant on them, so it has been withdrawn from residents. In order to incentivise or “de-risk” private investment, governments across Europe have weakened tenant protections, slashed planning regulations and building standards, and offered special subsidies, grants and tax breaks for entities such as real estate investment trusts. One group in particular has borne the brunt of this: renters. Renters have seen their rents skyrocket, living conditions deteriorate and their security undermined. In Europe, some investment funds have directly driven the displacement of lower-income tenants and overseen disruptive evictions.Powerful financial actors have done a great job at framing themselves as the solution to, rather than the cause of, the prevailing crisis. They have incessantly pushed the now-dominant narrative that more real estate investment is a good thing because it will increase the supply of much-needed homes. Blackstone, for example,claimsto play a “positive role in addressing the chronic undersupply of housing across the continent”. But theevidence suggeststhat greater involvement of financial markets has not increased aggregate home ownership or housing supply, but instead inflated house prices and rents.The thing is, institutional investors aren’t really into producing housing. It is directly against their interests to significantly increase supply. As one asset managerconcedes, housing undersupply is bad for residents but “supportive for cashflows”. Blackstone’s president famouslyadmittedthat “the big warning signs in real estate are capital and cranes”. In other words, they need shortages to keep prices high.Where corporate capital does produce new homes, they will of course be maximally profitable. Cities such as Manchester, Brussels and Warsaw have experienced a proliferation of high-margins housing products such as micro-apartments, build-to-rent and co-living. Designed with the explicit intention ofoptimising cashflows, these are both unaffordable and unsuitable for most households. Common Wealth, a thinktank focusing on ownership,foundthat the private equity-backed build-to-rent sector, which accounts for 30% of new homes in London, caters predominantly to high-earning single people. Families represent just5%of build-to-rent tenants compared with a quarter of the private rental sector more broadly. These overpriced corporate appendages are a stark reminder of the market’s inability to deliver homes that fit the needs and incomes of most people.Something vital is missing from Labour’s housing policy: council houses | Abi O’ConnorRead moreWhile housing lies at the heart of political disillusionment today, it is for the same reason becoming a primary trigger for mobilisation across Europe. In October 2024, 150,000 protestersmarchedthrough the streets of Madrid demanding action. Some governments, includingDenmarkand theNetherlands, are introducing policies to deter speculators. But real estate capital continues to hold the power, so it continues to get its way – including by exploitingloopholes, and lobbying against policies that put profits at risk. In 2021, Berliners voted in favour of expropriating and socialising apartments owned by stock-listed landlords. But underpressure from the real estate lobby, politicians have stalled this motion. That same year Blackstone – Spain’s largest landlord with 40,000 housing units – opposed plans to impose a 30% target for social housing in institutional portfolios. Struggles against the immense structural power of real-estate interests will be hard fought.In recent decades we have been living through an ever-intensifying social experiment. Can housing, a fundamental need for all human beings, be successfully delivered under the machinations of finance capitalism? The evidence now seems overwhelming: no.As investors have come to dominate, so the power of residents has been systematically undermined. We are left with a crisis of inconceivable proportions. While we can, and should, point the finger at corporate greed, we must remember that this is the system working precisely as it is set up to do. When profit is the prevailing force, housing provision invariably fails to align with social need – to generate the types of homes within the price ranges most desperately required. In the coming years, housing will occupy centre stage in European politics. Now is the time for fundamental structural changes that reclaim homes from the jaws of finance, re-empower residents and reinstate housing as a core priority for public provision.Tim White is a research fellow at Queen Mary University of London and the London School of Economics studying housing, cities and inequalityExplore more on these topicsHousingThe housing crisis in EuropeCommunitiesEuropeEuropean UnionPrivate equitycommentShareReuse this content"

A human would just scoop the sugar out againMon 7 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 13.16 EDTShareAt a time of intense, bitter division, it’s heartwarming when something brings us together. No, not “briefly becoming experts in lawn tennis”, or “being too hot” –that stupid Samsung advertwhere the guy “added way too much sugar to my gochujang pasta sauce” and asks his phone for help.If, by the greatest good fortune, you have managed to dodge it, Google Gemini (an AI “assistant”) suggests he makes “tasty cookies” out of his sugary sauce. Instead of throwing his phone out of the window in holy rage, the youth seems inexplicably enthused (“Sweet!”) and follows its frankly inadequate instructions – add butter, mix, bake for 10 minutes – before wandering off with a cookie, apparently happy with this bizarre outcome.It gives me a rage-powered eyelid twitch, so I was relieved to realise everyone off- and online feels the same (“Googled ‘sauce advert stupid’ and then made a Reddit profile just so I could find someone saying this and agree with them,”one commenter wrote). We differ only in what offends us most. Many are furious the “advice” is so unfit for purpose, withcommentssuch as “It’s SO ANNOYING – like what is he having for tea then????????” and “For dinner I’m having plain spaghetti and flourless gochujang cookies”, while anyone who has ever cooked anything is shouting: “Just scoop the sugar out like a normal human!”People have noted other problems: adding butter to a bowl of sauce is not a cookie recipe, for starters. Some protested that pasta sauces typically contain onions and garlic; not ideal cookie flavours. Others pointed out the eggs, flour, cubed butter and vanilla extract handily out on the worktop – why? He’s making pasta sauce! My husband is specifically offended because baking requires precision, and the hapless youth and his phone have no idea what “way too much” is in grams.I’ve always avoided badmouthing AI – it seems like a simple commonsense survival tactic to keep the robots on side at this point. But when it starts disrespecting dinner and baked goods in this cavalier fashion, a line has been crossed.

It’s unlikely to be the last.On Monday, the Trump regime said Harvard Universityhad violated federal civil rights lawover the treatment of Jewish students on campus.On Tuesday, the regimereleased $175min previously frozen federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania, after the school agreed to bar transgender athletes from women’s teams and delete the swimmer Lia Thomas’s records.Let’s be clear: DEI, antisemitism and transgender athletes are not the real reasons for these attacks on higher education. They’re excuses to give the Trump regime power over America’s colleges and universities.Why do Trump and his lackeys want this power?They’re following Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s playbook for creating an “illiberal democracy” – an authoritarian state masquerading as a democracy. The playbook goes like this:First, take over military and intelligence operations by purging career officers and substituting ones personally loyal to you. Check.Next, intimidate legislators by warning that if they don’t bend to your wishes, you’ll run loyalists against them. (Make sure they also worry about what your violent supporters could do to them and their families.) Check.Next, subdue the courts by ignoring or threatening to ignore court rulings you disagree with. Check in process.Then focus on independent sources of information. Sue media that publish critical stories and block their access to news conferences and interviews. Check.Then go after the universities.Crapping on higher education is also good politics, as demonstrated by the congresswoman Elise Stefanik (Harvard 2006) who browbeat the presidents of Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and MIT over their responses to student protests against Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, leading to several of them being fired.It’s good politics, because many of the 60% of adult Americans who lack college degrees are stuck in lousy jobs. Many resent the college-educated, who lord it over them economically and culturally.But behind this cultural populism lies a deeper anti-intellectual, anti-Enlightenment ideology closer to fascism than authoritarianism.JD Vance (Yale Law 2013) has called university professors “the enemy” and suggested using Orbán’s method for ending “leftwing domination” of universities. Vance laid it all out on CBS’sFace the Nationon 19 May 2024:Universities are controlled by leftwing foundations. They’re not controlled by the American taxpayer and yet the American taxpayer is sending hundreds of billions of dollars to these universities every single year.I’m not endorsing every single thing that Viktor Orbán has ever done [but] I do think that he’s made some smart decisions there that we could learn from.His way has to be the model for us: not to eliminate universities, but to give them a choice between survival or taking a much less biased approach to teaching. [The government should be] aggressively reforming institutions … in a way to where they’re much more open to conservative ideas.”Yet what, exactly, constitutes a “conservative idea?” That dictatorship is preferable to democracy? That white Christian nationalism is better than tolerance and openness? That social Darwinism is superior to human decency?The claim that higher education must be more open to such “conservative ideas” is dangerous drivel.So what’s the real, underlying reason for the Trump regime’s attack on education?Not incidentally, that attack extends to grade school. Trump’s education department announced on Tuesday it’swithholding $6.8bn in funding for schools, and Trump has promised todismantle the department.Why? Because the greatest obstacle to dictatorship is an educated populace. Ignorance is the handmaiden of tyranny.That’s why enslavers prohibited enslaved people from learning to read. Fascists burn books. Tyrants close universities.In their quest to destroy democracy, Trump, Vance and their cronies are intent on shutting the American mind.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

But more inclusive mainstream schools can coexist with rights to special provisionMon 7 Jul 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareChildren with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) must be supported through the education system to fulfil their potential as fully as possible. This is the bottom line for thefamiliesof the 1.6 million children with a recognised additional learning need in England, and all those who support them. It needs to be the government’s priority too.There is no question that therising numberof children receiving extra help has placed pressure on schools and councils. There is wide agreement that the current trajectory is not sustainable. But if plans for reform are shaped around the aim of saving money by removing entitlements, rather than meeting the needs of children by improving schools, they should be expected to fail.If ministers did not already know this, theSave Our Children’s Rights campaignlaunched this week ought to help. As it stands, there is no policy of restricting access to the education, health and care plans (EHCPs) that impose a legal duty on councils to provide specified support. But ministers’ criticisms of the adversarial aspects of the current system have led families to conclude that they should prepare for an attempt to remove their enforceable rights. Christine Lenehan, who advises the government, has indicated that thescope of EHCPs could be narrowed, while stressing a commitment to consultation.Tom Rees, who chairs the department for education’s specialist group, bluntly terms it “a bad system”.Mr Rees’s panel has had itsterm extendeduntil April. The education select committee will present the conclusions of its inquiry into the Send crisis in the autumn. Both should be listened to carefully. But the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, and her team also need to show that they are capable of engaging beyond the circle of appointed experts and parliamentarians. Parents can make their views known through constituency MPs. Their voices and perspectives need to be heard in Whitehall too.This is a hugely sensitive policy area. There is nothing parents care more about than the opportunities provided to their children, and this concern is intensified when those children have additional needs. Some positive steps have been taken during Labour’s first year.Increased capital spending on school buildingsshould make a difference to in-house provision, which relies on the availability of suitable spaces. Ministers are right, too, to focus on teacher training, whileinclusionhas been given greater prominence in the inspection framework. As with the NHS, there is a welcome emphasis on spreading best practice.But big questions remain. Families are fearful that accountability mechanisms are going to be removed, and want to know how the new “inclusive mainstream” will be defined and judged. Councils are concerned about what happens to their£5bn in special needs budget deficits, when the so-called statutory override expires in 2028. The concerningrole of private equity in special education– which mirrors changes in the children’s social care market – also needs addressing.Schools need to adapt so that a greater range of pupils can be accommodated. The issue is how the government manages that process. The hope must be that the lesson ministers take from theirfailure on welfareis that consultation on highly sensitive changes, affecting millions of lives, must be thorough. In order to make change, they must build consensus.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

At a time of acute geopolitical instability, fuelled in part by the return ofDonald Trumpto the White House, it is overwhelmingly in the interests of both countries, and Europe as a whole, that a fully functioning entente cordiale is restored.The arrival of Mr Macron in London on Tuesday for astate visit– the first by a French president since 2008 – confirms the successful work done to that end by Sir Keir Starmer over the past year. In relation to strengthening European defence and security, and supporting Ukraine’s ability to continue to resist Vladimir Putin, the two leaders haveforgeda close working relationship, which this trip will help consolidate. The symbolism of the event – Mr Macron is the first European leader to be so honoured since Brexit – will also do no harm to Sir Keir’s chances of making progress with his somewhat ill-defined aspirations for a “reset” with the EU.Much of the president’s time, naturally, will be taken up with pomp, circumstance and protocol, including a state dinner at Windsor Castle and a joint address to both Houses of Parliament. A warm welcome can be expected for Mr Macron and his wife, Brigitte, from King Charles, a devoutFrancophile. But it also seems likely that some meaningful political business will be done.On Thursday, Sir Keir and Mr Macron will co-host a video conference with European allies to again discuss the creation of a “reassurance force”, which could be deployed to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. More immediately relevant perhaps, given the stalled status of peace negotiations with Mr Putin, will be a simultaneous focus on how to maintain Ukraine’s fighting capabilities without relying on a reluctant Mr Trump. On the ever-more vexed issue of small boat crossings in the Channel, a potential pilot scheme to return irregular migrants to France in exchange for others with family connections in Britain may be unveiled.Anti-immigrant sentiment has been, for both leaders, a contributory factor to domestic politicalwoesand falling poll ratings. But on the world stage Sir Keir and Mr Macron have responded impressively, and largely in tandem, to the challenges of a new era in which great power rivalry and strongman politics threaten to undermine liberal values and international law. It will not have been lost on Mr Trump, who will make a second state visit to Britain in the autumn, that Mr Macron has stolen a march on him this time. For a number of reasons, from the need to heal the diplomatic wounds of Brexit to sending a signal of European solidarity and resilience in turbulent times, that is as it should be.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He knew, there and then, that hisWimbledonwas over and after a brief medical timeout, off the court, he returned in tears, before shaking Sinner’s hand.Cameron Norrie vows to stay vocal as Carlos Alcaraz awaits at WimbledonRead moreThe Italian goes through to a ­quarter-final against Ben Shelton, the big-serving American who advanced to the last eight at ­Wimbledon for the first time with an entertaining four‑set win against Lorenzo ­Sonego of Italy. It was not, of course, the way Sinner wanted to go through, but he lives on and maybe now he will believe the tennis gods are on his side.“I don’t take this as a win at all, this is just an unfortunate moment for us to witness,” the world No 1 said. “He has struggled in grand slams with injuries a lot so seeing him again with this injury is very tough. We all saw by his reaction how much he cares about the sport and he is one of the hardest working players on tour. This is not the end we wanted to see and it’s very sad. If there was a chance for him to be in the next round he would deserve it. I hope he has a speedy recovery.”It was brutal on Dimitrov, who had hit 36 winners, controlling the match in every way, but the incident means he has now pulled out through injury in each of the past five grand slam tournaments.View image in fullscreenGrigor Dimitrov acknowledges the Centre Court crowd at the conclusion of his match with Jannik Sinner.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was Sinner who seemed to be struggling physically early in the match, rubbing his right elbow at times and later, early in the second set, taking a timeout of his own. After the walkover, the Italian said he would be checking the elbow, ­probably with an MRI scan, to see if it was anything serious after slipping early on and banging it in the first game. “I felt it quite a lot, especially [on my] serve and forehand,” he said. “So let’s see. Tomorrow we are going to check to see how it is.”The 34-year-old Dimitrov was playing the tennis of his life before his injury, dominating Sinner with brilliant serving – he lost just eight points on first serve – and beautiful slices that took the Italian out of his comfort zone.Dimitrov had been to the ­quarter‑finals only once before, in 2014, the yearhe beat Andy ­Murrayon the way to the last four. But for two and a bit sets, he was right at his very best. Some of his volleys were Roger Federer-like and even the great man, watching in the royal box, approved. Dimitrov has always had an abundance of talent, more options than most players, so many choices at his hand, and Sinner was forced into a series of uncharacteristic errors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another early break put him in charge in the second but ­Sinner looked to have turned it around when he broke back for 5-5. Dimitrov broke again to move ahead and served out to double his lead.The roof was closed at the end of the second set, something Sinner would have been happy with, taking away the wind that had made life difficult. At 2-2, the drama happened. Dimitrov began the game serving and volleying, as he had done many times before, and hit his 14th ace, only to fall to the court immediately, ­clutching his right pectoral muscle. The pain was clear for everyone to see. Sinner came straight to his aid but it was obvious, even then, that nothing could be done. When he returned, Dimitrov was in tears and had to be helped from the court.Shelton will present a big ­challenge too after coming through another hugely entertaining clash with ­Sonego. The pair produced magic, as they always do and, as has ­usually been the case, it was Shelton who came out on top to reach the quarter-finals here for the first time.The left-handed Shelton, who has made the semi-finals of the US Open and Australian Open, served rockets, carved angles and slashed winners all over the place as he claimed a 3-6, 6-1, 7-6 (1), 7-5 victory. It is 25 years since an American man – Pete Sampras – last won the title here, and the way Shelton plays makes him a threat.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Jannik SinnerWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

There is natural ability in abundance. She is also an example of what technically gifted women’s players can be when given elite-level coaching from a young age. She is an example of what is to come, an outlier among her peers, having benefited from her father, Nigel, being a Uefa-qualified coach with his own coaching programme that is, in his own words, “about pure ball mastery and delivery with panache, to ultimately create elite technicians of the game”.James is effusive about her father’s input into her career, saying on the Nigel James Elite Coaching website that she is “grateful to my dad for all the time, effort and love that he has put into my football by coaching me in order to help me reach the very best level and fulfil my full potential”.‘We thrive under pressure’: Hemp defiant despite England’s losing startRead moreWhether in training or in a match, James stands out. In England’s open training session before their Euro 2025 send-off game against Jamaica on 29 June, the Chelsea forward was electric, despite not having played for three months because of a hamstring injury, gliding and shifting with the ball at her feet like she had never been away.Against Jamaica, it took only eight minutes after James’s introduction as a substitute for her to make an impression, providing a pinpoint cross for Alessia Russo to nod in.Sarina Wiegman’s decision to start James against France inEngland’s tournament openeron Saturday was not a surprise. Indeed, many would consider it a risk worth taking because, ultimately, even a semi-fit James is a better creative outlet than many of the squad’s fully fit players. Constructing the team in a way that draws the best out of her is a logical course of action.England desperately need James’s creative edge, her unpredictability, the fear she is able to strike into opposition players as she runs at them, her weight shifting, her movements fluid, opponents left fumbling and stumbling in her wake. Against France that dynamism and threat was evident from the off, James firing over 39 seconds into the contest, leaving France breathing a sigh of relief.However, England have a problem regarding where to play James. The Lionesses’ midfield was overrun against France, Georgia Stanway and Keira Walsh struggling with the physicality and pressing game of their opponents, with Sakina Karchaoui particularly influential for Laurent Bonadei’s side. And with James in the No 10 role instead of Ella Toone or Grace Clinton, there was clear disruption to the Lionesses’ unit in the middle of the pitch.View image in fullscreenSandy Baltimore scores France’s second goal, putting the game beyond England.Photograph: Harry Langer/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockA structured midfield is what England are used to operating with under Wiegman. James, on the other hand, is most effective when given a free role and allowed to run at defences from central or wide positions. She is less of a traditional attacking player than Beth Mead, Lauren Hemp or Chloe Kelly. As such, England are trying to fit a square peg into a round hole and it is not quite working.How should England move forward after the defeat against France, beginning with the game against the Netherlands here in Zurich on Wednesday?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But how to get the best out of her in the present is undeniably a tricky and pressing question. Does she start or is she a super sub? It is an unenviable dilemma for all concerned, Wiegman in particular, to wrestle with and quickly solve.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Shall we generously call that half a point out of three? Certainly you would struggle to mark Arsenal too highly on courage or intrinsic goodliness right now. But the unhappycase of Thomas Parteyillustrates the lengths to which they are willing to go to champion one of their own.You knew. I knew. Rival fans knew, even if their taunting of Partey was always delivered with the sort of gleeful relish that does not exactly scream concern for the alleged victims of sexual violence. And so of course did the staff and board of Arsenal; knew the man with whom they shared a workplace and a dressing room until last week, knew what he was accused of doing.Thomas Partey, former Arsenal footballer, charged with rape and sexual assaultRead moreCare, compassion and discretion are of course utterly vital at this point. The charging of Partey on 4 July means the accusations against him will finally be heard in court in early August: five counts of rape, and one of sexual assault, involving three separate women between 2021 and 2022. Partey’s lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire of Hickman and Rose, referred in a statement to her client now “welcoming the opportunity to finally clear his name”.And it is the word “finally” that stands out here: an acknowledgment of the protracted and often painful three-year process that has brought us to this point, during which Partey was the word English football dared not speak.Wiltshire, of course, is deeply familiar with such matters. She was also employed by the Manchester City player Benjamin Mendy,who was cleared in 2023of seven charges of rape, one of attempted rape and one of sexual assault. “She has often achieved positive results for her clients long before the charge stage,” reads her corporate bio. “This has caused her to be much in demand by high‑profile clients seeking a swift and discreet resolution to what, if made public, would be highly damaging allegations.”All of which is an acknowledgment that there is always a wider consideration to such cases: establishing a verdict and getting to the truth, but also managing the optics and reputations. Partey denies all the charges against him. There is no sense in prejudging the outcome of his case before all the facts come to light. The presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are important legal principles in this country.But the presumption of shining personal virtue is not, and many of Arsenal’s actions over the past three years give the impression of an organisation not simply content to employ Partey, but positively proud of doing so. Who seriously considered – at the urging of coach Mikel Arteta – offering a new contractand extending his stayat the Emirates Stadium beyond last Monday. Who regarded their talented central midfielder not as an alleged rapist but as a man to be lauded and celebrated, perhaps even a kind of victim himself.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta continually emphasised the importance of Thomas Partey and wanted to extend the midfielder’s contract.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APThree months after being arrested for the first time, and about a year after Arsenal were first made aware of a rape allegation against him, Partey scored a thumping goal against Tottenham in the north London derby. Afterwards, Arteta said: “For what he’s been through, and the injuries, and the effort that he put in this week, to be available for the team, I’m so happy for him. He deserves it.”Over the subsequent years Partey would play more than 100 times for Arsenal. His goals would earn them four points in the Premier League; his defensive work probably earned them many more. His collision with Rodri in which the Spaniard injured knee ligaments may well have had a decisive influence on the 2024‑25 title. Meanwhile Arteta would continually lionise Partey’s importance to Arsenal on the pitch, and towards the end of last season reiterated that he wanted Partey to stay.Obviously it would have been legally complex for Arsenal to terminate Partey’s contract before criminal charges had been laid. But of course there are steps that it is perfectly reasonable for a club to take against a player that do not require an absolute burden of criminal proof. Richly talented footballers such as Mesut Özil and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang were quietly moved towards the exit for perceived off-field failings. Last year a kit manager called Mark Bonnickwas sacked for social media postshe wrote about Israel.View image in fullscreenPierre-Emerick Aubameyang was moved towards the exit door by Arsenal for perceived off-field failings.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAnd there were plenty of legally unproblematic options available to Arsenal here that might have offered a certain comfort to the fans now feeling a sense of betrayal at the actions of the club they love. You do not, for example, have to praise him on social media. You do not have to pay tribute to his character or resilience after “what he’s been through”. You do not have to play him 108 times or spend much of June deliberating over whether he is worth a new contract.Who at the club made these calls and why? Who knew what, when? Who spoke out and who did not? And in supporting him so unconditionally, was it in fact Arsenal who are guilty of prejudging Partey’s case long before a jury would ever get the chance? Arsenal fans deserve answers, but it appears none are forthcoming for now. “Due to ongoing legal proceedings the club is unable to comment on the case,” they said in a statement.And perhaps in terms of the PR, this is Arsenal’s best strategy right now: say nothing, do nothing, and hope the whole storm passes. There is a new figurehead at the base of midfield, and quite apart from being a better and younger player Martín Zubimendi offers the sensation of renewal, of turning the page, perhaps even a kind of purgation. The women are champions of Europe and will play all their home league games at the Emirates next season. There are always happier, simpler stories to tell, and Arsenal will never get tired of telling those.Naturally we should be wary of singling out Arsenal here. There is, or should be, no room for tribal triumphalism. Many other clubs would have acted similarly in similar circumstances. In a sense Arsenal’s business-as-usual stance over the past three years is simply one of the defining characteristics of end-stage capitalism, one in which big companies ruthlessly pursue the bottom line while trumpeting their virtue.We are courageous in the pursuit of progress. We champion our community and each other. We do the right thing (even when no one is looking). This is the moral creed of Arsenal. Their fans are still waiting for them to deliver on it.Explore more on these topicsArsenalcommentShareReuse this content"

All signspoint to Jofra Archer’s return. A risk? Undoubtedly. After four years of injury struggles and a slow burn of a comeback in the white-ball formats, a mere 18 overs of priming in county cricket feels instinctively skinny.South Africa’s Mulder declares on 367 and says ‘legend’ Lara should keep Test recordRead moreBut it is a risk England can scarcely afford not to take given the swingin momentum that has occurredthis past week. Much like the Steve Smith conundrum during Archer’s debut series six years ago, Shubman Gill’s Bradman-esque start to this series demands a fresh line of attack. Oh, and Jasprit Bumrah is about to augment an India bowling unit that outshone the hosts, not least when the Dukes ball was new.Who makes way is the question. Provided the medical staff can sufficiently patch him up in time, Chris Woakes should stay put. Had a couple of umpire’s calls gone his way on the first morning, he could have easily walked off at stumps, setting the match on a different course. His record at Lord’s is impressive, too, with 32 wickets at 13.92 runs apiece and an unbeaten 137 against India in 2018.At 36 years old, and with the successes of last winter only mildly offsetting a poor record overseas, Woakes is clearly not a long-term investment. But there is a major series on the line at 1-1 and his understudy, Sam Cook, would lengthen the tail.This leaves England with a likely choice between omitting Brydon Carse, spiteful but still battling toe issues, or Josh Tongue, a fast swing bowler too often used as a siege weapon. England will be tempted by a return for Gus Atkinson that leads to both dropping out but, despite his excellence at Lord’s last summer, he has not played since May.Beyond the various possible bowling combinations, though, there is a legitimate question to be asked as to whether that traditional response to defeat should be flipped and the batting is refreshed instead. And it is here where England’s thoughts should turn to another son of Barbados in Jacob Bethell: a 21-year-old batter without a professional century, granted, but a talent about whom there appears very little doubt.View image in fullscreenEngland’s thoughts should turn to the talented batter Jacob Bethell.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesBethell’s retention felt a given following the win in New Zealand late last year with Brendon McCullum, the head coach,hinting heavily at this after an impressive start to his Test career. It was not just the left‑hander’s three half‑centuries, including a near-miss 96 in Wellington, but rather the ice running through his veins; a simple yet secure backfoot technique that looked made for the top level.So what changed? Before his debut in Christchurch, Bethell had been picked up in the Indian Premier League auction and with the tournament’s primacy apparently enshrined by all cricket boards – a different debate – England promised to make their players available for the duration. It meant Bethell had to miss the Zimbabwe Test – those who say he chose to do so are mistaken – with Ollie Pope restored to the No 3 position.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But instead he forced what appeared a rethink with 171 in that low-key match (even if Ben Stokes tried to frame it otherwise afterwards). And having done so, England’s vice-captain then backed it up with a pretty sublime 106 at Headingley, walking out at four for one and playing with such impressive clarity amid something of an onslaught from the mighty Bumrah.It felt like a corner turned. But rather than triggering a purple patch, Pope has since only furthered concerns about his ability to be a steadying presence in a big series. After his overnight 100 was cut short the next day in Leeds– itself a mis-step in what is a series for hungry hippos – scores of eight, nought and 24 have followed. Akash Deep exploited a crooked, tense defence on Sunday following a frantic time of it the evening before.The alternative is Bethell in for Zak Crawley and after Edgbaston the opener could hardly feel aggrieved. Two footwork-devoid scores of 19 and nought, plus a clanger of a drop off Rishabh Pant, was the latest downturn in a wildly lurching career. Thing is, that little-and-large partnership with Ben Duckett is a functioning part of the side overall. Since coming together in 2022, no active opening pair has passed 50 more consistently.However, there is little to suggest that England are mulling a change in the top three. As shown by Gill being player of the match at Edgbaston, when Deep’s 10-wicket haul was arguably the true difference between victory and a draw, it remains a batter’s game.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025Jofra ArcherEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

I almost lost my shoe and there was nothing I could do.”With the Tour’s top sprinter out of the race, there was little else to write home about. Certainly none of the 38-man French contingent in this year’s peloton were showing much spirit as the afternoon wore on, and the absence of any breakaway only emphasised the soporific nature of the racing.So uneventful was the stage that there was no “prix de combativité” awarded, for the most attacking rider. Meanwhile, the defending champion, Tadej Pogacar, was happy to see one of his key lieutenants Tim Wellens slide off the front of the peloton on the approach to the stage’s sole climb, the fourth category Mont Cassel.Wellens’ brief sortie ensured that the lead in the climber’s classification stayed within the UAE Emirates XRG team, with Pogacar himself seeming to enjoy the novelty of wearing polka dots, instead of yellow, for a day. “I’ve only worn it once in six editions of the Tour,” the Slovenian said of the distinctive climber’s jersey.But while Pogacar seems carefree, the dynamic at Jonas ­Vingegaard’s Visma Lease-a-bike team is ­growing complicated after the double Tour winner’s wife, Trine Hansen Vingegaard Hansen, expressed fears that her husband is close to burnout. Trine Vingegaard Hansen, her husband’s personal manager, who is following the race with the couple’s two young children, said: “I’m afraid he’s burning the candle at both ends. I think people sometimes forget the human being behind the athlete.”View image in fullscreenThe peloton cycles under decorative streamers hung above the race route in Aire-sur-la-Lys.Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty ImagesVingegaard’s team management was quick to counter. “The ­sacrifice is necessary – Jonas knows that more than anybody else,” the sports ­director, Grischa Niermann, said. “With the Tour preparation, he was away from home a lot, but that’s also why he’s in this shape now.“We have very good cohesion with Jonas, but also his family – by ­preparing him, how we prepared him, he is in the shape that he is now.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When he’s at the start of a race, there’s no doubt about who the leader is.”Asked about his wife’s comments, Vingegaard, who was present when the interview took place in the Alpine ski station of Tignes, prior to the Tour, said: “I haven’t ­actually read the article, I’ve just heard something about it, so I’m not 100% sure what it says.“Of course, it’s a lot of training camps and altitude camps during the year, so of course it’s hard on family life,” he said. “But I’m still riding and I haven’t felt burnout yet.”Tuesday’s fourth stage takes the ­convoy towards the Somme for a stage from Amiens, with three climbs in the final 21km, to Rouen.Meanwhile, in Italy, Anna Henderson, of Lidl-Trek, silver medallist for Team GB in the Paris Olympics, took her first World Tour stage win and the race leader’s pink jersey, in the women’s Giro d’Italia.

Each time the surfers fell and were swept downstream, they would swim back upstream, to try their luck again, adjacent to the tournament fan zone.The scene proved rather reminiscent of Belgium trying to resist wave after wave of Spanish attacks in the second half, but it felt as though every time Belgium clawed themselves back into the match, a fresh torrent of Spanish brilliance swept them away again.Alexia Putellas began the relentless scoring when she rounded off a neat team move, after superb play from Vicky López, to clinically tuck the ball home.Justine Vanhaevermaet briefly stunned the pre-tournament favourites as she headed in from a corner, but Spain were soon back in front when Irene Paredes headed in to make it 2-1, towards the end of a first half where Olga Carmona had also driven a powerful strike narrowly wide.View image in fullscreenClaudia Pina scores Spain’s stunning fifth goal.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/ReutersThe crowd were momentarily sensing a monumental shock might be on the cards, when Hannah Eurlings sprinted in behind Spain’s defence and slotted in, but almost immediately after the restart, Esther González met Putellas’s outstanding pass to restore Spain’s lead and make it 3-2.By this point, the Ballon d’Or winner Aitana Bonmatí, still returning carefully to full fitness after contracting viral meningitis before the tournament, had been brought on as a half-time substitute and she was showing her usual creativity and style in midfield.Her head coach, Montse Tomé, said: “Aitana could play but I think we must be patient. According to the medical team, she is fine, but we don’t want to risk her. As we have other players who allow us to keep the level. I believe Aitana will be 100%.”Spain were mounting pressure and shortly after the hour Mariona Caldentey tucked in from close range, before a marvellous strike from Clàudia Pina in the 81st minute, curled into the far corner from distance, made it 5-2 with a goal that will undoubtedly be included in the goal‑of-the-tournament shortlist.Putellas said of Pina’s strike: “Her goal was special, as always. Honestly, she’s so good, it was a perfect goal, it was impossible to stop it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She thinks collectively. She understands the spaces, she flows, and you see she enjoys it. I’m glad for her and also for the rest of the team.”Gunnarsdóttir, appeared crestfallen by her team’s fate but was also proud of their endeavour in attack. Trying to see the bigger picture, the Icelandic coach said: “When I was hired to coach the team, it was about more than leading the team to the Euros – it was about building a team that can compete regularly against the top teams in Europe.“I’ve only been here for five months. I’ve learned so much. I know I have a lot more to learn [but I] really feel we’re going in the right direction. I would never have taken this job if I didn’t believe the Red Flames could be a top nation in Europe.“I walked into the locker room today and I really wanted to cry.

In a breathtaking conclusion to the match, Cristiana Girelli thought she had sent Italy through to the quarter-finals. Francisco Neto’s side piled on the pressure in the final stages, however, and equalised in the 89th minute to ensure their dreams of progress remained alive.“We were solid, we were brave,” said a delighted Neto. “We played high, pressed our opponents, and played like a team in the European Championship. We’re a team with personality and ambition. It’s not easy when you’re losing, then you score but it’s disallowed again, and then score again! I’m very proud.”Putellas at the double as rampant Spain hit rain-soaked Belgium for six at Euro 2025Read more“The last words I told my players was to play, to have fun,” he continued. “Playing in a European Championship is a privilege. They’re friends, they want to do things for each other. As a team, they really rise to the challenge.”There had been contrasting fortunes on the opening day for both. While Italy earned a hard-fought victory over Belgium, Portugal had suffered a morale-sapping defeat against Spain. This was not quite last chance saloon for Neto’s side but almost, knowing they must avoid defeat to avoid elimination.It was most likely for this reason that the Portuguese manager rang the changes. Prior to this match, they had conceded 25 in the last five – a defensive record that will never bring success at this level. Goalkeeper Patrícia Morais came in for Inês Pereira to gain her 99th cap while Ana Borges and Joana Marchão brought considerable experience into defence. They were given a significant boost with the return of Kika Nazareth for the first time since suffering an ankle injury in March. The 22-year-old playmaker was making her long-awaited return against the side she made her senior international debut against just five years previous.Italy, meanwhile, had impressed against Belgium and manager Soncin stuck with the same team that had served them so well. Girelli had the armband once again, making her 121st appearance for her country.Portugal’s Borges and Andreia Jacinto had emphasised pre-match the need for a fast start. They were compact throughout the first half, repelling Italy’s advances and even dominated the ball without creating anything of real note. When they did break, Soncin’s well-drilled team dropped quickly to defend the space in behind and counter the speed of the likes of Diana Silva.View image in fullscreenCristiana Girelli prepares to curl the ball around Diana Gomes and put Italy 1-0 up.Photograph: Pier Marco Tacca/FIGC/Getty ImagesLe Azzurre, in contrast created the best opportunities. Girelli was at the heart of the action and forced a world-class stop from Morais before turning a Manuela Giugliano cross wide.Portugal rode their luck at times. Cecilia Salvai came so close to making her mark after missing the last three major tournaments with injury but saw her header agonisingly crash off the bar. Emma Severini had a goal ruled out for offside before the Portugal goalkeeper was on hand once again to keep her team in the contest. When Girelli met Sofia Cantore’s low cross, the ball looked destined for the back of the net but Morais instinctively stuck out a foot. She turned fist-pumping to the fans behind the goal, celebrating as if she had scored.The second half was a quiet affair until the game burst into life with 20 minutes left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Diana Silva thought she had levelled when she turned a rebound effort home only for a lengthy VAR check to rule it out for offside.Not to be deterred, Portugal continued to push forward and finally got their rewards thanks to a sweetly guided finish from Diana Gomes with a minute left on the clock. Jubilant celebrations followed as Neto’s side breathed fresh life into their campaign.There was still time for Ana Borges to receive a second yellow but it mattered little as Portugal go into their final game against Belgium knowing they have the chance to reach the knockouts.

I had a message from somebody that I knew and it was like: ‘It’s just like a bad night out that you want to forget as much as possible. Move on to the next one.’ So yeah, that’s exactly what we’re going to do.”England will be out of the tournament if they lose against the Netherlands in Zurich on Wednesday and France are not beaten by Wales. The pressure is on the holders but Lucy Bronze, who is competing at her seventh major tournament, helped to put things in perspective, recounting to her teammates how England lost their opening game of the World Cup in 2015, against France, before going on to reach the semi-finals.Stanway said: “It was a together moment. It was 2-1 [and] we could have got a draw. We just need to perform and we want the fans to stay with us, they know that we’re capable. True fans stick with us to the end.”Georgia StanwayStanway was disappointed with her own performance against France, with England’s midfield overrun and outmuscled. “For some reason, I couldn’t do the things that I wanted to be able to do in possession,” the Bayern Munich midfielder said.“That’s why I just knew that I had to run around and I had to put some tackles in, that was my way of showing if I can’t do something on the ball then I’ll work my socks off to make sure that I can do it off the ball.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There was also a bright cameo from João Pedro, who came on for Liam Delap just after Estêvão’s equaliser early in the second half and proceeded to change the game with his brawn and intelligent link-up play.It was an eye-catching performance from the forward given that his£60m move to Chelseahad been announced two days earlier. What had the 23‑year‑old been doing during his time off? Lifting logs and existing on a diet of raw steak, presumably. The aggression from João Pedro was startling. He was raring to go after a couple of training sessions with his new teammates and, while he was not involved in the winning goal, his bustling forward play was a vital part of Chelsea reasserting their dominance after Palmeiras pulled the score back to 1-1.“Even if he was on holiday, he looks sharp, he looks good,” Enzo Maresca said. João Pedro, who was wanted by Newcastle beforeChelseacame in for him, did not slack off while waiting for Brighton to sell him. He stayed in shape after going to Rio de Janeiro on holiday.Fifa cuts ticket price to $13.40 for Club World Cup semi-final between Chelsea and FluminenseRead more“I was in Brazil with my friends but I have a personal trainer and I trained, so I was ready,” João Pedro said on Monday. “Imagine if I didn’t train and Chelsea called me to come – then it would be more difficult for me. I made my debut and I think I showed I am ready. In Brazil the Club World Cup is very important because normally the teams there don’t play teams from Europe. I will always take this tournament seriously.”Such dedication from João Pedro meant Nicolas Jackson was shoved to the margins against Palmeiras. It is possible to read too much into one substitution. Equally it is possible that Maresca’s decision to introduce the newcomer instead of Jackson offered clues about the new hierarchy in Chelsea’s attack. There was already a new contender for a starting role up front afterthe arrival of Delapfrom Ipswich for £30m. The 22-year-old has been sharp in the US. He has started the past four games, scoring once, and seems to have moved above Jackson in the pecking order.With Delap serving a one-game ban after picking up his second booking of the tournament against Palmeiras it is not clear who starts in Tuesday’s semi-final against Fluminense. The pressure on Jackson is rising. Suspended for two games after a recklessred card against Flamengoduring the group stage, the Senegal striker watched Delap impress in his absence. More worrying for Jackson, though, is that he was back in the squad against Palmeiras and overlooked when Maresca took Delap off.Jackson has a lot to prove given that he was alsosent off for elbowing Newcastle’s Sven Botmanat the end of last season and will still be out when the Premier League campaign starts. The 24-year-old is a handful but immaturity blights his game. A sale cannot be ruled out if Chelsea receive a good offer. They need to generate funds after being fined by Uefafor breaching financial rules.It makes João Pedro’s instant involvement feel significant. He was signed for his versatility and is a team player. His goal return at Brighton was no more than acceptable – 30 in 70 games – but he was respected for his pressing and link-up play.View image in fullscreenJoão Pedro speaks to journalists in the runup to Chelsea’s Club World Cup semi-final against Fluminense, where the forward started his career.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/FIFA/Getty ImagesIt goes back to João Pedro’s spell as a youth player at Fluminense, who switched him from defensive to attacking midfield. Watford brought him to England in 2019 and sold him to Brighton three years later. He will be eager to face his former club. Fluminense have the oldest team at the Club World Cup. Fábio, their goalkeeper, is 44. Thiago Silva, the former Chelsea centre-back, is 40.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSilva spoke fondly of Chelsea here. The veteran may look to exploit his old side’s youth, though. Perhaps Silva will try to get a rise out of Jackson or João Pedro. It is worth noting that Jackson is not the only Chelsea striker with a history of disciplinary issues. Delap puts himself about and picked up 13 yellow cards in all competitions last season. As for João Pedro, he saw redfor violent conduct against Brentfordin April and could have been sent off against the same opponents after anattempted elbow on Yehor Yarmolyuklast December.Competitive edge? Maybe, but there was also an altercation with the Brighton centre-back Jan Paul van Hecke in training, which led to João Pedro missing the final game of last season. “The people who know me know my character,” João Pedro said. “But when two players want to win, these things happen.”Maresca needs that aggression to be channelled in the right way. Having three talented young forwards could be seen as a form of insurance policy if they keep getting suspended on rotation but the reality is that Delap, Jackson and João Pedro will not be helping themselves or Chelsea if they keep falling foul of referees.It is Delap’s turn to sit this one out and watch someone take his place. João Pedro and Jackson will be desperate to put themselves forward before the final on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 63-year-old has confirmed he will stand for a second term and is poised to face off against Tim Mayer after the American announced his candidacy in the buildup to Sunday’s British Grand Prix.Tim Mayer accuses FIA president Ben Sulayem of ‘reign of terror’ after announcing candidacyRead moreA number of high-profile figures have left the FIA under Ben Sulayem’s stewardship. His deputy, Robert Reid, the former rally co-driver, resigned from his post earlier this year. Ben Sulayem has also had multiple run-ins with Formula One and the sport’s biggest stars, notably Lewis Hamilton overthe wearing of jewelleryin the cockpit, and Max Verstappenon swearing.Launching his bid to run against Ben Sulayem, Mayer, who was sacked as chair of the FIA stewards in November, took aim at the Emirati’s controversial leadership, describing it as “a failure” and an “illusion of integrity”. He also accused Ben Sulayem of marginalising women and rushing through statute amendments to enhance his power.In response, Ben Sulayem said: “I feel for people [who] say this. They are disconnected from the FIA. He [Mayer] has worked as a steward. A steward doesn’t mean you’re an insider of the FIA. You’re not staff. I have other things to do. I am really busy. I am not going to fall into this way of campaigning where I answer someone. He is free to say whatever he wants.“But the FIA is bigger than me, bigger than anyone. It’s not about the media. One thing is very clear. It is the members who vote. It’s not anyone who is here to have a vote. It’s them. If they decide they want me, or they want X, Y, Z, it’s up to them. And I know that whatever I’ve been doing is good for the members. I’ve been very straight with them.“Let’s wait for the general assembly and let’s see if they will get me out, then. They have the power to get me out. It’s about the members. And when I see them smiling. Maybe, I don’t know, maybe they’re smiling, truly or not, but it’s their decision.”Ben Sulayem initially clashed with F1 and the grid’s 10 teams over the introduction of an 11th outfit. However, Cadillac – a division of American motoring giant General Motors and supported by TWG Motorsport – will be on the grid next season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If there is another team from China, they will approve it 100% because it is good for business. Wouldn’t it make more money with China coming in? I believe, yes.

Some people would take issue with the more sterile landscape on court and the lack of human touch, while the cull of around 300 linesmen and women would also surely be a sore point. It is difficult, however, to imagine they were prepared for the firestorm that has followed its long-awaited implementation at this tournament.Wimbledon line-call failure came after operator turned cameras off by mistakeRead moreElectronic line-calling, or ELC, which uses automated ball-tracking technology has, after all, long been used in professional tennis tournaments, starting with the Next Gen ATP Finals in 2018. It has been four years since the Australian Open became the first grand slam to utilise the technology and this year, for the first time, the men’s tour, the ATP, is using ELC at all of its events. Although all other men’s clay-court events use ELC, the French Open is now the only grand slam that still employs human line judges.Instead of this year offering Wimbledon to step into the future, however, the All England LawnTennisClub (AELTC) has spent the first eight days of the tournament defending its implementation of the technology, which is enhanced by artificial intelligence.For the first five days of the tournament the most significant blows were the parting shots from Jack Draper and Emma Raducanu, the men’s and women’s British No 1 players, whoeach criticised the ELC systemfollowing their defeats. Both players believed they had been subjected to incorrect calls. “It’s kind of disappointing, the tournament here, that the calls can be so wrong, but for the most part they’ve been OK. It’s just, like, I’ve had a few in my other matches, too, that have been very wrong,” Raducanu said.View image in fullscreenJack Draper complains to the umpire after an electronic line call during his loss to Marin Cilic.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe AELTC maintained that the system was working optimally and that ELC remains considerably more accurate than the line judges it replaced. Wimbledon employs Hawk-Eye, one of numerous ELC providerswhich uses a system that incorporates 10 cameras placed around the court, and which track the bounce of the ball. Hawk-Eye states that its margin of error is 2.2mm. Wimbledon had previously used ELC only as a safety net, allowing players to challenge calls conducted by line judges.“It’s funny, because when we did have linesmen, we were constantly asked why we didn’t have electronic line-calling because it’s more accurate,” Debbie Jevans, the chair of the AELTC, told the BBC.Then came a disastrous series of events on Centre Court.As Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova held game pointon her serve at 4-4 in the first set against Sonay Kartal on Sunday, a backhand from Kartal clearly flew long but it was not called out. After a lengthy delay, it emerged that some of the ELC cameras had not been functional on Pavlyuchenkova’s side of the court for some time during the game. The umpire Nico Helwerth opted to replay the point. Around 10 minutes later, after losing that service game, Pavyluchenkova faced a set point on Kartal’s serve.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pavlyuchenkova, who told Helwerth the tournament had “stolen” the game from her, recovered to win both the set and the match, limiting the significance of the error. The AELTC announced in a statement on Sunday night that the ELC had been accidentally deactivated on Pavlyuchenkova’s side of the court by one of the operators running the system.Bright on Monday morning, the Wimbledon chief executive, Sally Bolton, fielded a contentious scheduled meeting with the media, which was almost entirely centred around ELC. Bolton asserted repeatedly that the mistake was purely down to human error, that the protocols had been changed to prevent a similar issue and that ELC has otherwise been working accurately during the tournament. At the very least, the situation with Pavlyuchenkova also underlined the importance of having contingency plans for when technology fails, including the possibility of umpires using video replay.Since the implementation of ELC, player reaction has largely been positive as it was rolled out on hard courts, with players recognising the greater accuracy provided by the system compared to human errors. However, after numerous dramatic moments during the clay-court season, as some players were frustrated with the differences between the ball marks and the ELC’s judgments, the first week of ELC at Wimbledon has been a difficult one. It is clear that faith in its implementation on the surface has diminished and both privately and publicly, players and coaches have expressed scepticism about its accuracy. As the tournament moves into the latter stages, it remains to be seen if that faith will be restored.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisanalysisShareReuse this content"

The favourite missed the frame in three of the six races that comprise the bet, there were just 18.15 winning units in the pool and the dividend to a £1 stake was an eye-watering £26,420.10.This was a brilliant advertisement for a bet that can be won without finding any of the six winners. But following a recent update to the Tote’s website whichoffers more informationabout its Pool Guarantee Service (PGS) – a system by which the Tote itself places bets into its own pools – it also raised the interesting question of whether the operator took a share of the payout too.Ryan Moore guides Delacroix to Eclipse win and puts Oisin Murphy in the shadeRead moreAnd the answer, the Tote said on Monday, is no. It put “in excess of £100k” into the Placepot pool that day and, like 99.9% of the other punters in the bet, it failed to draw (although it did, of course, take the standard 27% cut of the pool). As a result, there was a big uplift to the dividend for the punters who did find a winning line, of around £10k per unit.“On Friday 20th June at Royal Ascot, the Tote guaranteed a Placepot of at least £400,000,” a spokesperson for the operator said on Monday.“The final pool size was £479,524.80 with results across the six races leading to a dividend of £26,424.30 which was won by 18.15 units.The Toteheld no winning units in that pool which meant all of the funds used by the Tote for seeding, amounting to in excess of £100,000 on that day, contributed to the dividends that were won by other customers. Without Pool Guarantee Service the total pool size pool would have been substantially less, with a corresponding reduction in the dividend to £16,383.80 instead of £26,424.30.”The Tote, which was founded nearly a century ago to effectively allow punters to bet between themselves with no bookmaker involved, first started betting into its own pools during the Covid-19 pandemic, when there were no on-course punters for well over a year. The fact that the practice had continued once the racecourse crowds returned was first highlightedin this column in March 2022, while a study by a Tote customer which suggested the operator could be responsible for as much as 60% of some Placepot poolswas sent to the Gambling Commission,which regulates gambling in the UK, in February. A month later, the Guardianreported an understandingthat the Commission had launched a review of the Tote’s activity.The commission itself refuses to confirm or deny whether it is investigating an individual operator, so it is impossible to gauge whether the regulator played any role in the recent update to the Tote’s website, which includes a statement that “over time this exercise [PGS] typically leaves a net profit for the Tote, which is used to help promote the Tote business.”The update also expanded on an earlier statement that PGS is designed “to add layers of liquidity at predetermined times to make the pools deeper and more robust as they build,” by stating that “the majority of seeding bets on multi-leg pools are placed four minutes before the scheduled off time of the first race”. It stated too that its system “is pre-configured to contribute anything up to 50% of the estimated value of any Tote pool in which seeding takes place.”View image in fullscreenRacegoers relaxing on day four of Royal Ascot this year.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAThe Tote remains robust in its defence of PGS. “Over the last six years,” its statement on Monday added, “we have transformed how the Tote operates creating a healthier and more sustainable ecosystem thanks to Pool Guarantee Service and initiatives such as the Tote’s SP Guarantee and World Pool. We have done this by responding directly to feedback, with customers consistently stating they want bigger guaranteed pools. Pool Guarantee Service allows us to provide this service in-house without the reliance on third parties to provide any significant liquidity.”Liquidity is all-important in pool betting, and it tends to flourish in jurisdictions where it has a monopoly on horse-race betting, which puts the UK Tote on the back foot from the off.It is also the case that big syndicates using sophisticated computer models and algorithms to cream off the value in multi-leg bets are now a feature of pool betting systems around the world. In a sense, the Tote is simply doing what a syndicate would be doing if the operator was not doing it first.But it is also some way from the popular idea of a strictly punter-to-punter betting product, in which the operator has no interest in the result. And while its activity in the Ascot Placepot on 20 June boosted the dividend by around £10k, the fact that PGS makes a net profit overall means that this is more than offset by reduced payouts to winners elsewhere, on other days and in other pools.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Tuesday tipsShowPontefract2.10 Sparkling Pink 2.40 Muhaajim 3.10 Royal Dress 3.40 Musical Touch 4.10 Analogical 4.40 Love Is The Law 5.10 Match PlayLingfield2.25 Penn Avenue (nap) 2.55 Monkmoor Pip (nb) 3.25 Captain Brett 3.55 Redditizio 4.25 Command The Stars 5.00 AmestrisUttoxeter6.00 Hope Rising 6.30 Isocrate 7.00 Ajp Kingdom 7.30 Wbee 8.00 Pescatorius 8.30 Turpin Gold 9.00 SevaranaBrighton6.12 Toussarok 6.42 Aeih 7.12 Kranjcar 7.42 Shady Bay 8.12 Lambournghini 8.42 PietroWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Many punters retain a deep, almost sentimental attachment to the Tote, which was famously founded by Sir Winston Churchill to return money to racing from on-course betting, and has been a fixture on the betting landscape for 97 years.For many, there is a keen desire too for a competitive alternative to betting with bookmakers, not least as so many punters find their accounts closed or restricted if they show any sign of being an unprofitable customer for the layer.Whether a Tote that regularly bets into its own pools and makes a net profit from its betting activity is a price worth paying for that alternative is a question for individual backers to decide.Explore more on these topicsThe ToteTalking HorsesHorse racingcommentShareReuse this content"

This is a threat that needs to be taken seriously at the highest levels of government.“Only when drugs are kept out, and prisoners are involved in genuinely purposeful activity that will help them to get work and resettle successfully on release, can we expect to see prisons rehabilitate rather than just contain the men and women they hold.”Almost two-fifths (39%) of respondents to prisoner surveys said it was easy to get drugs in prison, and inspectors regularly visited prisons where the recorded rate of positive random drug tests was more than 30%.The report said in many jails there were “seemingly uncontrollable levels of criminality” that often inexperienced staff were unable to contain.Taylor’s report found overcrowding and lack of activity caused frustration among prisoners, which fuelled the demand for drugs, with many spending most of the day in cramped shared cells with broken furniture and vermin.Overcrowding meant there were not enough places for every prisoner to take part in work or education while in custody, but even when there were spaces available inspectors found underused workshops because of staff shortages.Purposeful activity was the worst performing assessment category by inspectors, with 28 out of 38 adult prisons visited deemed to be “poor” or “not sufficiently good” in this area.The government recently approved the use of protective body armour for prison staff in high security areas after four prison officers wereattacked with hot oil and homemade weaponsby Manchester Arena bomb plotter Hashem Abedi at HMP Frankland in April.Ministers vowed to create 14,000 new prison places by 2031 and have accepted recommendations from the independent sentencing review to curb overcrowding in the long term.James Timpson, the prisons minister, said: “This report shows the scale of the crisis we inherited and the unacceptable pressures faced by our hardworking staff – with prisons dangerously full, rife with drugs and violence.“We are ending this chaos. After just 500 prison places added in 14 years, we’re building 14,000 extra – with 2,400 already delivered – and reforming sentencing to ensure we never run out of space again. We’re also improving prisons so they cut crime, not create better criminals.“We’re also investing £40m to bolster security, alongside stepping up cooperation with police to combat drones and stop the contraband which fuels violence behind bars.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationDrugsUK criminal justiceJames TimpsonnewsShareReuse this content"

PC Marsden kicks Mr Amaaz around the head area.“PC Marsden stamps his foot towards the crown of Mr Amaaz’s head area but doesn’t appear to connect with Mr Amaaz.”Footage from the body-worn cameras of the three officers was also played to the jury.Amaaz is alleged to have assaulted PC Marsden and PC Ward, causing them actual bodily harm.He is also accused of the assault of PC Cook and the earlier assault of a member of the public, Abdulkareem Ismaeil, at Starbucks.Amaad, 26, is alleged to have assaulted PC Marsden, causing actual bodily harm.Both men, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, deny the allegations.Giving evidence, PC Marsden told the court he approached the pay station area with the intention of taking “immediate control” and escorting the suspect from the crowd and to arrest him outside where he would have radio signal.He said: “I wanted to prevent his escape or any opportunity to escape, but also to give me control of someone who had allegedly been violent towards a member of the public.”He said he placed his hands on Amaaz’s left arm, but said he was “met with immediate resistance” and that he felt the suspect “clench his fists”.PC Marsden said: “I recall leaning in and saying to him words along the lines of ‘come on mate, we are not doing that here.’”He said he did not feel it was necessary to tell the suspect he was a police officer because he was wearing full uniform with a cap.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

As a matter of courtesy, I wrote to the party chairman in October to inform him of my intention not to renew my membership. I did not receive a reply.“I joined theConservativesall those years ago because I believed it was the party that best reflected my values and beliefs. Regrettably, that is no longer the case.

He also served as a minister in the Department for Exiting the EU under Theresa May between 2016 and 2017.He later became deputy chair of the European Research Group, a Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs.Jones, who stood down from parliament last year after 19 years as an MP, said he had no intention of standing for election, and had joined Reform “as a private individual”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This ends now.”In late May, Kennedy announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) wouldno longer recommendCovid-19 vaccines for healthy children or pregnant women. The announcement, made on social media, contradicted a raft of evidence showingpregnant womenand infants are at especially high-risk from the disease, including from the administration’s own scientific leaders.In June, Kennedy went further byfiringall 17 sitting members of a key vaccine advisory panel to the CDC. The advisory panel is a key link in the vaccine distribution pipeline, helping to develop recommendations insurers use when determining which vaccines to cover.That panel met for the first time in late June. Membersannounced they would reviewboth the childhood vaccine schedule and any vaccines that had not been formally reviewed in seven years. They also recommended against along-vilifiedvaccine preservative, in spite of a lack of evidence of harm.The news comes amid the largest annual measles case count in33 years, and amid reports of more parentsseeking early vaccinationfor their children, fearing vaccines will go into shortage or no longer be covered by insurance.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationRobert F Kennedy JrCoronavirusVaccines and immunisationReproductive rightsUS politicsInfectious diseasesnewsShareReuse this content"

He appeared to have killed himself, Russia’s investigative committee said in a statement.The Kremlin published an order signed by Putin to remove Starovoit from his position as transport minister on Monday morning, shortly before news of his death was made public. No reason was given for his dismissal in the order, which was dated 7 July at 9.15am.But Russian media, including the local edition of Forbes, have reported that Starovoit may have died as early as Friday evening, before the order to dismiss him was published. The timeline of his death and dismissal has not been confirmed by investigators. A member of the State Duma, Andrei Kartapolov, told Russian journalists that Starovoit had died “quite long ago”.Starovoit was a prominent official in the Putin government who had previously served from 2018 to 2024 as the governor of the Kursk region, where he oversaw the construction of defensive fortifications for the region on the border with Ukraine after the Russian invasion.The subsequent governor was arrested in a corruption scandal after investigators claimed that more than 1bn roubles (nearly £10m) had been embezzled from federal funds designated to protect the region from a potential incursion by Ukrainian forces.Kommersant, a leading Russian business newspaper, reported that other Kursk officials targeted in the embezzlement case had given testimony against Starovoit, indicating that he may also have faced scrutiny or arrest. Top officials who are dismissed from the Russian government can often face criminal charges as they lose the political backing that previously may have protected them from inquiries into their business or political dealings.Part of the Kursk region was occupied by Ukraine’s army last August in a counteroffensive that was deeply embarrassing for the Kremlin, which has sought to keep the war out of Russia and minimise the impact of the conflict on Russian citizens.Kommersant reported that Starovoit was found with a Makarov pistol that he had been awarded in 2003 for his service “ensuring public safety” in his role as the governor of the Kursk region.Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, denied that Starovoit’s sacking was due to a “lack of trust” but did not answer questions on why he had been dismissed.Also on Monday, a senior official at Russia’s federal roads agency, Andrei Korneichuk, died at work of an apparent heart attack. There was no clear connection between the two transport officials’ deaths.The Kremlin announced Starovoit’s dismissal after hundreds of flights were cancelled across Russia due to a mass disruption caused by Ukrainian drone attacks over the weekend.As of Monday, nearly 500 flights had been cancelled in Russia and another 1,500 were delayed, according to official statistics. Russia and Ukraine struck each other with hundreds of long-range drones on Sunday as Ukraine said it would scale up drone production in collaboration with western countries. Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have shot down more than 150 long-range drones over the weekend.The strikes on Russia led to what local media described as a “transport collapse”, with photos of travellers stranded in transport hubs including Moscow’s Sheremetyevo and St Petersburg’s Pulkovo airports.Explore more on these topicsRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Water companies rebrand it as biosolids and give or sell it to farmers as a nutrient-rich fertiliser.It is spread over vast areas under light-touch regulation and minimal scrutiny, unmonitored for toxic substances.“On the outside it appears to be ‘black gold’ – containing nitrogen and phosphates valuable for soil,” a water industry expert said. “But hidden within it are microplastics,Pfas forever chemicals, endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals and heavy metals.”About 87% of the UK’s 3.6m tonnes of sewage sludge is applied to farmland. An Environment Agency (EA) officer, speaking anonymously, said: “People have seen the sewage in rivers … they need to know about the sludge, where it goes and what’s in it.”The water industry’s own chemicals investigation programme found hormone-damaging nonylphenols and phthalates, the banned carcinogen PFOS, antibiotics, antimicrobials and anti-corrosion chemicals in every sample tested from 11 treatment works.Scientists from Cardiff and Manchester universities estimate that31,000 to 42,000 tonnes of microplasticsare spread on European farmland annually via sludge, with the UK possibly facing the worst contamination.Rules set in 1989 require testing only for a few heavy metals, and EA insiders say they are “not fit for purpose”.The investigation identified about 34,000 registered sites in England where sludge is stored, usually before being spread at the same site or on a field nearby, although it can sometimes be transported long distances. Of these, about 33,000 sites are defined as being agricultural land.In 2023 alone, more than 768,000 tonnes of dry solids were spread across 152,000 hectares. Figures from the past decade consistently fall between 715,000 and 800,000 tonnes.Some counties are more affected than others: Hampshire, Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire and Essex have the highest number of sites, with 6,371 between them.Sludge storage sites in England mapSludge-spreading is governed by waste exemptions, allowing companies to store or apply waste on land without an environmental permit, provided certain conditions are met such as avoiding significant risk to water, soil, air or wildlife. But enforcement is weak. “No one checks. No one cares,” said one EA insider.An EA officer explained that sludge toxicity depends on local sources: “Anywhere with an industrial estate will likely produce more contaminated sludge than a rural area.”Industrial waste, such as landfill leachate, is often tankered into sewage works, mixed with domestic waste, and the resulting sludge is spread under the same rules as any biosolid.Contaminated fields become silent sources of pollution. Even uncontaminated sludge can be a problem if mismanaged. When too many nutrients reach rivers, they fuel algal blooms that block sunlight and starve aquatic life of oxygen – a process called eutrophication.The investigation found that one in 20 sludge storage sites in England are within 100 metres of a river, and 1,277 sites are within 500 metres of waters already classed as eutrophic by the EA.The investigation found that 73% of all sludge sites – 23,844 – are within nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs), where strict rules apply due to pollution risks. In England, no rivers meet chemical standards and just 14% meet ecological ones.Sludge-spreading occurs in Wales and Scotland, too. Almost a quarter of sludge storage sites in Scottish locations that could be identified are within NVZs. A study from the James Hutton Institute found microplastic levels rose by 1,450% after four years of sludge-spreading in North Lanarkshire and remained elevated 22 years later. In Northern Ireland, most sludge is incinerated.Richard Benwell, Wildlife and Countryside Link’s chief executive, said: “Though sludge could be a beneficial fertiliser, it is mixed with the dregs of chemical pollutants. Damaging Pfas, BPA and glyphosate are prevalent in sludge. Regulation must be strengthened to protect public health and the environment.”Prof Rupert Hough, of the James Hutton Institute, said: “At the moment, sludge will only be checked for metals and the receiving environment is checked for metals but I don’t think it gets checked rigorously.“We all put chemicals down the drain, take medicines – these end up in the sludge and on land, and can enter the food chain.” He said the alternative options – landfilling and incineration – had capacity limits and high costs.“The cost of removing chemicals from sludge is also prohibitively expensive … the industry has few options,” he said.A water industry source said: “Colleagues in the industry are not out to commit evil in their public service of water management. They’re just constrained by a lack of research and development.”A spokesperson for Water UK said water companies were backing research and trialling new uses for bioresources, including as aviation fuel. “The UK has banned some products with microplastics – we need the same for Pfas, plus a national cleanup plan funded by polluting manufacturers. Contaminants cross borders, which is why we’re calling for coordinated action across Europe.”Shubhi Sharma, of the charity Chem Trust, said the government used lack of funding as an excuse for “failing to prevent our farmlands from being poisoned”. She called for tighter chemical restrictions and a “polluter pays” model. “France has already introduced taxes for Pfas polluters. The UK should follow,” she said.The EA said sludge must not harm soil or water, and that it enforced strict rules, including through more than 4,500 farm inspections last year, resulting in more than 6,000 pollution-reducing actions.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it wanted safe, sustainable sludge use and it has launched an independent water commission to review the regulatory framework in collaboration with the EA, farmers and water companies.Explore more on these topicsFarmingWaterRiversWastePfasWater industrynewsShareReuse this content"

This is affecting shipping along the Rhine – one of Europe’s key waterways – south of Duisburg and Cologne inGermany, including the choke point of Kaub, forcing vessels to sail about half full.Rainfall over the weekend caused only a moderate rise in water levels, according to commodity traders.Paris reopens River Seine to public swimming after century-long banRead moreShallow water has prompted ship operators to impose surcharges on freight rates to compensate for vessels not sailing fully loaded, increasing costs for cargo owners. Traders told Reuters that loads that are normally transported on one vessel were being carried on several barges.Most of the nearly 200m tonnes of cargo shipped on German rivers each year – from coal to car parts, grains and food to chemicals – is transported on the Rhine, the second longest river in central and western Europe after the Danube.Unusually low water levels on the Danube inHungaryare affecting shipping and agriculture, as temperatures peaked at 35C in Budapest last week. This means cargo ships must leave behind more than half of their loads and can only operate at 30-40% capacity, Attila Bencsik, the deputy president of the Hungarian Shipping Association, said.In Poland, the water level in the Vistula, the country’s longest river, hasfallen to its lowest ever recorded level in Warsawas temperatures stayed above 30C for a prolonged spell and there has been little rainfall.Three years ago,German companies faced supply bottlenecks and production problemsaftera drought and heatwave led to unusually low water levels on the Rhine.That summer, the French energy supplierEDF had to temporarily reduce outputat its nuclear power stations on the Rhône and Garonne rivers as heatwaves pushed up their temperatures, restricting its ability to use their water to cool the plants.More rain is forecast in Germany in the coming days, which could raise water levels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Yorkshire in the UK, water reservoirs have plunged. Data released by Yorkshire Water, which has more than 5 million customers, showed levels had dropped further from63% recorded in Mayto55.8% in June– significantly below the average (81.9%) for this time of year.Reservoirs are close to half full, with most of the summer still ahead. Yorkshire’s reservoirs have been declining since late January amid the driest spring for 132 years in the county and England’s warmest June on record. During warm weather, water usage usually increases, which further affects reservoir levels. Customers used almost 1.5bn litres on 30 June – 200m litres above Yorkshire Water’s typical daily output.Another UK water company,Severn Trent, has urged its 8 million customers to be “mindful of their water use”. It said there was less water in reservoirs and rivers and while there was no plan for a hosepipe ban, it remained an option.Explore more on these topicsShipping industryWater industryGermanyHungaryPolandEuropeRiversnewsShareReuse this content"

They never took into consideration my age or the distance from my family. I was still a child, just very confused.”The inquest, which is taking place more than 10 years after Mathieson died, heard that her parents believed social workers fuelled her fantasy of what living in care away from her family would be like.Her father, James Mathieson, expressed concern that it had taken so long for the inquest to begin and said lessons had to be learned from his daughter’s death.Conroy was jailed for life a year after killing Mathieson, who was from Windsor, Berkshire, in 2014.A serious case review found the attack was predictable and preventableas Conroy had assaulted other women and Alexandra Housewas fined.James Mathieson told the inquest at Avon coroner’s court that his daughter was kind, gentle and wanted to work in a children’s nursery.She was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorderaged seven, had difficulties with her speech and was bullied at school.James Mathieson said she became obsessed with the fictional Jacqueline Wilson character Tracy Beaker, who lived “happily” in a residential care home nicknamed the Dumping Ground.He said social workers talked to her about living in care, which fuelled a “fantasy” of what it would be like. He said: “Whenever social services became involved, her social worker would talk to Melissa about going into care, without really explaining to her what this actually meant. This encouraged Melissa to develop this fantasy of care as being the answer to all her problems.”He said that just after Mathieson’s 17th birthday she was admitted to hospital with anxiety and after that moved between care homes, returning home only intermittently.“No one seemed to listen to us or involve us in the decisions being made,” he said. Mathieson moved to Alexandra House – about 80 miles from the family home – three days after her 18th birthday.James Mathieson spoke to his daughter the night before she died. She was tired and he told her to go sleep. “She was killed in her sleep,” he said. “I have to live with that.”Her mother, Karen Mathieson, died from cancer at the end of 2015. James Mathieson said he believed Melissa would have helped care for her. “I think in some way it would have made her,” he said.Maria Voisin, the senior coroner for Avon, said the inquest had been delayed by legal proceedings but James Mathieson said: “I should not have had to wait for over 10 years for this inquest to happen. I feel it should have happened shortly after to ensure that something like this doesn’t happen again.”A statement from Karen Mathieson read out in court said she and her husband had found the involvement of social services “impossible”.It said: “From the age of about 16, we felt we no longer had a voice – social services were putting ideas into her head about living away from home and ultimately it was this that put Melissa in danger.Karen Mathieson said Conroy’s problems should have been addressed. “There were warning signs. These were missed and nothing will bring Melissa back,” she said. “The system failed him and failed Melissa.”The inquest continues.Explore more on these topicsSocial careBristolCrimeEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The message – later removed – said council byelections “are frequent events as councillors retire or stand down – it is important that all branches have prospective candidates lined up ready to go”.While Reform has not previously set out its vetting criteria, beyond a ban on previous members of far-right groups such as the British National party, the message hints at a lowering of the threshold for concerns about controversial statements, for example on X or other social media.Before the general election last year the partydisowned three parliamentary candidatesalready in place over comments they had made. One had made derogatory comments about the IQ of sub-Saharan African people, and another said asylum seekers arriving on small boats were “scum”.After the election it emerged that one of the Reform MPs elected on 4 July last year, James McMurdock,had been convictedof assaulting his girlfriend 18 years previously.McMurdock voluntarily removed the party whip on Friday ahead of the publication of a newspaper storysayingthat before entering parliament he had taken out £70,000 in Covid loans for two companies that appeared to have no employees.Since May’s local elections, where Reform won 677 seats and took control of 10 councils, a series of its councillors have been suspended or quit the party for reasons including one man who has appeared in court accused of making threats to kill his wife.While Reform has had to act at speed to recruit parliamentary and council candidates, Farage has argued that its vetting system was beyond reproach.“We’ve been vetting, I bet, to a standard that no other party has ever done before for local council elections,” he told GB News in March. “The reason is, I know we’ll be held to a higher standard than all the others.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Reform rap sheet reads jail time for assaulting a woman, alleged financial misconduct, and flirting with the far right.“It’s disturbing that Farage is seemingly looking to further water down Reform’s standards. The public rightly expects the highest standards in public office. It appears Reform just aren’t up to the job.”Antony Hook, the Liberal Democrat leader of the opposition on Kent council and member of the party’s “Reform watch” board, said: “Reform must urgently clarify the situation. They have clear issues with candidate vetting at all levels, so the idea that their standards could be watered down further is shocking and very concerning. Inviting failed candidates to try again under lax rules suggests that they are either struggling to recruit candidates, or something more sinister.”Explore more on these topicsReform UKNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

It has more than 900 staff in more than 45 countries.The former UK prime minister has been involved in the region and worked for nearly eight years as special representative of the Quartet of international powers seeking a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.He resigned in 2015.The institute denied it was involved in the preparation of a slide deck, which the FT reported had been developed by the Israeli business people using BCG’s financial models and was said to have proposed paying half a million Palestinians to leave the area.The slides reportedly outlined a plan called the “Great Trust” and was shared with theTrump administration. It envisaged that private investors would have been attracted to Gaza once many of the inhabitants had been paid to leave.The plan outlined in the slides was reported to have been created to attract Trump’s attention and that of wealthy Gulf rulers. Among 10 “mega projects”, the document includes the “MBS Ring” and “MBZ Central” highways – named after the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – and an “Elon Musk smart manufacturing zone”.In February, Trump retweetedan AI-generated videoand said: “We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal … the Riviera of the Middle East, it could be so magnificent.”Blair’s institute said it was not involved in the preparation of the slide deck, which it described as “a BCG deck”, and added that it had no input into its contents.“Tony Blair himself has neither spoken to the people who prepared this deck nor commented on it. The TBI team speaks to many different groups and organisations with postwar ‘plans’ forGaza, but had nothing to do with the authorship of this plan,” a spokesperson said.“TBI staff participated in two calls, as they have done with many other people with ‘Gaza plans’ and interacting with them doesn’t mean endorsement. But we were not involved in drawing up the deck, it is emphatically not TBI work or ‘joint’ work so it would be completely wrong to suggest it is.“Of course we’re opposed to any plan which tries to make Gazans leave Gaza. We want them to be able to stay and live in Gaza.“The TBI document referred to is an internal TBI document looking at proposals being made by various parties covering all the different aspects of what a postwar Gaza could look like, though it is one of many such internal documents.”The spokesperson said TBI’s work in the region had always been dedicated to building a better Gaza for Palestinians, adding: “Tony Blair has worked for this since leaving office. It has never been about relocating Gazans, which is a proposal TBI has never authored, developed or endorsed.”The TBI describes itself as a “not-for-profit, non-partisan organisation helping governments and leaders turn bold ideas into reality”.BCG has been embroiled in a separate controversy over its connection to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the controversial Israeli- and US-backed delivery group.The consulting company said last month that it had cancelled its contract with the GHF amid growing media scrutiny into the group’s work and sources of funding.BCG has sought to dissociate itself from the work in Gaza and has reportedly fired two partners who it said had misled senior management. TheFT reported last week that the BCG team had been involved in modelling of the potential reconstruction of Gaza.Explore more on these topicsTony BlairGazaTrump administrationPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and chair, Samir Shah, have apologised and disciplinary action is expected for some of those directly involved.However, music industry insiders said the corporation has seriously overreacted, pointing to the fact that extensive Glastonbury coverage has been running for years without serious incident. Several also cited free speech concerns for artists.David Martin, the head of the Featured Artists Coalition (FAC), the UK trade body representing music artists, called for a rethink and said it was a moment for “cool heads and an even-handed approach”.“The BBC is absolutely fundamental to the continued success of British music, and particularly vital to supporting our new and emerging artists’ development,” he said.“The FAC wholeheartedly supports the network’s remit for public service broadcasting, something which is encapsulated by their Glastonbury coverage. That remit also comes with responsibilities. The BBC is rightly held to the highest regulatory, legal and editorial standards. If those standards have been breached, then there should be appropriate guidelines to follow.“But the idea of preemptively grading artists according to their ’risk’ factor feels arbitrary and disproportionate – and a dangerous step towards censorship. That kind of approach could potentially curtail artistic freedom around certain genres and inadvertently punish those who are simply expressing their views. It’s a road I think we should resist going down.“Live music is incredibly important to the UK. It provides entertainment and cultural capital. But it’s also an art form, and our performers should be free to challenge, provoke and take risks.”Naomi Pohl, the general secretary of the Musicians’ Union, said she was very concerned by the BBC’s decision to be more cautious about live music broadcasts.“We really don’t want to see the BBC broadcasting fewer live events,” she said. “It’s such a shame there has been this shadow cast over this year’s Glastonbury coverage, because it has had fantastic viewing figures. It’s been all over iPlayer and people have been tuning in live.“We need to talk to the BBC about it directly. But I don’t want to see any broadcasters now broadcasting fewer live events because they don’t want to take the risk. The whole of the music industry will be feeling that, because it’s so crucial to us to have the BBC.”The BBC’s decision came after significant political pressure. Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said the incident – together with otherBBC issues over Gaza coverage– could be “a problem of leadership”. Davie currently has the support of the BBC board.There is frustration among some in the BBC that the number of people who actually saw the Bob Vylan broadcast was very small. Others say editorial cuts have aggravated issues around the monitoring of live streams.A BBC spokesperson said: “We will continue to bring audiences a range of music performances, both live and on-demand, and we respect artists’ freedom of expression. However, Bob Vylan’s offensive and deplorable behaviour on one of our Glastonbury live streams was completely unacceptable and we are sorry it appeared on the BBC.“This is why we have made immediate changes to livestreaming music events, and these alongside our editorial guidelines will shape our plans going forward.”Explore more on these topicsBBCGlastonbury festivalFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Romero was five months pregnant when a taskforce of army personnel raided the home where the couple lived with their one-year-old daughter. Romero was killed after she gave birth.After the 1976 coup, Argentina’s military set about crushing potential opposition and eventually 30,000 people were killed or disappeared, almost all of them civilians.Pregnant prisoners were kept alive until they gave birth and then murdered. At least 500 newborns were taken from their parents while in captivity and given to military couples to raise as their own.View image in fullscreenAdriana Metz, sister of the 140th identified grandchild, at a press conference with photos of her murdered parents.Photograph: EPAThe man, who has not been named, was reunited with his sister, Adriana Metz, who was just a year-and-a-half old when their parents were abducted. Metz, now a member of the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo’s executive committee, was raised by her grandparents and never stopped hoping that her brother might still be alive. Their grandmother died in 1992 without having met her grandson.During a press conference in Buenos Aires, Metz said that during her first conversation with her brother, she learned that he had been raised as an only child. She celebrated their reunion as the beginning of a new chapter for their family.“From here on out, everything is a gain for the Metz-Romero family,” she said.“Thank you to the Grandmothers for teaching us that this search is a collective one, and that we must continue on behalf of the 300 grandchildren who are still missing,” Metz said.“With the restitution of grandchild 140, we confirm once again that our grandchildren are among us – and that thanks to the perseverance and tireless work of 47 years of struggle, more will continue to appear. This fight cannot be carried out in solitude,” said Estela de Carlotto, 94, president of the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo.View image in fullscreenThousands attend a Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice rally in Buenos Aires’ Plaza de Mayo in March 2024 to commemorate the victims of the last military dictatorship.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAccording to the group, there are still hundreds of people aged between 45 and 49 years old who could be anywhere in the world and who have no idea they were kidnapped as children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

McAllen police chief, Victor Rodriguez, said Mosqueda had a “utility vest” in addition to the rifle when federal agents returned fire.Hours before the attack in McAllen, Mosqueda’s father was stopped by Weslaco police at about 2.30am for a traffic violation, according to police spokesperson Heriberto Caraveo. The father told police that he was looking for his son, who he said had psychological issues and was carrying weapons in his car, Caraveo told the Associated Press.Police say the white two-door sedan that Mosqueda drove to the facility had letters painted – possibly in Latin – on the driver’s side door.“What it means, or whether or not it is an underlying reason for him being here, I do not know,” Rodriguez said when asked about the graffiti.After Mosqueda was killed, law enforcement found other weaponry, ammunition and backpacks inside the vehicle.“There are many, many more rounds of ammunition in his backpack,” Rodriguez said.Rodriguez said his department received a call about the shooting around 5:50am One officer who responded to the shooting, a 10-year veteran, was injured after being struck in the knee. Rodriguez said it was unclear if the injury was from shrapnel or a bullet.Fear and surveillance in the US-Mexico borderlands: ‘There’s a lot more open hate’Read morePolice say Mosqueda was linked to a Michigan address, but was reported missing from a Weslaco, Texas, address around 4am Monday. Weslaco is about 20 miles (32km) from the border patrol facility.“An hour and a few minutes later, he was at this particular location opening fire on the federal building and our federal agents,” Rodriguez said.The exact details of the missing person report were not immediately shared with the media.Rodriguez said there is no ongoing threat to the public, but it is unknown if any other people were involved in the attack. He said the motive and events leading up to the attack are part of the ongoing investigation, which the FBI is taking the lead on.The attack comes as Donald Trump ’s administration ramps up deportations, which will be turbocharged by a sweeping spending bill that became law last week. Stephen Miller, the president’s deputy chief of staff and chief architect of his immigration policies, recently set a target of at least 3,000 immigration arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of the administration.Explore more on these topicsTexasUS immigrationUS-Mexico bordernewsShareReuse this content"

We don’t want an emperor – we are sovereign nations.”Later, during apress conferenceat theBrics summit in Rio de Janeiro, Lula was asked directly about Trump’s post in support of Bolsonaro. “Look, I’m not going to comment on this Trump and Bolsonaro thing,” he said. “I’ve got more important things to talk about than that.“This country has laws, this country has rules, and this country has an owner: the Brazilian people. So mind your own business and not ours,” he added.Bolsonaro is facing a range of criminal and electoral cases in Brazil.He is now barred from running for office until 2030 after making unfounded attacks on the country’s voting system, which disqualifies him from next year’s election.At the supreme court, in addition to the alleged coup attempt, Bolsonaro stands accused of allegedly selling jewellery intended for the presidency and forging a Covid vaccination certificate. The coup case, however, is the most advanced, with a ruling expected later this year.In his post, Trump wrote: “The only Trial that should be happening is a Trial by the Voters of Brazil – It’s called an Election. LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE!”The former Brazilian president had been seeking a more vocal show of support from Trump for months. One of his sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, took leave from his post as a congressman and has been living in the US since March,lobbying Trump and Republican politiciansto impose sanctions on Brazil – and particularly on the judge overseeing the cases against the former president, Justice Alexandre de Moraes.Eduardo praised Trump’s post and said it “would not be the only news coming from the United States in the near future”.In his post thanking Trump – which included a photo of the two standing side by side during their presidencies – Bolsonaro said he was the target of “a legal aberration (lawfare), a clear case of political persecution that is now obvious to anyone with common sense”.In Brazil, however, there isbroad consensus among legal expertsthat the coup case is legally sound and that a conviction is likely.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroDonald TrumpLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

There were also 19 cloudbursts, in which an enormous amount of rain falls in a sudden deluge, according to a report by the Himachal Pradesh state government.Several districts remained on high alert for further landslides, with warnings of more rainfall this week.Himachal Pradesh, a state that spans the mountainous terrain of the Himalayas, has suffered repeatedly in recent years as the climate emergency has led to the monsoon rains becoming erratic and falling in more intense, unmanageable bursts.In 2023, large swathes of essential infrastructure in Himachal Pradesh was destroyed and more than 300 people lost their lives after destructive flooding across north India.Many of the state’s biggest towns and cities are built on steep slopes, resulting in hundreds of homes – often built on insecure terrain – collapsing or being engulfed in mud due to landslides and flooding.Weather tracker: Deadly storms in India and huge hailstones in ParisRead moreThe state disaster management authority said the death toll from monsoon-related disasters had reached 78 so far this year, which included deaths from flash floods, electrocution and road accidents.Rescue efforts were ongoing on Monday to find dozens of people still missing after the landslides, but officials said efforts had been hampered by the region’s treacherous terrain and the destruction of vital roads. Many areas across the state were left isolated, without access to clean water and power.One of the state’s worst-affected urban areas was the town of Mandi. The town’s MP, the Bollywood star turned politician Kangana Ranaut – known for her often provocative statements – caused outrage after she said she did “not have any funds for disaster relief or hold any cabinet post”.Experts have repeatedly said the climate crisis is intensifying the risk of flooding in India to dangerous levels due to increased rainfall, rising sea levels and more extreme weather events, particularly during the monsoon period between June and September, when about 80% of the country’s rain falls.Serious flooding in June had already led to dozens of deaths in the north-eastern Indian states of Assam and Mizoram where the monsoon rains arrive earlier. The early arrival of heavy monsoon rains in Mumbai left large areas of the city under water, bringing the metropolitan area, home to about 24 million people, to a standstill.Explore more on these topicsIndiaFloodingExtreme weatherSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

There’s a lot to celebrate: few careers are this distinctive, or this successful. And there’s a real sense Minchin has got life where he wants it tonight. With a five-strong band in tow, the balance is better than onhis last tourbetween troubadour and rock Gargantua. And there’s an embrace, too, of his misfit status: who cares if no one knows whether he’s a musician, a comedian, an auteur or a clown – or whether tonight’s show is, as Minchin describes it, “an absolute shitshow of tonal inconsistency”?I mean, he’s not wrong. Minchin has always been a curious mix of cool and uncool, sending up rock theatrics while openly in thrall to them. He is an artist of excess, never knowingly underwritten – and for more than three hours tonight, we get a lot of him.View image in fullscreenCuriously cool and uncool … Tim Minchin.Photograph: PaulwdixonphotographyNone of the songs, selected from a 28-year career, are left to speak for themselves; they’re all chattily placed in the context of Minchin’s life at the time. This one (Song of the Masochist) was written to help his brother get over an ex-girlfriend. That one (Apart Together) touchingly summons a story about his father and recently deceased mum.‘It had to be dark’ – how we made Matilda the MusicalRead moreThe balance is roughly equal between comic songs, serious songs and bits-of-both songs. There are fantastic highs, like a rendition of Revolting Children, fromMatilda, replete with a squawking electric guitar solo courtesy of bandmate Jak Housden, and the show’s newest number, an elegiac, rounding-off-a-life affair palpably written by a man entering his second half century. And there are moments when we fall foul of our host’s refusal to care what anyone else thinks: see his “I love boobs” number, Confessions, at which one feels faintly embarrassed that his whole band are obliged to sing along.But that’s Minchin, for whom honesty or bust (or in this case, both) is a guiding principle. It’s far more endearing than not tonight, in a show that lays on the line his delight to be where he finds himself – and ensures we share in it.Touring the UK until 26 July, then touring Australia, 31 October-7 DecemberExplore more on these topicsStageComedyTim MinchinreviewsShareReuse this content"

As Japan’s beloved Nakagin Capsule Tower resurfaces, we celebrate an architectural marvelOliver WainwrightMon 7 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 12.38 EDTShareLooking like a teetering stack of washing machines perched on the edge of an elevated highway, the Nakagin Capsule Tower was an astonishing arrival on the Tokyo skyline in 1972. It was the heady vision ofKisho Kurokawa, a radical Japanese architect who imagined a high-rise world of compact capsules, where people could cocoon themselves away from the information overload of the modern age. These tiny pods would be “a place of rest to recover”, he wrote, as well as “an information base to develop ideas, and a home for urban dwellers”. Residents could peer out at the city from their cosy built-in beds through a single porthole window, or shut it all out by unfurling an elegant circular fan-like blind, all while remaining connected with the latest technology at all times.Launched to critical acclaim, the Nakagin tower’s 140 capsules quickly sold out, and became highly sought after by well-heeled salarymen looking for a place to crash when they missed the last train home. Never intended to be full-time housing, the pods came stuffed with mod cons: en suite bathroom, foldout desk, telephone and Sony colour TV. But, 50 years on, after a prolonged lack of maintenance and repairs, and disagreements among owners about its future, the asbestos-riddled building was finally disassembled in 2022. The creaking steel capsules of Kurokawa’s space-age fantasy were unbolted and removed from the lift and stair towers, pod by pod.Buildings in Tokyo had an average lifespan of 15 to 20 years. So standing for 50 years makes it a resounding successNow, three years on, a little piece of his dream is back. After a meticulous process of conservation, people will soon be able to get a glimpse of life in one of these sci-fi capsules, thanks to anew exhibitionat the Museum of Modern Art in New York. MoMA acquired a unit in 2023, one of 14 capsules that were carefully restored to their original condition, with oversight from Kurokawa’s office, after the tower was disassembled. “The Nakagin Capsule Tower is one of the world’s most written about works of modern architecture,” says MoMA curator Evangelos Kotsioris. “But the many lives of the building, and its residents, have rarely been told.”View image in fullscreen‘Office, studio, hotel, home, conference room, or urban villa’ … interior view.Photograph: © Noritaka MinamiHe and co-curator Paula Vilaplana de Miguel have pieced together an immersive display that tells the full story of the project in all its facets, from conception to marketing to unexpected afterlife. There will be a wealth of ephemera, from the building’s only surviving sales brochure, to the original promotional film for the tower, alongside video interviews with former residents, and an explorable digital model of the entire building. And of course, there’s the capsule itself, visible in all its freshly white-painted glory through the window of MoMA’s street-level gallery. The museum’s retractable glass facade was opened up for the first time to get it in.Peek through the pod’s porthole window and you will find a streamlined white world that could have been lifted from 2001: A Space Odyssey. A reel-to-reel tape recorder shines out from an angled wall panel, next to a sleek radio receiver and built-in rotary phone, beneath a Sony Trinitron TV. A bright red Olivetti typewriter perches on a fold-down desk, alongside a Sharp electronic calculator – one of the cutting-edge features included in the “super-deluxe” capsule model.“Just as there is a full range of automobiles, from sedans to coupes to sports cars,” Kurokawa explained in the sales brochure, “a capsule house can serve numerous purposes – mini-office, studio, hotel, home, conference room, or urban villa – based on the equipment selected.”View image in fullscreenMedia-savvy salesman … Kurokawa in front of the completed tower in 1974.Photograph: Tomio OhashiKurokawa was the youngest founding member of theMetabolist movement, a group of Japanese architects formed in 1960 that fused ideas about megastructures with those of organic biological growth. They imagined a networked world of interconnecting modular structures that could multiply and spread across the planet like a great branching fungus. But, unlike many of his contemporaries who struggled to communicate effectively with clients and the public through the usual clouds of architectural jargon, Kurokawa was a media-savvy salesman.He produced a sizzling manifesto, The Capsule Declaration, illustrated with Airstream trailers and Nasa space capsules, amniotic sacs and coffins, arguing that “the capsule transcends human and device”. He imagined a seductive plug-and-play future, where capsules could be adapted, expanded and replaced as societal needs changed, presenting a new kind of architecture capable of growth and transformation through “metabolic cycles”. In 1970, he published a punchy magazine-like book, which came with a striking fold-out orange and pinkposterand a 7-inch vinyl recording of his computerised voice reading out his manifesto. On seeing this, as well as Kurokawa’s capsule installation at the Osaka Expo the same year, the Nakagin development company was sold.The 1973 international oil crisis saw construction costs soar – and Kurokawa’s capsule dreams evaporateTheir sales pitch for the “capsule manshon” – a term for high-end apartment buildings – was expounded in a glossy brochure designed like a car catalogue. It included dashing cutaway illustrations of the 10 square metre capsules, drawn by a car magazine illustrator, suggesting that life in one of these pods would be just as thrilling as driving a sports car. The construction company, Taisei, made a 25-minute film, with actors performing a glamorous day in the life of the tower, while buyers were even gifted a lamp in the shape of a building. The marketing worked. Despite their small size, the capsules sold for around 50% more per square metre than the average apartment.The only surviving wooden model of the project will be on show in the exhibition, and attentive visitors will notice that it includes a second capsule tower. Such was the initial sales success, Nakagin started planning a twin complex across the road, to be connected to the first by a raised plinth, as well as towers for several other sites across the city. But their timing couldn’t have been worse. The 1973 international oil crisis saw construction costs soar – and Kurokawa’s capsule dreams evaporate. Still, the first tower remained a success for the next 15 years. Its neighbourhood, Ginza, boomed into a bustling business district, while the capsule prices were ever-inflated by the 1980s bubble economy. Kurokawa, meanwhile, would continue pursuing his penchant for pods elsewhere, building theworld’s first capsule hotelin Osaka in 1979, which spawned a wave of similar micro-hotels across Japan.View image in fullscreenMeticulously restored … the MoMa’s capsule.Photograph: Jonathan Muzikar/The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Nakagin Capsule Tower Preservation and Restoration Project, TokyoBut the Nakagin tower wouldn’t be repeated. Like a giant pixelated bar chart, it reflected the country’s fortunes: when the bubble burst in the early 1990s, so the capsules started to crumble. Residents moved out, maintenance funds dwindled, and rainwater pooling on the capsules’ flat roofs caused extensive corrosion.Kurokawa had always intended that the pods would be replaced after 25 years, to respond to changing needs. But a crucial design flaw made it impossible to remove them individually without first removing every capsule above. Besides, any attempt to refurbish would have required the prohibitively expensive removal of the asbestos insulation. Lured by the value of the site for redevelopment, the individual pod owners voted by majority to sell the building for demolition in 2007, just a few months before Kurokawa died.“Many people see the Nakagin tower as a failed utopian project,” says Kotsioris, but it actually stood for a relatively long time, in terms of Japan’s throwaway building culture. “When buildings in Tokyo had an average lifespan of 15 to 20 years, the fact that it stood for 50 years makes it a resounding success.”View image in fullscreen‘Like a traumatic memory’ … Wakana Nitta (AKA Koe-chan) in the capsule she uses as a DJ booth.Photograph: Courtesy Tatsuyuki Maeda / The Nakagin Capsule Tower Preservation and Restoration Project, Tokyo, JapanAs it turned out, the building’s final years were some of its most vibrant. It won a 15-year reprieve when, after the 2007 financial crisis, the developer that had agreed to acquire the site unexpectedly filed for bankruptcy. Takayuki Sekine, a retired chamber of commerce manager, and his wife, Yumiko, bought a capsule when demolition was already on the cards, and spent every weekend in it. “After I started my blogposts, my articles attracted many readers here,” Takayuki recalls in a video interview. “Some enthusiasts started living here, with many more people joining in. And we had so much fun, with drinking parties at night.”In another video, a DJ called Koe-chan explains how she spotted the tower from the highway. “It stuck with me like a traumatic memory,” she recalls, and she was compelled to acquire a capsule for live-streaming her DJ sets. Others used their pods as offices or libraries, each customised to their new purpose, while the collective efforts to repair and maintain the leaky hulk brought the tower a real sense of community for the first time. “Ironically, the capsules were originally designed as protective wombs for isolation from the city,” says Kotsioris. “But in the end, they turned out to form a really sociable, neighbourly community.”As for Kurokawa, he would no doubt be amused that some of his capsules have found new homes, scattered around cultural institutions and collections worldwideAfter all, he imagined a future where you might undock your capsule and take it with you across the ocean to pastures new.The Many Lives of the Nakagin Capsule Tower is at MoMA, New York, from Thursday until 12 July 2026Explore more on these topicsArchitectureJapanAsia PacificMuseum of Modern ArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is nothing remotely happy about twentysomething Sano (Hiroki Sano). His wife has just died suddenly in her sleep, and Sano is visiting the sleepy Japanese seaside town where they met five years ago. He is rude and sullen, and obsessive about finding a red baseball cap he lost on that first visit. In the pain and anger of his grief, everyone sounds vapid and dumb, their words meaningless blah-blah-blah.It’s hard to see where the happy fits in, until the film flips back in time. In the same hotel five years ago, Sano first claps eyes on his wife Nagi (Nairu Yamamoto) in a chance meeting in the hotel lobby. Yamamoto gives the performance of the film as aspiring photographer Nagi: funny, scatty and earnest. She plays it so naturally, so true to life, that Nagi feels like someone you might have actually met. She and Sano wander around town, young and free: dancing in a club, eating instant noodles. There is a glow to these scenes, a bit like in Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise, which similarly bottles the heart-flutter moment of something clicking, flirtation that feels like more than flirting.In essence it’s a love story in reverse. In the part set five years earlier, director Kohei Igarashi’s script becomes almost like a mystery, following the clues dropped like a trail of crumbs in the first part. (Sothatexplains why he’s so desperate to find the red cap!) A young Vietnamese chambermaid who works in the hotel plays an important role – and the point is gently made that she doesn’t have the luxury of wafting around town for a day.There is something in here about chance and fate, but the film is too natural, too intimate to go too heavy on themes. It is gentle, straightforward drama, beautifully acted and emotionally tuned in. Its message is obvious but true: things can be super happy, just not forever.Super Happy Forever is on MubiExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsJapanRomance filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

A gay man who was very out by the standards of the times, he was right in the middle of the one of the most flamboyant bohemian queer scenes of the period. And, man, did he have fun, shagging up a storm and taking nude pictures of beautiful men and women (but mostly men) when he wasn’t earning work shooting fashion spreads for Vogue magazine. This documentary, directed by Sam Shahid, introduces his life and work in a deeply respectful, straightforward way, splicing in hundreds of examples of his mostly black-and-white pictures with curators, admirers and some surviving friends and acquaintances. Notable interviewees include portrait artist Don Bachardy, and the painter Bernard Perlin, seen in archive footage given he died in 2014, who was a very close friend of Platt Lynes and the executor of his artistic estate.Like so many other documentaries about dead artists that require cooperation from the deceased’s estate, this sometimes gets a little hyperbolic about its subject’s talent. Which is not to say that Lynes’ work isn’t worth exploring and celebrating, not only for its aesthetic merits but also for the way it captures a specific time and place. His commercial work was classical and elegant, tinged with a surrealism he learned first hand from Man Ray himself. His nudes and frankly erotic material are gorgeously sensual with a chilly, sculptural quality whose influence can be traced in later photographers of male nudes like Robert Mapplethorpe.Meanwhile, the snapshot the film offers of New York’s queer scene in the 1940s and 50s – a shimmering fever dream of orgiastic (literally) cocktail parties, fuelled by passion and pomp – is an eye-opening delight. Lynes himself was in a long-running menage a trois with curator Monroe Wheeler and writer Glenway Wescott well before the word polyamorous was even coined, let alone “throuple”. He was also very close to such figures as Gertrude Stein, who scolded him like a granny for dropping out of university, and Christopher Isherwood among others. His encounter with sexologist Alfred Kinsey (which became a friendship) resulted in the Kinsey Institute holding a significant chunk of Lynes’ work, including a box marked “private” that the curators teasingly insist they’ve never looked in out of respect for Lynes. The latter emerges as an irrepressibly charming figure, although perhaps not without a sinister, manipulative side that the film never really delves into.Hidden Master: The Legacy of George Platt Lynes is in UK cinemas from 11 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPhotographyLGBTQ+ rightsNew YorkreviewsShareReuse this content"

Recently divorced from her husband, actor-director Anne Barbot throws herself into preparing a stage adaptation ofEmile Zola’s classic novel L’Assommoir. In Gervaise, the working-class heroine of the book, Barbot finds echoes of her current situation: both are women who struggle to reclaim professional autonomy in the aftermath of broken relationships. Barbot’s production becomes more complicated when she casts Benoît Dallongeville, a neighbour who is also an actor, in the role of her love interest in the play. Soon, passion and tension begin to spill from personal relationships on to the page, and vice versa.Matarrese’s film keeps the camera strikingly close to Barbot and Dallongeville as the pair embark on a long and physically arduous rehearsal process. Jagged, handheld closeups of minute facial expressions and gestures clue us into private emotions that may be unknown even to the two actors. We can sense that, in the beginning, Dallongeville is interested in courting Barbot, though she is pulling back. Yet, over long takes in which they feed each other lines, a certain chemistry gradually emerges, followed by actual romance. The film keeps this development deliberately opaque, as scene transitions make it difficult to tell whether they are reading a script or communicating as themselves. It is as if the border between performance and life has entirely collapsed.Reflecting the ebb and flow of emotions between Barbot and Dallongeville, the film swiftly moves on and off stage as the couple continue their rehearsals – and later on, heated arguments – over trips to the forest and the beach. While the varied locations offer a sense of spontaneity, the film occasionally feels too beholden to its art-versus-life thesis, which makes moments of catharsis come off as mannered and calculated. It has the look of a John Cassavetes film, but lacks that film-maker’s sense of unpredictability.The Zola Experience is on True Story from 11 JulyExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsEmile ZolaTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

I really feel like I betrayed myself. Big time. When I was growing up, I had all the potential in the world. Now I’m back to being Mark with a beer in his hand who is thinking about the great American script and the great American movie. This time I cannot fail. I will not fail.”As far as opening monologues go, you couldn’t have scripted a more perfect introduction to a film that captures one of the purest pursuits of the American Dream ever set to film. But these were not written for a character, but instead straight from the heart of Mark Borchardt in a 1999documentary. It’s rare that documentaries are associated withfeelgood movies, which is odd because they are remarkable vehicles for generating warmth, empathy and humor from spending time in the company of real life people who you grow to like. And I utterly adore spending time with these people.‘Joyous and uplifting’: why Chungking Express is my feelgood movieRead moreBorchardt is from Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, a town with a population of fewer than 40,000 people. He is a dedicated but struggling film-maker. At 30 years old, he delivers newspapers and cleans cemetery toilets for work, has major issues with alcohol, relationship problems, and often has to borrow gas money from his mom, who he lives with. His own brother speaks on camera about him with pity, stating that he thought he would turn out to be a stalker or serial killer. But he is also smart, deeply passionate, articulate and ferociously committed to making films with close to zero budget. He’s got a team of locals, many of who volunteer their time to help make his dreams a reality. We follow him, through ups and downs, as he manages to coax a few thousand bucks from his distrusting, disdainful, yet sweet and endearing uncle, as he sets about to film his 16mm black-and-white horror film Coven.His best friend is Mike Schank, a metalhead, and recovering party monster, who likes to play guitar blindfolded. He has taken such copious amounts of hallucinogens – and once spent a month in hospital after overdosing on PCP – that he has never quite recovered and exists in a kind of perma-haze. A cruel reading of the pair is as wasted buffoons who come across like a bumbling, realWayne’s Worldbut there is far greater depth to them, and the film, than this.American Movie is a profoundly moving document about dreams, friendship, class and America. Yes, it’s funny as hell and loaded with as many one-liners as any scripted comedy, and has subsequently seen the pair pop up as characters in Family Guy, but it’s also shot through with real emotional weight.‘Full of delightful surprises’: why Spy is my feelgood movieRead moreWhen I watch Borchardt, I don’t see him as a down-and-out drunken loser who is delusional about his aspirations, but as someone with roaring ambition and an unflinching belief that another life is possible and that art can take him there. “There was no such thing as college or religion,” he says at one point, speaking about his own upbringing in a town far away from the bright lights of Hollywood. “There was drinking. Drinking, drinking, drinking. Everything would revolve around that.” Despite this, he is an autodidact. The camera pans across his shelves to reveal book after book on film history. While there are calamitous moments and funny fails, and he may need to rope in his confused mom to be an extra or camera operator along the way, he’s clearly got a vision underpinned with deep cinematic knowledge. “I will be goddamned if I don’t get the American Dream,” he says at one point.I feel buoyant and inspired every time I watch the film. It’s such a beautiful example of how much talent exists out there in the world, in unconventional places, that never gets a shot or a look in. And the people who give up their time to support his vision are a stirring depiction of community in action. The film is ultimately one that can be interpreted two ways: you are either laughing at these people or you’re rooting for them and laughing with them along the way. I’m rooting for them, every time. There’s a line that Borchardt speaks, as he is passionately trying to convince a room full of people to be in his film, that perfectly sums up the finished documentary itself: “You get to see Americans and American dreams and you won’t walk away depressed after seeing this. Period.”American Movie is available to rent digitally in the US and Australia and on Amazon Prime in the UKExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsMy feelgood moviefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gradually the other big tech companies followed suit, and now what is technically defined as the “pistol” emoji, supposed to represent a “handgun or revolver”, does not show either: instead you’ll get a water pistol or sci-fi raygun and be happy with it. No doubt this change contributed significantly to a suppression of gun crime around the world, and it remains only to ban the bomb, knife and sword emoji to wipe out violence altogether.As Keith Houston’s fascinatingly geeky and witty history shows, emoji have always been political. Over the years, people have successfully lobbied the Unicode Consortium – the cabal of corporations that controls the character set, including Google, Microsoft, Meta and Apple – to include different skin colours and same-sex couples. It was easy to agree to add the face with one eyebrow raised, the guide dog and the egg. But not every request is granted. One demand for a “frowning poo emoji” elicited this splendid rant from an eminent Unicode contributor, Michael Everson: “Will we have a crying pile of poo next? Pile of poo with tongue sticking out? Pile of poo with question marks for eyes? Pile of poo with karaoke mic? Will we have to encode a neutral faceless pile of poo?”Contrary to popular belief, the word “emoji” has nothing to do with emotions, but instead combines the Japanese terms for “picture” and “written character”. The origin of such sets of symbols has been determined by dogged tech researchers to stretch back much further than the first iPhone, or even the regular mobile phones and electronic PDAs that preceded them. A basic set of emoji could be found in the operating systems of some 1980s electronic typewriters and word processors from manufacturers such as Sharp and Toshiba.Before emojis proper there was a craze for emoticons, made out of regular characters, such as the excellent shrug: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯Long before that, Houston notes, humans used pictographic characters such as hieroglyphs. Later, movable type saw an efflorescence of publishers’ symbols such as the pilcrow (for a new paragraph) and the lamentably under-used manicule (a tiny pointing hand in the margin). And before emoji proper there was a craze for smileys, or emoticons, made out of regular alphanumeric characters, such as the excellent shrug, still sometimes encountered in the wild: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯Indeed, Houston makes the intriguing argument that the age of the mechanical typewriter represented an unusual historical interlude of expressive poverty. Once humans were freed from the unnatural restrictions it imposed, there was bound to be a new flourishing of symbolic play.Such considerations often lead the unwary to suppose that emoji might constitute a “language”, which they definitely don’t. To demonstrate why, Houston recalls the Emoji Dick stunt of 2009, whereby developer Fred Benenson had thousands of people contribute to a crowd-sourced “translation” of Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick into emoji. If this were a bona fide language, it should be possible to translate Emoji Dick back into something close to the original with no knowledge of the source text. It isn’t.As Houston argues, then, emoji are possibly a “script” (a method of writing), and a set of emoji might be a lexicon (a vocabulary), but you can’t communicate anything complex in emoji. It is better, perhaps, to think of emoji as an expanded palette of expressive punctuation.Where next, then, for these little yellow blobs of joy? Unicode has no intention of adding any more flags, the least used category of emoji. The second least popular kind, oddly, is mammals, a fact that has me determined to use more cat faces in future. At some point they will surely have to retire the floppy disk emoji, a picture of an obsolete storage format that millions of younger people have never even seen. Should we even be able, Houston wonders, to create our own custom emoji? As someone who is grateful he doesn’t have to reinvent the full stop every time he reaches the end of a sentence, I doubt most people could be bothered.Face with Tears of Joy: A Natural History of Emoji by Keith Houston is published by Norton (£14.99).

The latest addition to the corpus, a slim debut story collection by nonbinary Northern Irish writer Liadan Ní Chuinn, shares the brilliance and burning energy of those other books, but there is a fundamental distinction. Ní Chuinn was born in the year of the Good Friday agreement, the 1998 power-sharing deal that delivered peace and brought an end to the Troubles; why, then, should their writing be so obsessed with them?“I believe, these things, they’re the making of us,” a character says at one point. He’s talking about a dead friend, but his words might apply to Northern Ireland’s past 50 or so years. Throughout the book the violence of that period is shown to persist, the past proving powerfully, inconveniently alive. Tensions flare between those who attempt to ignore that fact and others who insist on it.The narrator of the title story, Jackie, sometimes uses slashes to prevent him having to choose between alternative nouns: “It looks like a morgue/a nightmare and it smells like a butcher’s but with chemicals mixed in.” Ní Chuinn’s writing is often terse, blunt, its subject matter better served by urgency than elegance. Jackie is a young man haunted by the internment, before his birth, of his uncle and grandfather – also Jackie – and by loyalists having hijacked his parents’ car when his mother was pregnant with him.In Northern Ireland the past bears down on the present with such weight that it is an error to even call it historyWhen Jackie was a boy his father fell ill and appeared to enter a vegetative state. Ní Chuinn, a writer of subtlety despite the polemic that veins these stories, doesn’t push hard on the metaphor, but this “lax and unmoving” figure can be read as a symbol for a Northern Ireland that forgets its history. In fact, as another character – born, like Jackie, after the Good Friday agreement – insists later on, in Northern Ireland the past bears down on the present with such weight that it is an error to even call it history. Ní Chuinn forgoes an epigraph, but a lesser writer, one more in need of underlining their aims, would have reached for Faulkner’s lines from Requiem for a Nun: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”There is space, though, for other concerns and registers. Novena features Moll, second-generation Irish with a father from East Timor. Her grandmother, who is literally keeping the faith, texts Moll: “Said special prayer. You should feel it in couple mins.” But the church she attends announces the impossibility of single funerals owing to a lack of priests, and its congregants listen to hymns on CD because “there is no choir”. In the story Russia, which centres on a brother and sister adopted from that country, a psychic asks her client why he’s come. Aren’t you supposed to know? he answers. “The psychic says: Everyone, no word of a lie, every single person says that. You’ve, none of youse, you’ve no concept of how this works.” Ní Chuinn’s humour flashes brighter for its infrequent use.The same story describes a series of anonymous protests at a museum. Flowers of remembrance are being left at exhibits containing human remains: the preserved corpse of an ancient Egyptian, a Viking skull, a stone age woman’s bones. This broadens the book’s preoccupation with the past while simultaneously, in the manner of Heaney’s bog poems, linking ancient instances of violence with the sectarian murders committed within living memory.Not everyone is willing to have such connections pointed out. In the closing story, Daisy Hill, a young man’s obsession with the Troubles exasperates his family. “I’m sick of this, right, Rowan?” his cousin Shane says. “It happened, right? It happened, two sides, either side, both, it happened, it stopped.” Rowan rejects not only the urge to leave the past behind, but Shane’s characterisation: “I hate that, says Rowan. It’s not both sides, it’s not either side, it’s this huge fucking army, it’s this huge fucking state, this government that does whatever it wants, that just, that, they can kill us, and kill us.” Reading this book as the Israeli state kills unprecedented numbers of Palestinian civilians in Gaza feels particularly difficult, but also valuable – or as valuable as reading can be in the circumstances.Ní Chuinn’s stories are unpredictable and memorable. While they contain the stuff of plots – family secrets, abuse, fraudulent fertility clinics and human trafficking – these aren’t their true subjects, and they almost entirely lack the resolution provided by that familiar short-story trait, the epiphany. Rather than accounts of revelation, these are reports from the knotty midst of things. They describe entanglements that cannot be ignored or consigned to history.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Now receiving a rare production, it captures his conflict between ethics and aestheticsMichael BillingtonMon 7 Jul 2025 07.09 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 07.11 EDTShareWho wrote the following: “When private property is abolished, there will be no necessity for crime”? In one of his plays the same writer has a female revolutionary cry: “How easy is it for a king to kill his people by thousands but we cannot rid ourselves of one crowned man in Europe.” If I reveal that the writer was a London-based Irishman, most people would assume it was Bernard Shaw. In fact, it was Oscar Wilde and, while the first quote comes from his essay The Soul of Man Under Socialism, the last is from his play Vera; or, The Nihilists which is to get a rare professional production at theBrockley Jack Studio theatre, south-east London, in September.The play itself is virtually unknown even to Wildean devotees. It was written in 1879 and loosely based on the story of a 22-year-old Russian revolutionary who had attempted to shoot the St Petersburg chief of police. Wilde’s version is set in Moscow but his heroine, Vera Sabouroff, has a similar political ardour and leads a band of nihilists who plan to assassinate the tsar. That is only the starting-point for a robustly noisy melodrama that was intended for London production in 1881. But the actual assassination of TsarAlexander IIin March of that year and the fact that the Prince of Wales was married to the sister of the new tsarina killed it stone dead. When it was eventually produced in New York in 1883, it was greeted with sneery disdain and, aside from the odd amateur revival, has lain buried ever since.View image in fullscreenA poster for the new production of Oscar Wilde’s Vera; Or, The NihilistsYet, for all its obvious faults, the play has several points of interest and one is what it reveals about Wilde’s own divided nature. We tend to think of that division in terms of his sexuality but there is a comparable split between his radical and aesthetic selves. The two achieve a perfect reconciliation inThe Importance of Being Earnestwhich offers a running commentary on class, money, marriage, morals and the state of society while being an exquisite comic creation. But in an early work like Vera there is a deep, unhealed division between the earnest and the epigrammatic. The play is packed with diatribes against despotism and full of rhetorical hymns to liberty: at one point Vera apostrophises the concept as: “O mighty mother of eternal time, thy robe is purple with the blood of those who have died for thee.”But the play’s most intriguing character is Prince Paul, the Russian prime minister, tsarist apologist and devious word-spinner. He talks throughout in chiselled phrases such as “Experience, the name men give to their mistakes,” and suggests that there is a link between making a good salad and being a brilliant diplomat: the art in both cases is “to know exactly how much oil one must put with one’s vinegar”. He is the prototype of Lord Henry Wotton in The Picture of Dorian Gray and all those languid aristocrats who pepper Wilde’s society dramas with their potted witticisms.View image in fullscreenAristocrat … John Gorick, centre, as Lord Henry Wotton with Rupert Mason and Guy Warren-Thomas in The Picture of Dorian Gray at Trafalgar Studios, London, in 2016.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianOn the one hand, Wilde celebrates revolutionary ardour: on the other, a dandified cynic who claims “life is much too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it”. But this conflict between ethics and aesthetics is not peculiar to Wilde. In 1885, Henry James pursued a similar bifurcation, admittedly with far more subtlety, in his novelThe Princess Casamassima. Its hero, Hyacinth Robinson, is the illegitimate son of an English aristocrat and a French working-woman and his life is as divided as his name suggests. Through his meeting with the titular princess, he acquires a taste for the trappings of privilege. But he also has a passion for social justice that leads him to join a band of political conspirators very like those in Vera and to accept the duty of assassination.James had no great sympathy for Wilde, and in 1895 shamefully refused to sign a petition calling for mitigation of his prison sentence. Yet the two writers had more in common than one suspects and in The Princess Casamassima you find a strange echo of the dilemma posed by Vera: how do you reconcile the desire to change the world with a delight in its culture; or, to put it more simply, how do you achieve a perfect balance between socialism and style?Vera; or, The Nihilists is atBrockley Jack Studio theatre, London, 16-27 September.Explore more on these topicsTheatreOscar WildeClass issuesRussiaSocialismHenry JamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Until now.On Sunday, The Observer published an investigation which made a series of claims about the author of the best-selling book on which the film is based.The report alleged that Winn took tens of thousands from a former employer, and suggests she lied about being made homeless and about the circumstances under which the couple’s house was repossessed in the memoir. It also cast doubt over the legitimacy of Moth’s diagnosis.Contacted by The Guardian, Winn said the Observer report was “highly misleading”.“We are taking legal advice and won’t be making any further comment at this time.“The Salt Path lays bare the physical and spiritual journey Moth and I shared, an experience that transformed us completely and altered the course of our lives. This is the true story of our journey.”Raynor Winn – whose real name is Sally Walker, according to the report – took “around £64,000” from an estate agency and property surveyor where she worked as a bookkeeper. Walker was subsequently arrested, said the wife of the business owner.The Salt Path describes the couple losing their home after investing a “substantial sum” in the business of a childhood friend of Moth – whose real name is Tim Walker, according to the Observer – which subsequently failed. According to Winn, the friend claimed the couple were responsible for company debts, and took them to court, where the judge ordered the repossession of their house.However, it is claimed the Walkers’ house was in fact repossessed after the couple did not pay back a loan used to cover the money Walker took from the estate agency, according to the investigation. The Walkers borrowed £100,000 from a distant relative of Tim’s, and the loan was secured against their house.It is alleged that the relative also helped Walker get a solicitor, who approached her former employer, Martin, with the offer that she would pay back the money and cover legal costs. The Observer claimed that Martin also agreed to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and that no criminal charges were pursued against Walker.Tim’s relative’s business failed, and the Walkers’ house was ultimately repossessed in June 2013. Yet, while Winn depicts the couple as being made “homeless” and having nowhere to go, documents seen by the Observer show that the Walkers bought a house in France in 2007, which they still own.The investigation also casts scepticism over Moth’s diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration (CBD), which he has apparently lived with for 18 years. Miche﻿le Hu, a professor of clinical neuroscienc﻿es at Oxford University named in the report, said that she would be “very s﻿ceptical” that it is CBD. “I’ve never looked after anyone that’s lived that long.”Following The Salt Path, Winn published two further books, The Wild Silence and Landlines. Each of the books opens with Moth suffering from the symptoms of CBD, before the couple go on a difficult walk and Moth’s symptoms seem to improve.The Salt Path has sold more than two million copies worldwide since its publication in 2018. Last month,a film adaptationstarring Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs was released in the UK.“The film is a faithful adaptation of the book that we optioned,” said Number 9 Films and Shadowplay Features, the two production companies behind the film. “The allegations made in the Observer relate to the book and are a matter for the author Raynor Winn.There were no known claims against the book at the time of optioning it or producing and distributing the film and we undertook all necessary due diligence before acquiring the book.”A fourth book by Winn, On Winter Hill, is scheduled to be released in October. Michael Joseph, the Penguin imprint that publishes Winn’s memoirs, did not comment or respond when asked whether the publication of On Winter Hill would go ahead.PSPA, a charity which supports people with CBD and had worked with the Winns, has now ended its relationship with the family, according to the BBC. Winn has also withdrawn from the forthcoming Saltlines tour, on which she was scheduled to appear alongside The Gigspanner Big Band at a number of UK venues.Explore more on these topicsBooksRaynor WinnnewsShareReuse this content"

Shady Glade…”And sitting on my bed in our basement flat in London, for the 33rd time, he would recite (and pretend to read), in exactly the same warm, alerting, storytelling tone, as if he had never seen them before, the first lines. He would have just done the same thing for my brother, now in a deep doze on the other side of the room, with The Gnats of Knotty Pine, while in the kitchen in my pyjamas I gave my nightly reading of Peter and Jane and Pat the Dog to my mother.His beautiful voice, which was soft and rich and clever, was the last thing I heard every day for years; being read to is the routine I remember best from my early childhood, before they split up, and we moved to Wales and our mother took up reading to us. The nights she gave us Astrid Lindgren’s The Brothers Lionheartwere spellbinding. Dad was a broadcaster. Mum had been an actress. They were super performers.I soon realised the aim was not necessarily to entrance and delight, but to render unconsciousWhen my turn to read to my child came, I discovered all the pleasures of the bedside performance. One is the chance of escape through absorption. When Aubrey was small, I commuted between home in the Pennines and teaching in Liverpool, in more or less constant movement through the weeks, and only when I was working with students or reading to Aubrey was my anxious and tugging inner self stilled. And I can recognise that absorption and pleasure on my father’s face when I think of him now.It’s a particular time, reading to and being read to, a quietly magical time for a child, especially snug in your covers, watching and listening to an adult giving themselves entirely to entertaining you. Being an audience of two to the story of the book is lovely, too, a companionship something like equality across generations, across the gulfs between childhood and the adult world.Dad took us on boating holidays after the divorce; with the little cabin cruiser moored for the night, and the black Thames slithering under the keel, he set about EB White’s Charlotte’s Web, and Russell Hoban’s The Mouse and His Child.Whenever he found a funny passage, his delight and amusement were beautiful; the cabin chimed with our laughter and snorted with giggles. Unlike me, Dad timed reading so that we heard a chapter or section and were then bid goodnight, kissed and the light was turned off. When I began bedtime reading to my then partner’s six-year-old, Robin, I soon realised the aim was not necessarily to entrance and delight, but to render unconscious.Deciding to read a book a week was the best new year resolution I ever made | Katie CunninghamRead moreWe did whatever Robin wanted, including Jeff Kinney’s Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and manuals on Bionicles (a race of plastic space robots with which he was in love) and Derek Landy’s Skullduggery Pleasant.Michael Morpurgo’s War Horsewe met in our tiny studio flat in Verona, and also Robert Westall’s The Machine Gunners, one of my favourites ever, which Dad had sent to me from London in the years when he was there, and we were up the mountain, with a note –I thought this might be up your street.Although I knew The Machine Gunners well, reading aloud is different, more powerful. In moments of this and War HorseI struggled not to cry, fighting not to embarrass Robin and break the spell.With even the most gripping books I found I could change gear, after the appropriate while, from an entertaining rendition, designed to engage Robin, to a soporific monotone, to knock him out. One evening in Verona we began one of David Walliams’ books. The flat was a one-bedroom, and Robin slept on a sofa bed in the kitchen-diner. His mother, Rebecca, often curled up with him to listen, and often they both fell asleep.There is a time then that readers aloud know, when you raise your eyes from the page and look at some one or two you love most in the world, your now dreaming audience, and though you do not think it consciously, perhaps, the truth is that their gentle sleep is a gift you have helped, that night, to give them, and it feels an almost holy moment. When you read aloud to your partner or your child the room and the world beyond it seem to still, and the spirits gather to hear the story. Words uttered are more than words heard in the silence of the mind; they are things in the world, and the world responds. Sometimes, depending on where you live, in the hoot of an owl …Robin was six when I met him and about 12 the last time I read to him, so I knew something of what to expect and to try when Aubrey reached that stage. But I knew nothing about those first half-dozen years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it is also a love of parenting in the root meaning of the word, a bringing forth, of the listener’s attention, marvel, laughter and thought. Reading aloud is also a self-parenting, in the bringing forth of the voices, feeling and tones from the reader. And it is a team sport, as it were, while reading to yourself is all about individual skill.Not all children love to read. They absorb narrative through talk and games and films and their friends and their YouTubers and that is fine, I learned, despite my initial panic when neither Robin nor Aubrey showed any great love of print. They still loved stories, and they loved being read to.If he was tired, Aubrey would ask me to read Mum’s current Greek myth (Rebecca was teaching herself to be a Classics A-level teacher at the time) or switch to something “not exciting”. This was the cue to put down The Hobbitor whatever for whatever I was reading, and, I noticed, writing. The knock- out drop of his childhood proved to be my own Down to the Sea in Ships–I don’t think he has ever made it past the second page, and we have read it often – which was gratifying if not flattering. As he and his days grew longer, the knock-out was often all we had time for, though he excels at the well-timed question or thought, only partly designed to keep you talking and put off going to sleep.View image in fullscreenThe Gifts of Reading for the Next Generation, curated by Jennie Orchard.As is the way of memory, I expect Aubrey will recall more of these times, these nights, these books, as he grows older, if not perhaps as I remember them now, in great range and detail: he was only very young and going to sleep for most of them, after all. When we talked about this essay, I ran a few by him, to yesses, noes, and ums, until I said, “Philip Hoare’s whale! The Sea Inside!”“I rememberthat!”he cried, immediately.No wonder. The writer is hanging in fathomlessly deep water off the Azores and a sperm whale approaches. The whale sonar-scans the man with his clicks, and the two creatures hang there, the great beast and the little being, as Philip describes the way a whale can make a cannonball of sound, a weapon to stun a squid, and the two look at each other in a kind of whale’s peace. It is the most beautiful passage, and we read it night after night, hanging beside Philip and the whale in exactly the same place at last, in that wonder between life and sleep.This is an edited extract of an essay, The Gifts of Being Read To, by Horatio Clare.

With an entirely new cast, led by Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey, producers were not overly optimistic of its chances, given that Independence Day is not a traditional moviegoing holiday. Critical reaction has been mixed, withthe Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw being particularly enthusiastic with a four star rating, saying: “It feels relaxed and sure-footed in its Spielberg pastiche, its big dino-jeopardy moments and its deployment of thrills and laughs”.The film’s chances of profitability are also helped by the (relatively) restricted production budget, reported at $180m compared to the$845m spent on its two predecessors, Fallen Kingdom and Dominion.However, analysis shows that the film’s figures fall somewhat short of previous Jurassic World films. Rebirth earned $91.5m over the actual weekend (Friday to Sunday), considerably less than Fallen Kingdom ($148m) and Dominion ($145m) over their equivalent periods, while the first franchise rebootJurassic Worldtook $208m in 2015.Explore more on these topicsFilmJurassic WorldFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

You write a word on a piece of paper, then fold it over so the next person can’t see what you’ve written, and you end up with a strange sentence. The game is now known as Exquisite Corpse, after the result of their first go:Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau(The exquisite corpse will drink the new wine).Exquisite Corpse gave Breton so much joy because it summed up the essence of the surrealist school of art he was trying to articulate at the time. In his first 1924 manifesto, he told budding surrealists to put themselves in “as passive, or receptive, a state of mind” as they can and write quickly. Forget about talent, about subject, about perception or punctuation. Simply trust, he writes, “in the inexhaustible nature of the murmur”.View image in fullscreenReceptive state of mind … an invitation to Exquisite Corpse from 1927.Photograph: API/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesIn the year of its centenary, the spirit of Breton’s Exquisite Corpse is not just un-dead but frantically rattling the lid of its coffin from the inside. Several modern artists are continuing the surrealist tradition by composing with found materials (words, images, objects), drawn from the accidental debris of the everyday, to make the unexpected.I’ve found extremely beautiful haikus in sordid booksFor a recent show at Frith Street Gallery, the British artist Fiona Banner showed works made with discarded mannequin parts she’d found in an abandoned Topshop in north-west England. In a film, titled DISARM (Portrait), she has emblazoned words like “disarm” on arms, “obsolete” on soles, and “delegation” on legs. At first she thought of it as a concrete poem or a Breton-esque poème objet. Then she realised, she says, that “actually, it’s more liquid than concrete”.For Banner, the power of Exquisite Corpse, “its radical space”, lies not in the finished sentence but on that fold. “I think to not understand is a very important space,” she says. “To be free of human logic.”View image in fullscreenDiscarded mannequin parts from an abandoned Topshop … Fiona Banner’s DISARM.Photograph: Fiona BannerDimitri Rataud, a French actor turned artist, whose work is now on show at HIS Paris gallery, makes what he calls “haikus marinières”: surrealist-inspired concrete poems he finds by blacking out most of the words on a ripped-out page of a random book. The name itself is a word play: the pieces look like Breton tops AKA marinières because of the stripes. And the poems (et soudain … le bonheur– “and suddenly … happiness”) are as light as a feather on the breeze.The printed word, which he handles like a builder might a brick, is useful raw material. And each poem is but a moment. Rataud starts by tearing the cover off the book then opening it on the last page. He can never do the same thing twice. To his gallery’s dismay, he refuses to make copies.Rataud is popular on Instagram, and you can of course see why: Breton tops, French romance, Japanese minimalism. And yet, these found poems are luminous, in the way they balance on that paper-thin edge between accident and intention. “I’ve found extremely beautiful haikus in sordid books.”View image in fullscreenPopular on Instagram … Poème 10 of Haiku Marinière.Photograph: ©Haiku Marinière-2025For the Paris surrealists of the 1920s – crawling out of the wreckage of the first world war – nonsense was a deadly serious matter. When the Centre Pompidou’s exhibition,Surréalisme(a touring mega-show currently at the Hamburger Kunsthalle), opened in September 2024, co-curator Marie Sarré described the centennial movement as one of the most politically engaged of the avant gardes. “Throughout its history, the political and the poetic ran in parallel,” she said. “It wasn’t an artistic movement or a formalism, but a collective adventure and a philosophy.” Contrary to other avant garde movements which embraced the notion of progress, it questioned everything. The surrealists were among the first anticolonialists, the staunchest anti-fascists, proponents of social revolution and proto-eco warriors.“They asked the questions artists today are asking,” said Sarré.To wit, Malaysian-born artist Heman Chong, whose work is currently on show at the Singapore Art Museum. This survey exhibition is organised into nine categories: words, whispers, ghosts, journeys, futures, findings, infrastructures, surfaces and endings. One piece, “This pavilion is strictly for community bonding activities only”, reproduces a sign Chong found in a communal space within one of Singapore’s Housing and Development Board block of flats. “The sentence itself is nuts, right?” he says. “That you would insist on community bonding activities, which means, literally, you cannot be there alone, right? Because you can’t bond with anyone alone.”By contrast, he often makes installations with things people could secrete away – stacks of postcards; mountains of sentences from spy novels shredded on to the floor; a library of unread books. “I would love it if people just take things out of their own accord,” says Chong. “Coming from Singapore, which is an extremely paternalistic, authoritarian state, a lot of my work is not about telling people what they cannot do.”View image in fullscreenShredded sentences … Secrets and Lies (The Impossibility of Reconstitutions) by Heman Chong.Photograph: Heman Chong; Image courtesy of MGSR CollectionIn November 2024, South Africa-based Nhlanhla Mahlangu, who is a long-term collaborator of William Kentridge, gave a performance lecture titled Chant for Disinheriting Apartheid. It collates several spoken word compositions and improvised works, which delve into the brutal flattening of colonial oppression: language stolen, names mangled, bodies which have learned to recognise different guns by the sounds they make.In one section, he performs, one by one, various unrelated sentences in the languages of isiZulu, Sesotho, Xitsonga, Venda, Xhosa. And then, “the language of apartheid”. He stands stock still, in total silence, for two whole minutes.He recounts doing a workshop with children from Hillbrow, a part of inner Johannesburg beset by high crime and intense poverty. They were working on a performance of Aimé Césaire’s 1939 masterwork, Return to My Native Land – a gut punch of a poem against colonialism, which Breton called “the greatest lyrical monument of this time”. Mahlangu’s students, who were witnessing crime and death and abandonment on the way to class, said: “We experience surrealisms every day. We don’t understand why people go to universities and study it. Our lives are surreal.”“Surrealism offers ways to look awry at things,” says Patricia Allmer, an art historian at the Edinburgh College of Art. She recently co-curated The Traumatic Surreal at the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds. “Because you can’t encounter trauma head on, you have to find ways of seeing it, either as a distortion, through a distorting lens or from the side.” For Mahlangu, it is about “bringing fluidity to what seems stable, and understanding that stability can be a weakness. It’s constantly not answering the question, but questioning the answers, asking more questions.”In the 21st century, we may have grown wary of “isms” in art. In a climate of constant technological and economic interruption, the promise of a transformative cultural revolution can feel suspicious; the most powerful movement in modern art, contended a recent article inthe Art Newspaper, may be the art market itself. But it’s worth remembering that when Breton first wrote about his ideas in 1924, he didn’t think of it as a manifesto, just a preface to a book of poems he wanted to publish. And that’s why Exquisite Corpse sums up surrealism’s most lasting legacy to modern art today: a tool that taps you into something unexplored, a game for “pure young people who refuse to knuckle down”.Explore more on these topicsArt and designPoetryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How has this extreme practice been normalised?Anna MooreMon 7 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTShareNow that Lucy has been in a steady relationship for a year, she finds herself looking back at previous sexual encounters through a new lens. The slaps to her face. Hands round her neck. The multiple late-night messages from one partner – nine years older and, in her words, “a Tinder situation”: “Can I come over and rape you?”“I like to think I enjoyed my single 20s,” says Lucy, now 24. “I was an avid Hinge and Tinder user and I liked to think of myself as the ‘cool girl’. But I’ve been thinking about it so much – I’m not sure why. There was the friend of a friend who slapped me so hard in the middle of us having sex – no warning, just from nowhere. It actually made my teeth rattle. There was another guy I met at a bar. We got together that night and he started choking me so hard, I felt this sharp pressure, this pain I’d never experienced before. I was drunk but it sobered me up in one second. I still wonder what he did to me to cause that pain.”Never was “rough sex” discussed before, during or after. “Among my friends, there’s this competitiveness about not being boring, not being ‘vanilla’. I think it’s very prevalent for women my age, and no one wants to kink-shame anyone,” says Lucy (not her real name). “There’s a lot of talk about online porn and what that has done to men’s brains and expectations, but I also saw a lot of very violent porn when I was a teenager. I don’t know why or how I found it. The women in porn never push back or say, ‘Don’t do that’ when they’re choked. I think I became quite performative. I like to think I’m a strong woman but … I don’t know if it’s about male validation.”Growing concern around the normalisation of “choking” – ie strangulation – during sex has led to the recent announcement that pornography depicting it will be criminalised in an amendment to theCrimeand Policing Bill.Among my friends, there’s this competitiveness about not being boring, not being ‘vanilla’It has become so standard among young people that one recent council-funded sex education presentation for Welsh secondary schoolchildren included “safe” choking advice such as: “It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first …” and: “Consent should also happen every time sexual choking is an option, not just the first time.” When the presentation was made public, Fiona Mackenzie, the founder of campaigning group We Can’t Consent to This (WCCTT), was “absolutely furious but not at all surprised”.Mackenzie formed WCCTT at the end of 2018 in response to the growing number of women and girls killed or injured in violence claimed to be consensual. How has the landscape changed in the years since?“When we began, we were focusing on two aspects,” says Mackenzie. “The first was the men who were successfully using the ‘rough sex defence’ to murder women, claiming it was consensual and therefore getting away with it or getting ludicrously short sentences. The other part, which is the part I didn’t realise was an issue until a month or two in, was that so many young women were being strangled by their sexual partners.”Almost seven years on, there’s been progress on the first part. The Domestic Abuse Act of 2021 clarified that a person cannot consent to being harmed for the purpose of sexual gratification and also made non-fatal strangulation a specific criminal offence. Before that, it fell under general offences such as battery, the mildest assault possible. “The major win for us is that [when women are] subjected to a non-fatal or a fatal assault during sex, there will be a much better response from the criminal justice system,” says Mackenzie. “There have been several cases since where the men have been prosecuted and convicted for murder by juries and given long sentences.”On the second aspect, though – the normalisation of strangulation during sex – Mackenzie believes the situation has only worsened. “I’d hoped that lots of other charities and sex educators, the government and academics would get behind it, but instead what we’ve got is this completely mad idea that we can somehow help women to keep having violent sex but in a safer way. Maybe in a hi-vis jacket?”Most women in England and Wales have seen abusive male behaviour in past year, says pollRead moreHannah Bows, a professor of criminal law at Durham Law School, believes strangulation is one of a few crimes where public awareness has dramatically regressed. “I think it’s a really troubling sign that 50 years ago most people would probably know strangulation was an offence – just like we all know that stealing is illegal,” she says. “We’re nowhere near that now, especially among young people. There’s actually less acknowledgment and understanding, even though we have more laws criminalising it.”There’s good reason for these laws. Necks are alarmingly fragile. Blocking the jugular vein requires less pressure than opening a can of Coke.Evidence suggeststhat strangulation is now the second most common cause of stroke in women under 40. According toone piece of sobering research, it’s more dangerous than the torture known as waterboarding, because strangulation affects blood flow as well as airflow. Though some cases can cause loss of consciousness in seconds and death in minutes, in others consequences can be delayed by weeks. It can cause a change in voice, difficulty swallowing, incontinence, seizures, problems with memory, decision-making and concentration, depression, anxiety, miscarriage.In apaper publishedin May, 32 young women were recruited from a large midwestern university in the US and separated into two groups – those who’d been strangled at least four times during sex in the last 30 days and those with no history of strangulation. (There were 15 from the former group and 17 in the second.) Blood was taken from all recruits. The samples from the women who’d been strangled showed elevated levels of S100B, a marker of brain damage.“There’s no safe way to do it, no safe quantity of blood or oxygen you can cut off from her brain for fun,” says Jane Meyrick, a chartered health psychologist who leads work on sexual health at the University of the West of England. She describes being at a sexual health conference last year where data was presented on sexual strangulation – the prevalence and harms. “Usually, at those conferences, people will be talking about the extremes of what everyone is getting up to in a very sex-positive way,” she says. “When this was presented, you could feel the tension, the internal conflict, in the room, with professionals being unable to reconcile the gap between what they were hearing and their usual sex-positivity.”When it comes to prevalence, UK data is patchy. A survey by the Institute for Addressing Strangulation, established with Home Office funding in 2022, after strangulation became a standalone offence, found over a third of 16 to 34-year-olds had experienced this, compared with 16% of 35 to 54-year-olds and 3% of those 55 and above. “Larger academic studies of college students in the US and Australia put it at much higher,” says Meyrick.US researchfound that 64% of female college students had been choked during sex. In contrast, data on previous generations, collected between 2006 and 2015, found that most college students didn’t include choking when listing rough sexual behaviour (slapping, being pinned down or tied up were all cited) and, overall, choking/strangulation was reported as occurring infrequently. “It has become normalised practice among younger people and not viewed as problematic,” says Meyrick, “and most older people have no idea.”Necks are alarmingly fragile. Blocking the jugular vein requires less pressure than opening a can of CokeIn 2021, a research team led by Debby Herbenick, provost professor at the Indiana University School of Public Health, interviewed 24 women aged 18 to 33 in depth about their experiences of strangulation during sex. Although, for most, their first experience had involved no prior discussion – including one who was having sex for the first time – the majority now viewed it as “routine and regular”. All believed it was safe, despite experiencing many physical reactions, including coughing, gasping, difficulty swallowing and breathing and vision changes. Some said they accepted being choked for their partner’s pleasure, even though they didn’t personally find it arousing. Others did enjoy it and sought it out as “adventurous” and “exciting”.The paper notes that historically, autoerotic asphyxiation is rare among women and adds, “It is curious how sexual asphyxiation, which has long been described as predominantly engaged in by/for men’s arousal, has become so frequently enacted by men on women partners.”Bows makes the same point. “What’s not being talked about is that this is happening overwhelmingly to women by men. If you accept what people will argue – that this is an activity that’s enjoyed because it’s ‘sensual’ – then why aren’t men the recipients more often? To me, it’s just another way we’ve culturally legitimised men harming women.”Few doubt its origins. “It’s about porn and the mainstreaming of illegal and violent tropes in porn practices,” says Meyrick. It’s not just dedicated porn sites, she says. “It’s a click away on TikTok, it’s absolutely everywhere. I’ve had young people come to me in tears, young women saying, ‘I don’t want to be strangled’ and young men saying, ‘I don’t want to do it’ but both watch porn where it’s handed to them in an uncritical way and there’s an assumption that that’s what has to happen.”Much research shows the impact of porn consumption on sexual behaviour and beliefs.Another study by Herbenickthat looked at behaviours such as choking and spanking found that those who engaged in it viewed porn at a younger age and had a higher lifetime use than those who didn’t. The recent proposals to criminalise “choking” in porn follow the recommendations ofa reviewby Baroness Bertin, commissioned by the previous government and published in February. It noted that strangulation was “rife” online, with “competition for clicks” driving the production of increasingly disturbing content. According to the review, “Non-fatal strangulation or ‘choking’ sex is perhaps the starkest example of where online violent pornography has changed ‘offline behaviour’.”Labour to make taking intimate images without consent a criminal offenceRead moreWhen it comes to criminalisation, Clare McGlynn, a professor of law at Durham University, who worked on the proposals with Baroness Bertin, says the specifics will be key. “The provision must be comprehensive and cover all depictions of strangulation and not be based on non-consent,” she says. “If it requires proof of non-consent, or any other such qualifications … it will make no difference.”Mackenzie is not optimistic and points out that this is the third such “ban”, given that we already have theObscene Publications Act 1959and theCriminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008(which was introduced afterthe strangulation of Jane Longhurstand supposedly criminalised the possession of “extreme pornography”). “The problem has always been that not one of the millions of people employed by the state will feel it is their job to enforce such a ban,” says Mackenzie. “If it wanted, the government could start tomorrow to make it uncommon for kids to see strangulation porn, building on existing law – but instead it will ban this content yet again, and hope that state bodies and tech companies will this time take account of the ‘vibe shift’. Not a single site will fear prosecution. They will have seen from decades of experience that no one from the state will knock on their door.”McGlynn says that previous legislation was problematic – the Obscene Publications Act covers “obscene” material, which, she says, is a “vague concept”. The 2008 legislation covers “life-threatening injury”, which will apply to some forms of strangulation but not all. “While there are serious harms and risks, such as stroke, they are not evident on the face of a depiction and not therefore within the existing law on extreme pornography.” However, she does agree that enforcement will be everything. “The platforms will only act if they think Ofcom will challenge them,” she says. “I hope this will be the case. It should be and I think it could be – but it might require considerable public and political pressure.”For Lucy, strangulation during sex has become something she hopes she’ll never return to, something she has almost “grown out” of. “I’ve been with my current boyfriend for over a year and at some point, we had a conversation where I asked, ‘Why don’t you choke me?’ He said he had no desire to. I asked if he watched porn and he said the kinkiest porn he’d watch would be massage. This might be too much information, but he’s the only man I’ve been with where I’ve had constant orgasms. With other men, the sex was always about them. Now it’s about us.”In the UK, call the nationaldomestic abuse helplineon 0808 2000 247, or visitWomen’s Aid.

And I’m sure my husband will love it if I mention the time he didn’t realise our brand-new camping stove had a removable plastic film around it. I can vividly remember the taste of plastic-infused penne to this day.View image in fullscreenSian’s daughter, Sylvie, was only too happy to help test camping chairs.Photograph: Sian Lewis/The Guardian“I’ve learned a lot since those camping calamities, and now own an army of trusty tents and stoves. I’ve used some of my top recommendations for years, such as Boutique Camping’sLuna bell tent(great for weddings), MSR’s toughHubba Hubba two-man tent, and Kelty’scosy Loveseat, which has a permanent spot in my garden.“I tested out new products in my friend’s field in Somerset. Firing up several stoves turned out to be a great way to end up with a mega barbecue feast once we’d finished. My assistant Sylvie (aged two) was keen to help me test tents and chairs, but was especially taken with the pint-sizedHelinox Chair One Mini, and was pleased to get her own bedroom in the palatialOutwell Montana 4 Air.”Princess and the Pea-style testingView image in fullscreenFairytale-inspired, scientific results.Photograph: Linda Geddes/The GuardianLinda, who tested thebest camping mattressesfor us, has earned her stripes as a camping and festival aficionado. “Age has brought wisdom, aching hips and a deepening intolerance for sleeping on anything that isn’t cloud adjacent,” she writes. “Happily, over the past 15 years, a quiet revolution has swept the world of camping mats. Enter the ‘air pad’ – a pillowy hybrid of the traditional airbed and self-inflating mat, boasting technical fabrics, insulated cores and price tags that could make you choke on your rehydrated noodles.“But how do you test comfort scientifically? I imagined the worst-case scenario: a rock-hard campsite with stray pebbles protruding in all the wrong places. To recreate this at home, I collected a selection of sharp stones from my garden and my neighbourhood’s finest pavements (you’re welcome, Bristol city council) and arranged them on our wooden dining room floor like some kind of domestic booby trap. I laid each mattress on top of them, and then, like the Princess and the Pea, rolled around in different positions to see if I could detect them.“Another of my tests recreated a ‘clumsy camper’ scenario: the inevitable moment when someone stumbles into the tent at 1am, tramples across the bed, and collapses – possibly wine-fuelled – on to their sleeping mat. I walked up and down each mattress in my bare feet, gently bounced on them five times, and then dropped myself from standing height on to each pad to see which ones burst, flattened and held their dignity. Remarkably, most survived.“While you can spend hundreds on a whisper-light camping mattress (like my top pick, theTherm-a-Rest NeoLoft), there are also great budget options if you’re willing to sacrifice a tiny bit of comfort: they still put old-school airbeds to shame. My top budget pick wasDecathlon’s £44.99 Simond mattress.”Linda also tested thebest cool boxes.“These, too, have come a long way since the flimsy, hollow-chambered buckets of yore,” she writes. “Possibly inspired by the American-born Yeti brand, today’s high-end models promise rugged durability and ice retention that borders on witchcraft. Though theYeti modelI tested lacked the integrated ports to padlock it and make it fully bear-proof, it still felt like it could survive a nuclear winter (andendless summers). But at £400, it’s not for the faint of wallet.“Happily, I discovered plenty of more budget-friendly heroes too. The £30Campingaz Icetime Plusexceeded expectations with its insulation, while the £25Quechua backpack coolerkept its contents chilled for almost a full weekend, despite a modest claim of seven-hour cooling. Both made our battered, 14-year-old bucket look like a bad joke.“The ultimate winner? TheColeman Pro cooler box, which can be picked up for about £130. As for the mattresses, I doubt if even today’s high-end camping mattresses could survive a grizzly attack. Or a toddler brandishing a marshmallow stick.”This week’s picksThe ultimate holiday capsule wardrobe: Jess Cartner-Morley’s 11 suitcase essentialsThe best mattresses in 2025: sleep better with our seven rigorously tested picksPanda Hybrid Bamboo mattress review: a stylish, supportive hybrid that keeps cool on balmy nights‘True to the traditional British banger’: the best supermarket sausages, tasted and ratedEditor’s pickView image in fullscreenOne man went to mow, went to mow what was left by the builders.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianReviewer Andy Shaw may not have been thrilled when recent building work left his lawn a complete mess – but, with its patches of longer grass and bare earth, it made for the ideal lawnmower testing zone.

You can assemble all the components for these lovely, fresh lettuce wraps while the chicken poaches in an aromatic broth, and either make up the cups yourself or put all the components down on the table for everyone to help themselves. This was a hit with my three-year-old daughter, and it even encouraged the one-year-old to try lettuce for the first time.Lettuce wraps with aromatic lemongrass chicken and peanut sauceDon’t throw away the aromatic broth: strain it and refrigerate for two days or freeze for up to six months. Use it in soups.Prep20 minCook20 minServes23 slices fresh ginger10coriander stalks1 lemongrass stick, bashed1tsp fine sea saltZest of ½ lime, peeled into strips2chicken breasts, quarteredFor the peanut sauce60gsmooth peanut butter20ml lime juiceZest of ½ lime20ml soy sauce½tsp flaky sea salt1 small garlic clove, peeled and finely grated1tsp dark soft brown sugarTo serve2small little gem lettuces, leaves separated1 carrot, grated10g coriander leaves1 large red chilli, finely sliced, seeds and all2 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced30g salted peanuts, roughly choppedPut a litre of water in a medium-sized saucepan, bring to a boil, then add the aromatics and chicken pieces. Bring back to a boil, then turn down the heat so the surface barely breaks a bubble, and leave the chicken to poach for 15-20 minutes, until cooked through (test a piece by slicing it open). Lift out all the chicken from the broth and set aside.Meanwhile, make the peanut sauce. Vigorously whisk all the ingredients and 20ml cold water, or pulse them in a high-speed blender, until the mix is the texture of thick double cream – you may need a little more water, depending on how thick the peanut butter is. Taste and adjust the salt as needed.Shred the chicken, then arrange the lettuce cups on two large plates. Divide the grated carrot and chicken evenly between the lettuce cups, then drizzle each one generously with peanut sauce. Top with the coriander, chilli, spring onions and peanuts, roll up and eat immediately, with plenty of napkins. Alternatively, put everything on a platter and make up the lettuce cups as you go.Explore more on these topicsSummer food and drinkQuick and easyChickenFoodMeatVegetablesPicnicsrecipesShareReuse this content"

I love making pesto on such evenings, and not just the classic basil-and-pine-nut situation. Jazzing things up with braised greens or a red pesto made from lots of jarred goods are just two directions in which I like to take things for a big hit of flavour. Both of today’s pestos freeze well, too.Smoky pepper and chilli pesto pasta with ricotta (pictured top)An almost no-cook sauce of smoked harissa whizzed up with jarred peppers, almonds and parmesan, tossed through rigatoni and topped with a dollop of lemony ricotta.Prep5 minCook20 minServes4Salt and black pepper400g rigatoni90g flaked almonds350g jarred roasted peppers80g sun-dried tomatoes1garlic clove, peeled1 heaped tbsp smoked harissa paste15g basil90g pecorino romanoOlive oil250g ricottaJuice and finely grated zest of½ lemonBring a large pan of salted water to a boil, then add the pasta and cook according to packet instructions, until al dente.Meanwhile, toast the almonds in a dry frying pan on a medium heat for three minutes, or until lightly golden, then tip into a bowl and leave to cool to room temperature.Tip 70g of the almonds into the bowl of a food processor, add the peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, harissa and basil, then grate in 70g of the pecorino and whizz to a paste.

There was no notice, no option to appeal and, from my understanding, no just cause. He had built up two successful businesses in clothing designand musicevents.Six days before the ban, he had sold 1,500 tickets for an electronic dance event in London. Instagram, rather than a website, is the platform for his work. However, he was suddenly informed that his content did not abide by Meta’s community guidelines on violence and incitement.His business account, which had 5,700 followers, and his personal account, withalmost 4,000 contacts, were deleted. These represent his entire social and professional network, as he has no alternative contact book. He has not been allowed to retrieve this data.The IP addresses onhis deviceshave been banned, so he can’t opennew accounts.I have been following his work, and have not seen anything violent, save for toy weapons in one promo video. This man’s life has been damaged by what appears to be an algorithm.RP, LondonThe essential role of social media platforms in young people’s social and professional lives is baffling to older generations used to websites and contact books.When I contacted 21-year-old RM, he told me fellow students had also lost burgeoning businesses when their accounts were summarily closed by Meta for breaching unspecified rules.“For my generation, an Instagram profile can be not only a sole source of income but an identity, and the severance of mine has been difficult to recover from,” he says. “I received no warning that I was violating any guidelines, and this decision has cost me thousands of pounds in lost sales, which, as I come from an inner city, single-parent household, is catastrophic.”RM vehemently denies posting content that could count as violence or incitement. I’m unable to see for myself, since the accounts have been deleted.Instead, I read an interview with RM on a music website that gives a hint of the cyberpunk rave scene in which he works. It seems the names of some bands and songs could, indeed, get an algorithm exercised.The words drugs, sex and kill are prevalent, as they are across some music genres. We will never know what specific line, or footage, led to RM’s defenestration because Meta refused to tell RM or me, citing “confidentiality”.It also refused to comment on the record, but a press officer did call to tell me that, because of “breaches” of its guidelines, it will not be reinstating the accounts, or letting RM retrieve his contacts. There is no right of appeal.Meta, as a commercial company, can choose who its customers are, and has a duty to remove harmful content, but its role as judge, jury and executioner is troubling given the impact of its decisions.RM could make asubject access requestto Meta to see the information held about him. That won’t reinstate the accounts but may enable him to understand his “offence”. If Meta refuses to comply, he can complain to theInformation Commissioner’s Office.He has bought a laptop to open new accounts and start rebuilding. I advise him (and everyone else) to back up his contacts and not rely solely on an unaccountable company for all of his administration.Meta is now being accused of mass bans by algorithm of Facebook and Instagram users, anda petitiondemanding human intervention on Change.org has garnered more than 25,000 signatures.Locked out of FacebookEMof West Sussex hit a digital brick wall after she was locked out of her Facebook account when a hacker gained access and changed the password, email address and phone number. She says Facebook’s automated system blithely sent instructions on how to restore access to the hacker’s email when she asked what she should do. The hacker later changed the account from private to public, revealing years of personal information.When EM asked Facebook to intervene, it permanently closed the new account she had set up. “It makes it impossible to get hold of anyone to speak to, by email, chat or phone,” she says. “The unexpected positive is that after feeling like my arms had been cut off, I am enjoying the absence of Facebook noise in my life!”Meta did not respond to requests for a comment.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsConsumer championsConsumer rightsInstagramFacebookSocial networkingMetaSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

There has beenKylie Jenner’s hyper-realistic lion headdress, Bella Hadid wearing a gold necklace resembling a pair of lungs and even a robot baby made up of electrical wires and crystals.On Monday as it opened couture fashion week in Paris, there was speculation that the instigator of its most recent buzz worthy moment – Lauren Sánchez – might be in attendance.Last month as she made her way to a prenuptial party with Jeff Bezos, the former TV journalist waspictured in an off-the-shoulder gownfeaturing a tightly corseted bodice covered in shimmering bugle beads. Before she had even disembarked the taxi boat, online fashion sleuths had identified the dress as Schiaparelli couture.View image in fullscreenLauren Sánchez wearing Schiaparelli in Venice for her three-day wedding to Jeff Bezos.Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/AFP/Getty ImagesFor those who wonder who actually buys couture, here came the answer floating down Venice’s Grand Canal.Backstage, Schiaparelli’s creative director, Daniel Roseberry, described Sánchez as a client. This means that rather than borrowing a look, as is often the case for celebrities, Sánchez paid for her dress. It is speculated to have cost $100,000 (£73,000), which is probably small change to the third richest couple in the world.“It was an amazing moment to dress a client in one of the most special moments of her life,” said Roseberry. “That is always special. She wore it because she wanted to. And as a client.”The brand did not share any images of Sánchez and when asked what that kind of exposure meant for the brand, Roseberry described it as “different”. “I was in Paris at the time so I didn’t really see it as widely but my friends in the US were messaging to say it’s all over the news and on CNN and things like that,” he said.Monday’s front row was peppered with a mixture of other high net worth clients – some even brought their own lighting assistants – and A-listers. The pop star Dua Lipa wore a white dress covered in fish-like shimmering scales while the rapper Cardi B was almost shrouded in beaded fringing.View image in fullscreenSchiaparelli’s creative director said this season’s couture inspiration came from photographs he found in the house’s archive taken in 1940.Photograph: SchiaparelliRoseberry described celebrity dressing as “mission critical” for the brand. “We have never paid someone to wear Schiaparelli which is something that I don’t think really any brand that’s functioning like this could say. And I think that’s what makes it more powerful.”The US designer, who has helmed the brand since 2019, said this season’s couture inspiration came from a series of photographs he found in the house’s archive that had been taken in Paris just before France was invaded by Germany in 1940. “There’s something about that era that felt mournful and also turbocharged at the same time.” His aim, he said, was to make the “archives feel futuristic in a way”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A red beaded necklace shaped like a heart featured a hidden mechanism to make it pulse while bodices were exaggerated with moulded breasts and erect nipples.These type of pieces often dominate the red carpet but Roseberry hinted he may be moving away from such virality.“I wanted it to feel like a bit of a farewell. We’re going to be restructuring everything after this,” he said. “I think if you want to change the result, you have to change the process, and I just want to keep pushing forward.

When the ferry docks at Lerwick, the kids, Lydia (11) and Alex (eight), are uncharacteristically silent as we take in the view: the town huddled on a low hill, the water shimmering in the morning sun, and islands as far as the eye can see.We are spending a week in the archipelago, travelling first around Mainland, the main island, and then north to the less populated islands of Yell and Unst, linked by regular ferries. It turns out to be the perfect location for a family holiday: short journey times (it takes 80 minutes to drive from the southern tip of Mainland to the northern) combined with the sea almost always being in view, and the excitement of a boat or ferry trip every day.View image in fullscreenNorthern gannets near their colony on Noss.Photograph: Biosphoto/AlamyOn Mainland, we base ourselves atHayhoull B&B. Mary, the owner, makes us feel like part of her family and cooks us delicious dinners that even my picky son doesn’t turn his nose up at. We wake to spectacular views of St Ninian’s Isle, before heading to Lerwick harbour to join a boat trip withShetland Seabird Tours. Skipper Phil tells us we’ll be sailing up to Noss island to see the gannet colony. Alex turns to me with wide eyes. “They dive like missiles!” he whispers excitedly.First, though, we see eider ducks, paddling just outside the harbour, and fulmars in cosy pairs on the cliffs. The latter, Phil tells us, “have a nasty defence mechanism against birds of prey – they vomit on them and ruin their flight feathers”. The kids are delighted and repulsed at the same time. Then there are sentry-like shags inside a cave, crowds of black guillemots and a solitary puffin bobbing on the waves, which sends a ripple of excitement around the boat.Gannets are shaping themselves into torpedoes, before plunging bullet-like into the deep. It is a phenomenal sightBut it is those gannets that steal the show. They appear as we approach the uninhabited, sheer-cliffed island of Noss, unmistakable with their pointed white beaks and yellow head feathers. As the birds (about 600–700 according to Phil’s estimate) circle and call above us, Phil submerges a long metal tube in the water; he throws a mackerel down it and within seconds the first gannets are folding their wings back and in and shaping themselves into bird torpedoes, before plunging bullet-like into the deep blue water. It is a phenomenal sight. The only word I hear out of either child for the next 15 minutes is “Wow!”In fact, if there’s a word that characterises our visit to Shetland, “wow” is it. AtJarlshof prehistoric and Norse settlement, where thousands of years of human habitation are revealed in the remains of countless buildings, the kids wander off happily with their audio guides, pointing things out to each other with glee; what I had anticipated being a 10-minute visit takes us an hour and a half.Just down the road isSumburgh Head lighthouse, where the season’s first puffins have recently arrived. We listen to a recreation of the sound of the lighthouse foghorn that is so loud the kids cover their ears, and climb up the foghorn tower to see the land drop away into the seemingly endless sea.View image in fullscreenSumburgh Head lighthouse.Photograph: Ian Dagnall/AlamyAnotherboat triptakes us out to the small, uninhabited island ofMousa, an RSPB nature reserve. A huge broch (an iron-age circular tower unique to Scotland) stands on its south-western shore; though it’s closed on our visit, we peer through the gate to look at the layered stone interior and imagine the people and animals that would once have lived there. We have three hours on Mousa, and spend them wandering the two-mile path around it at a leisurely pace, losing time watching seals play in East Pool and spotting nesting fulmars. “Stay away from them,” Alex tells us. “You don’t want to be sicked on.”Back on land, we walk the short distance from our B&B to St Ninian’s Isle, reached via the UK’s largest active tombolo (a sand bar). The kids immediately whip off their shoes to submerge their feet in the soft white sand; while they play, my husband and I walk across to the island. From the top, we have a clear view of both the kids and the skerries (small rocky islands and reefs) that pepper the isle’s south side.Just up the road isWest Lynnecroft (small farm), where the multitalented Cecil Tait shows us around and demonstrates the skills of his sheepdog, Bess, who is convinced that we need herding too. Tait, who also makes furniture and wool, and runs woodworking courses, tells us that all the while we’re talking he’s translating in his headfrom his native Shetland dialect into English. I watch the kids digest this. “Wow, Mum,” Alex says afterwards, “I didn’t know English wasn’t everyone’s main language here.”When the shout to ‘Get down!’ comes, we drop on our fronts and crawl. There in the water is the slick, dark curve of an otterThe next day, we head for Unst, the archipelago’s most northerly island. Getting there involves driving through Mainland and the neighbouring island of Yell, and two short ferry journeys (Mainland to Yell, and Yell to Unst), with the excitement building as we go. Most people come here for the birds and dramatic coastal scenery ofHermaness national nature reserve, on the northern tip of the island, but we decide against a three-and-a-half-hour walk battling the wind (and the children). Instead, we opt to head along the south coast with Catriona Waddington, the chair ofWild Skies Shetland, which has set up interactive “sky stops” to help visitors explore the island.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A listening post invites us to hear a Norse story or a fiddle tune that Catriona says “always makes people waltz”. The kids are soon doing exactly that. That night, they sleep – much to their excitement – in traditional alcove beds at the elegantBelmont House.En route back to Mainland, we pause in Yell for the afternoon, spending more than two hours wandering its gentle north-eastern shoreline on an otter-watching tour with Brydon Thomason ofShetland Nature. Armed with binoculars, the kids tramp happily for miles, stopping every time Brydon does, to join him in scanning the shore and water.View image in fullscreenEmma Gibbs’ children, Alex and Lydia, spotting otters.Photograph: Emma GibbsThere are no complaints about the cold or the distance; there is too much to learn about otters, such as how we have to walk downwind so they can’t smell us, and how to identify their toilets. Brydon has been otter–spotting since he was Alex’s age. “I was excited by the thrill of how hard they were to find,” he tells us. “It’s like being a detective in nature.”The kids are clearly happy being detectives, too. But when the shout to “Get down!” comes, they are more than ready, dropping straight on to their fronts as we follow Brydon’s instructions to crawl on to the beach. There, in the water, is the slick, dark curve of an otter.Brydon sets up his camera so the kids can take photos when the otter comes on to the shore. When she does, though, she is not alone; she is with her two cubs and is busy demolishing an octopus she has caught. We watch, through binoculars and Brydon’s camera, in a silence that is broken only by emphatic wows. “This is why I do it,” Brydon says with a smile. “For reactions like these.”In Shetland, it seems to me, they are the only reactions to have.The trip was provided byvisitscotland.comandshetland.org.

Pausing to consider what I really want to do has transformed my lifeNikki AllenMon 7 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 12.39 EDTShareIt was 6.18pm when the email pinged through. The lasagne smelled decidedly overcooked as I attempted to referee another squabble between my kids. The cat litter needed changing, and my cup of tea sat next to the microwave, stone cold and grey. Still, irresistibly, I was drawn to the screen. I read the subject line: “Quick favour this evening, if you have a sec?” Without thinking I started to reply: “Of course, no probl ...”I didn’t reach the end of the sentence. The hyper-sensitive smoke alarm started blaring. I grabbed a towel and swatted at the ceiling; by the time the house fell silent, I had forgotten about the email.The next morning – kids at school, cat litter changed, hot coffee in hand – I remembered, and read it again. The urgency had passed. This request had a deadline, and I had missed it. “Sorry I couldn’t help,” I typed, flushed with guilt. The reply? “Don’t worry – I knew it was last minute!” I breathed. I didn’t say yes – and the world kept turning.It was the start of a new habit: to stop saying yes on the spot. To pause and think about whether I really want to first. I’ve been conditioned to say yes without stopping to question it since I was a child. The echoes of my formative years reverberate in my brain: be kind, be agreeable, don’t be selfish.I have spent decades dismantling these unhelpful narratives and, more recently, as a therapist, helping others do that too. I have made progress. But this – the automatic yes – and with it the internal fight to turn down a request, to acknowledge when my plate is full, to give myself permission to say no … it felt like a hurdle that was too high to jump.The one change that worked: lonely and losing confidence, I was saved by an open-mic nightRead moreBut what if I don’t have to say no upfront – what if it’s enough to pause before I respond? That’s what I tried, and the results changed my life. Now, since that night a few years ago, whenever someone asks me to do something – a work enquiry, the PTA asking for help, a favour from a friend – I tell them: “Let me check and get back to you.”And then I leave it – for anything from 10 minutes to two days. It gives me space to pause and ask: do I want to do this? Do I have the capacity? Is this yes out of willingness, or guilt?It’s a simple habit, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. The reflex to help, fix or please is strong. There are moments I catch myself drafting a reply before I’ve even registered the question. But it’s like strengthening a muscle I’ve never worked out before: it gets easier with time, practice and repetition.Since I started pausing, I still say yes often. But in line with what I actually want, rather than what I think I should do. It’s not a loud change, but it’s one that’s giving me more time, energy and autonomy. And at the end of the day, those things are worth more than other people’s approval.The Hideawayby Nikki Allen is published by Pan Macmillan on 17 July,£9.99Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe one change that workedFamilyFriendshipSocial etiquettefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maybe you haven’t heard his catchphrases – “absolute creamer”, “muttonista”, or the still-in-development “creamerisimo”.If so, you’re missing out on a man who in the space of a yearhas created little short of a cult: an army of more than 160,000 social media fans, including celebrities, who cheer along online and in person as their leader – basically – reviews beer.Prime Mutton, whose real name is Jason Hackett, isn’t the typical social media star. He is not, with all due respect, a beautiful twentysomething posting videos that are brightly lit with nice colors and snappy edits.He’s a 55-year-old professional bridge player from Manchester, with a moustache, a leather pork pie hat, and a body that, he readily admits, reflects his enthusiasm for ale. The lighting in his videos is not up to professional standards, they are rife with background noise – he films the videos in bars – and his recent experiments with fonts and emojis have frequently been chaotic.But what Prime Mutton does have is a passion: a passion for pints.That devotion, coupled with his unvarnished persona and his “absolute creamer” catchphrase – uttered with relish when a beer meets his high standards – have been enough for him to succeed where so many Brits before him have not: he has cracked America.“I think people, when I publish my little videos and posts, it brings them quite a lot of happiness,” Prime Mutton told the Guardian on a recent Sunday in Brooklyn.“People, you know, wake up, they’re about to go to work, or they’re at work on their break, and it’s something that makes them happy – and it’s wholesome and authentic as well.”View image in fullscreenPaul Giamatti with Prime Mutton.Photograph: Adam Gabbatt/The GuardianPrime Mutton – “the brain in terms of knowledge of food and drink is prime; the body is mutton, in that I’m not exactly a honed, prime physical athletic specimen” – is on his first US tour, appearing in Boston, New York, Philadelphia and beyond. He has visited dozens of bars, drawing thousands of fans, many wearing T-shirts bearing his face or holding banners with the legend “absolute creamer”.The in-person appearances, which Prime Mutton announces in advance on his Instagram, follow the same formula as his videos. Prime Mutton appears on camera standing in a bar, holding a pint of beer. He greets the visiting “muttonistas” – a term he coined for fans, and one which they have eagerly embraced, before announcing where he is, and which beer he is going to review.Then the magic begins.Sommeliers and cicerones advise that the best way to taste wine or beer is to swish it in the glass, sniff, sip, and swill it around in your mouth to really assess the flavors. Prime Mutton does not do this. Instead, he raises his pint and takes a gigantic swig, a full four or five gulps, until two-thirds of the beer is consumed. After coming up for air, he takes a few moments before delivering his verdict.The gold standard, for Prime Mutton and his adherents, is that the beer is an “absolute creamer”. His delivery of the phrase, which he said he picked up on a visit to Ireland, sends crowds online and in person into ecstasy.The Guardian met Prime Mutton at a bar close to where he was due to make his first appearance of the day. The idea was to have a private chat before he addressed the muttonistas. But nowhere is private for Prime Mutton these days.As we talked, a man, in his 50s, balding, with a grey beard, spotted us through the window and began to wave, hopping up and down excitedly. The man was Paul Giamatti, Golden Globe and Emmy-winning, Oscar- and Bafta-nominated actor.From outside, Giamatti motioned for us to stay in place – the man really can act – and ran out of view. He quickly reappeared with his son and hustled into the bar. He was wearing a black polo shirt which said “Muttonista” above an image of Prime Mutton.Giamatti introduced himself as Paul. Rarely has a man looked happier. He asked if he could have a photo. “Of course,” said Prime Mutton – and one was taken. The two men chatted briefly before a beaming Giamatti left. I asked Prime Mutton if he knew who that was. He did not. I told him it was a famous actor.“See, that’s not my world,” Prime Mutton said, but he did add that Giamatti “seemed very nice”.Giamatti satiated, it was time for Prime Mutton to head to Hartley’s bar, where about 150 people had gathered in a pub designed to hold about 30 people. The majority of the crowd had to settle for a spot outside, some spilling over into the road. Mutton was here to sample the Guinness, which he had been told was among the best the city has to offer.As we walked round the corner together, the crowd went wild. There was a primal roar, like people cheering a musician as they emerge at the Super Bowl. This was Mutton as a more conservatively dressed, somewhat heavier Kendrick Lamar – a rough and ready British interpretation of American celebrity.Inside, an area had been spaced out for Prime Mutton to taste the bar’s Guinness. A hush went over the crowd as he was presented with a pint. He raised it to his lips and paused, a showman teasing his audience. Then he drank, gulp after gulp, as he drained more than two-thirds of the beer.Prime Mutton set the glass down on the bar. He smacked his lips. Foam hung on his moustache. Tension hung in the air.The crowd was now completely silent. Their entire focus was on this man, wearing a pork pie hat and suspenders, a man about to make days or crush dreams. Hairs on the backs of necks were raised. Which way would Caesar Mutton’s thumb point?He paused, considering his decision.“That’s good. It’s very good actually,” Prime Mutton said, but there was more. “However, I can’t say it’s the best pint I’ve had in New York.”Hearts sank. His assessment wasn’t over, however.“But it’s still so good,” Prime Mutton said, “that I’m going to call it an absolute creamer.”View image in fullscreenPrime Mutton with fans.Photograph: Prime MuttonAn almighty cheer went up. People went wild. Men jumped up and down and hugged each other. High fives were exchanged between strangers. A woman nearly fell off a stool. The muttonistas, much like Prime Mutton’s thirst, had been sated.“He’s completely endearing, and sort of what I need in my heart right now, given the state of the world,” said Nick Lucchesi, as Prime Mutton polished off the rest of his pint.“I mean, look at him. He’s smiling and kind of quite Mancunian in all the best ways.”Lucchesi had already seen Mutton once on this tour, but came back for more, cycling across Brooklyn to lend his support.“He’s certainly a wonderful bloke. I just feel like: who doesn’t like a Guinness? And a nice guy dropping a catchphrase and talking about it? It makes you feel good,” he said.Others echoed the sentiment. And at a time when male influencers are frequently awful, it’s true that Mutton offers something different from the rest. He’s not ordering young men todunk their heads in iceat 3.50am. He’s not amisogynist, he’s notracist, he doesn’t belittle anyone, he’s basically … not a dickhead.He’s just a man, a man who likes drinking beer, who likes making his videos, and likes bringing people joy.At a time when a lot is wrong with society, when many of us have found ourselves searching for something real and grounded andnormal, who wouldn’t want to be a muttonista?This article was amended on 7 July 2025. A previous version said Paul Giamatti had been introduced to Prime Mutton by his son. It was actually Giamatti who introduced his son to Prime Mutton.Explore more on these topicsUS newsBeerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The world’s most fascinating number – revealed!It’s not what you expectUPDATE: Read the solutions hereAlex BellosMon 7 Jul 2025 02.10 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 12.05 EDTShareBefore we get to today’s puzzles, I’d like to introduce the most interesting number in the universe.108Readers of Asian heritage will nod with familiarity. The number has profound significance in Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Chinese culture. It’s the number of beads on a rosary, the number of sun salutations performed in a yoga ceremony, the number ofBuddhas to be carved on a walnutfor good luck, and the phone number of the Indian Emergency Ambulance service.Mathematically, 108 is also a superstar, a fact I only discovered recently in a new book by the former Principal Chief Engineer of Indian Railways, Shyam Sunder Gupta. For example:108 is 11x 22x 33, the product of the first three numbers raised to themselves.108 is the smallest number whose divisors when taken together contain every digit at least once. (The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54 and 108)108 is the largest known numbernsuch that 2ndoes not contain a 9.(2108= 324518553658426726783156020576256)108 is the internal angle (in degrees) of a regular pentagon108 is the number offree heptominoes(the Tetris-like shapes made from seven linked squares.)108 is the number of cards in a UNO deck.I’ve only scratched the surface. Gupta’s book,Exploring the Beauty of Fascinating Numbers,has ten pages of facts about 108, ending with the observation that ‘1’ stands for truth, ‘0’ for emptiness and ‘8’ is the infinity symbol rotated by 90 degrees. “Thus the sacred number 108 tells us that we are at once something, nothing and everything.” The only other numbers that Gupta devotes an entire chapter to are pi, 13, 666 and 153 (possibly the second most interesting number in the universe).It could be the case that the spiritual importance of 108 led Asian mathematicians to catalogue interesting properties about it. Or it could be that 108 really is a particularly interesting number – it is not too small, not too large, and highly divisible – which helped it gain spiritual importance in the first place. How nice that numerologists and number theorists have something to agree about for once!Today’s puzzles are about numbers with interesting properties.1. Brilliant billionsYou have ten cards. On each of the cards is one of the digits 0 to 9. When you arrange the cards in a line you get a number between 0123456789 and 9876543210.i) How many of these numbers are divisible by 2?ii) How many are divisible by 3?2. How low can you go?What is the smallest even number between 1000 and 9999 written with four different digits?3. All about meAn autobiographical number is one where the first digit describes how many 0s it has, the second digit describes how many 1s it has, and so on, so that the (n +1)th digit describes how manyn’s it has. For example, 1210 is an autobiographical number because it has 1 zero, 2 ones, 1 two and 0 threes.Find the only ten digit autobiographical number.I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solutions.UPDATE: Read the solutions here.PLEASE NO SPOILERS – instead tell me why you find 108 such a great number!Exploring the Beauty of Fascinating Numbersby Shyam Sunder Gupta is out now.I’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015.

Photographs by Polly BradenMon 7 Jul 2025 04.00 EDTShareOn the beach in Weston-super-Mare, on the south-west coast of England, there is a hint of a chilly breeze in the air but the sun is out and the clouds are faint, whispy streaks across a pleasantly blue canvas. A couple of fishing boats are tethered to the harbour wall and a lone man with a metal detector wanders slowly along the sand. A small shop selling ice-creams has a few takers, despite the nip in the air.Yet behind its low-key but welcoming seafront lies the evidence of a cloudier, more complex reality.“A lot of emphasis is put into the main seafront for things to look nice and for the roads to be fixed, and for everything to be up and working,” says 21-year-old Ceilidh, who has lived in Weston all her life. “But then you look around the estates and there are potholes everywhere, shop fronts are falling down and there’s mould in many of the houses.”Coastal towns and communitiesconsistently dominateUK government deprivation statistics, and young people who live in them face some of the country’s worst health outcomes and educational attainment levels, and are exposed to poorer mental health provision and transport infrastructure.Q&AWhat is the Against the tide series?ShowOver the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped back public services and transport systems that limit their life choices.For the next 12 months, accompanied by documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.New data from the University of Essex’sCentre for Coastal Communities,published by the Guardian today, suggest these factors are having a greater than average impact on their mental health. Self-reported mental distress – measured using a widely recognised scale – was three times greater in young people in some of the most deprived coastal communities than in their peers in comparable places inland.People are lumped into categories, told things like ‘oh, you’re a druggie’, or ‘you’ll never grow up to amount to anything’. We’re left to the sidelinesCeilidh“We don’t yet know why these young people are being left out but one reason might be that they are not demanding help in the way the older generation is, or if they are, they are not having their voices heard,” says Dr Emily Murray, director of the Centre for Coastal Communities.The Guardian is launching a year-long reporting series, Against the Tide, with those aged 16 to 25 at the forefront. For the past six months we have been travelling to port towns and seaside resorts around England to discover how younger people feel about the places they live and what changes would enable them to build the futures they want. We will continue our reporting over the next 12 months, talking to young people such as Ceilidh, living in coastal towns.View image in fullscreenSome young people report being embarrassed about living in Weston-super-MareGrowing up on a deprived council estate, as she did, carries a stigma that is hard to shake, says Ceilidh. “Most people who grew up on the Bourneville estate are lumped into categories, told things like ‘oh, you’re a druggie’, or ‘you’ll never grow up to amount to anything’,” she says. “We’re very much left to the sidelines, which then makes it quite a dangerous place to live, because people take on that opinion that everybody else has of them, and then they will run with it, and they’ll actually become that thing.”Penny and Archie, two 19-year-olds living in Southend-on-Sea on the east coast are trying to find somewhere to buy food on their lunch break from the local college. Although both work part-time in hospitality jobs, they feel despondent about building a future for themselves in the town.“At this point I don’t see much of a future for Southend,” says Penny. “All the shops are closing, crime is getting worse, there’s graffiti and litter everywhere, drugs. I work and live here and so I see it on a daily basis. I think it’s gone pretty downhill.”The only people who have jobs in my friend group only got them because they know peopleThomasArchie says he will leave when he has enough money and can go and get a job elsewhere. “I don’t plan on staying in Southend for ever. It’s definitely easy to go down a bad path. When I was younger there were loads of things like youth programmes and places you can go where there were games and things to do, good places for young kids to go to kill time. Now, you don’t see these things any more.”Stefania Fiorentino, one of the authors of a report on“left-behind” coastal placesfrom the University of Cambridge’s department of land economy and the Bartlett school of planning at University College London (UCL), says their research found young people were often disproportionately adversely affected by the lack of investment in their towns and communities.View image in fullscreenLisa February says Grimsby where she lives can feel quite isolated.Photograph: Courtesy of Lisa“In many places there are no coastal economies any more. This is fuelling the out-migration of young people who have the skills, resources or qualifications to leave and leaving the more fragile behind.”UCL researchersrecently travelled around England’s coastlineinterviewing dozens of policymakers and practitioners about the issues where they live and work. They concluded the problems that came up were almost universally influenced by geographic isolation.Lisa February, 25, says it’s a common feeling where she lives. “A lot of people see Grimsby as the end of the line, quite literally, as the train line ends here and there’s no passing traffic, so it can feel quite isolated. It has one of the busiest ports in the country, but I don’t feel particularly connected to that.”Nineteen-year-old Taylor lives on a Weston-super-Mare estate that is, in his own words, “literally just housing”, with little public transport in and out of the town centre. His nearest bus stop is a 20-minute walk along a main road, before his hour’s journey to college each day. “It’s a first-world problem I know,” he jokes. “But it can make you feel quite isolated.”The lack of long-term employment opportunities is a common complaint. In Harwich, Thomas, 17, Bradley, 24, and Callum, 19, are all desperate to work. “I just want a job and to make money, I’d do anything,” says Callum.View image in fullscreenTaylor, 19, is studying art and design in Weston-super-MareThey all have GCSEs, and Thomas is at college studying public services, while Bradley has been to two colleges and done a number of courses.“The only people who have jobs in my friend group only got them because they know people,” says Thomas. “Mostly that’s working in a restaurant or a bar. My cousin used to work for a big supermarket and she started when she was 17. Now big corporations don’t seem to hire younger people any more and I don’t know why.”Much of the support available for young people comes from the voluntary sectors. Where this is combined with a forward-thinking council that joins up with these services to offer early interventions on crime prevention, or dedicated physical and mental health support, the results are evident.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

O’Connor, unperturbed by the sudden onset of drizzle, is enthusiastically darting between teenagers, helping them dig.He was brought in by North Somerset council because of his approach, a model called “child first”, which he previously used successfully with young people in Swindon.He explains: “We spend very little or no time thinking about the behaviour [young people] were involved in and think more in terms of how their identity has allowed them to behave in the way they have, and what do we need to do through relationships to shift that identity?”Activities such as tree planting, he says, provide interactions and roles for identity development and encourage a sense of achievement, helping the young person and the community.View image in fullscreenTaylor’s passion for photography was encouraged by a ‘brilliant’ youth worker“Some of our most vulnerable children have experienced repeated exposures to trauma and they simply haven’t had those experiences at school, of, say being in that school play, or being praised for the work they’re doing in school,” he says. “So we’re trying to find the opportunity through targeted interventions that provide multiple experiences of love, nurture, care … interactions of worth and value.”He says he has often witnessed a “sense of embarrassment” from young people in Weston about where they live.“There’s some really great opportunities for children and young people if we can just start to turn the dial on how they think,” he says. “When we change that narrative and be proud of place, you can really change communities.”Taylor has been helped by a “brilliant” youth worker who has encouraged his passion for photography. He lives with high levels of anxiety, in part due to a past difficult experience. “The photography has been brilliant,” he says. “I’ve always loved it but one day I went down to the local bike races and rented out a lens from college, and perched up on some dunes and got some photos. It felt like so much fun.”Those photos have since made up part of Taylor’s coursework – he is studying art and design and has been offered a university place – and featured in an exhibition. “I also like street photography because I can just put some music on, walk around wherever and try and take some cool shots.”The UCL researchers who spoke to local policymakers said their strongest recommendations included providing year-round leisure and entertainment facilities for young people, the need for youth centres, proper funding for services and for young people to be involved in decision-making. “I think letting people make decisions is massive, it’s so important in our town,” says one interviewee.View image in fullscreenFiona Matthews, creative director at the charity Super Culture, says ‘uplifting and creative experiences’ are an important part of improving mental healthIn Weston, Fiona Matthews, the creative director of an arts charity calledSuper Culture, believes “uplifiting and creative experiences” are a crucial part of the path to better mental health in seaside towns. “It’s also all about partnership with communities, services and organisations. Between us, we can create a scaffold for a place and its people that is based on listening and connecting.”‘Dare to believe’: young writers on their dreams of the seaRead moreIn Grimsby, February co-founded lowercase theatre, working with aspiring artists across north-east Lincolnshire. “Growing up I was always told to get out of Grimsby. I was really fortunate that when I was about 14 I joined a youth theatre that gave me mentors and through their help, opportunities to stay here. I didn’t know these things existed until I went to the theatre and met them.”For Ceilidh, who has been involved with Super Culture since she was a toddler, the chance to change where she lives is real. She has helped children in schools who struggle with mainstream education, as well as working on drama and circus skills with local Gypsy and refugee communities. She also recently gave a speech to board members of a local group outlining what she believes needs to be done to continue making Weston a better place. She is, she says, extremely hopeful about the years ahead. “That’s because I know that I’m making steps towards making my town a much better place than the place I grew up in. I always said, growing up, that I wanted to be part of that transformation, and perhaps that’s something a lot of people say. But I am proud that I went out there and have actually become part of that change.”View image in fullscreenCeilidh says she is extremely hopeful about the years aheadShare your experiencesYou can share your experiences of living in a coastal town using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Anne Reid wants to get one thing straight from the off. Sheadoresworking with the directorDominic Dromgoole. “He treats actors like grownups. Some directors feel as if they’ve got to play games and teach you how to act. But a conductor doesn’t teach a viola player how to play the blooming instrument, does he?” She talks about directors who get actors to throw bean bags at each other and go round the room making them recite each other’s names. “Blimey! I want to be an adult. I think I’ve earned it now.” She pauses. Reid has always been a master of the timely pause. “You can’t get more adult than me and be alive really, can you, darling?”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Reid turned 90 in May. She celebrated by going on a national tour with Daisy Goodwin’s new play, By Royal Appointment. I catch up with the show at Cheltenham’s Everyman theatre. She’s already done Bath. Then there’s Malvern, Southampton, Richmond, Guildford and Salford. I feel knackered just thinking about it, I say. She gives me a look. “Oh, they send me in cars. I don’t have totoilmuch!”Yesterday she did a double shift – matinee and evening show. Reid is magnificent as the queen in this witty, moving drama, directed by Dromgoole. The play documents Elizabeth II’s years on the throne via relationships with her dress designer, milliner and, most poignantly, her dresser. We witness the major events of her reign backstage as her team prepares appropriate outfits for them. Reid’s queen is fabulously multifaceted – funny and mischievous, loyal and dutiful, devastated and disappointed, nostalgic and lustful. There are myriad lines to learn and she’s on stage virtually the whole two hours. When Reid emerged for the evening performance’s encore, she looked as if she could have happily popped out a third show of the day.View image in fullscreenAnne Reid as the queen in By Royal Appointment, with (from left) James Wilby, Caroline Quentin and James Dreyfus.Photograph: Nobby ClarkShe tells me she’s delighted with the part, not least because it’s so different from the roles she played earlier in her career. Back then she tended to be cast as working-class mothers tethered to the kitchen or women working in aprons (Victoria Wood’s canteen comedy Dinnerladies, the cook in the revival of Upstairs Downstairs). “I’ve always been below-stairs, and you can’t get more upstairs than the queen!”The weird thing is, she says, she grew up in a middle-class family and was privately educated. Her grandfather, father and all three brothers were journalists. Reid’s dad was a foreign correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, and she discovered in 2015 (when participating in the genealogy TV show Who Do You Think You Are?) that he also had a sideline spying for the British in the second world war. Her brother Colin was a columnist for the Daily Mail, and her husband Peter Eckersley worked for the Guardian before becoming head of drama at Granada, which is where they met.Did she ever fancy a career in journalism? “No, I wanted to be a ballet dancer. My dad wanted me to be a performer because my grandma was some sort of small-time performer. I had a letter from him in the war saying, ‘I want you to drink milk when Mummy gives it to you because that will make you strong, but most of all I want you to learn elocution and to sing and dance.’” She was sent to boarding school in Wales, dutifully took the elocution lessons and lost her geordie accent, and her teacher told her parents that Anne was a born actor. She went to Rada and was the only girl in her year to win a prize.For the past couple of decades, her parts have been more varied and challenging. Now she’s best known as the genteel Celia in the BBC’s comedy-drama Last Tango in Halifax; the family matriarch Muriel in Russell T Davies’s dystopian series Years and Years; the grande dame Lady Denham in the Jane Austen adaptation Sanditon; and the mousy May, who has a sizzling affair with her daughter’s boyfriend in the 2003 movie The Mother. All of them dream roles, beautifully played.View image in fullscreenAnne Reid as Valerie Barlow in Coronation Street, 1967.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockReid is a household face rather than name. When I tell friends I’m interviewing her, most look blank. Then I show them pictures of her best-known roles, and they say they love her.We meet in the boardroom at the Everyman. Reid is elegantly casual – shirt, slacks, a dash of lipstick. She can look a little sour and disapproving, then she smiles and her face lights up. It’s one of Reid’s great dramatic gifts, transforming her from dour curmudgeon to empathetic beauty (and vice versa) in a flicker.Your career has been amazing, I say. She gently rebukes me. “Well, ithasn’t, actually, darling!” Give me a chance, I say – I mean in recent years. “Yes, right! Well, in the beginning I don’t think casting directors rated me. A casting director said to me once, ‘Dear Anne, you always help us out when we’reabsolutelydesperate.’ Meaning they’d tried everyone else in the business and no one was available. On Desert Island Discs, Kirsty Young said to me, ‘Your career’s the wrong way round.’ I said to her, ‘I think it’s the right way round actually.’ Most people have success in their 20s and then it starts to fade away. Mine’s just got better and better and better.” In 2010, she was awarded an MBE, presented by the queen, upgraded to a CBE in King Charles’s 2025 new year honours list.Reid was actually famous in her 20s – again a household face rather than name, as Ken Barlow’s first wife, Valerie, in Coronation Street. She made her debut in 1961, and was electrocuted by hairdryer a decade later – still one of the iconic soap deaths. Reid says she was desperate to leave. “I said, ‘I have to go – I’m going mad.’” Was she bored? “Ohyeah! I was so frustrated. I didn’t get a laugh in nine years.”She thinks that being in Coronation Street pigeonholed her as northern and working class. Didn’t she tell casting directors that she was privately educated and more than capable of playing posh? “Honey, have you ever met a casting director? Once you’ve done Coronation Street, you’re working class. I do think that hangs about.” Even if she was married to the upwardly mobile teacher Ken Barlow? “Well, he’s pseudo-middle class!” she says dismissively. “God, I don’t know how he’s stayed in there so long. I would have gone totally bonkers.” I tell her William Roache is in his 65th year on the Street. She looks aghast. “It suits some people, but it doesn’t suit me. No! I would have been in the funny farm by now, darling.”View image in fullscreenReid and Peter Eckersley on their wedding day in Manchester, 1971.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesIt was on Coronation Street that she met Eckersley, who wrote many of the scripts. She adored him, and tells me how wise and witty he was. “My husband was the funniest man in the world. You know that thing Clive James said: ‘A sense of humour is just common sense dancing’? Wonderful saying! Pete had that pinned up on his office wall. Michael Parkinson said he was the funniest man he’d ever met, and so did Victoria Wood.”She married Eckersley in 1971, the year she left Coronation Street, and got pregnant soon after with their son Mark. But life didn’t work out as she had planned. First her mother became ill and then Eckersley was diagnosed with cancer. She became a full-time carer and mother. In 1981, Eckersley died. “He was ill for a very long time. It was a miracle that he survived that long. We were both 45. Terribly young when I think about it now. I can’t really talk about that much.” She looks upset. “Mark was nine.”How did she cope? “People deal with these things. You just get on. I wish I’d been the person I am now. I’m much wiser now. I was a fool when I was young.” In what way? Well, she says, Mark had a top education at boarding school, became head boy and went on to the University of Oxford, where he met his wife, but she’s still not sure she did the right thing in sending him away. “He’s lovely. He’s a film editor. And I’ve got two lovely grandsons. Family’s the most important thing in my life.”When Reid finally returned to work, she’d been away for 12 years, and it felt as if she had to start again with bit parts on TV and in repertory theatre. Wood gave her a break in Dinnerladies in the late 1990s. By now Reid was in her 60s, and this is when she thinks her career really began. She’d never done comedy before except at Rada. “The relief of working with people like Vic was so lovely. Yeah! Yeah, sad!” And I can see her travelling back to the days working withWood, the comic genius who died aged 62 in 2016. “Sad that she’s gone. She could never have imagined that she would die before me. Vic was a huge talent. Absolutelyhuge!”View image in fullscreenAnne Reid (right) and Victoria Wood in a scene from Wood’s BBC series in 1989.Photograph: Radio Times/Getty ImagesIt was The Mother that transformed Reid’s career as a serious actor. In an early interview, she said she’d love to be cast in a role where she had to come out of the sea in a bikini and be made love to by James Bond. Here she got her chance, with Daniel Craig, 33 years her junior (and not yet cast as Bond). Reid played the part with such tender yearning and uninhibited passion. The film, directed by Roger Michell and written byHanif Kureishi, was groundbreaking. Beforehand, we only seemed to see older women with noticeably younger men if it was played for laughs or weirdness (Harold and Maude) or they were famous beauties (Anne Bancroft in The Graduate, and even then she was only six years older than Dustin Hoffman).“The Mother changed my life,” she says. Did she realise how radical the part was? “Not really, no. Roger used to say, ‘It’s a film about this old granny.’ I was only 68!”You were a baby, I say. “Of course I was, but it’s because he was only 40 or something. He said ‘We can’t cast Julie Christie because everyone wants to fuck Julie Christie!’, the implication being that no one in their right mind would want to fuck me.”View image in fullscreen‘I want to be an adult. I think I’ve earned it now.’Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianThat’s outrageous! “I know! Iknow. He said, ‘I wanted to cast somebody you wouldn’t notice if you passed them in Tesco.’ Thanks a lot! You can see why I don’t feel I’ve been valued, can’t you!” She smiles.I tell her I think it was a brave film. “Yeah, but I think they wanted to shock people. I mean all that business about leaning down and giving a …” She stops herself for once. Blowjob, I suggest. “Yes! And the actual sex was very unromantic. I thought all that was rather ugly, personally. I don’t think it was necessary.Nooooo! But young men want to shock the public. And Hanif, who I love dearly, certainly does. I do think it could have been more about the emotion than the shocking thing. I found some of it disappointing. I haven’t watched it for years.” It’s really good, I say. “Well I did win the Film Critics’ best actress award. That was really important.” Then she changes her mind. “Oh, it doesn’t matter! Who remembers, darling?”At the time, she said it was important to show that sexual desire doesn’t simply disappear in older people. “I don’t think it does, really,” she says. What about now, 22 years on? “Oh, now would be ridiculous, darling, but there you go! No, I don’t really think about it.” But what she does think about is desire in general – to push herself, to have fun, to make the most of her life. Reid says it drives her nuts when people in their 60s tell her their best days are behind them. “A dear friend said it to me yesterday: ‘Oh, I’m 62 now – I might never do another play.’ Then a taxi driver – I live in black cabs – said, ‘It’s all over now.’ He was in his early 60s, and you thinkMy God! Well, if you don’t need those years, give them to me becauseIcould do with them. So many of the most wonderful things in my life have happened since I was 68! I hadn’t done cabaret then. I’d not done Last Tango in Halifax. Travelling – I’ve been all over the place. I can’t bear negativity! Ican’t bearit, and I get so angry with people who give up.”Now she’s on a roll. “I’m a real optimist. Ialwayssee the best side of things. My father-in-law was the most divine man, an English teacher, and he said happiness is not something you find – it’s something you take with you. Some people will always be miserable, and some people will always find the upside and be happy.”View image in fullscreenAnne Reid and Daniel Craig in The Mother in 2003.Photograph: BBC Films/AllstarReid never remarried after Eckersley died. Have there been partners? “Ah well, that’s for me to tell you.” Go on, then. “No, no, I don’t talk about my private life.” Is there anybody in her life at the moment? “Nononononono! Not for a good long time. I don’t like living with anybody. I’m very happy on my own. I just prefer to be on my own. I can get up at two in the morning and play the piano if I feel like it. Yeah. I’ve got wonderful friends, and I like to get up and do what I want to do. If I want to go to New York today and I’ve got the money I’ll go, I don’t have to ask anybody or say, ‘D’you want to come with me?’” She pauses. “I used to think it might be quite nice to be American, but I don’t now!” She cackles, and doesn’t even mention his name. “God! What a nutcase!”She says she’s having a riot touring the play. Every night she and her co-stars Caroline Quentin and James Dreyfus stay up late at night shooting the breeze. Sometimes they are joined by Dromgoole’s daughter Grainne, who is also in the play. “Dominic worries about us. He thinks I’m too wild. He’s always saying, ‘Go to bed!Go to bed!’ because he worries that I live the life too much! But blow that! That’s half the fun.”As for the future, she’s hoping to take the play to New York, is writing a cabaret that she plans to perform later in the year, and wants to finally get on with her memoir. There’s obviously no point in talking about retirement, I say on the way out. She laughs at the idea. Then, with the sweetest voice, she gives me a warning: “If you write anything horrible about me, darling, I’ll come round and put a bomb through your letterbox and blow your house up.”Perhaps we should reconvene in 10 years’ time if we’re still about, I suggest. “You don’t know! I might be.” And she heads off, singing: “I’m gonna live for ever, I’m gonna learn how to fly!”By Royal Appointment is at theMayflower theatre, Southampton,9-12 July;Richmond theatre, London, 22-26 July; theYvonne Arnaud theatre, Guildford, 29 July-2 August; and theLowry, Salford, 5-9 AugustExplore more on these topicsAnne ReidThe G2 interviewTheatreDominic DromgooleDaniel CraigHanif KureishiinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Twenty years ago, as the chair of Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health, I was suddenly summoned by the then Labour minister, Rosie Winterton, to be told that the commission was to be abolished. It had only just been set up 2003 in the wake of anger about its abolition of the successful Community Health Councils in that year.The disillusionment of thousands of patients and service users who gave their time and effort to the new system was palpable, so much so that few felt able to participate in the subsequent ill-fated LINks community engagement system, which never got off the ground.It was left to the Conservative government to address the absence of users’ voices in health and social care. In 2013, it set up Healthwatch England, which gradually went about overcoming well-founded cynicism, building its independent, local, community-based networks in every English local authority.The Healthwatch network has involved many thousands of people to bring the experience of service users to bear, using genuine local knowledge, fuelled by an enduring belief in the principles of a qualityNHSand social care system free at the point of use.Abolition will again alienate many of those knowledgeably critical friends whose supportLabourmight have expected to attract and who will now express their views in other ways.Sharon GrantOutgoing chair, Healthwatch HaringeyExplore more on these topicsNHSHealthHealth policyPublic services policyLabourlettersShareReuse this content"

But the government won’t admit it, 30 June). But it’s not as simple as demanding more price cuts, which could end up falling even harder on the very low-wage workers and farmers struggling to survive, rather than the big food profiteers she is calling out.Williams points to Hungary as an example, where there is alsoan additional levyon production and sales of unhealthy food and drink, with the money raised supporting nurses’ wages and public health interventions. Similar models could be deployed in the UK to get big food companies to change their recipes while subsidising fruit and vegetable access via school meals, early years feeding support or community initiatives. Let’s hope the forthcomingfood strategywill adopt some of these more ambitious solutions.Barbara CrowtherManager, Children’s Food Campaign,SustainZoe Williams’ analysis of the links between obesity and big food is spot on. Another turn in the screw I’ve experienced is that, at least in the case of the two excellent local food banks where I have volunteered, a large proportion of the food distributed – pasta, bottled sauces, biscuits and cakes, white bread – comes from big supermarket chains. Many service users tended to shun healthier choices. I suspected this was through lack of the surplus hope, energy and curiosity required to shift from habitual eating patterns and addictions. As, with far less excuse, I find it hard to limit my intake of chocolate and wine.Eithne DodwellBradfordHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Plus a letter fromMichael E CorbyMon 7 Jul 2025 12.24 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 12.47 EDTShareRegarding Dr Helen Salisbury’s article (As an NHS GP, I can now prescribe weight-loss jabs – but a quick fix for obesity is not what we need, 26 June), I had a body mass index of almost 50 before starting on Mounjaro privately, even though I ate well and exercised more frequently than many of my peers. I could also have written several books on nutrition. I’d not got to that size as some bimbling idiot eating continually, but did have a binge-eating disorder linked to episodes of poor mental health that no medical professional was interested in discussing until I’d lost some weight.Healthcare for people suffering with obesity in the UK is abysmal. You cannot approach a GP about anything without it being linked to your weight and told that you just need to eat less and move more, yet we wonder why a significant number of people who are obese have malnutrition.At one point, I was advised by my GP to cut my daily calorie intake, 1,500, in half, leaving me trying to manage on 750 a day. Weight-loss drugs have changed my life as I feel in control for the first time ever, and I have slowly and appropriately lost three stone using them.Rebecca NottinghamGrimsby, LincolnshireI have had a private prescription for Mounjaro since March 2023 and have lost 43kg, 30% of my original weight, with my body mass index dropping from 42 to 29. I appreciate that, at a society level, more needs to be done to regulate junk food, but at a personal level, with a history of failed diets, this has been revolutionary for me. I have followed nutrition and exercise advice, and have been very lucky in experiencing no side-effects.I appreciate Dr Helen Salisbury’s point: it hasn’t changed my underlying approach to food, and to avoid regaining all the weight I will have to manage it very carefully when I reach my target weight and stop medication. However, I don’t think that there was any other feasible way to achieve that weight loss. Rather than avoid medication, as the article suggests, surely the priority must be the behaviour change and support in the next stage?Andy TaylorLondonFar from solving the obesity problem, drugs tend to make it worse, because those receiving them will tend to regard them as a substitute for healthy eating combined with exercise. Sugar was very severely rationed during the second world war and its aftermath, and “fast food” had not been invented. My village state primary school had two asphalted play areas, as well as a large field. My secondary school was even better equipped, and we were taken to the council’s local swimming baths (now closed) twice a week. These are benefits for life: I celebrated my 80th birthday by swimming 1,000 metres.What is needed is a campaign similar to the anti-smoking campaign coupled with the reinstitution of play and swimming areas. This will take time and money, but will be more than self-funding, as the health benefits will accrue almost straight away and savings for theNHSwill grow exponentially. Type 2 diabetes is an avoidable disease, but already has reached epidemic proportions, with heart problems and poor circulation leading to infections and often amputations. Doubtless there will be the usual outcry from self-styled “freedom” organisations funded by the food lobby. These, like the pro-smoking lobby, should be ignored.Michael E CorbyLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Administration officials said the men had been convicted of violent crimes in the US.“This was a win for the rule of law, safety and security of the American people,” Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement on Saturday announcing the men’s arrival in South Sudan.The supreme court cleared the way for the transfer of the men last Thursday.The men had been put on a flight in May bound for South Sudan but which was diverted to a base in Djibouti, where they were held in a converted shipping container. The flight was diverted after a federal judge found that the administration had violated his order by failing to allow the men a chance to challenge the removal.The supreme court’s conservative majority had ruled in June that immigration officials could quickly deport people to third countries. The majority halted an order that had allowed immigrants to challenge any removals to countries outside their homeland where they could be in danger.A flurry of court hearings on 4 July resulted in a temporary hold on the deportations while a judge evaluated a last-ditch appeal, before the judge decided he was powerless to halt their removals and that the person best positioned to rule on the request was a Boston judge whose rulings had led to the initial halt of the administration’s effort to begin deportations to South Sudan.By Friday evening, that judge had issued a brief ruling concluding that the supreme court had tied his hands.US authorities have reached agreements with other countries to house immigrants who cannot quickly be send back to their homelands.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationSouth SudanAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We don’t want an emperor – we are sovereign nations.”Later, during apress conferenceat theBrics summit in Rio de Janeiro, Lula was asked directly about Trump’s post in support of Bolsonaro. “Look, I’m not going to comment on this Trump and Bolsonaro thing,” he said. “I’ve got more important things to talk about than that.“This country has laws, this country has rules, and this country has an owner: the Brazilian people. So mind your own business and not ours,” he added.Bolsonaro is facing a range of criminal and electoral cases in Brazil.He is now barred from running for office until 2030 after making unfounded attacks on the country’s voting system, which disqualifies him from next year’s election.At the supreme court, in addition to the alleged coup attempt, Bolsonaro stands accused of allegedly selling jewellery intended for the presidency and forging a Covid vaccination certificate. The coup case, however, is the most advanced, with a ruling expected later this year.In his post, Trump wrote: “The only Trial that should be happening is a Trial by the Voters of Brazil – It’s called an Election. LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE!”The former Brazilian president had been seeking a more vocal show of support from Trump for months. One of his sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, took leave from his post as a congressman and has been living in the US since March,lobbying Trump and Republican politiciansto impose sanctions on Brazil – and particularly on the judge overseeing the cases against the former president, Justice Alexandre de Moraes.Eduardo praised Trump’s post and said it “would not be the only news coming from the United States in the near future”.In his post thanking Trump – which included a photo of the two standing side by side during their presidencies – Bolsonaro said he was the target of “a legal aberration (lawfare), a clear case of political persecution that is now obvious to anyone with common sense”.In Brazil, however, there isbroad consensus among legal expertsthat the coup case is legally sound and that a conviction is likely.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroDonald TrumpLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Romero was five months pregnant when a taskforce of army personnel raided the home where the couple lived with their one-year-old daughter. Romero was killed after she gave birth.After the 1976 coup, Argentina’s military set about crushing potential opposition and eventually 30,000 people were killed or disappeared, almost all of them civilians.Pregnant prisoners were kept alive until they gave birth and then murdered. At least 500 newborns were taken from their parents while in captivity and given to military couples to raise as their own.View image in fullscreenAdriana Metz, sister of the 140th identified grandchild, at a press conference with photos of her murdered parents.Photograph: EPAThe man, who has not been named, was reunited with his sister, Adriana Metz, who was just a year-and-a-half old when their parents were abducted. Metz, now a member of the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo’s executive committee, was raised by her grandparents and never stopped hoping that her brother might still be alive. Their grandmother died in 1992 without having met her grandson.During a press conference in Buenos Aires, Metz said that during her first conversation with her brother, she learned that he had been raised as an only child. She celebrated their reunion as the beginning of a new chapter for their family.“From here on out, everything is a gain for the Metz-Romero family,” she said.“Thank you to the Grandmothers for teaching us that this search is a collective one, and that we must continue on behalf of the 300 grandchildren who are still missing,” Metz said.“With the restitution of grandchild 140, we confirm once again that our grandchildren are among us – and that thanks to the perseverance and tireless work of 47 years of struggle, more will continue to appear. This fight cannot be carried out in solitude,” said Estela de Carlotto, 94, president of the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo.View image in fullscreenThousands attend a Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice rally in Buenos Aires’ Plaza de Mayo in March 2024 to commemorate the victims of the last military dictatorship.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAccording to the group, there are still hundreds of people aged between 45 and 49 years old who could be anywhere in the world and who have no idea they were kidnapped as children.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ll remove you,’” he says.The Guardian contacted Bolsonaro for comment but did not receive a response.In January 2023, Metuktirestood alongsideLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva as the leftist took office for a third term, having defeated Bolsonaro in the 2022 election.In the book, the chief recalls telling Lula that he could not “repeat the mistakes of the past”. He says Indigenous communities were “deceived” during Lula’s previous administration, particularly with the construction of theBelo Montehydroelectric dam on the Xingu River.Despite his criticism over the dam’s construction, the overall tone towards Lula is one of trust and cautious hope.The book, not yet scheduled for English translation, is the result of more than 80 hours of interviews given to Metuktire’s “grandchildren”, a term that includes biological descendants and younger members of the community who are not blood-related.The interviews were conducted and transcribed in the Indigenous language Mẽbêngôkre and translated into Portuguese with support from Fernando Niemeyer, an anthropologist who led the research for the book.Through this work, Niemeyer was able to determine Metuktire’s year of birth – until now only an estimate, as there were no official records – as 1937. The exact date, however, remains uncertain.The chief recalls moments including his tour across 13 countries in the late 1980salongside the rock star Stingto denounce the destruction of Brazil’s forests and raise funds for the demarcation of Indigenous lands.Metuktire remembers being at Sting’s home when they saw on the news that the environmentalist Chico Mendes had been murdered by ranchers illegally occupying protected land.“After lunch, Sting came over to me and said: ‘Let’s talk. Raoni, I’m worried about you. They’ve just killed Chico Mendes because he was fighting for the forest. Find people you trust to manage this money, and take care of yourself in this struggle,’” the chief says.The narrative does not follow a linear chronology. Instead, the book weaves together personal accounts, myths, dreams and songs – a deliberate choice, Niemeyer explains, to preserve the way Metuktire sees and relates to the world.“For centuries, our colonial tradition worked to erase Indigenous memory,” the anthropologist said, noting that there were still very few autobiographies by Brazilian Indigenous leaders. “Until quite recently, the ones writing about Indigenous people were white – and there were practically no Indigenous voices writing about whites.”The memoir is also a call to arms and unity for the younger generations, with frequent scoldings for, in Metuktire’s view, drifting away from tradition.“I still feel strong enough to keep fighting,” Metuktire says, “but my grandchildren must carry this struggle forward.” He is expected toname his successoras chief next month.Explore more on these topicsIndigenous peoplesBrazilJair BolsonaroLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

According to immigration authorities, Chávez entered the US in August 2023 on a legally held visa, but it expired in February 2024.Chávez then applied for legal permanent US residency based on his marriage to Frida Muñoz, an American citizen.Muñoz’s prior relationship with one of El Chapo’s sons drew scrutiny from US officials. Though she has not been charged with any crime, in December 2024, Chávez was reportedly flagged in internal DHS documents as an “egregious public safety threat”, though his removal from the US was not prioritized.Despite that assessment and a criminal record dating back more than a decade, Chávez was allowed re-entry into the US at the San Ysidro port of entry inCaliforniain January under a discretionary parole process approved by Joe Biden’s outgoing presidential administration.Chávez had been convicted of driving while intoxicated in California in 2012. And in January 2024, he was convicted of illegal possession of an assault weapon and manufacturing or importing a short-barreled rifle.Chávez’s most notable sporting feat was winning the WorldBoxingCouncil’s version of the middleweight title in June 2011. The native of Culiacán, Sinaloa, successfully defended it four times before losing it in September 2012.His arrest on 2 July occurred in Studio City, a Los Angeles neighborhood known for its celebrity residences. He was detained five days afterhe lost to Jake Paul, the YouTuber turned boxer, in a lucrative, heavily promoted fight in Anaheim reported to have taken in $1.5m in gate receipts alone.TheTrump administrationhasdesignatedthe Sinaloa cartel as a foreign terrorist organization.After Chávez’s arrest, Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary of the DHS, criticized the Biden administration for not expelling or detaining him, despite an active arrest warrant for trafficking guns, ammunition and explosives.“It is shocking the previous administration flagged this criminal illegal alien as a public safety threat but chose to not prioritize his removal and let him leave and come back into our country,” she said in a statement.McLaughlin’s statement said Chávez’s status as a “world-famous” athlete meant nothing to theTrump administration.“Our message to any cartel affiliates in the US is clear: We will find you and you will face consequences,” the statement said. “The days of unchecked cartel violence are over.”In its own statement, the Chávez family expressed “total and unconditional support” for Julio Jr, who the document described as “a son, a father and a human who has grappled with multiple challenges in his personal and professional life”.“We are completely confident in his innocence and quality as a human – as well as in the justice systems of bothMexicoand the US,” the family’s statement said. “We hope this situation will resolve itself according to the law and the truth.”On his X account over the weekend, Chávez’s father – now a well-known commentator – republished a post from another user that asserted Julio Jr was in rehab.The post that the elder Chávez republished also denied Julio Jr belonged to a cartel.Ramon Antonio Vargascontributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationBoxingUS crimeMexicoDrugsDrugs tradeGangsnewsShareReuse this content"

During that time judicial organs were attacked as “bourgeois” and the nascent court system was largely suspended.China tops list of countries trying to silence exiled dissidents over past decade, study showsRead moreRen is one of hundreds of human rights lawyers to have been targeted since the “709 incident”, a nationwide crackdown on lawyers and activists that started on 9 July 2015. According to human rights groups and the US government, about 300 people from the loose collective of a burgeoning rights defence movement, known asweiquan,were targeted in the round-up. At least 10 were convicted of crimes such as “subversion of state power” and given jail terms, while dozens more have been subjected to surveillance, harassment and the revocation of their professional licences in the years since.Modern China has never welcomed human rights lawyers. But in the relatively open years of the early 2000s, with the rise of the internet and China’s increasing desire for approval on the world stage, the space for civil society grew to a degree that is now almost unrecognisable. Lawyers scored wins for defendants in cases ranging fromtainted baby milk formula scandalsto the abuse of migrant workers.View image in fullscreenRen QuanniuPhotograph: supplied“It’s hard to say we achieved success – we can only say that the services we provided have made it more difficult for the authorities to persecute certain groups,” saidJiang Tianyong, a 54-year-old former human rights lawyer known for taking on cases involving religious and ethnic minorities who served two years in prison for “inciting subversion of state power”.But the nascent movement that Jiang was part of was suppressed soon after Xi Jinping, China’s leader, took power in 2012.A suppression that is less visibleAlthough someweiquanlawyers were also interested in political reform, most were focused on working within the existing Chinese system. The daily grind was not about promulgating foreign ideas, said Ren. It was about defending ordinary citizens “based on the existing laws of China itself, the laws of the Chinese Communist party’s own legal system. Yet even within that framework, the lawyers were not allowed to help.”Under Xi’s rule,activists have been rounded up, independent law firms and NGOs have been reined in, and any kind of organised activity outside the auspices of the Communist party (CCP) has been tightly restricted.View image in fullscreenLawyer Ren Quanniu, representing Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan who reported on Wuhan’s Covid-19 outbreak, in 2020.Photograph: Leo Ramirez/AFP/Getty Images“The Chinese government under Xi Jinping has sought to eradicate the influence of lawyers who defend people’s rights,” said Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch.Ten years on from the crackdown, human rights workers say that the suppression of independent lawyers has become more systematic, and less visible, than rounding up individuals. Those affected by the 709 incident describe living under conditions of harassment and surveillance, and are often blocked from leaving the country. Jiang hasn’t seen his wife and daughter, who left China, in over a decade.More broadly, lawyers working on cases that the CCP considers sensitive have been stripped of their professional credentials, while legal and political reforms have strengthened the role of the CCP in law firms.Ren escaped the first wave of reprisals after the 709 incident. For a few years, he tried to keep on taking up sensitive cases, including that ofZhang Zhan, the citizen journalist who was jailed after reporting from Wuhan on the early days on the Covid-19 pandemic.In 2021, his licence was revoked.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenJiang Tianyong, who appeared in court in 2017 (top).Photograph: AFP/Getty Images/ suppliedAccording to data gathered by Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a US-based NGO, between 2017 and 2019, there were 29 cases of law firms or lawyers having their licences revoked or suspended, compared with nine cases between 2014 and 2016.At the same time, China has expanded the provision of legal aid, which the government says will “benefit more people in need”. According to a Chinese study published in 2022, 60% of defendants with legal representation would receive government-sponsored legal aid. But the legal aid law states that its aim is to “uphold the leadership of the Chinese Communist party” and critics say that the changes, which include the insertion of Xi Jinping Thought into the charter of the All-China Lawyers Association, have narrowed the space for independent lawyers.“The Chinese government has been increasing ideological control throughout the legal profession while also increasing the provision of public legal services, and at the same time requiring those legal services be provided by lawyers who are loyal to the party,” said Wang.Many of China’s human rights lawyers say their work has been pushed underground. Those without licences try to offer informal advice to people in need, but their ability is severely limited.Under these conditions, “no one is truly safe,” said Xie Yanyi, a lawyer detained in the 709 crackdown. “Human rights belong to everyone, and the rule of law protects everyone.”Still, Xie remains hopeful for the future. “Although the year of the 709 incident marked a major regression in the rule of law in China … people, I believe, are gradually building resilience, maturing and becoming stronger.”China’s Ministry of Justice and Public Security Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsChinaHuman rightsAsia PacificFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

Kerr County, in the south-central Hill Country, received more than 300mm of rain in just a few hours.As of Sunday evening, at least 68 people hadbeen confirmed dead, and 28 girls were missing after flood waters tore through a summer camp.In just two hours, the Guadalupe River surged by more than 6 metres (20ft), sweeping away vehicles and inundating homes.The storms were supercharged by moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, which had struck Mexico earlier in the week and drawn saturated air from the Gulf, and instability in the atmosphere facilitated by a low-level jet stream. Climate change is expected to increase the likelihood of these events, as warmer air can hold more moisture.The Hill Country’s rugged topography, marked by steep hills, canyons, and valleys, amplifies the risk and impact of flash flooding, and it is often referred to as “Flash Flood Alley”. On top of that, the area’s limestone and granite terrain exacerbates runoff, because water struggles to soak into the ground.Meanwhile, what began as a tropical depression near the north-west of the Philippines rapidly intensified into Typhoon Danas over the weekend and struckTaiwanon Sunday morning with winds reaching 85mph and torrential rain. Almost 3,000 people had to evacuate their homes.View image in fullscreenUtility poles knocked down during Typhoon Danas in Tainan, Taiwan.Photograph: Johnson Liu/AFP/Getty ImagesOriginally expected to head towards Thailand, the storm altered its course over the weekend, veering northwards across the Taiwan strait. On Sunday, more than 150mm of rainfall was recorded in parts of Taiwan, causing landslides and flash flooding. Further heavy rainfall hit the region on Monday morning.Typhoon Danas is projected to continue its path north-east across the South China Sea, hitting south-east China by midweek. Yellow weather warnings have been issued in Fujian and southern Zhejiang provinces, where wind speeds may reach up to 90mph and more than 130mm of rainfall is expected by Wednesday. However, the exact trajectory of the storm remains uncertain and may shift in the coming days.Although Thailand was spared a direct hit, the typhoon has amplified the region’s monsoon, intensifying the south-westerly winds and drawing in more saturated air from the surrounding ocean. Consequently, northern Thailand has seen an increased humidity and widespread heavy rainfall, which is expected to reach over 90mm in 24 hours in places, bringing the risk of flash flooding and landslides to 33 provinces, particularly near the Mekong River.Explore more on these topicsTexasWeather trackerTaiwanAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

What remains to be decided is: what proportion of a product should be?How transshipments will be defined under the agreement – and how this policy will be enforced – remains to be seen, but it could have significant implications for global trade and tensions with China.View image in fullscreenWorkers at a garment factory in Vietnam’s Thai Nguyen province.Photograph: Nhac Nguyen/AFP/Getty Images“One lesson for other countries is that the US intends to use these deals to apply pressure on China,” said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator.Vietnam, a booming manufacturing hub, benefited during the last Trump administration when punishing tariffs placed on China prompted many Chinese companies to shift their supply chains.However, this caused the Vietnamese trade surplus with the US to surge, attracting US ire and allegations that Vietnam was wrongly acting as a conduit for Chinese companies wanting access to the US market.China’s commerce ministry spokesperson He Yongqian responded to the US-Vietnam deal on Thursday stating: “We firmly oppose any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests. If such a situation occurs, China will resolutely counter it to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”Vietnam’s manufacturing industry is closely intertwined with both the US and China. US exports account for 30% of Vietnam’s GDP, while China is Vietnam’s top import source, relied on for raw materials used to make anything from footwear to furniture and electronics.Vietnam is not alone in relying on China for such components, especially across electronic sectors. “[China] is completely interwoven into global supply chains,” says Dan Martin, international business adviser at Dezan Shira and Associates, based in Hanoi.If companies are expected to prove the origin of all goods, this could place an unwelcome burden on those in sectors such as textiles where margins are low, says Martin.However, he cautions that it remains to be seen whether the higher 40% tariff on transshipments will be actively enforced. It is also possible that Vietnam could benefit if US policy encourages suppliers to set up shop in Vietnam, Martin adds.View image in fullscreenWorkers at a garment factory in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesBusinesses are largely pausing decisions until a clearer picture emerges, say analysts.Policymakers in Hanoi remain on a diplomatic tightrope. Vietnam has long sought to balance relations with Washington and Beijing. It considers the US not only a key export market but a security partner that serves as a counterbalance to China’s assertiveness.However, if Beijing considers that Hanoi is helping Washington constrain it, this risks antagonising Vietnam’s northern neighbour. It could lead to economic measures from China, or pressure over the disputed South China Sea, a major flashpoint in the region, says Peter Mumford, head of practice for south-east Asia at Eurasia Group.As things stand, “aggressive retaliation” by Beijing against Hanoi is unlikely, he says: “Hanoi may even have given Beijing a rough indication of the steps it would have to take to secure a US trade deal.”Vietnam has made efforts to showgoodwill towards Chinaover recent months, while also courting Trump.In exchange for the 20% tariff rate, Trump said Vietnam would open up its market to US goods. US-made SUVs, “which do so well in the United States, will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam”, said Trump.However the market for cars remains small in Vietnam, where city streets are famously crammed with millions of motorbikes.Explore more on these topicsVietnamTariffsInternational tradeAsia PacificGlobal economyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

We should be lowering barriers which make trade harder,” he said.McKibbin’s conclusion that Australia would be left relatively unscathed by US-led trade disruptions was backed up by separate Productivity Commission analysis which showed our economy could even receive a small boost from America’s higher trade barriers.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe Productivity Commission’s modelling found that retaliating with our own tariffs would be counterproductive, and that the best response was to pursue reforms at home to boost the productive potential of Australia’s economy.With Anthony Albanese yet to meet the US president in person, Jim Chalmers in a statement said the Productivity Commission’s conclusions backed the government’s approach to American protectionism.Chalmers said “the key message from the PC review is that Australia is best served by continuing to advocate for free and fair trade, and that’s exactly what we’ve done”.James Paterson, the shadow finance minister, told Channel Nine that “the only fair tariff on Australia would be 0%, and I hope that’s what we get”.“But we haven’t given ourselves the best chance of securing that from the Trump administration because the prime minister has not even met President Trump, now seven months after he was elected,” Paterson said.The Productivity Commission modelling found the “small, positive effect” on Australia’s economy comes about as goods previously sold to the US are diverted to us at a cheaper rate, and as we also scoop up some of the investment that flows out of America and heavily tariffed countries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the average approval time of 32 months put Australia well behind other OECD countries, with only about a third of new medicines launched between 2014 and 2023 available on the PBS, compared with 87% for US consumers.Trump and US commerce secretary say tariffs are delayed until 1 August, sparking confusionRead moreMurphy said Australia had no system to notify drug patent holders of applications by rival companies for generic drugs entering the market, meaning public announcements sometimes prompted court action.The chamber also highlighted measures to boost onshore production of mRNA vaccines used during the Covid-19 pandemic as creating an “uneven playing field” for US companies, and said mandated price reductions tied to listings dates on the PBS devalued intellectual property and undermined medical research.“US-manufactured products should be allowed to compete on an equal basis with Australian-produced goods, consistent with the WTO [World Trade Organization] and US-Australia Free Trade Agreement,” he said.The National Taxpayers Union, a conservative lobby group, called consumer drug price controls in countries such as Australia “socialised medicine” and criticised efforts by governments to push ahead with the OECD’s rewrite of key international tax rules.Australia is pursuing the plan, which includes a global minimum 15% tax rate for multinational companies, as well new taxes on tech firms on the basis of where they earn revenue.Research and development tax concessions in Australia, France and Spain were described as conferring advantages to local firms “that the United States is hard-pressed to match”.American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly hit out at favourable R&D settings in Australia for threatening biomedical innovation and patient care. It said since 2012, 94% of new cancer medicines have been available in the US, compared with just 39% in Australia.The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America used its submission to urge Trump to “leverage ongoing trade negotiations” to weaken the PBS, something Labor has ruled out.In Australia,prices for pharmaceutical medicines are capped at $31.60if listed on the PBS. A 2024 report by research organisation Rand found that US drug prices were, on average, about 370% higher than in Australia and278% abovethe OECD average.Trump said on Monday AEST that the White House planned to start sending letters to US trading partners this week, dictating new tariff rates.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The new start date has left importers uncertain.TheUS treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said key trading partners would receive letters warning if deals were not made, they would “boomerang” back to the 2 April tariff rates.The Albanese government believes Australia’s 10% rate will stick, and no negotiations on a further deal have taken place.Labor frontbencher Matt Thistlethwaite told Sky that Labor wanted the tariffs removed.“But our expectation is that the tariffs will remain. Australia’s fared better than any other nation in the world.”Liberal senator Maria Kovacic called for clarity from the White House.“The reason we don’t know what is going on is because our government and our prime minister don’t know, because they don’t have the strength of relationship with the United States that they should have.”On Friday the prime minister,Anthony Albanese, said he expected Australia’s 10% rate to remain in place.Explore more on these topicsHealthAustralian politicsDonald TrumpAnthony AlbanesePharmaceuticals industryBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

But while millions were glued to news updates, only a handful of people had access to the full case.Jurors heard from more than 50 witnesses and were introduced to more than 120 pieces of evidence by the prosecution and defence throughout the lengthy proceedings.On Monday, the Victorian supreme court juryconvicted Patterson of murderingher estranged husband’s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and his aunt, Heather Wilkinson. The 12-person jury also found Patterson guilty of attempting to murder Heather’s husband,Ian Wilkinson, who survived the lunch after spending weeks in hospital.Now, the exhibits have been made public, showing a mountain of private text messages, phone records, screenshots, CCTV video and medical documents that helped to convict Patterson.Here are some of the major pieces of evidence that paint a picture of how the tragedy unfolded.The leftoversView image in fullscreenThe beef wellington leftovers sent to an expert for examination.Photograph: AAP Image/Supreme court of VictoriaThe remains of the fatal beef wellington dish were shown to jurors in “Exhibit 26” and “Exhibit 15”.

Wilkinson also told the jury about the atmosphere of the lunch, including Patterson’s reluctance to let guests help in the kitchen and her revelation about having cancer, which later proved to be false.The dehydratorView image in fullscreenThe Sunbeam dehydrator found at the tip, which had been dumped there by Erin Patterson on 2 August 2 2023.Photograph: AAP Image/Supreme court of VictoriaPatterson’s food dehydrator became a key piece of evidence for the prosecution to point to fabrications she had made to the police immediately after the fatal lunch.Initially, she denied owning a dehydrator, which she was later found to have dumped at the local tip on 2 August. The dehydrator was found to contain traces of poisonous mushrooms.Exhibit 21 shows images of Patterson in her vehicle at Koonwarra transfer station.View image in fullscreenExhibit 21 showed Erin Patterson in her vehicle at Koonwarra transfer station.Composite: Jane Warren/Supreme court of VictoriaThe CCTV2:13Erin Patterson at Monash Hospital on 31 July 2023 in CCTV vision played to the court – videoCCTV footage was shown to the jury of Patterson at Monash hospital on the morning of 31 July, presenting to medical staff.

He appeared to have killed himself, Russia’s investigative committee said in a statement.The Kremlin published an order signed by Putin to remove Starovoit from his position as transport minister on Monday morning, shortly before news of his death was made public. No reason was given for his dismissal in the order, which was dated 7 July at 9.15am.But Russian media, including the local edition of Forbes, have reported that Starovoit may have died as early as Friday evening, before the order to dismiss him was published. The timeline of his death and dismissal has not been confirmed by investigators. A member of the State Duma, Andrei Kartapolov, told Russian journalists that Starovoit had died “quite long ago”.Starovoit was a prominent official in the Putin government who had previously served from 2018 to 2024 as the governor of the Kursk region, where he oversaw the construction of defensive fortifications for the region on the border with Ukraine after the Russian invasion.The subsequent governor was arrested in a corruption scandal after investigators claimed that more than 1bn roubles (nearly £10m) had been embezzled from federal funds designated to protect the region from a potential incursion by Ukrainian forces.Kommersant, a leading Russian business newspaper, reported that other Kursk officials targeted in the embezzlement case had given testimony against Starovoit, indicating that he may also have faced scrutiny or arrest. Top officials who are dismissed from the Russian government can often face criminal charges as they lose the political backing that previously may have protected them from inquiries into their business or political dealings.Part of the Kursk region was occupied by Ukraine’s army last August in a counteroffensive that was deeply embarrassing for the Kremlin, which has sought to keep the war out of Russia and minimise the impact of the conflict on Russian citizens.Kommersant reported that Starovoit was found with a Makarov pistol that he had been awarded in 2003 for his service “ensuring public safety” in his role as the governor of the Kursk region.Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesperson, denied that Starovoit’s sacking was due to a “lack of trust” but did not answer questions on why he had been dismissed.Also on Monday, a senior official at Russia’s federal roads agency, Andrei Korneichuk, died at work of an apparent heart attack. There was no clear connection between the two transport officials’ deaths.The Kremlin announced Starovoit’s dismissal after hundreds of flights were cancelled across Russia due to a mass disruption caused by Ukrainian drone attacks over the weekend.As of Monday, nearly 500 flights had been cancelled in Russia and another 1,500 were delayed, according to official statistics. Russia and Ukraine struck each other with hundreds of long-range drones on Sunday as Ukraine said it would scale up drone production in collaboration with western countries. Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have shot down more than 150 long-range drones over the weekend.The strikes on Russia led to what local media described as a “transport collapse”, with photos of travellers stranded in transport hubs including Moscow’s Sheremetyevo and St Petersburg’s Pulkovo airports.Explore more on these topicsRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Firefighters and medical teams treated the victims, while police set up a security perimeter until the bees stopped their attack.The three people in critical condition were evacuated to a local hospital. Pierre Mathonier, the mayor of Aurillac, told BFM TV on Monday that their condition had improved.One of them was a 78-year-old person who had to be resuscitated after a cardiorespiratory arrest, he said.The mayor said the incident may have been related to Asian hornets threatening a beehive that was installed on the roof terrace of a hotel more than a decade ago, and had caused the bees to become aggressive.Mathonier said the beekeeper had removed the beehive and relocated it outside of the town.Lt Col Michel Cayla, in charge of the local fire services, said he had never experienced such an attack. “In terms of the number of victims, the panic among the people and the severity of some of the injuries, it was striking,” he told broadcaster TF1.Explore more on these topicsFranceBeesInsectsWildlifeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This scheme would allow for the return of small boat arrivals in exchange for the UK accepting another asylum seeker fromFrancewho is thought to have a clearer right to claim asylum in Britain, such as through family ties.‘We are waking from a long sleep’: France’s ex-PM Gabriel Attal on revitalising relations with the UKRead moreMacron arrives on Tuesday for a state visit that will involve events with royals and other pageantry but is also scheduled to include an Anglo-French summit and other meetings with Starmer.France is expected to announce it will allow police to intervene in shallow waters up to 300 metres from shore in order to stop small boats leaving. It would help prevent “taxi-boats”, which pick people up in the water rather than launching from the beach with passengers on board. This will require changes to existing protocol that do not contravene the UN convention on the law of the sea, which bars any intervention at sea that is not an actual rescue.Maritime authorities have been asked to draw up proposals to “advance” French protocol on interceptions to allow such interventions to take place “while still respecting the UN convention on the law of the sea”.It is understood that aFrench reviewof such tactics has been completed, with French and British officials continuing talks about what more could be done. On Friday, French policeused knives to puncture a boatin shallow seas near Boulogne, in northern France, although it is not known if this was a sign of new protocols or a one-off.Downing Street declined to comment on possible announcements before the visit, although Starmer’s deputy spokesperson indicated that there was likely to be concrete progress on small boat crossings.He told reporters: “We expect to make progress on a wide range of issues and joint priorities, and that includes migration. I’m not going to get ahead of the summit this week, but there are a range of maritime tactics that we have been discussing and have secured agreement with the French over.“It is operationally and legally complicated, but we expect these tactics to be operationalised soon.“It’s for French authorities to make operational decisions for themselves, but as I say, it’s a complex area, but we are working extremely closely with the French. Our relationship with them is better than it has been for a long time.”The hope of the “one in, one out plan”, in combination with a greater likelihood of boats being stopped in the water, is that people could be dissuaded from paying people-smugglers to try to get them across the Channel.Starmer faces sustained political pressure to reduce the number of people arriving across the Channel. Despite a government promise to “smash the gangs” that organise the crossings, more than 20,000 people have crossed to the UK in the first six months of this year, up 48% on the equivalent period in 2024.Explore more on these topicsMigrationImmigration and asylumFranceKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday, Apple accused Brussels of making it deploy “confusing” business terms in order to avoid the threat of fines.“Today we filed our appeal because we believe the European Commission’s decision – and their unprecedented fine – go far beyond what the law requires,” said Apple, announcing an appeal to the general court, the second highest court in the EU. “As our appeal will show, the EC is mandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which are confusing for developers and bad for users.”Apple also accused the commission of unlawfully expanding the definition of “steering” – or the language and methods the company allows developers to use when guiding consumers outside its app stores.The company said officials on Brussels had changed the definition by, for instance, not just focusing on whether app developers should be allowed to link to an external website, but also on whether developers should be permitted to promote offers inside an app.Donald Trump’s senior trade adviser, Peter Navarro, has accused the EU of using “lawfare” against big US tech companies, describing the use of regulations against American companies such as Apple and Meta as part of a barrage of “non-tariff weapons” used for by foreign states against the US.Henna Virkkunen, theEuropean Commissionvice-president responsible for tech sovereignty, said in April that the EU will not rip up its tech rules in an attempt toagree a trade deal with the US.

It alsodirectly contradictedclaims made hours earlier by the office of Israel’s military chief, which said in a letter that Palestinians were only displaced inside Gaza for their own protection.“(Katz) laid out an operational plan for a crime against humanity. It is nothing less than that,” Sfard said. “It is all about population transfer to the southern tip of theGazaStrip in preparation for deportation outside the strip.“While the government still calls the deportation ‘voluntary’, people in Gaza are under so many coercive measures that no departure from the strip can be seen in legal terms as consensual.“When you drive someone out of their homeland that would be a war crime, in the context of a war. If it’s done on a massive scale like he plans, it becomes a crime against humanity,” Sfard added.Katz laid out his plans for Gaza shortly before Netanyahu arrived in Washington DC for meetings with Donald Trump, where he will be under heavy pressure to agree a ceasefire deal to end or at least pause the 21-month war.Work on the “humanitarian city” at the heart of Katz’s plans could start during a ceasefire, the defence minister said. Netanyahu is leading efforts to find countries willing to “take in” Palestinians, he added.Speaking from the White House on Monday, Netanyahu said the US and Israel were working with other countries who would give Palestinians a “better future.”“If people want to stay, they can stay, but if they want to leave, they should be able to leave,” Netanyahu said, as he prepared to have dinner with Trump.Israeli politicians including the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, have also been enthusiastic advocates of new Israeli settlements in Gaza.Plans for the construction of camps called “humanitarian transit areas”, to house Palestinians inside and possibly outside Gaza, had previously been presented to the Trump administration and discussed in the White House, Reuters reported on Monday.The $2bn plan bore the name of the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), Reuters said. GHF denied it had submitted a proposal and said slides seen by Reuters, which laid out the plan, “are not a GHF document”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionConcerns about Israel’s plans to displace Palestinians had previously been raised by military orders for the operation launched this spring.Sfard represented three reservists who filed a petition to Israel’s courts, demanding the military revoke commands to “mobilise and concentrate” the civilian population of Gaza, and to prohibit any plans for the deportation of Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.In a letter responding to their claims, the office of Israel’s chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, said that displacing Palestinians or concentrating the population in one part of Gaza were not among the objectives of the operation.That statement was directly contradicted by Katz, said Prof Amos Goldberg, historian of the Holocaust at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.The defence minister laid out clear plans for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, Goldberg said, and the creation of “a concentration camp or a transit camp for Palestinians before they expel them”.“It is neither humanitarian nor a city,” he said of Katz’s planned holding area for Palestinians.“A city is a place where you have possibilities of work, of earning money, of making connections and freedom of movement.“There are hospitals, schools, universities and offices. This is not what they have in mind. It will not be a livable place, just as the ‘safe areas’ are unliveable now.”Katz’s plan also raised the immediate question of what would happen to Palestinians who refused to follow Israeli orders to move into the new compound, said Goldberg.He added: “What will happen if the Palestinians will not accept this solution and revolt, because they are not completely helpless?”Explore more on these topicsGazaMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

It has more than 900 staff in more than 45 countries.The former UK prime minister has been involved in the region and worked for nearly eight years as special representative of the Quartet of international powers seeking a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.He resigned in 2015.The institute denied it was involved in the preparation of a slide deck, which the FT reported had been developed by the Israeli business people using BCG’s financial models and was said to have proposed paying half a million Palestinians to leave the area.The slides reportedly outlined a plan called the “Great Trust” and was shared with theTrump administration. It envisaged that private investors would have been attracted to Gaza once many of the inhabitants had been paid to leave.The plan outlined in the slides was reported to have been created to attract Trump’s attention and that of wealthy Gulf rulers. Among 10 “mega projects”, the document includes the “MBS Ring” and “MBZ Central” highways – named after the leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – and an “Elon Musk smart manufacturing zone”.In February, Trump retweetedan AI-generated videoand said: “We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal … the Riviera of the Middle East, it could be so magnificent.”Blair’s institute said it was not involved in the preparation of the slide deck, which it described as “a BCG deck”, and added that it had no input into its contents.“Tony Blair himself has neither spoken to the people who prepared this deck nor commented on it. The TBI team speaks to many different groups and organisations with postwar ‘plans’ forGaza, but had nothing to do with the authorship of this plan,” a spokesperson said.“TBI staff participated in two calls, as they have done with many other people with ‘Gaza plans’ and interacting with them doesn’t mean endorsement. But we were not involved in drawing up the deck, it is emphatically not TBI work or ‘joint’ work so it would be completely wrong to suggest it is.“Of course we’re opposed to any plan which tries to make Gazans leave Gaza. We want them to be able to stay and live in Gaza.“The TBI document referred to is an internal TBI document looking at proposals being made by various parties covering all the different aspects of what a postwar Gaza could look like, though it is one of many such internal documents.”The spokesperson said TBI’s work in the region had always been dedicated to building a better Gaza for Palestinians, adding: “Tony Blair has worked for this since leaving office. It has never been about relocating Gazans, which is a proposal TBI has never authored, developed or endorsed.”The TBI describes itself as a “not-for-profit, non-partisan organisation helping governments and leaders turn bold ideas into reality”.BCG has been embroiled in a separate controversy over its connection to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the controversial Israeli- and US-backed delivery group.The consulting company said last month that it had cancelled its contract with the GHF amid growing media scrutiny into the group’s work and sources of funding.BCG has sought to dissociate itself from the work in Gaza and has reportedly fired two partners who it said had misled senior management. TheFT reported last week that the BCG team had been involved in modelling of the potential reconstruction of Gaza.Explore more on these topicsTony BlairGazaTrump administrationPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The 27-year-old resident of Tuba, one of the dozen or so villages that make up Masafer Yatta in the arid south Hebron hills of the occupiedWest Bank, had been up all night watching as a masked Israeli settler on horseback circled his family home.“When we saw the masked settler, we knew he wanted violence,” said Awad, his eyes bloodshot. They were lucky this time: the settler disappeared into the darkness before police could show up.The men in Masafer Yatta rarely sleep these days. They take turns standing watch at night, fearful that nearby Israeli settlers will attack under the cover of darkness.Daylight brings little respite. Residents work with an ear pricked up for the sound of approaching vehicles, scanning the horizon for Israeli bulldozers which could signal their homes are next to be demolished.Israel designated Masafer Yatta a military training zone – named firing zone 918, where no civilians can live – in 1981. It has been working since to push out the roughly 1,200 residents who remain. These residents have been fighting in Israeli courts for more than two decades to stop their expulsion, a battle which has slowed, but not stopped, the demolition of Palestinian homes there.A map of Palestinian villages within firing zone 918Recently, an Israeli administrative body issued a decision which legal experts and activists have said could remove the last remaining legal barriers for the demolition of homes in Masafer Yatta. The decision could lead to the forcible transfer of 1,200people, something the UN warned could be a war crime.“This would amount to forcible transfer, which is a war crime. It could also amount to a crime against humanity if committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack,” theUN human rights office saidon 26 June.On 18 June, the civil administration’s central planning bureau, the Israeli military agency that issues construction permits in occupiedPalestinian territories, issued a directive that all pending building requests in Masafer Yatta be rejected.Map shows the occupied West Bank, with the area od Masafer Yatta highlighted in the south.Previously, residents could file building planning requests and, while they were being examined, their structures could not legally be demolished. By cancelling all pending requests, the new directive dismisses all previously submitted cases without examining their particularities and gives demolitions the green light.The decision was made at the same time as Israeli authorities are pursuing sharply increased numbers of demolitions across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, destroying 933 structures since the beginning of the year, a record-breaking pace, according toUN data. As structures are demolished, more Palestinians are killed in the West Bank, with at least 950 killed and 9,000 injured by Israeli forces and settlers since the start of the war in Gaza on 7 October 2023, according to Palestinian health authorities.The new directive cites a military planning document issued a day earlier, which said that firing zone 918 was necessary for combat preparedness and that the presence of civilian structures prevented training exercises.MapThe document says: “The practical condition for such [military training] access is the removal of the unauthorised constructions, thus enabling the IDF to conduct its training … No construction in the firing zone can be permitted.” It adds that for live-fire exercises to be conducted, the area needs to be “sterile”.According to a lawyer representing residents of Masafer Yatta, Netta Amar-Shiff, the new directive bypasses a previous legal ruling and abrogates local laws, and could rapidly expedite the destruction of villages.“If this directive is activated, it means planning institutions can dismiss building requests under military auspices, so no civilian construction and development can be approved. It’s easier for them to eliminate entire villages,” Amar-Shiff said.View image in fullscreenAli Awad, a resident of the Palestinian village of Tuba, in the firing zone 918, in Masafer Yattah.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianHumanitarian organisations have long accused Israel of establishing firing zones as an excuse to push Palestinians off their land and expand settlement construction. About 18% of Area C, the parts of the West Bank under full Israeli control, has been designated as firing zones.According to government meeting minutes in 1981, the then agriculture minister and future PM, Ariel Sharon, proposed the creation of firing zone 918 with the purpose of forcing Palestinians out of the area.In themeeting, Sharon told the IDF he wanted to expand shooting zones “in order to keep these areas … in our hands”, pointing to “the expansion of the Arab villagers” in the area.In a comment, the Israeli military said the civil administration was “holding ongoing discussions regarding villages built within the boundaries of firing zone 918” and that the military had a “vital need for the area”.“As a general rule, no approval will be granted for construction within the firing zone, which is designated as a closed military area,” the Israeli military said in a statement to the Guardian, adding that building permit requests were subject to approval by military command.To Awad, last week’s decision is the latest attempt in a long line of court decisions and policies by the Israeli government to expel the residents of Masafer Yatta from their homes.In May 2022, Israel’s high court ruled that the residents could be expelled and the land repurposed for military use, as it said villagers were not permanent residents of the area before the firing zone was declared. Residents and lawyers, relying on expert testimony and literature, said they had inhabited the area for decades.“This decision was a clear way of cutting the last nerve of life that these people had,” said Awad, calling it part of a larger policy of “ethnic cleansing of Palestinians”.View image in fullscreenNasser Shreiteh stands in what was his kitchen of in the Palestinian village of Susyia. Israeli settlers set his home on fire in an attack.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianAwad and the other residents of Masafer Yatta have spent more than two decades filing petitions, appeals, proposing master plans and submitting documents to try to fight the destruction of their community.“We tried for many years to supply different documents and proofs and plans to the courts. But, after years of this, a commander in the army says no and that’s enough,” said Nidal Younis, head of the Masafer Yatta council, in a press briefing late last month.As the residents navigate Israel’s labyrinthine bureaucracy to stave off demolition orders, settlers have acted as the extrajudicial vanguard of displacement, making daily life nearly intolerable for Palestinians.Almost every single resident has a story about being harassed or attacked by nearby settlers, whose presence has been slowly growing, with new outposts popping up on the area’s hilltops.Middle East crisis: Trump calls for Gaza hostages release ahead of Netanyahu meeting at the White House – as it happenedRead moreIn the early hours of 25 June, settlers set fire to Nasser Shreiteh’s home in the town of Susiya, burning his kitchen and a bedroom almost entirely, running off as he tried to extinguish the fire.“They want to evict everyone, they want everyone to disappear. But I am here, if they burn my house down, I will stay here, I have no other place to go,” said Shreiteh, a 50-year-old with seven children, as he overlooked the charred remains of his kitchen.As he spoke, an Israeli military patrol passed and behind it roared a beaten-up sedan driven by settlers, swerving in circles as the car’s trunk swung open. They pulled up to Shreiteh’s driveway and made an obscene hand gesture before driving off.Incidents of settler violence in the area have sharply increased since the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 and the subsequent war in Gaza. The rise of the far-right, extremist ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir has provided political cover, allowing settlers to act with virtual impunity.Many settlers have been called to military reserves, where they serve around their settlements. Residents of Masafer Yatta said settlers would often walk around in military dress, such as combat trousers, which made it impossible to tell whether they were dealing with settlers or soldiers.View image in fullscreenSouad al-Mukhamari with three grandchildren in Sfai. She said one of her granddaughters was attacked by a settler.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianSettler violence has escalated the tighter residents have clung to their land. In late January, settlers torched Awad’s car, which he had used to transport children to school and residents to legal hearings.Souad al-Mukhamari, a 61-year-old resident of Sfai, another village in Masafer Yatta, complained that one of hergranddaughters, a child, had been beaten and pepper-sprayed by a settler a month earlier. Her own home overlooked the debris of a school that was demolished in 2022.Palestinians can do little to protect themselves from settler violence, and are severely punished if they attempt to do so. They complain that Israeli authorities fail to protect them and do not follow up on their complaints.Legal advocates have said they expect little protection from Israel’s legal system, but instead are looking to the international community to increase pressure on Israel to halt settlement construction and protect the rights of Palestinians.“We don’t see any possibility of internal change within Israel to protect these communities,” said Sarit Michaeli, an international advocacy officer at the Israeli human rights group B’tselem. “The only way to stop this is whether there is clear international action to clarify to Israeli policymakers that actions have consequences,” she added.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Ayub family look on during a demolition in Khirbet al-Fakheit.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianThe Trump administration has expressed little interest in addressing illegal settlement construction and violence, lifting Biden-era sanctions on settlers. Instead, Michaeli said the EU could play a role in pressuring Israeli officials, especially as itannounced at the end of Maythat it is reviewing its association agreement with Israel over human rights compliance concerns.As residents of Masafer Yatta wait for international action, they live under the constant threat of displacement and settler violence, their means of resistance all stripped away one at a time. Still, they are determined to stay.“Just mentally we are preparing for more demolitions. There’s nothing more on the ground we can do, besides putting our words in the media so they can reach farther than we can scream,” Awad said.Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesIsraelWest BankMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

There were also 19 cloudbursts, in which an enormous amount of rain falls in a sudden deluge, according to a report by the Himachal Pradesh state government.Several districts remained on high alert for further landslides, with warnings of more rainfall this week.Himachal Pradesh, a state that spans the mountainous terrain of the Himalayas, has suffered repeatedly in recent years as the climate emergency has led to the monsoon rains becoming erratic and falling in more intense, unmanageable bursts.In 2023, large swathes of essential infrastructure in Himachal Pradesh was destroyed and more than 300 people lost their lives after destructive flooding across north India.Many of the state’s biggest towns and cities are built on steep slopes, resulting in hundreds of homes – often built on insecure terrain – collapsing or being engulfed in mud due to landslides and flooding.Weather tracker: Deadly storms in India and huge hailstones in ParisRead moreThe state disaster management authority said the death toll from monsoon-related disasters had reached 78 so far this year, which included deaths from flash floods, electrocution and road accidents.Rescue efforts were ongoing on Monday to find dozens of people still missing after the landslides, but officials said efforts had been hampered by the region’s treacherous terrain and the destruction of vital roads. Many areas across the state were left isolated, without access to clean water and power.One of the state’s worst-affected urban areas was the town of Mandi. The town’s MP, the Bollywood star turned politician Kangana Ranaut – known for her often provocative statements – caused outrage after she said she did “not have any funds for disaster relief or hold any cabinet post”.Experts have repeatedly said the climate crisis is intensifying the risk of flooding in India to dangerous levels due to increased rainfall, rising sea levels and more extreme weather events, particularly during the monsoon period between June and September, when about 80% of the country’s rain falls.Serious flooding in June had already led to dozens of deaths in the north-eastern Indian states of Assam and Mizoram where the monsoon rains arrive earlier. The early arrival of heavy monsoon rains in Mumbai left large areas of the city under water, bringing the metropolitan area, home to about 24 million people, to a standstill.Explore more on these topicsIndiaFloodingExtreme weatherSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

This is a threat that needs to be taken seriously at the highest levels of government.“Only when drugs are kept out, and prisoners are involved in genuinely purposeful activity that will help them to get work and resettle successfully on release, can we expect to see prisons rehabilitate rather than just contain the men and women they hold.”Almost two-fifths (39%) of respondents to prisoner surveys said it was easy to get drugs in prison, and inspectors regularly visited prisons where the recorded rate of positive random drug tests was more than 30%.The report said in many jails there were “seemingly uncontrollable levels of criminality” that often inexperienced staff were unable to contain.Taylor’s report found overcrowding and lack of activity caused frustration among prisoners, which fuelled the demand for drugs, with many spending most of the day in cramped shared cells with broken furniture and vermin.Overcrowding meant there were not enough places for every prisoner to take part in work or education while in custody, but even when there were spaces available inspectors found underused workshops because of staff shortages.Purposeful activity was the worst performing assessment category by inspectors, with 28 out of 38 adult prisons visited deemed to be “poor” or “not sufficiently good” in this area.The government recently approved the use of protective body armour for prison staff in high security areas after four prison officers wereattacked with hot oil and homemade weaponsby Manchester Arena bomb plotter Hashem Abedi at HMP Frankland in April.Ministers vowed to create 14,000 new prison places by 2031 and have accepted recommendations from the independent sentencing review to curb overcrowding in the long term.James Timpson, the prisons minister, said: “This report shows the scale of the crisis we inherited and the unacceptable pressures faced by our hardworking staff – with prisons dangerously full, rife with drugs and violence.“We are ending this chaos. After just 500 prison places added in 14 years, we’re building 14,000 extra – with 2,400 already delivered – and reforming sentencing to ensure we never run out of space again. We’re also improving prisons so they cut crime, not create better criminals.“We’re also investing £40m to bolster security, alongside stepping up cooperation with police to combat drones and stop the contraband which fuels violence behind bars.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationDrugsUK criminal justiceJames TimpsonnewsShareReuse this content"

PC Marsden kicks Mr Amaaz around the head area.“PC Marsden stamps his foot towards the crown of Mr Amaaz’s head area but doesn’t appear to connect with Mr Amaaz.”Footage from the body-worn cameras of the three officers was also played to the jury.Amaaz is alleged to have assaulted PC Marsden and PC Ward, causing them actual bodily harm.He is also accused of the assault of PC Cook and the earlier assault of a member of the public, Abdulkareem Ismaeil, at Starbucks.Amaad, 26, is alleged to have assaulted PC Marsden, causing actual bodily harm.Both men, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, deny the allegations.Giving evidence, PC Marsden told the court he approached the pay station area with the intention of taking “immediate control” and escorting the suspect from the crowd and to arrest him outside where he would have radio signal.He said: “I wanted to prevent his escape or any opportunity to escape, but also to give me control of someone who had allegedly been violent towards a member of the public.”He said he placed his hands on Amaaz’s left arm, but said he was “met with immediate resistance” and that he felt the suspect “clench his fists”.PC Marsden said: “I recall leaning in and saying to him words along the lines of ‘come on mate, we are not doing that here.’”He said he did not feel it was necessary to tell the suspect he was a police officer because he was wearing full uniform with a cap.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

As a matter of courtesy, I wrote to the party chairman in October to inform him of my intention not to renew my membership. I did not receive a reply.“I joined theConservativesall those years ago because I believed it was the party that best reflected my values and beliefs. Regrettably, that is no longer the case. Today, Reform UK is the party that best represents my views – and, I believe, those of many others who have become disillusioned with the two old major parties.”Citing concern about the cost of living, illegal immigration and “the steady erosion of our national sovereignty”, Jones said Reform UK was the only party “demonstrating the determination needed to tackle the country’s many problems and to improve the lives of people across Britain”.Jones served as Welsh secretary under David Cameron between 2012 and 2014. He also served as a minister in the Department for Exiting the EU under Theresa May between 2016 and 2017.He later became deputy chair of the European Research Group, a Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs.Jones, who stood down from parliament last year after 19 years as an MP, said he had no intention of standing for election, and had joined Reform “as a private individual”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some charities said they calculated the figure to be higher.This was amended to 150,000 people after the government made some initial concessions, including reversing some universal credit cuts and applying the stricter Pip eligibility rules only to new claimants, as it tried to quell a rebellion over the changes.In the end, Keir Starmer shelved the main component of the cuts which were expected to save the government £5bn a year, and the Resolution Foundation estimates that the bill as it stands will bring no savings in five years’ time.The means the chancellor is facing a large financial hole,, with tax rises now predicted.The chief secretary to the Treasury declined to rule out the introduction of a wealth tax when pressed on future tax rises in the Commons on Monday, and said any tax decisions would be set out by the chancellor at the autumn budget.On Sunday, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, suggested the welfare U-turn may makescrapping the two-child benefit cap more difficultto achieve. “The decisions that have been taken in the last week do make decisions, future decisions harder,” she said.Explore more on these topicsPovertyWelfareBenefitsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

As the Guardian has reported on widely, this is not an issue confined to high-profile individuals or the most powerful organisations.“The use of NDAs to cover up abuse and harassment is growing – and sadly amongst those in low-income or insecure employment across multiple industries and workplaces.“This cannot go on. That is why we are stamping out this practice and taking action to ban any NDAs used for this purpose. My message is clear: no one should suffer in silence and we will back workers and give survivors the voice that they deserve.”NDAs should be banned to curb music industry ‘culture of misogyny’, says new parliament reportRead moreThe legislation represents the biggest overhaul of workers’ rights in a generation, introducing day one rights, establishing collective bargaining bodies in vital sectors and strengthening family-friendly entitlements, as well as going further on bereavement leave and tackling “fire-and-rehire”.Over time NDAs have become the default solution for many organisations, corporations and public bodies to settle cases including sexual misconduct, racism, and pregnancy discrimination.Their original purpose was to protect intellectual property or other commercial or sensitive information, but reports have shown they have become commonly used to prevent people speaking out about horrific experiences in the workplace.There have been many high-profile cases of NDAs being used to prevent victims from speaking about crimes, often forcing women and vulnerable individuals to feel stuck in unwanted situations, through fear or desperation.They have proliferated especially in lower-income, insecure employment including sectors such as retail, hospitality and accommodation, with non-disparagement clauses also typically attached.A report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) last year found the use of NDAs was relatively common, with 22% of respondents to a survey of 2,000 employers saying their organisation used them when dealing with allegations of sexual harassment.In contrast, 44% said they did not use NDAs in this way and a further 34% did not know, highlighting that awareness around their use in some organisations may be low.The CIPD also found that most employers would not strongly object to the removal of NDAs in the workplace. Nearly half (48%) of employers would support a ban, with just 18% opposing, while 20% were ambivalent, and a further 14% did not know.Zelda Perkins, a former PA to Harvey Weinstein who spearheads the campaign group Can’t Buy My Silence, said of the government’s plans: “This is a huge milestone, for years we’ve heard empty promises from governments whilst victims have continued to be silenced.“To see this government accept the need for nationwide legal change shows that they have listened and understood the abuse of power taking place.“Above all though, this victory belongs to the people who broke their NDAs, who risked everything to speak the truth when they were told they couldn’t. Without their courage, none of this would be happening.View image in fullscreenZelda Perkins, who worked for Harvey Weinstein as an assistant in the 1990s, called the changes ‘a huge milestone’.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer“This is not over yet and we will continue to focus closely on this to ensure the regulations are watertight and no one can be forced into silence again. If what is promised at this stage becomes reality, then the UK will be leading the world in protecting not only workers but the integrity of the law.”Louise Haigh, a former cabinet minister who led the parliamentary campaign to ban NDAs alongside Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, said: “Victims of harassment and discrimination have been forced to suffer in silence for too long. Today’s announcement will mean that bad employers can no longer hide behind legal practices that cover up their wrongdoing and prevent victims from getting justice.”Moran, who began campaigning when a victim from Oxford University shared their story with her, added: “This would not have been possible without the brave students and victims who have shared their heartbreaking stories with me over the years.“It has been a privilege to work alongside Zelda, Louise, and countless others to bring their voices to Westminster and raise awareness of the truly devastating impact misused NDAs can have on people’s lives.”Legislative changes have already been made in Ireland, Canada and the US so that NDAs cannot prohibit disclosure of sexual harassment, discrimination or bullying without it being the expressed wish of the employee.A landmark survey of sexual harassment at work has found that one in four women have suffered work-related sexual assault.Britain’s largest trade union, Unite, polled approximately 300,000 female members on whether they had experienced sexual harassment at work, travelling to work or from a colleague in or out of work hours.Of the 6,615 respondents, 25% said they had been sexually assaulted and 43% had been inappropriately touched. More than 3,000 said they had been the recipient of sexually offensive jokes and/or experienced unwanted flirting, gesturing or sexual remarks.And 28% had been shared or shown pornographic images by a manager, colleague or third party, while 8% had been a victim of sexual coercion – when a person pressures, tricks, threatens or manipulates someone into engaging in sexual activity without genuine consent – at work.While the perpetrator in the bulk of these incidents was a member of public in the workplace, such as a patient or a passenger, 3% said they had been sexually assaulted by a manager and 6% by a colleague.Explore more on these topicsEmployment lawSexual harassmentDiscrimination at workWork & careersAngela RaynernewsShareReuse this content"

No increases will take place on Wednesday, however, after he extended a previous pause.White House officials also signaled that new blanket rates – charged on all goods imported from certain markets – would incorporate, rather than be imposed on top of, existing duties charged on certain sectors, such as cars.Posting copies of letters addressed to world leaders on social media,Trump announcedthe following new US tariff rates:Goods from Bangladesh: 35% US tariffBosnia and Herzegovina: 30%Cambodia: 36%Indonesia: 32%Japan: 25%Kazakhstan: 25%Laos: 40%Malaysia: 25%Myanmar: 40%Serbia: 35%South Africa: 30%South Korea: 25%Thailand: 36%Tunisia: 25%He also signed anexecutive orderon Monday extending a 90-day pause for a slate of so-called “reciprocal” tariffs first introduced in April – in effect pushing back the deadline of trade talks back to 1 August.Asked if the deadline was firm, Trump said: “I would say firm, but not 100% firm. If they call up and they say we’d like to do something a different way, we’re going to be open to that.”The press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a press briefing that more letters would be sent later this week.Trump was “close” on other deals, she added, but “wants to ensure these are the best deals possible”.Trump officials initially suggested they would strike dozens of deals with key economies by 9 July, but have since indicated that they would seek an extension to continue talks.The letters were largely identical and informed the leaders that there will be no tariffs if their countries “decide to build or manufacture product within the United States”.Trump also threatened higher tariffs if the countries place additional tariffs on US exports. “If for any reason you decide to raise your tariffs, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto that 25% we charge,” he wrote.In an earlier post on Truth Social, Trump also threatened an extra 10% levy on countries working with Brics nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) after the bloc’s leaders issued a statement on Sunday expressing “serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff” measures.Trump initially announced a slate of so-called reciprocal tariffs in April, on what the White House dubbed “liberation day”, with some countries facing rates as high as 50%The US has so far settled deals with three countries: the UK, China and Vietnam, and Bessent said there were over a dozen countries the US is still trying to negotiate with.The new August deadline for countries without a deal amounts to a further three-week reprieve, but also triggers fresh uncertainty for importers because of the lack of clarity around the tariffs.As the July deadline has approached, Trump’s officials have been racing to broker deals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the beginning of this year, the dollar had its worst six months in more than 50 years, falling 10.8% since the start of 2025.British steelmakers face a nervous wait to discover if they will be hit by US tariffs, after the UK government said it was trying to complete a deal to protect the industry from Trump’s trade war.The US has set a 50% tariff on foreign steel and aluminum imports. While the UK has brokered a reduced rate of 25% and is trying to bring it down to zero, a deal has not yet been completed.On Monday, Downing Street refused to confirm it was confident it could eliminate US tariffs on UK steel before Trump’s deadline. A spokesperson for No 10 said: “Our work with the US continues to get this deal implemented as soon as possible.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpJapanSouth KoreaTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes after a slight drop of 0.3% in May, although the average house price was still about 2.5% higher in June compared with a year earlier.Amanda Bryden, the head of mortgages at Halifax, said the market was resilient thanks to wage growth and stable interest rates. However, she added that buyers and homeowners still had to dig deep.“Affordability is still stretched, particularly for those coming to the end of fixed-rate deals,” she said. “The economic backdrop also remains uncertain; while inflation has eased, it’s still above target, and there are signs the job market may be softening.”The unemployment rate in the UKhit its highest level in four yearsin the first three months of this year, at 4.5%. That was up 0.2% on the previous quarter, according to official figures.However, the housing market could be supported by a lower cost of borrowing, with two more interest rate cuts expected this year, Bryden added. With the average rate on new mortgages now at its lowest since 2023, Halifax anticipates “modest” house price growth for the rest of the year.The number of first-time buyers in the market has also fallen back to its normal level before the changes to stamp duty, Halifax said. Temporary cuts to the tax in England and Northern Ireland expired in April, adding thousands of pounds to the cost of many property transactions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It calculated that the average price of a home dropped by 0.8% to £271,619, after a 0.4% gain in May.However, analysts at the building society also said it expected activity to “pick up as the summer progresses, despite ongoing economic uncertainties in the global economy, since underlying conditions for potential homebuyers in the UK remain supportive”.Explore more on these topicsHousing marketReal estateMortgage lending figuresMortgagesPropertynewsShareReuse this content"

The answer is increasingly noMon 7 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 12.08 EDTShare“The housing crisis is now as big a threat to the EU as Russia,” Jaume Collboni, the mayor of Barcelona, recentlydeclared. “We’re running the risk of having the working and middle classes conclude that their democracies are incapable of solving their biggest problem.”It is not hard to see where Collboni is coming from. From Dublin to Milan, residents routinely find half of their incomes swallowed up by rent, and home ownership is unthinkable for most. Major cities are witnessingspiralling house pricesand some have jaw-dropping year-on-year median rent increases ofmore than 10%. People are being pushed into ever more precarious andcrampedconditions and homelessness israpidly rising.As Collboni asserts, housing lies at the heart of surging political disfranchisement across mainland Europe. The crisis isfuelling the far right– linked, for example, to the support for Alternative für Deutschland in Germany and the recentvictory of the Dutch anti-Islam Freedom party. Housing has become a primaryengine of inequality, reinforcing divisions between the asset-haves and have-nots anddisproportionately affecting minority groups. Far from offering security and safety, for many in Europe housing is now a primary cause of suffering and despair.But not everyone is suffering. At the same time it is robbing normal people of a comfortable and dignified life, the housing crisis is lining the pockets of a small number of individuals and institutions. AcrossEuropein recent decades the same story has unfolded, albeit in very different ways: power has shifted to those who profit from housing, and away from those who live in it.Councils in England face ‘impossible decisions’ to build or repair homesRead moreThe most striking manifestation of this shift is the large-scale ownership and control of homes by financial institutions, particularly since the 2008 global financial crisis. In 2023,$1.7tnof global real estate was managed by institutional investors such as private equity firms, insurance companies, hedge funds, banks and pension funds, up from $385bn in 2008. Spurred by loose monetary policy, these actors consider Europe’s housing a particularly lucrative and secure “asset class”. Purchases of residential property in the euro area by institutional investorstripled over the past decade. As a London-based asset managerputs it: “Real estate investors with exposure to European residential assets are the cats that got the cream,” with housing generating “stronger risk-adjusted returns than any other sector”.The scale of institutional ownership in certain places is staggering. In Ireland, nearlyhalfof all units delivered since2017 were purchased by investment funds. Across Sweden, the share of private rental apartments with institutional investors as landlords has swelled to24%. In Berlin,€40bnof housing assets are now in institutional portfolios,10%of the total housing stock. In the four largest Dutch cities, aquarterof homes for sale in recent years were purchased by investors. Even in Vienna, a city widely heralded for its vast, subsidised housing stock, institutional players are now invested inevery 10thhousing unit and42%of new private rental homes.Not all investors are the same. But when the aim is to make money from housing it can mean only one thing: prices go up. As Leilani Farha, a former UN special rapporteur, points out, investment funds have a “fiduciary duty” to maximise returns to shareholders, which often include the pension funds on which ordinary people rely. They therefore do all they can to increase prices and reduce expenditure, including via “renoviction” (using refurbishment as an excuse to hike rents), under-maintenance and the introduction of punitive fees. When the private equity giant Blackstone acquired and renovated homes across Stockholm, it increased rents on some of the homes by up to 50%, the economic geographer Brett Christophersfound. “Green” retrofits in the name of sustainability are also an increasingly commontactic.The corporate capture of our homes has not sprung out of thin air. Decades of housing market privatisation, liberalisation and speculation have enabled the financial sector to tighten its grip on European households. From the 1980s in places such as Italy, Sweden and Germany, government-owned apartments were transferred en masse to the private market. In Berlin, for example, vast bundles of public housing were sold overnight to large corporations. In one single transaction, Deutsche Wohnen purchased 60,000 flats from the city in 2006 for€450m; just €7,500 per apartment.With the role of welfare states in housing provision dismantled, many countries reached for demand-side interventions such as liberalising mortgage credit. This fuelled widespread speculation, pushed up house prices and encouraged extreme levels of household indebtedness. The resulting financial crisis of 2008 provided fresh opportunities for investors. Countries such as Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland became a treasure trove of “distressed” assets and mortgage debt that could be scooped up at bargain prices. Despite the widespread devastation caused by the crisis, Europe’s dependence on the financial sector for housing solutions only intensified in the years that followed.As power has shifted to investors and speculators, and governments have become ever more reliant on them, so it has been withdrawn from residents. In order to incentivise or “de-risk” private investment, governments across Europe have weakened tenant protections, slashed planning regulations and building standards, and offered special subsidies, grants and tax breaks for entities such as real estate investment trusts. One group in particular has borne the brunt of this: renters. Renters have seen their rents skyrocket, living conditions deteriorate and their security undermined. In Europe, some investment funds have directly driven the displacement of lower-income tenants and overseen disruptive evictions.Powerful financial actors have done a great job at framing themselves as the solution to, rather than the cause of, the prevailing crisis. They have incessantly pushed the now-dominant narrative that more real estate investment is a good thing because it will increase the supply of much-needed homes. Blackstone, for example,claimsto play a “positive role in addressing the chronic undersupply of housing across the continent”. But theevidence suggeststhat greater involvement of financial markets has not increased aggregate home ownership or housing supply, but instead inflated house prices and rents.The thing is, institutional investors aren’t really into producing housing. It is directly against their interests to significantly increase supply. As one asset managerconcedes, housing undersupply is bad for residents but “supportive for cashflows”. Blackstone’s president famouslyadmittedthat “the big warning signs in real estate are capital and cranes”. In other words, they need shortages to keep prices high.Where corporate capital does produce new homes, they will of course be maximally profitable. Cities such as Manchester, Brussels and Warsaw have experienced a proliferation of high-margins housing products such as micro-apartments, build-to-rent and co-living. Designed with the explicit intention ofoptimising cashflows, these are both unaffordable and unsuitable for most households. Common Wealth, a thinktank focusing on ownership,foundthat the private equity-backed build-to-rent sector, which accounts for 30% of new homes in London, caters predominantly to high-earning single people. Families represent just5%of build-to-rent tenants compared with a quarter of the private rental sector more broadly. These overpriced corporate appendages are a stark reminder of the market’s inability to deliver homes that fit the needs and incomes of most people.Something vital is missing from Labour’s housing policy: council houses | Abi O’ConnorRead moreWhile housing lies at the heart of political disillusionment today, it is for the same reason becoming a primary trigger for mobilisation across Europe. In October 2024, 150,000 protestersmarchedthrough the streets of Madrid demanding action. Some governments, includingDenmarkand theNetherlands, are introducing policies to deter speculators. But real estate capital continues to hold the power, so it continues to get its way – including by exploitingloopholes, and lobbying against policies that put profits at risk. In 2021, Berliners voted in favour of expropriating and socialising apartments owned by stock-listed landlords. But underpressure from the real estate lobby, politicians have stalled this motion. That same year Blackstone – Spain’s largest landlord with 40,000 housing units – opposed plans to impose a 30% target for social housing in institutional portfolios. Struggles against the immense structural power of real-estate interests will be hard fought.In recent decades we have been living through an ever-intensifying social experiment. Can housing, a fundamental need for all human beings, be successfully delivered under the machinations of finance capitalism? The evidence now seems overwhelming: no.As investors have come to dominate, so the power of residents has been systematically undermined. We are left with a crisis of inconceivable proportions. While we can, and should, point the finger at corporate greed, we must remember that this is the system working precisely as it is set up to do. When profit is the prevailing force, housing provision invariably fails to align with social need – to generate the types of homes within the price ranges most desperately required. In the coming years, housing will occupy centre stage in European politics. Now is the time for fundamental structural changes that reclaim homes from the jaws of finance, re-empower residents and reinstate housing as a core priority for public provision.Tim White is a research fellow at Queen Mary University of London and the London School of Economics studying housing, cities and inequalityExplore more on these topicsHousingThe housing crisis in EuropeCommunitiesEuropeEuropean UnionPrivate equitycommentShareReuse this content"

Some people would take issue with the more sterile landscape on court and the lack of human touch, while the cull of around 300 linesmen and women would also surely be a sore point. It is difficult, however, to imagine they were prepared for the firestorm that has followed its long-awaited implementation at this tournament.Wimbledon line-call failure came after operator turned cameras off by mistakeRead moreElectronic line-calling, or ELC, which uses automated ball-tracking technology has, after all, long been used in professional tennis tournaments, starting with the Next Gen ATP Finals in 2018. It has been four years since the Australian Open became the first grand slam to utilise the technology and this year, for the first time, the men’s tour, the ATP, is using ELC at all of its events. Although all other men’s clay-court events use ELC, the French Open is now the only grand slam that still employs human line judges.Instead of this year offering Wimbledon to step into the future, however, the All England LawnTennisClub (AELTC) has spent the first eight days of the tournament defending its implementation of the technology, which is enhanced by artificial intelligence.For the first five days of the tournament the most significant blows were the parting shots from Jack Draper and Emma Raducanu, the men’s and women’s British No 1 players, whoeach criticised the ELC systemfollowing their defeats. Both players believed they had been subjected to incorrect calls. “It’s kind of disappointing, the tournament here, that the calls can be so wrong, but for the most part they’ve been OK. It’s just, like, I’ve had a few in my other matches, too, that have been very wrong,” Raducanu said.View image in fullscreenJack Draper complains to the umpire after an electronic line call during his loss to Marin Cilic.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe AELTC maintained that the system was working optimally and that ELC remains considerably more accurate than the line judges it replaced. Wimbledon employs Hawk-Eye, one of numerous ELC providerswhich uses a system that incorporates 10 cameras placed around the court, and which track the bounce of the ball. Hawk-Eye states that its margin of error is 2.2mm. Wimbledon had previously used ELC only as a safety net, allowing players to challenge calls conducted by line judges.“It’s funny, because when we did have linesmen, we were constantly asked why we didn’t have electronic line-calling because it’s more accurate,” Debbie Jevans, the chair of the AELTC, told the BBC.Then came a disastrous series of events on Centre Court.As Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova held game pointon her serve at 4-4 in the first set against Sonay Kartal on Sunday, a backhand from Kartal clearly flew long but it was not called out. After a lengthy delay, it emerged that some of the ELC cameras had not been functional on Pavlyuchenkova’s side of the court for some time during the game. The umpire Nico Helwerth opted to replay the point. Around 10 minutes later, after losing that service game, Pavyluchenkova faced a set point on Kartal’s serve.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pavlyuchenkova, who told Helwerth the tournament had “stolen” the game from her, recovered to win both the set and the match, limiting the significance of the error. The AELTC announced in a statement on Sunday night that the ELC had been accidentally deactivated on Pavlyuchenkova’s side of the court by one of the operators running the system.Bright on Monday morning, the Wimbledon chief executive, Sally Bolton, fielded a contentious scheduled meeting with the media, which was almost entirely centred around ELC. Bolton asserted repeatedly that the mistake was purely down to human error, that the protocols had been changed to prevent a similar issue and that ELC has otherwise been working accurately during the tournament. At the very least, the situation with Pavlyuchenkova also underlined the importance of having contingency plans for when technology fails, including the possibility of umpires using video replay.Since the implementation of ELC, player reaction has largely been positive as it was rolled out on hard courts, with players recognising the greater accuracy provided by the system compared to human errors. However, after numerous dramatic moments during the clay-court season, as some players were frustrated with the differences between the ball marks and the ELC’s judgments, the first week of ELC at Wimbledon has been a difficult one. It is clear that faith in its implementation on the surface has diminished and both privately and publicly, players and coaches have expressed scepticism about its accuracy. As the tournament moves into the latter stages, it remains to be seen if that faith will be restored.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonTennisanalysisShareReuse this content"

Mexico won its second consecutive Concacaf Gold Cup trophy in a heated final with the United States in Houston’s NRG Stadium on Sunday. The oddly angular cup will be tucked into Mexico’s federation trophy case next toEl Tri’s first Concacaf Nations League title, lifted in March. The program was unquestionably on top of Concacaf before the Gold Cup – now that it’s over, they still are.If anything is changing, it’s the momentum in Mexico’s favor.The 2-1 victory over the United Statesmen’s national team was the first time the Mexicans vanquished their arch-rivals in six years – minus one day.Yet for the US, it feels like a fair few thingshavechanged over the course of the last month, altering a projected 2026 World Cup roster quite substantially with 340 days to run and zero competitive games left.Mexico beat USA in Gold Cup final as Pochettino decries ‘embarrassing’ penalty no-callRead moreThe USMNT stumbled into the Gold Cup on the back of a disastrous Nations League and a pair of all-too-simple defeats to Turkey and Switzerland on the eve of the tournament.Absent star forward Christian Pulisicand a raft of other stalwarts like Weston McKennie, Antonee Robinson, Sergiño Dest and basically any striker with a track record, expectations and enthusiasm had sagged to a low not seen in the better part of a decade.But on their way to the final, the US rediscovered the moxie and intensity it had misplaced more than a year ago.“When you lose a trophy, it’s really, really painful,” the US manager, Mauricio Pochettino, told reporters afterward, after lamenting what he saw asseveral suspect refereeing decisionsthat went against them. “But the most important thing is to have our head up because I think the tournament was fantastic. We keep going, [this] is the way we want to build our journey to the World Cup. In this way, I have no doubt, we’re going to be really, really competitive.”With what was in effect a B-team, the Americans found their fight and, along the way, a fair few players who may call into question the spots and roles of the men they filled in for.“We found a very good group of players with the desire and the open mind to learn and to prove [themselves],” Pochettino said before the game. “I need to say thank you to the players, because from day one they created an unbelievable atmosphere on the team – never one problem, never one issue between them.”View image in fullscreenMauricio Pochettino was incensed at a few refereeing decisions in the Gold Cup final.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesThis assessment stood in stark contrast to Pochettino’s postmortem on the Nations League camp, when he accused the players of taking more interest in playing golf, going out for a meal or seeing family and friends than on performing on the field.This is where the roster watch gets interesting. Pochettino demonstrated throughout the Gold Cup that he’s unmoved by players’ pedigrees, starting NYCFC’s Matt Freese in goal over Premier Leaguer Matt Turner and his 52 caps. Or relying on young and barely proven Major League Soccer players over Brenden Aaronson, who, like Turner, is a 2022 World Cup veteran and has his own half century of appearances. The Argentinian coach was entirely comfortable handing the keys to the likes of Diego Luna, the little-tested Real Salt Lake spitfire, and was repaid for his faith.If this Gold Cup squad was sort of an aberration of circumstance – Pulisic decided to rest; Robinson decided to get knee surgery; Dest wasn’t fit; McKennie, Tim Weah and Gio Reyna were committed to the Club World Cup instead, and so on – something impressive grew in the void.“There’s been a lot of success this summer, how the team has grown,” said Chris Richards, who scored in the final and finally put one of the starting center-back positions in a headlock going forward. “If you look at the overall theme of the whole camp, it’s been a summer full of growth.”Tim Ream, the grizzled 37-year-old veteran defender and somehow very much a candidate for next summer’s team, saw a spirit lost some time ago regained over the course of five weeks spent together. “It was an opportunity to grow as players, to grow as people, to create a togetherness that we’ve maybe lacked in a lot of moments in the past six months to a year,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s the latest in the Kingdom’s soft power campaign | Karim ZidanRead moreCertainly, the US was fairly dominated in yesterday’s final. You might point out that Jorge Sánchez committed a clear handball in his own box (as Pochettino did) and that Mario Escobar’s refereeing was shaky. But the Mexicans entirely deserved their title, and not just because the goals by Raúl Jiménez and Edson Álvarez were both pretty and well worked. While the US produced several scrambles in front of the Mexican goal through sheer stubbornness, their opponents were largely in control. Pochettino was perhaps too slow to react asEl Tritightened the screws on his overmatched team.Here’s the glass-half-full view: Mexico competed with its A team, the squad likely to go to the World Cup. Yet the US gave them a good game before an overwhelmingly pro-Mexican crowd even without most of its attacking weapons. The abundance of joy and relief spilling fromEl Triafter its goals and on the final whistle was telling.Just over the course of this tournament, the US finally figured out how to utilize attacking midfielder Malik Tillman, witnessed the breakout of Luna, surprised all observers with the emergence of Sebastian Berhalter and Freese, and witnessed flashes of promise in forwards Patrick Agyemang and Damion Downs.You wouldn’t blame for Pochettino for thinking of the core of this group as his full national team at present and resist the temptation to revert to the missing men. Certainly, this team is desperate for the forward thrust brought by Robinson and Dest, Pulisic’s dribbling and a semi-reliable goalscorer. Yet Tillman clearly deserves a regular place, as does Luna. With in-form options in short supply, Freese may very well be the incumbent goalkeeper now. A few others so far on the outside a month ago that they could barely even see a path to the World Cup may well be in the mix.Pochettino, for his part, pushed back on the assumption that the absentees will walk right back into the team after the game. “You already made the list?” he snapped back when a reporter asked him how he will reintegrate the likes of Pulisic, McKennie, etc. “Or you asked artificial intelligence to do the roster for next time?”This Gold Cup, then, was an unexpectedly productive exercise. If nothing else, it put pressure on a band of national team players that was anointed and never questioned again. The US may have lost a trophy on Sunday, but it gained a new intensity to the competition for places. And that might be worth more at the World Cup.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond (Jonathan Wilson himself is on vacation right now)Subscribe for free here.Have a question?

Shall we generously call that half a point out of three? Certainly you would struggle to mark Arsenal too highly on courage or intrinsic goodliness right now. But the unhappycase of Thomas Parteyillustrates the lengths to which they are willing to go to champion one of their own.You knew. I knew. Rival fans knew, even if their taunting of Partey was always delivered with the sort of gleeful relish that does not exactly scream concern for the alleged victims of sexual violence. And so of course did the staff and board of Arsenal; knew the man with whom they shared a workplace and a dressing room until last week, knew what he was accused of doing.Thomas Partey, former Arsenal footballer, charged with rape and sexual assaultRead moreCare, compassion and discretion are of course utterly vital at this point. The charging of Partey on 4 July means the accusations against him will finally be heard in court in early August: five counts of rape, and one of sexual assault, involving three separate women between 2021 and 2022. Partey’s lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire of Hickman and Rose, referred in a statement to her client now “welcoming the opportunity to finally clear his name”.And it is the word “finally” that stands out here: an acknowledgment of the protracted and often painful three-year process that has brought us to this point, during which Partey was the word English football dared not speak.Wiltshire, of course, is deeply familiar with such matters. She was also employed by the Manchester City player Benjamin Mendy,who was cleared in 2023of seven charges of rape, one of attempted rape and one of sexual assault. “She has often achieved positive results for her clients long before the charge stage,” reads her corporate bio. “This has caused her to be much in demand by high‑profile clients seeking a swift and discreet resolution to what, if made public, would be highly damaging allegations.”All of which is an acknowledgment that there is always a wider consideration to such cases: establishing a verdict and getting to the truth, but also managing the optics and reputations. Partey denies all the charges against him. There is no sense in prejudging the outcome of his case before all the facts come to light. The presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are important legal principles in this country.But the presumption of shining personal virtue is not, and many of Arsenal’s actions over the past three years give the impression of an organisation not simply content to employ Partey, but positively proud of doing so. Who seriously considered – at the urging of coach Mikel Arteta – offering a new contractand extending his stayat the Emirates Stadium beyond last Monday. Who regarded their talented central midfielder not as an alleged rapist but as a man to be lauded and celebrated, perhaps even a kind of victim himself.View image in fullscreenMikel Arteta continually emphasised the importance of Thomas Partey and wanted to extend the midfielder’s contract.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APThree months after being arrested for the first time, and about a year after Arsenal were first made aware of a rape allegation against him, Partey scored a thumping goal against Tottenham in the north London derby. Afterwards, Arteta said: “For what he’s been through, and the injuries, and the effort that he put in this week, to be available for the team, I’m so happy for him. He deserves it.”Over the subsequent years Partey would play more than 100 times for Arsenal. His goals would earn them four points in the Premier League; his defensive work probably earned them many more. His collision with Rodri in which the Spaniard injured knee ligaments may well have had a decisive influence on the 2024‑25 title. Meanwhile Arteta would continually lionise Partey’s importance to Arsenal on the pitch, and towards the end of last season reiterated that he wanted Partey to stay.Obviously it would have been legally complex for Arsenal to terminate Partey’s contract before criminal charges had been laid. But of course there are steps that it is perfectly reasonable for a club to take against a player that do not require an absolute burden of criminal proof. Richly talented footballers such as Mesut Özil and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang were quietly moved towards the exit for perceived off-field failings. Last year a kit manager called Mark Bonnickwas sacked for social media postshe wrote about Israel.View image in fullscreenPierre-Emerick Aubameyang was moved towards the exit door by Arsenal for perceived off-field failings.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAAnd there were plenty of legally unproblematic options available to Arsenal here that might have offered a certain comfort to the fans now feeling a sense of betrayal at the actions of the club they love. You do not, for example, have to praise him on social media. You do not have to pay tribute to his character or resilience after “what he’s been through”. You do not have to play him 108 times or spend much of June deliberating over whether he is worth a new contract.Who at the club made these calls and why? Who knew what, when? Who spoke out and who did not? And in supporting him so unconditionally, was it in fact Arsenal who are guilty of prejudging Partey’s case long before a jury would ever get the chance? Arsenal fans deserve answers, but it appears none are forthcoming for now. “Due to ongoing legal proceedings the club is unable to comment on the case,” they said in a statement.And perhaps in terms of the PR, this is Arsenal’s best strategy right now: say nothing, do nothing, and hope the whole storm passes. There is a new figurehead at the base of midfield, and quite apart from being a better and younger player Martín Zubimendi offers the sensation of renewal, of turning the page, perhaps even a kind of purgation. The women are champions of Europe and will play all their home league games at the Emirates next season. There are always happier, simpler stories to tell, and Arsenal will never get tired of telling those.Naturally we should be wary of singling out Arsenal here. There is, or should be, no room for tribal triumphalism. Many other clubs would have acted similarly in similar circumstances. In a sense Arsenal’s business-as-usual stance over the past three years is simply one of the defining characteristics of end-stage capitalism, one in which big companies ruthlessly pursue the bottom line while trumpeting their virtue.We are courageous in the pursuit of progress. We champion our community and each other. We do the right thing (even when no one is looking). This is the moral creed of Arsenal. Their fans are still waiting for them to deliver on it.Explore more on these topicsArsenalcommentShareReuse this content"

I almost lost my shoe and there was nothing I could do.”With the Tour’s top sprinter out of the race, there was little else to write home about. Certainly none of the 38-man French contingent in this year’s peloton were showing much spirit as the afternoon wore on, and the absence of any breakaway only emphasised the soporific nature of the racing.So uneventful was the stage that there was no “prix de combativité” awarded, for the most attacking rider. Meanwhile, the defending champion, Tadej Pogacar, was happy to see one of his key lieutenants Tim Wellens slide off the front of the peloton on the approach to the stage’s sole climb, the fourth category Mont Cassel.Wellens’ brief sortie ensured that the lead in the climber’s classification stayed within the UAE Emirates XRG team, with Pogacar himself seeming to enjoy the novelty of wearing polka dots, instead of yellow, for a day. “I’ve only worn it once in six editions of the Tour,” the Slovenian said of the distinctive climber’s jersey.But while Pogacar seems carefree, the dynamic at Jonas ­Vingegaard’s Visma Lease-a-bike team is ­growing complicated after the double Tour winner’s wife, Trine Hansen Vingegaard Hansen, expressed fears that her husband is close to burnout. Trine Vingegaard Hansen, her husband’s personal manager, who is following the race with the couple’s two young children, said: “I’m afraid he’s burning the candle at both ends. I think people sometimes forget the human being behind the athlete.”View image in fullscreenThe peloton cycles under decorative streamers hung above the race route in Aire-sur-la-Lys.Photograph: Marco Bertorello/AFP/Getty ImagesVingegaard’s team management was quick to counter. “The ­sacrifice is necessary – Jonas knows that more than anybody else,” the sports ­director, Grischa Niermann, said. “With the Tour preparation, he was away from home a lot, but that’s also why he’s in this shape now.“We have very good cohesion with Jonas, but also his family – by ­preparing him, how we prepared him, he is in the shape that he is now.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When he’s at the start of a race, there’s no doubt about who the leader is.”Asked about his wife’s comments, Vingegaard, who was present when the interview took place in the Alpine ski station of Tignes, prior to the Tour, said: “I haven’t ­actually read the article, I’ve just heard something about it, so I’m not 100% sure what it says.“Of course, it’s a lot of training camps and altitude camps during the year, so of course it’s hard on family life,” he said. “But I’m still riding and I haven’t felt burnout yet.”Tuesday’s fourth stage takes the ­convoy towards the Somme for a stage from Amiens, with three climbs in the final 21km, to Rouen.Meanwhile, in Italy, Anna Henderson, of Lidl-Trek, silver medallist for Team GB in the Paris Olympics, took her first World Tour stage win and the race leader’s pink jersey, in the women’s Giro d’Italia.

There is natural ability in abundance. She is also an example of what technically gifted women’s players can be when given elite-level coaching from a young age. She is an example of what is to come, an outlier among her peers, having benefited from her father, Nigel, being a Uefa-qualified coach with his own coaching programme that is, in his own words, “about pure ball mastery and delivery with panache, to ultimately create elite technicians of the game”.James is effusive about her father’s input into her career, saying on the Nigel James Elite Coaching website that she is “grateful to my dad for all the time, effort and love that he has put into my football by coaching me in order to help me reach the very best level and fulfil my full potential”.‘We thrive under pressure’: Hemp defiant despite England’s losing startRead moreWhether in training or in a match, James stands out. In England’s open training session before their Euro 2025 send-off game against Jamaica on 29 June, the Chelsea forward was electric, despite not having played for three months because of a hamstring injury, gliding and shifting with the ball at her feet like she had never been away.Against Jamaica, it took only eight minutes after James’s introduction as a substitute for her to make an impression, providing a pinpoint cross for Alessia Russo to nod in.Sarina Wiegman’s decision to start James against France inEngland’s tournament openeron Saturday was not a surprise. Indeed, many would consider it a risk worth taking because, ultimately, even a semi-fit James is a better creative outlet than many of the squad’s fully fit players. Constructing the team in a way that draws the best out of her is a logical course of action.England desperately need James’s creative edge, her unpredictability, the fear she is able to strike into opposition players as she runs at them, her weight shifting, her movements fluid, opponents left fumbling and stumbling in her wake. Against France that dynamism and threat was evident from the off, James firing over 39 seconds into the contest, leaving France breathing a sigh of relief.However, England have a problem regarding where to play James. The Lionesses’ midfield was overrun against France, Georgia Stanway and Keira Walsh struggling with the physicality and pressing game of their opponents, with Sakina Karchaoui particularly influential for Laurent Bonadei’s side. And with James in the No 10 role instead of Ella Toone or Grace Clinton, there was clear disruption to the Lionesses’ unit in the middle of the pitch.View image in fullscreenSandy Baltimore scores France’s second goal, putting the game beyond England.Photograph: Harry Langer/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockA structured midfield is what England are used to operating with under Wiegman. James, on the other hand, is most effective when given a free role and allowed to run at defences from central or wide positions. She is less of a traditional attacking player than Beth Mead, Lauren Hemp or Chloe Kelly. As such, England are trying to fit a square peg into a round hole and it is not quite working.How should England move forward after the defeat against France, beginning with the game against the Netherlands here in Zurich on Wednesday?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But how to get the best out of her in the present is undeniably a tricky and pressing question. Does she start or is she a super sub? It is an unenviable dilemma for all concerned, Wiegman in particular, to wrestle with and quickly solve.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballcommentShareReuse this content"

Each time the surfers fell and were swept downstream, they would swim back upstream, to try their luck again, adjacent to the tournament fan zone.The scene proved rather reminiscent of Belgium trying to resist wave after wave of Spanish attacks in the second half, but it felt as though every time Belgium clawed themselves back into the match, a fresh torrent of Spanish brilliance swept them away again.Alexia Putellas began the relentless scoring when she rounded off a neat team move, after superb play from Vicky López, to clinically tuck the ball home.Justine Vanhaevermaet briefly stunned the pre-tournament favourites as she headed in from a corner, but Spain were soon back in front when Irene Paredes headed in to make it 2-1, towards the end of a first half where Olga Carmona had also driven a powerful strike narrowly wide.View image in fullscreenClaudia Pina scores Spain’s stunning fifth goal.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/ReutersThe crowd were momentarily sensing a monumental shock might be on the cards, when Hannah Eurlings sprinted in behind Spain’s defence and slotted in, but almost immediately after the restart, Esther González met Putellas’s outstanding pass to restore Spain’s lead and make it 3-2.By this point, the Ballon d’Or winner Aitana Bonmatí, still returning carefully to full fitness after contracting viral meningitis before the tournament, had been brought on as a half-time substitute and she was showing her usual creativity and style in midfield.Her head coach, Montse Tomé, said: “Aitana could play but I think we must be patient. According to the medical team, she is fine, but we don’t want to risk her. As we have other players who allow us to keep the level. I believe Aitana will be 100%.”Spain were mounting pressure and shortly after the hour Mariona Caldentey tucked in from close range, before a marvellous strike from Clàudia Pina in the 81st minute, curled into the far corner from distance, made it 5-2 with a goal that will undoubtedly be included in the goal‑of-the-tournament shortlist.Putellas said of Pina’s strike: “Her goal was special, as always. Honestly, she’s so good, it was a perfect goal, it was impossible to stop it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m glad for her and also for the rest of the team.”Gunnarsdóttir, appeared crestfallen by her team’s fate but was also proud of their endeavour in attack.

In a breathtaking conclusion to the match, Cristiana Girelli thought she had sent Italy through to the quarter-finals. Francisco Neto’s side piled on the pressure in the final stages, however, and equalised in the 89th minute to ensure their dreams of progress remained alive.“We were solid, we were brave,” said a delighted Neto. “We played high, pressed our opponents, and played like a team in the European Championship. We’re a team with personality and ambition. It’s not easy when you’re losing, then you score but it’s disallowed again, and then score again! I’m very proud.”Putellas at the double as rampant Spain hit rain-soaked Belgium for six at Euro 2025Read more“The last words I told my players was to play, to have fun,” he continued. “Playing in a European Championship is a privilege. They’re friends, they want to do things for each other. As a team, they really rise to the challenge.”There had been contrasting fortunes on the opening day for both. While Italy earned a hard-fought victory over Belgium, Portugal had suffered a morale-sapping defeat against Spain. This was not quite last chance saloon for Neto’s side but almost, knowing they must avoid defeat to avoid elimination.It was most likely for this reason that the Portuguese manager rang the changes. Prior to this match, they had conceded 25 in the last five – a defensive record that will never bring success at this level. Goalkeeper Patrícia Morais came in for Inês Pereira to gain her 99th cap while Ana Borges and Joana Marchão brought considerable experience into defence. They were given a significant boost with the return of Kika Nazareth for the first time since suffering an ankle injury in March. The 22-year-old playmaker was making her long-awaited return against the side she made her senior international debut against just five years previous.Italy, meanwhile, had impressed against Belgium and manager Soncin stuck with the same team that had served them so well. Girelli had the armband once again, making her 121st appearance for her country.Portugal’s Borges and Andreia Jacinto had emphasised pre-match the need for a fast start. They were compact throughout the first half, repelling Italy’s advances and even dominated the ball without creating anything of real note. When they did break, Soncin’s well-drilled team dropped quickly to defend the space in behind and counter the speed of the likes of Diana Silva.View image in fullscreenCristiana Girelli prepares to curl the ball around Diana Gomes and put Italy 1-0 up.Photograph: Pier Marco Tacca/FIGC/Getty ImagesLe Azzurre, in contrast created the best opportunities. Girelli was at the heart of the action and forced a world-class stop from Morais before turning a Manuela Giugliano cross wide.Portugal rode their luck at times. Cecilia Salvai came so close to making her mark after missing the last three major tournaments with injury but saw her header agonisingly crash off the bar. Emma Severini had a goal ruled out for offside before the Portugal goalkeeper was on hand once again to keep her team in the contest. When Girelli met Sofia Cantore’s low cross, the ball looked destined for the back of the net but Morais instinctively stuck out a foot. She turned fist-pumping to the fans behind the goal, celebrating as if she had scored.The second half was a quiet affair until the game burst into life with 20 minutes left.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Diana Silva thought she had levelled when she turned a rebound effort home only for a lengthy VAR check to rule it out for offside.Not to be deterred, Portugal continued to push forward and finally got their rewards thanks to a sweetly guided finish from Diana Gomes with a minute left on the clock. Jubilant celebrations followed as Neto’s side breathed fresh life into their campaign.There was still time for Ana Borges to receive a second yellow but it mattered little as Portugal go into their final game against Belgium knowing they have the chance to reach the knockouts.

After a standoff that has lasted weeks and driven Gyökeres to distraction, the clubs are in constructive dialogue and close to bringing the saga to an end.Mikel Arteta has made a new No 9 his priority during a pivotal summer forArsenaland he has had Gyökeres on his shortlist, together with RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko. If the manager has not had the encouragement he might have wanted over Sesko, the picture has been different and more clear-cut on Gyökeres, with Sporting saying they would sell for €80m – less than the value of his €100m buyout clause – and standing by the position.‘There is no one like him’: what Martín Zubimendi will bring ArsenalRead moreGyökeres, who has scored prolifically for Sporting since his £20.5m move from Coventry in the summer of 2023, has been clear he wants to sign for Arsenal. The 27-year-old’spersonal terms have been agreed. They were never likely to be an issue; the obstacle has been an agreement between the clubs.Arteta wants the deal wrapped quickly, ideally before Arsenal depart for their tour of Asia on Saturday week to play Milan, Newcastle and Tottenham. Gyökeres is scheduled to return to pre-season at Sporting on Friday. It has been reported in Portugal that he is unwilling to turn up, such is his determination to force through the move to Arsenal.Sporting’s record sale is the deal that took Bruno Fernandes to Manchester United in January 2020; the agreement was €55m plus €25m in add-ons. They have been intent on rivalling that with Gyökeres, who has three years to run on his contract.The Sweden international has been a sensation at Sporting, scoring 97 goals in 102 appearances. He has helped them to back-to-back league titles and, in this past campaign, to the Portuguese Cup.Arsenal have signed the goalkeeperKepa Arrizabalaga for £5mfrom Chelsea and the midfielder Martín Zubimendi for £56m from Real Sociedad.

There was also a bright cameo from João Pedro, who came on for Liam Delap just after Estêvão’s equaliser early in the second half and proceeded to change the game with his brawn and intelligent link-up play.It was an eye-catching performance from the forward given that his£60m move to Chelseahad been announced two days earlier. What had the 23‑year‑old been doing during his time off? Lifting logs and existing on a diet of raw steak, presumably. The aggression from João Pedro was startling. He was raring to go after a couple of training sessions with his new teammates and, while he was not involved in the winning goal, his bustling forward play was a vital part of Chelsea reasserting their dominance after Palmeiras pulled the score back to 1-1.“Even if he was on holiday, he looks sharp, he looks good,” Enzo Maresca said. João Pedro, who was wanted by Newcastle beforeChelseacame in for him, did not slack off while waiting for Brighton to sell him. He stayed in shape after going to Rio de Janeiro on holiday.Fifa cuts ticket price to $13.40 for Club World Cup semi-final between Chelsea and FluminenseRead more“I was in Brazil with my friends but I have a personal trainer and I trained, so I was ready,” João Pedro said on Monday. “Imagine if I didn’t train and Chelsea called me to come – then it would be more difficult for me. I made my debut and I think I showed I am ready. In Brazil the Club World Cup is very important because normally the teams there don’t play teams from Europe. I will always take this tournament seriously.”Such dedication from João Pedro meant Nicolas Jackson was shoved to the margins against Palmeiras. It is possible to read too much into one substitution. Equally it is possible that Maresca’s decision to introduce the newcomer instead of Jackson offered clues about the new hierarchy in Chelsea’s attack. There was already a new contender for a starting role up front afterthe arrival of Delapfrom Ipswich for £30m. The 22-year-old has been sharp in the US. He has started the past four games, scoring once, and seems to have moved above Jackson in the pecking order.With Delap serving a one-game ban after picking up his second booking of the tournament against Palmeiras it is not clear who starts in Tuesday’s semi-final against Fluminense. The pressure on Jackson is rising. Suspended for two games after a recklessred card against Flamengoduring the group stage, the Senegal striker watched Delap impress in his absence. More worrying for Jackson, though, is that he was back in the squad against Palmeiras and overlooked when Maresca took Delap off.Jackson has a lot to prove given that he was alsosent off for elbowing Newcastle’s Sven Botmanat the end of last season and will still be out when the Premier League campaign starts. The 24-year-old is a handful but immaturity blights his game. A sale cannot be ruled out if Chelsea receive a good offer. They need to generate funds after being fined by Uefafor breaching financial rules.It makes João Pedro’s instant involvement feel significant. He was signed for his versatility and is a team player. His goal return at Brighton was no more than acceptable – 30 in 70 games – but he was respected for his pressing and link-up play.View image in fullscreenJoão Pedro speaks to journalists in the runup to Chelsea’s Club World Cup semi-final against Fluminense, where the forward started his career.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/FIFA/Getty ImagesIt goes back to João Pedro’s spell as a youth player at Fluminense, who switched him from defensive to attacking midfield. Watford brought him to England in 2019 and sold him to Brighton three years later. He will be eager to face his former club. Fluminense have the oldest team at the Club World Cup. Fábio, their goalkeeper, is 44. Thiago Silva, the former Chelsea centre-back, is 40.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionSilva spoke fondly of Chelsea here. The veteran may look to exploit his old side’s youth, though. Perhaps Silva will try to get a rise out of Jackson or João Pedro. It is worth noting that Jackson is not the only Chelsea striker with a history of disciplinary issues. Delap puts himself about and picked up 13 yellow cards in all competitions last season. As for João Pedro, he saw redfor violent conduct against Brentfordin April and could have been sent off against the same opponents after anattempted elbow on Yehor Yarmolyuklast December.Competitive edge? Maybe, but there was also an altercation with the Brighton centre-back Jan Paul van Hecke in training, which led to João Pedro missing the final game of last season. “The people who know me know my character,” João Pedro said. “But when two players want to win, these things happen.”Maresca needs that aggression to be channelled in the right way. Having three talented young forwards could be seen as a form of insurance policy if they keep getting suspended on rotation but the reality is that Delap, Jackson and João Pedro will not be helping themselves or Chelsea if they keep falling foul of referees.It is Delap’s turn to sit this one out and watch someone take his place. João Pedro and Jackson will be desperate to put themselves forward before the final on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

STOPSFootball Daily would prefer not to have to think about Copa Gianni at all but we have a certain professional obligation to do so and have never knowingly been found shirking in the face of our responsibilities. To keep things simple, we prefer to view the tournament as a stand-alone competition that’s taking place between the end of the last season and the beginning of the next one, but the fact that it’s being contested by clubs instead of countries leaves plenty of room for debate. Watching Kingsley Coman “sprint” on to a through-ball from Harry Kane during Bayern Munich’s defeat by PSG as if he was running in knee-deep wet cement, we were presented with the sight of a player in next season’s kit who was quite clearly exhausted by the exertions of the one that may or may not have ended before the tournament in which he was playing started. Does the goal he didn’t score go down in the official xG column of last season, next season, or neither?If as seems likely, Copa Gianni goes down in the official record books as part of last season, then it will overlap with European football’s next season, which officially starts … on Tuesday! Designed in part by Fifa to disrupt and devalue the gleaming jewel in Uefa’s crown, it will go down as a matter of historical record that last season’s Copa Gianni will conclude at the end of the same week next season’s Bigger Cup began. Over the next two days no fewer than 28 teams will line up to play in Bigger Cup qualifiers, with The New Saints, Shelbourne and Linfield representing Wales, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland respectively. And while it would be little short of a miracle for any of the three sides to make it to Bigger Cup proper, at least one of Shels and Linfield will make it into the next qualifying round because they’ve been paired against each other.Until very recently managed by Damien Duff, who won the League of Ireland Premier Division with them last season before resigning a couple of weeks ago following a typically forthright but extremely coruscating public take-down of his players, Shels will be managed by Duff’s former assistant turned replacement, Joey O’Brien. “He made his call and then it was up to me to make my call and I did,” said the former Bolton Wanderer of his decision to take over from his pal. “Hopefully we can write new memories again. With the players, we have a great squad. Great lads. That’s why I wanted to hang around.” While fans of both Shels and Linfield had almost certainly hoped for a more exotic Bigger Cup away trip than a two-hour coach trip up and down the M1 to Belfast or Dublin respectively, the good news is that the winners can look forward to an away day in Baku, Azerbaijan. Qarabag await the victors and are a team the Northern Irish side and their manager, David Healy, have faced before in what is now known as Bigger Vase.Meanwhile in Wales, they’ll be dancing on the streets of The New Saints if the famous side formerly known as Total Network Solutions can see off North Macedonia’s Shkendija to tee up what looks certain to be a second qualifying round tie against FCSB, the even more famous side formerly known as Steaua Bucharest. While TNS are well aware Shkendija is a tough place to go having lost there 5-0 seven years ago, their manager Craig Harrison is hopeful they can exact some revenge. “It’s going to be a really tough game out there,” blathered the former Middlesbrough defender. “It’s going to be really hot and humid and it will be like it was in Montenegro against Decic.” Decic, of course, being the team TNS beat at this stage of Bigger Cup at the start of last season. Unless, of course, it was the end of the season before.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Sarah Rendell for Euro 2025 updates onSpain 4-0 Belgiumat 5pm (BST), while Will Unwin will be on hand at 8pm for Portugal 1-1 Italy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He knew, there and then, that hisWimbledonwas over and after a brief medical timeout, off the court, he returned in tears, before shaking Sinner’s hand.Cameron Norrie vows to stay vocal as Carlos Alcaraz awaits at WimbledonRead moreThe Italian goes through to a ­quarter-final against Ben Shelton, the big-serving American who advanced to the last eight at ­Wimbledon for the first time with an entertaining four‑set win against Lorenzo ­Sonego of Italy. It was not, of course, the way Sinner wanted to go through, but he lives on and maybe now he will believe the tennis gods are on his side.“I don’t take this as a win at all, this is just an unfortunate moment for us to witness,” the world No 1 said. “He has struggled in grand slams with injuries a lot so seeing him again with this injury is very tough. We all saw by his reaction how much he cares about the sport and he is one of the hardest working players on tour. This is not the end we wanted to see and it’s very sad. If there was a chance for him to be in the next round he would deserve it. I hope he has a speedy recovery.”It was brutal on Dimitrov, who had hit 36 winners, controlling the match in every way, but the incident means he has now pulled out through injury in each of the past five grand slam tournaments.View image in fullscreenGrigor Dimitrov acknowledges the Centre Court crowd at the conclusion of his match with Jannik Sinner.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was Sinner who seemed to be struggling physically early in the match, rubbing his right elbow at times and later, early in the second set, taking a timeout of his own. After the walkover, the Italian said he would be checking the elbow, ­probably with an MRI scan, to see if it was anything serious after slipping early on and banging it in the first game. “I felt it quite a lot, especially [on my] serve and forehand,” he said. “So let’s see. Tomorrow we are going to check to see how it is.”The 34-year-old Dimitrov was playing the tennis of his life before his injury, dominating Sinner with brilliant serving – he lost just eight points on first serve – and beautiful slices that took the Italian out of his comfort zone.Dimitrov had been to the ­quarter‑finals only once before, in 2014, the yearhe beat Andy ­Murrayon the way to the last four. But for two and a bit sets, he was right at his very best. Some of his volleys were Roger Federer-like and even the great man, watching in the royal box, approved. Dimitrov has always had an abundance of talent, more options than most players, so many choices at his hand, and Sinner was forced into a series of uncharacteristic errors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another early break put him in charge in the second but ­Sinner looked to have turned it around when he broke back for 5-5. Dimitrov broke again to move ahead and served out to double his lead.The roof was closed at the end of the second set, something Sinner would have been happy with, taking away the wind that had made life difficult. At 2-2, the drama happened. Dimitrov began the game serving and volleying, as he had done many times before, and hit his 14th ace, only to fall to the court immediately, ­clutching his right pectoral muscle. The pain was clear for everyone to see. Sinner came straight to his aid but it was obvious, even then, that nothing could be done. When he returned, Dimitrov was in tears and had to be helped from the court.Shelton will present a big ­challenge too after coming through another hugely entertaining clash with ­Sonego. The pair produced magic, as they always do and, as has ­usually been the case, it was Shelton who came out on top to reach the quarter-finals here for the first time.The left-handed Shelton, who has made the semi-finals of the US Open and Australian Open, served rockets, carved angles and slashed winners all over the place as he claimed a 3-6, 6-1, 7-6 (1), 7-5 victory. It is 25 years since an American man – Pete Sampras – last won the title here, and the way Shelton plays makes him a threat.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Jannik SinnerWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The 63-year-old has confirmed he will stand for a second term and is poised to face off against Tim Mayer after the American announced his candidacy in the buildup to Sunday’s British Grand Prix.Tim Mayer accuses FIA president Ben Sulayem of ‘reign of terror’ after announcing candidacyRead moreA number of high-profile figures have left the FIA under Ben Sulayem’s stewardship. His deputy, Robert Reid, the former rally co-driver, resigned from his post earlier this year. Ben Sulayem has also had multiple run-ins with Formula One and the sport’s biggest stars, notably Lewis Hamilton overthe wearing of jewelleryin the cockpit, and Max Verstappenon swearing.Launching his bid to run against Ben Sulayem, Mayer, who was sacked as chair of the FIA stewards in November, took aim at the Emirati’s controversial leadership, describing it as “a failure” and an “illusion of integrity”. He also accused Ben Sulayem of marginalising women and rushing through statute amendments to enhance his power.In response, Ben Sulayem said: “I feel for people [who] say this. They are disconnected from the FIA. He [Mayer] has worked as a steward. A steward doesn’t mean you’re an insider of the FIA. You’re not staff. I have other things to do. I am really busy. I am not going to fall into this way of campaigning where I answer someone. He is free to say whatever he wants.“But the FIA is bigger than me, bigger than anyone. It’s not about the media. One thing is very clear. It is the members who vote. It’s not anyone who is here to have a vote. It’s them. If they decide they want me, or they want X, Y, Z, it’s up to them. And I know that whatever I’ve been doing is good for the members. I’ve been very straight with them.“Let’s wait for the general assembly and let’s see if they will get me out, then. They have the power to get me out. It’s about the members. And when I see them smiling. Maybe, I don’t know, maybe they’re smiling, truly or not, but it’s their decision.”Ben Sulayem initially clashed with F1 and the grid’s 10 teams over the introduction of an 11th outfit. However, Cadillac – a division of American motoring giant General Motors and supported by TWG Motorsport – will be on the grid next season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If there is another team from China, they will approve it 100% because it is good for business. Wouldn’t it make more money with China coming in? I believe, yes.

But the past year has shown there is room for growth in her game, with the player admitting she has mentally struggled. She is seeded No 8 here – low for her standards – and her most recent singles title came more than a year ago,at the 2024 French Open. Her first final of this season came at the end of last month at Bad Homburg, where she lost against Jessica Pegula in straight sets.Wimbledon 2025: Sinner v Dimitrov; Djokovic, Swiatek and Andreeva through – liveRead more“I’m doing a great job at learning how to play on grass,” said Swiatek. “It is the first time I feel comfortable.“I can move well on all the ­surfaces. On grass I just need to change the way I stop before the ball.Tennisis not the easiest sport when we have to switch surfaces so often but that’s what makes it interesting. Obviously it’s tougher when the expectations are high and people talk like you’re underperforming.”Tauson’s lack of serve against the world No 4 was her biggest downfall, with the player hitting only one ace to Swiatek’s four and having a lowly first-serve-points-won percentage of 64%.The Dane said she was operating at 30% due to illness and that she realistically needed to be at “110% to beat one of the best players in the world”.“I didn’t have any power in my legs or in my arm,” said Tauson. “Even when I was just trying to put the first serve in, I didn’t have any speed to keep it in the court.”View image in fullscreenClara Tauson receives medical assistance during her fourth-round match against Iga Swiatek.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APIt was surprising given she had enteredWimbledonranked second in the WTA for most aces served this year (223) and has served 28 aces at the tournament, the highest in the women’s singles. Her big first serves helped to bring about her first career win against a top-20 player on grass in the last round, defeating the 2022 champion, Elena Rybakina.It was a very strange opening to the match with three straight breaks to start. Swiatek hit four double faults in her first two service games to hand Tauson, who repeatedly complained to the chair umpire the court was too slippery, the advantage. Both players proceeded to hold to love with Swiatek showing off her close net action while Tauson aimed to hit big.After a scruffy game, Swiatek broke as the Dane’s booming forehands sailed long and then went ahead in the first set with a hold. Three more holds from the pair followed before Swiatek broke again to take the set, with Tauson beating her chest in frustration after hitting a forehand wide to hand the Pole the advantage before serving a double fault.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Pole hit the fastest serve of the match at 117mph to keep her serve and she looked a lot more settled than in the first set.In the next game, the former world No 1 looked incredibly frustrated after a close line call at her break point but she put her emotions to the side to win a stunning rally that had Tauson scrambling across the court. Another hold meant three games won in a row, sealed with two aces. She looked composed and as sure as she has been on the court in over a year, a stark comparison to Tauson, whose game was unravelling rapidly.Swiatek broke again with a ­backhand winner down the line before holding serve to fly into her second quarter-final at ­Wimbledon, only needing an hour and five ­minutes to finish the match off. She will face Liudmila Samsonova, the 19th seed who is yet to drop a set in the tournament.“She can play great,” said Swiatek on her next opponent. “We have played some tight matches. She’s a player that likes fast surfaces. She’s pretty experienced too so it’s going to be a challenge. I’ll just prepare the same way as before any other match and I’ll be ready.”Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025WimbledonIga SwiatekTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Beaten in the first round here a year ago, the 18-year-old Russian defeated Emma Navarro 6-2, 6-3 on Monday to reach the quarter-finals at ­Wimbledon for the first time, with the promise of much more to come.Taking the ball early to deny the American time, she changed the pace, as she loves to do, and manoeuvred her opponent into uncomfortable positions from which mistakes flowed. Andreeva is the youngest player to reach this stage at Wimbledon since the Czech Nicole Vaidisova in 2007 and on her Centre Court debut, with Roger Federer watching from the Royal Box, she was so much in the moment that she didn’t even realise she had won.“It’s something crazy,” said Andreeva, who will now play Belinda Bencic, the Swiss who also reached her first ­Wimbledon quarter-final, having become a mother in April last year.Cameron Norrie vows to stay vocal as Carlos Alcaraz awaits at WimbledonRead more“I was super-nervous, playing first time on Centre Court. I really tried my best not to look in the box because I knew that I would lose focus, as I did at 4-1 [in the second set], [when] I saw Roger and Mirka [his wife]. It’s been one of my dreams to see you in real life, so when I saw both of you I got really, really nervous. But I’m super-happy I managed to stay focused.”The great thing about young players is that they seem to improve almost week on week, improvements in their game appearing from one tournament to another. Coached by Conchita Martínez, the 1994 singles champion, Andreeva has been tipped for the top for a while but has really hit her stride this year, winning theMasters 1000 titlein Indian Wells.Her serve has also become a real weapon. She dropped only two points on first serve in the opening set, giving her the platform to show off her full game, from drop shots and angles to power and lobs.TennisIQ, they call it. She was 5-1 up before Navarro knew what had hit her and she closed it out two games later.A brilliant point, which ended with a flicked forehand pass, gave Andreeva the break in the opening game of the second set and though Navarro broke back immediately, the Russian broke twice more to open up a 4-1 lead. The American nabbed one of the breaks back but Andreeva then broke to love for victory, even if she didn’t know it at first.“I just kept telling myself I’m facing break points, tried to tell myself I’m not the one who’s up in the score,” she said. “I think that helped me to stay focused and in the end I completely forgot the score. I’m happy I did it because I think I would be three times more nervous on a match point.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Álvarez’s goal was initially ruled out for offside, but VAR intervened and determined that he was level with the last defender at the time Vásquez made contact, sparking jubilant celebrations on the field and in the stands.It also sparked an argument on the sideline from head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who was incensed that a penalty had not been given at the other end 10 minutes earlier. In that play, Mexico defender Jorge Sánchez put his hand on the ball while falling after making a tackle on Max Arfsten’s run into the penalty area.“For sure it’s penalty... he pushed the hand over the ball,” Pochettino told reporters afterward. “It’s not that the hand was on the floor & the ball touched.”Pochettino also insinuated that the officials were swayed by the pro-Mexico crowd.“The truth is if that happened in the opposite half, in the other box, for sure it’s a penalty,” he said. “Maybe it’s 2-1 for us and maybe we’re celebrating the trophy. I think that is clear. It’s not about to cry, it’s not about to complain, it’s not about to put excuses … For me, it was embarrassing to see that situation and it’s a shame. Because I understand that with 70,000 people, giving this penalty is not easy.”For the US, the loss brings to an end an uneven month, as a decidedly second-choice group of players at first looked below the standard in friendly losses to Turkey and Switzerland, then played better once the Gold Cup began and gained momentum throughout the tournament.Canada’s Gold Cup implosion leaves Jesse Marsch with more questions than timeRead moreThe team has had some players make a case for inclusion on next year’s World Cup roster – namely midfielders Malik Tillman and Diego Luna – while others like defender Chris Richards stepped up effectively into leadership roles. However, the loss will be viewed as something of a disappointment, as it is the United States’ final competitive game before kicking off the 2026 World Cup at home.In truth, the result wasn’t quite as close as the scoreline makes it appear. Mexico took 16 shots (eight on target) to the USA’s six and three. El Tri held possession 60% of the time, and earned 12 corners while holding the United States to zero of them.Richards opened the scoring early on with a header off a set piece that seemed to catch everyone, including the US, by surprise. Richards’ header came after the Crystal Palace defender swooped low between Mexico defenders and redirected the Sebastian Berhalter set piece with an upward motion. The ball clanged off the crossbar and bounced off the turf – over the line, in the estimation of the assistant referee and the VAR.The US had the advantage and momentum. They would spend the vast majority of the rest of the match hanging on for dear life.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The US, whose only entry into the Mexico penalty area early on came on their goal, could scarcely get out of their own half.The pressure paid off for Mexico in the 27th minute, when Raúl Jiménez netted the equalizer off a nice finish after a complete defensive breakdown from the US. From a tight angle in the penalty area and with Tim Ream fast approaching, the Fulham striker did well to launch a stinging strike past Matt Freese and into the roof of the net to make things 1-1. Jiménez’s celebrations were tinged with a tribute, as the striker produced a jersey with the name of Diogo Jota, the Liverpool forward who wastragically killedalong with his brother in a car accident last week. Jiménez and Jota were team-mates at Wolves from 2018 to 2020, and with the jersey laid in front of him, Jiménez sat on the pitch and mimed playing a video game – one of Jota’s signature celebrations.The pressure continued for Mexico, as did the wholesale domination of possession. “Olé”s rang through the crowd as early as the 30th minute as El Tri sprayed passes around. In the few instances when the US were able to get out on the break, the combination of Patrick Agyemang and Malik Tillman were out of sync more often than not.The US had one glimmer of hope at the end of the first half – a chaotic sequence just before the half-time whistle in which right-back Alex Freeman got on the end of a hopeful long-ball and won a header at goal, but only managed to hit the face of the onrushing Mexico goalkeeper Luis Malagón. The first half ended with Mexico holding a 5-0 edge in corner kicks, a 10-2 advantage in interceptions, and 298 passes to the USA’s 162.That trend continued in the second stanza. Roberto Alvarado missed a close chance at the near post in the 51st minute, then again in the 56th. By the 76th minute, Mexico had their breakthrough.Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsGold Cup 2025ShareReuse this content"

On Monday, Apple accused Brussels of making it deploy “confusing” business terms in order to avoid the threat of fines.“Today we filed our appeal because we believe the European Commission’s decision – and their unprecedented fine – go far beyond what the law requires,” said Apple, announcing an appeal to the general court, the second highest court in the EU. “As our appeal will show, the EC is mandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which are confusing for developers and bad for users.”Apple also accused the commission of unlawfully expanding the definition of “steering” – or the language and methods the company allows developers to use when guiding consumers outside its app stores.The company said officials on Brussels had changed the definition by, for instance, not just focusing on whether app developers should be allowed to link to an external website, but also on whether developers should be permitted to promote offers inside an app.Donald Trump’s senior trade adviser, Peter Navarro, has accused the EU of using “lawfare” against big US tech companies, describing the use of regulations against American companies such as Apple and Meta as part of a barrage of “non-tariff weapons” used for by foreign states against the US.Henna Virkkunen, theEuropean Commissionvice-president responsible for tech sovereignty, said in April that the EU will not rip up its tech rules in an attempt toagree a trade deal with the US. In January, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of the Facebook owner Meta, accused the EU of “institutionalising censorship” via its digital rules.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And you can still open it up to replace the memory, storage and internal components with a few simple screws.The Framework 12 is available in either DIY form, starting at £499 (€569/$549/A$909), or more conventional prebuilt models starting at £749. It sits under the £799-and-upLaptop 13and £1,399Laptop 16as the company’s most compact and affordable model.View image in fullscreenThe compact notebook is available in a range of two-tone colours, not just grey and black.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianWhere the Laptop 13 is a premium-looking machine, the Laptop 12 is unmistakably chunky and rugged with over-moulded plastic parts for shock protection. It is designed to meet the MIL-STD-810 standard common to rugged electronics. It looks and feels as if it could take a beating, not like a flimsy DIY kit you put together yourself.The glossy 12.2in screen is bright and relatively sharp. But it is highly reflective, has large black bezels around it and has a relatively narrow colour gamut, which means colours look a little muted. It’s decent enough for productivity but not great for photo editing. The touchscreen rotates all the way back on to the bottom of the machine to turn it into a tablet or it can be folded like a tent or parallel to the keyboard. The screen supports the use of a wide range of first and third-party styluses for drawing or notes, which could make it handy in the classroom.A selection of fun colours are available for the DIY version, further enhancing its college appeal. The 1080p webcam at the top is decent, although it won’t rival a Surface, and it has a physical privacy switch alongside the mics. The stereo speakers are loud and distortion-free but lack bass and a little clarity, sounding a little hollow compared with the best on the market.View image in fullscreenThe keyboard is nicely spaced, fairly quiet and pretty good to type on but lacks a backlight.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianAt 1.3kg the Laptop 12 isn’t featherweight but it is nice and compact, easy to fit in bags or on small desks. The generous mechanical trackpad is precise and works well. But the laptop lacks any form of biometrics, with no fingerprint or face recognition, forcing you to enter a pin or password every time you open the laptop or to use secure apps such as password managers, which gets old fast.SpecificationsScreen:12.2in LCD 1920x1200 (60Hz; 186PPI)Processor:Intel Core i3 or i5 (U-series, 13th gen)RAM:8 or 16GB (up to 48GB)Storage:512GB (up to 2TB)Operating system:Windows 11or LinuxCamera:1080p front-facingConnectivity:wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, headphones + choice of 4 ports: USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, ethernet, microSD, SDDimensions:287 x 213.9 x 18.5mmWeight:1.3kgModular ports and performanceView image in fullscreenThe expansion modules slide into sockets in the underside of the laptop to change the ports, which you can change at any time.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Laptop 12 comes with a choice of two Intel 13-generation U-series processors, which are lower-power chips from a few years ago. As tested with the mid-range i5-1334U it won’t win any raw performance awards but was generally up to the task of more than basic computing. It feels responsive in day-to-day tasks but struggles a bit in longer, processor-heavy jobs such as converting video.The older chip means the battery life is a little on the short side for 2025, lasting about seven to eight hours of light office-based work using browsers, word processors, note-taking apps and email. Use more demanding apps and the battery life shrinks by a few hours. The battery takes about 100 minutes to fully charge using a 60W or greater USB-C power adaptor.View image in fullscreenFour expansion cards can be fitted at any one time, but they can be swapped in and out without having to turn off the laptop.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe port selection is entirely customisable with a fixed headphone jack and four slots for expansion cards,which are availablein a choice of USB-A and USB-C, DisplayPort and HDMI, microSD and SD card readers, or ethernet. Other cards can add up to 1TB of storage and the USB-C cards are available in a range of solid or translucent colours to make things even brighter. It is an excellent system but note the Laptop 12 supports only USB 3.2 Gen 2, not the faster USB4/Thunderbolt common on new machines.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe high-quality plastic body with over-moulded sides feels well built and durable.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianFramework rates the battery to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for at least 1,000 full charge cycles. It caneasily be replacedalong with all therest of the components, including the RAM and SSD.Framework sells replacement parts and upgradesthrough its marketplacebut also supports third-party parts. The laptop contains recycled plastic in many components.PriceThe DIY edition of the Framework 12 starts at£499(€569/$549/A$909) with pre-built systems starting at£749(€849/$799/A$1,369) with Windows 11.For comparison, the DIY Framework 13 costs from£799and the DIY Framework 16 costs from£1,399. Similarly specced 2-in-1 Windows machines start at about £500.VerdictLike previous Framework machines, the Laptop 12 demonstrates that repairable, upgradable and adaptable computers are possible, work well and can be used by more than just the tech savvy. It manages to be fun in a way most mid-range PCs just aren’t.The keyboard is solid, the trackpad good and the speakers loud. The modular ports are a killer feature that every PC should embrace, while being able to repair or upgrade it easily is still so unusual. The touchscreen is bright but unremarkable, the lack of any biometrics is irritating, and the older processor, while still decently fast for everyday tasks, means the battery life isn’t long by modern standards.Its biggest problem is cost, as it is about £150-£200 more expensive than similarly specced but closed and locked-down machines. Unless you already have spare storage and RAM lying around, that’s the price you have to pay for the open and modular machine.Pros:swappable ports, repairable and upgradeable, fun and durable design, compact, lots of colour choices, solid keyboard and trackpad, solid performance for everyday tasks.Cons:battery life short of best, screen is bright but a little lacklustre, no biometrics, expensive, older processor, wait time for purchases.View image in fullscreenThe ports can be colour matched to the body or mixed and matched for fun combinations.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsLaptopsComputingWindows 11reviewsShareReuse this content"

There was no notice, no option to appeal and, from my understanding, no just cause. He had built up two successful businesses in clothing designand musicevents.Six days before the ban, he had sold 1,500 tickets for an electronic dance event in London. Instagram, rather than a website, is the platform for his work. However, he was suddenly informed that his content did not abide by Meta’s community guidelines on violence and incitement.His business account, which had 5,700 followers, and his personal account, withalmost 4,000 contacts, were deleted. These represent his entire social and professional network, as he has no alternative contact book. He has not been allowed to retrieve this data.The IP addresses onhis deviceshave been banned, so he can’t opennew accounts.I have been following his work, and have not seen anything violent, save for toy weapons in one promo video. This man’s life has been damaged by what appears to be an algorithm.RP, LondonThe essential role of social media platforms in young people’s social and professional lives is baffling to older generations used to websites and contact books.When I contacted 21-year-old RM, he told me fellow students had also lost burgeoning businesses when their accounts were summarily closed by Meta for breaching unspecified rules.“For my generation, an Instagram profile can be not only a sole source of income but an identity, and the severance of mine has been difficult to recover from,” he says. “I received no warning that I was violating any guidelines, and this decision has cost me thousands of pounds in lost sales, which, as I come from an inner city, single-parent household, is catastrophic.”RM vehemently denies posting content that could count as violence or incitement. I’m unable to see for myself, since the accounts have been deleted.Instead, I read an interview with RM on a music website that gives a hint of the cyberpunk rave scene in which he works. It seems the names of some bands and songs could, indeed, get an algorithm exercised.The words drugs, sex and kill are prevalent, as they are across some music genres. We will never know what specific line, or footage, led to RM’s defenestration because Meta refused to tell RM or me, citing “confidentiality”.It also refused to comment on the record, but a press officer did call to tell me that, because of “breaches” of its guidelines, it will not be reinstating the accounts, or letting RM retrieve his contacts. There is no right of appeal.Meta, as a commercial company, can choose who its customers are, and has a duty to remove harmful content, but its role as judge, jury and executioner is troubling given the impact of its decisions.RM could make asubject access requestto Meta to see the information held about him. That won’t reinstate the accounts but may enable him to understand his “offence”. If Meta refuses to comply, he can complain to theInformation Commissioner’s Office.He has bought a laptop to open new accounts and start rebuilding. I advise him (and everyone else) to back up his contacts and not rely solely on an unaccountable company for all of his administration.Meta is now being accused of mass bans by algorithm of Facebook and Instagram users, anda petitiondemanding human intervention on Change.org has garnered more than 25,000 signatures.Locked out of FacebookEMof West Sussex hit a digital brick wall after she was locked out of her Facebook account when a hacker gained access and changed the password, email address and phone number.

The hacker later changed the account from private to public, revealing years of personal information.When EM asked Facebook to intervene, it permanently closed the new account she had set up. “It makes it impossible to get hold of anyone to speak to, by email, chat or phone,” she says. “The unexpected positive is that after feeling like my arms had been cut off, I am enjoying the absence of Facebook noise in my life!”Meta did not respond to requests for a comment.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsConsumer championsConsumer rightsInstagramFacebookSocial networkingMetaSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why is this even a story, you might also ask.Excellent questions.Whatever its news value, or lack thereof, the story certainly got the attention of one of Mamdani’s rivals – current New York City mayor Eric Adams, who will run in the general election as an independent candidate.Adams, who is Black, called it “deeply offensive” that Mamdani would try to “exploit” an African American identity even though he is not Black.And on Fox News,talkshow hostsused the Times story to trash Mamdani. Charlie Hurt, for one, called the mayoral candidate a racist on Fox & Friends and claimed that Mamdani despises America “and everything that we stand for”.The rightwing cable network was having a field day with Mamdani, a Muslim and social democrat, even before the Times story. President Trump has called him a communist and suggested he should be deported. Other rightwing outlets picked up the story, too, presenting it as a DEI scandal – that Mamdani lied about his race in order to take advantage of the affirmative action admission policy at Columbia. (Making the story even more absurd is the fact that Mamdani didn’t get in.)In print, the would-be scandal got some help from headline writers: “Mamdani Faces Scrutiny Over College Application.”Mamdani has explained that he was trying to communicate his complicated background. His father is Indian Ugandan and his mother is Indian American; Mamdani himself was born in Uganda and lived briefly in South Africa before moving to New York City as a child.“Most college applications don’t have a box for Indian-Ugandans so I checked multiple boxes trying to capture the fullness of my background,” he told the Times.The Times’s decision to pursue and publish the story was, at the very least, unwise.For one thing, it came to the Times due to a widespread hack into Columbia’s databases, transmitted to the paper through an intermediary who was given anonymity by the paper. That source turns out to be Jordan Lasker, who – as the Guardian hasreported– is a well-known and much criticized “eugenicist”, AKA white supremacist.Traditional journalism ethics suggests that when news organizations base a story on hacked or stolen information, there should be an extra high bar of newsworthiness to justify publication. Much of Big Journalism, for example, turned their noses up at insider documents offered to them about JD Vance during last year’s presidential campaign, in part because the source was Iranian hackers; in some cases, they wrote about the hack but not the documents.The Mamdani story, however, fell far short of the newsworthiness bar.A ranking Times editor, Patrick Healy,responded to criticismof the story in a thread on X, justifying it as part of the paper’s mission “to help readers better know and understand top candidates for major offices”.Soledad O’Brien, the prominent media entrepreneur and journalist, called that explanation “a joke”. The publication of the Mamdani story is “an absolute embarrassment” for the Times, charged O’Brien, who herself is of mixed-race ancestry and identifies as Black.Plenty of others agreed, seeing Healy’s explanation not as admirable transparency but as damage control.The incident raises a larger issue: the Times’s apparent opposition to Mamdani’s candidacy.On the opinion side of the paper, there’s little question about that. Even though the Times no longer makes endorsements for mayor, theypublished an editorial urging voters to avoid ranking Mamdani at allon their ballots because he was so unqualified. (New York City uses ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to list several candidates in order of preference.)Remarkably, the Times stopped short of giving the same “don’t rank him” advice about disgraced governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned his office in 2021 and then ran for mayor against Mamdani in the primary.The opinion side of the Times is entitled to its opinion, however misguided. But straight news articles, by contrast, aren’t supposed to go to bat for or against candidates. They’re supposed to be neutral and non-partisan, not cheering on one candidate or kneecapping another.In practice, of course, that’s often not the case.With this made-up scandal, combined with the pre-election editorial, the Times looks like it’s on a crusade against Mamdani.And no lofty explanation about the mission can disguise it.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsNew York TimesOpinionNew YorkZohran MamdaniNewspapersUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

In 2021, a bellicose Boris Johnson sent Royal Navyfrigatesto patrol off the coast of Jersey in response to a dispute with Paris over fishing rights. The following year, notoriously, Liz Trussdeclinedto say whether she considered the French president, Emmanuel Macron, to be a friend or foe to Britain. For five years, no Franco-British bilateralsummitstook place at all.That, thankfully, was then. France and Britain are close neighbours, nuclear powers and members of the United Nations security council. At a time of acute geopolitical instability, fuelled in part by the return ofDonald Trumpto the White House, it is overwhelmingly in the interests of both countries, and Europe as a whole, that a fully functioning entente cordiale is restored.The arrival of Mr Macron in London on Tuesday for astate visit– the first by a French president since 2008 – confirms the successful work done to that end by Sir Keir Starmer over the past year. In relation to strengthening European defence and security, and supporting Ukraine’s ability to continue to resist Vladimir Putin, the two leaders haveforgeda close working relationship, which this trip will help consolidate. The symbolism of the event – Mr Macron is the first European leader to be so honoured since Brexit – will also do no harm to Sir Keir’s chances of making progress with his somewhat ill-defined aspirations for a “reset” with the EU.Much of the president’s time, naturally, will be taken up with pomp, circumstance and protocol, including a state dinner at Windsor Castle and a joint address to both Houses of Parliament. A warm welcome can be expected for Mr Macron and his wife, Brigitte, from King Charles, a devoutFrancophile. But it also seems likely that some meaningful political business will be done.On Thursday, Sir Keir and Mr Macron will co-host a video conference with European allies to again discuss the creation of a “reassurance force”, which could be deployed to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. More immediately relevant perhaps, given the stalled status of peace negotiations with Mr Putin, will be a simultaneous focus on how to maintain Ukraine’s fighting capabilities without relying on a reluctant Mr Trump. On the ever-more vexed issue of small boat crossings in the Channel, a potential pilot scheme to return irregular migrants to France in exchange for others with family connections in Britain may be unveiled.Anti-immigrant sentiment has been, for both leaders, a contributory factor to domestic politicalwoesand falling poll ratings. But on the world stage Sir Keir and Mr Macron have responded impressively, and largely in tandem, to the challenges of a new era in which great power rivalry and strongman politics threaten to undermine liberal values and international law. It will not have been lost on Mr Trump, who will make a second state visit to Britain in the autumn, that Mr Macron has stolen a march on him this time. For a number of reasons, from the need to heal the diplomatic wounds of Brexit to sending a signal of European solidarity and resilience in turbulent times, that is as it should be.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s unlikely to be the last.On Monday, the Trump regime said Harvard Universityhad violated federal civil rights lawover the treatment of Jewish students on campus.On Tuesday, the regimereleased $175min previously frozen federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania, after the school agreed to bar transgender athletes from women’s teams and delete the swimmer Lia Thomas’s records.Let’s be clear: DEI, antisemitism and transgender athletes are not the real reasons for these attacks on higher education. They’re excuses to give the Trump regime power over America’s colleges and universities.Why do Trump and his lackeys want this power?They’re following Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s playbook for creating an “illiberal democracy” – an authoritarian state masquerading as a democracy. The playbook goes like this:First, take over military and intelligence operations by purging career officers and substituting ones personally loyal to you. Check.Next, intimidate legislators by warning that if they don’t bend to your wishes, you’ll run loyalists against them. (Make sure they also worry about what your violent supporters could do to them and their families.) Check.Next, subdue the courts by ignoring or threatening to ignore court rulings you disagree with. Check in process.Then focus on independent sources of information. Sue media that publish critical stories and block their access to news conferences and interviews. Check.Then go after the universities.Crapping on higher education is also good politics, as demonstrated by the congresswoman Elise Stefanik (Harvard 2006) who browbeat the presidents of Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and MIT over their responses to student protests against Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, leading to several of them being fired.It’s good politics, because many of the 60% of adult Americans who lack college degrees are stuck in lousy jobs. Many resent the college-educated, who lord it over them economically and culturally.But behind this cultural populism lies a deeper anti-intellectual, anti-Enlightenment ideology closer to fascism than authoritarianism.JD Vance (Yale Law 2013) has called university professors “the enemy” and suggested using Orbán’s method for ending “leftwing domination” of universities. Vance laid it all out on CBS’sFace the Nationon 19 May 2024:Universities are controlled by leftwing foundations. They’re not controlled by the American taxpayer and yet the American taxpayer is sending hundreds of billions of dollars to these universities every single year.I’m not endorsing every single thing that Viktor Orbán has ever done [but] I do think that he’s made some smart decisions there that we could learn from.His way has to be the model for us: not to eliminate universities, but to give them a choice between survival or taking a much less biased approach to teaching. [The government should be] aggressively reforming institutions … in a way to where they’re much more open to conservative ideas.”Yet what, exactly, constitutes a “conservative idea?” That dictatorship is preferable to democracy? That white Christian nationalism is better than tolerance and openness? That social Darwinism is superior to human decency?The claim that higher education must be more open to such “conservative ideas” is dangerous drivel.So what’s the real, underlying reason for the Trump regime’s attack on education?Not incidentally, that attack extends to grade school. Trump’s education department announced on Tuesday it’swithholding $6.8bn in funding for schools, and Trump has promised todismantle the department.Why? Because the greatest obstacle to dictatorship is an educated populace. Ignorance is the handmaiden of tyranny.That’s why enslavers prohibited enslaved people from learning to read. Fascists burn books. Tyrants close universities.In their quest to destroy democracy, Trump, Vance and their cronies are intent on shutting the American mind.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Imagine what we would hear today insteadHugh MuirA response by Ken Livingstone asserted London’s diversity – not as a weakness, but a strength. The politicians now peddling division should read itMon 7 Jul 2025 11.20 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 21.30 EDTShareToday, at 8.49am, the teeming mass coursing through King’s Cross station inLondonfell silent. It continued to move, because the world must turn, but the hubbub ceased. Moments earlier, a strangely quiet, sombre loudspeaker announcement marked the moment the 7/7 terrorist bombs exploded in that station and elsewhere in the capital in 2005, killing 52 people and injuring more than 770.The capital moves on, butthe capital remembers. I stood still for a minute underneath the glowing light of a digital clock. People offered knowing glances and nods as they passed to catch their trains. At the time of the bombings, I covered London and the London mayoralty for the Guardian. I remember being called by colleagues asking for information about what they had been told in the initial moments was a giant electrical failure on the London underground. I had been warned that week about the fears in official circles that some sort of terrorist attack was possible, if not likely. I rang a contact. “It’s not an electrical incident, is it?” “No,” they replied gravely, “it isn’t.”Some things I have forgotten, but others stayed with me. The calm in those stations, even amid the horror, even when no one knew if there were more bombers, more devices. The relative calm on the streets. City dwellers are like dysfunctional families, and no less in Britain’s capital. They bicker over nonsense and trivialities, but pause all that when something serious occurs, when they need to find the ties that bind.Thirteen people died when the youngest bomber detonated his device on a No 30 double-decker bus not far from King’s Cross, in Tavistock Square. All buses stopped that morning, but by the afternoon, they were running again and Londoners were boarding them.One thing I remember acutely is the reaction of the then London mayor,Ken Livingstone. He was a controversial figure throughout his time in public life, first as a two-fingered salute to the Thatcher government during his leadership of the Greater London council and then as the lefty mayor that righties never liked, but, in the early years at least, could never quite dislike.For a time, he was formidable. It didn’t last, and by the end of his time in politics, he had pretty well obliterated goodwill and overshadowed his political accomplishments with shocking, recurring comments referencing Hitler and disgraceful remarks rightly condemned as antisemitism. He resigned from the Labour party in 2018,having been suspended two years earlierover his comments, which were exacerbated by his denials of any antisemitism in the party. Livingstone apologised for any offence, and insisted his comments were not antisemitic. In 2023, it was announced that he had Alzheimer’s and has retired from public life.When Livingstone was clever and sensible, I praised him. When he was stupid and offensive, I said that too. The Boris Johnson-supporting London Evening Standard, my former employer, onceimplied I was an uncritical Livingstone crony, pointing to an independent research project commissioned by City Hall I had worked on. But a multitude of my stories critical of Livingstone gave easy lie to that.So this is not a blithe attempt to rehabilitate Livingstone. But 20 years ago, on the day of 7/7, as London mayor, he gave an example of political leadership in the face of trauma and despair. It was just what was needed at the time, but it also highlights the inadequacy of the community stewardship we too often accept as normal in our national politics, and the current primacy of an approach that actively creates division as its modus operandi, seeking incremental gains regardless of the collateral damage.View image in fullscreenKen Livingstone boards an underground train during the morning rush hour in London as police urged Londoners to get back to work, 11 July 2005.Photograph: Paul Hackett/ReutersIn a hastily called press conference, in a dark suit, in a steady voice, but with eyes slightly watering,Livingstone said: “I want to say one thing specifically to the world today. This was not a terrorist attack against the mighty and the powerful. It was not aimed at presidents or prime ministers. It was aimed at ordinary, working-class Londoners, black and white, Muslim and Christian, Hindu and Jew, young and old. It was an indiscriminate attempt to slaughter, irrespective of any considerations for age, for class, for religion, or whatever.”That isn’t an ideology, he said: “It isn’t even a perverted faith – it is just an indiscriminate attempt at mass murder and we know what the objective is. They seek to divide Londoners. They seek to turn Londoners against each other. I said yesterday to the International Olympic Committee [London had just secured the 2012 Olympics] that the city of London is the greatest in the world, because everybody lives side by side in harmony. Londoners will not be divided by this cowardly attack. They will stand together in solidarity alongside those who have been injured and those who have been bereaved and that is why I’m proud to be the mayor of that city.”Finally, he said: “I wish to speak directly to those who came to London today to take life. I know that you personally do not fear giving up your own life in order to take others – that is why you are so dangerous. But I know you fear that you may fail in your long-term objective to destroy our free society and I can show you why you will fail.“In the days that follow look at our airports, look at our sea ports and look at our railway stations and, even after your cowardly attack, you will see that people from the rest of Britain, people from around the world will arrive in London to become Londoners and to fulfil their dreams and achieve their potential. They choose to come to London, as so many have come before, because they come to be free, they come to live the life they choose, they come to be able to be themselves. They flee you because you tell them how they should live. They don’t want that and nothing you do, however many of us you kill, will stop that flight to our city where freedom is strong and where people can live in harmony with one another. Whatever you do, however many you kill, you will fail.”From swim schools to eye clinics: how families of 7/7 victims used heartbreak to help othersRead moreIt is hard to reconcile how pitch-perfect that was with his later, awful treatment of one of London’s cherished communities. But on that day, he took an approach that absolutely chimed with me and many others. It said, we are London, we are diverse, we are fiercely unapologetic about who we are and how we live. You, the attackers, don’t like it – and, by the way, we don’t really care; we reject you. London salutes its dead and wounded. London moves on.And it’s not just London: up and down the country, there are, for all the challenges and difficulties of doing so, communities seeking to live that way, preyed upon by extremists who, for their own ends – be they political, social, ideological or criminal – seek to achieve exactly the opposite. Twenty years on, reject them too.Hugh Muir is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s something Aboriginal families know to be true: racism kills.One report, 33 recommendations, but Kumanjayi Walker inquest findings draw on centuries of painRead moreElisabeth Armitage found that former NT constable Zachary Rolfe, who shot and killed Walker in a botched arrest in 2019, was racist. “Having considered all the evidence, including Mr Rolfe’s explanations and justifications, I found that Mr Rolfe was racist and that he worked in, and was the beneficiary of, an organisation with hallmarks of institutional racism,” Armitage said.She said she could not rule out that Rolfe’s racism was a factor in the death of Kumanjayi.“I am satisfied that there is a significant risk that his racism, in combination with some of his other attitudes and values, affected his interactions with the community of Yuendumu on 9 November 2019, his entry into their houses and his perception of and response to the young Aboriginal man he shot and killed in a way that increased the likelihood of a fatal outcome.”She found Rolfe operated in a system that failed on a number of occasions to “rein him in”.If we are starting to talk about truth telling, here is the truth from where we stand: police racism was a factor in the death of Kumanjayi Walker – not just the racism of an individual officer but the structural racism of the force itself.Armitage and her formidable team, including counsel assisting Dr Peggy Dwyer, have worked hard to forensically document the entire horrific episode. It has taken them more than three years. There were delays to the inquest proceedings brought about by legal challenges from Rolfe’s lawyers, including an unsuccessful attempt to have the coroner recuse herself.They investigated every case where Rolfe had used force in an arrest – a total of 12 incidents.In summarising Rolfe’s use-of-force history, she noted time after time the “serious failure” of supervision by senior officers, whose response to Rolfe’s conduct was “wholly inadequate”. She found that officers “should have shown more leadership”.“There was a serious failure by senior police (and the systems that support them) to facilitate an adequate and timely investigation into Mr Rolfe, once it emerged that there was a concerningly similar theme to the complaints being made against him; namely, that Mr Rolfe was involved in a number of matters where he did not have his BWV [body-worn video] on at the crucial moment of arrest, many where he was the only officer at the scene at the moment of arrest and where the suspect he arrested suffered a serious injury,” she said.It was incumbent on NT police to “take urgent interim action to mitigate the risk to the public while Mr Rolfe was working”, either by suspending him from certain duties, or at the very least, ensuring he was warned and counselled about his suspected behaviour and carefully supervised.She was surprised this did not happen even after a local court judge “found that Rolfe had probably assaulted an Aboriginal man, causing a head wound that required sutures, and had lied in a statutory declaration and on oath about doing so”.Kumanjayi Walker shooting inquest: coroner finds NT police officer Zachary Rolfe ‘was racist’Read moreThe failure of NT police to properly supervise Rolfe, or to “rein him in”, as she put it, contributed to the sense of impunity with which he approached his work.“In my view, the failure of the NT police to take any action in response to these extremely serious findings represents one of the most serious failures of oversight examined by the inquest,” she said.It is now for the NT police force, and the NT government, to explain to the public why those things did not happen, why Rolfe remained an officer until relatively recently, and whether the changes to procedures and training it told the coroner have taken place since the shooting will be enough to ensure change.These structural problems were so entrenched and longstanding that in 2024, the former NT police commissioner Michael Murphy felt compelled to apologise for the “harms and the injustices” inflicted by the police on Aboriginal people over the past 154 years. Murphy promised he would go to Yuendumu and apologise in person to the shattered families there. But Murphy was stood down from the force in March, after an Icac investigation, and a replacement is being sought. Yuendumu is not expecting to hear an apology anytime soon.The coroner made 33 recommendations, including support for Yuendumu night patrol, youth services, disability services, mediators and rehabilitation programs. She recommended the NT police engage directly with the Yuendumu leadership groups to develop mutual respect agreements, including “when it would be appropriate for police not to carry firearms” in the community.She said they are aimed at preventing such a tragedy from happening again.Yet a few weeks ago another young man from Yuendumu, who was in state care due to a disability, died in an Alice Springs supermarket after a botched arrest attempt by off-duty police officers.Armitage and her team will be investigating that death as well.Without systemic change, the truth can be easily stepped over.Walker was killed six years ago. His family has endured a criminal trial, and then protracted inquest hearings, with patience and dignity. Their voices have been hardly heard throughout the entire sorry ordeal.Now, maybe they might be able to speak freely. And alongside their truth-telling and that of the coroner, there must be somelisteningto what they have to say, and what they think needs to change so they can feel safe in their own homes again.“Kumanjayi’s death has devastated our community. We miss him and feel his loss deeply every single day; it will stain our country for generations to come,” Walker’s cousin, Samara Fernandez-Brown, said.“The inquest into his death has been gruelling, shocking and devastating. Throughout it, our families and communities have stood strong, showed up and listened to all the ways that Kumanjayi was failed.“We are heartbroken and exhausted after many long years, but we are hoping change is coming. We have faith that the truth will finally be told, and want to see real change so that we can finally start our healing.”Walker’s family said late on Monday they are taking the time to process the coroner’s findings and will make a full statement and press conference later today.Lorena Allam is descended from the Gamilaraay and Yuwaalaraay nations of north-western New South Wales.

That, at any rate, is the narrative that has taken hold since Donald Trump’s retreat from the postwar global security order and the urgent pressure to rearmEurope.But to frame the dilemma facing Europe in this way is a big mistake. History teaches us that the political choice has never been about guns or butter, but rather guns or taxes.The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s seemed to close almost a century of global ideological conflict, but it was also supposed to make us all richer. With the end of the cold war, Europeans would no longer need to uphold an expensive military apparatus for territorial defence. Governments ditched conscription and walked back defence outlays. Cashing in on that so-called “peace dividend”, governments could spend on the domestic priorities of their liking, boosting non-military investment.Last month’s Nato summit in The Hague showedhow this tide has been dramatically reversed. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Trump’s uncertain commitment to Nato means that European governments have no choice but to invest more in their own mutual defence. The peace dividend, asKristalina Georgieva, the head of the IMF, stated, “is gone”.Europe’s Nato memberspledged to increasespending on “hard defence”, such as tanks and military salaries, from 2% to 3.5% of GDP by 2035.The question now is how to finance it. Forsome experts, the only way to build a warfare state that can deter Russia is to slash social spending. After all, goes the misleading argument, governments in the 1990s splashed the savings from defence on expensive welfare promises.Even before the Nato agreement in The Hague, the public were being softened up for the new reality. In a TV address in March, the French president,Emmanuel Macron, warnedcitizens that in a “more brutal” world, they would have to make budget sacrifices. Macron ruled out higher taxes. Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, decided toscrap a public holidayto finance higher defence spending. The UK has cut savagely into its international development aid budget for the same reason.But Europe would be drawing the entirely wrong lessons from history if it weakened the welfare state to build up the military state. There is another way: instead of slashing social spending, Europe’s governments should raise taxes on corporations and capital to finance deterrence.View image in fullscreenDenmark’s prime minister Mette Frederikse, France’s president Emmanuel Macron and Finland’s president Alexander Stubb attend a Nato summit in The Hague, Netherlands, 25 June 2025.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersLet’s look at what actually happened in the 1990s. While cutting defence spending after the collapse of the Soviet Union allowed governments to increase social spending, it mostly gave them room to cut taxes and budget deficits, which they did with great zeal, as the 1990s neoliberal consensus took hold and tax competition intensified.Yes, the “peace dividend” helped to financebig increasesin social spending, but with ageing societies it was mostly devoted to pensions, health and longterm care. Social protection for the working age population hasfallenacross Europesince the end of the cold war.But from the mid 1980s to 2023,corporate income tax ratesfell by around half within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Capital gains tax rates also dropped significantly: from up to 53% in the early 1990s to26% today in Germany, or from up to 30% to up to 24%today in the UK for the same period. The “peace dividend” was in fact a boon for the wealthiest in Europe.Savings in defence not only went to the private sector via tax cuts, but also via reduced fiscal deficits. Germany’s adoption of its contentious constitutional “debt brake” in 2009 helped it to achieve a balanced budget; something that would have been impossible without cutting defence spending to the bone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More public debt, as Germany has now committed itself to, will be necessary. But debt is often a regressive tax, weighing more on the poorest, as the wealthy own a large share of the debt. Moreover, if EU members don’t agree to common borrowing to finance the defence surge, as happened during the pandemic, financial markets may not let EU countries with a high debt load, such as Italy or France, increase deficit-spending on defence.The “new normal” of higher defence spending should thus also be funded by increasing taxes, especially on corporate income, high wealth and capital gains. This won’t be possible without limiting tax competition at a Europe-wide level.Indeed, the idea that some European tax havens continue to suck up corporate tax resources from others while they free-ride on their defence spending will become increasingly difficult to sustain. France and Germany have long pushed for the harmonisation of corporate taxes across the EU’s 27 members. The EU must now rein in tax-dumping countries such as neutral Ireland. Europe cannot achieve better defence without better tax revenues.And only a defence buildup that is supported by the wider public across Europe can run beyond the short-term momentum and thus develop into a credible deterrence.The experience of “military Keynesianism” globally, and across history, has never been about gunsorbutter, but gunsandbutter. In a war, you not only need weapons, but also a supportive population to operate them. Keeping the peace on the home front is just as important as holding the line in the trenches. Rather than slashing the welfare state to build up the military state, Europe’s leaders should think about how to improve and modernise social spending. Only the prospect of a better and fairer world will keep our societies united and capable of fighting.Shahin Vallée is a senior research fellow at the German Council for Foreign Relations.

But on one issue, politicians from all parties seem to agree: the great British public don’t really want ambitious action to meet net zero goals. They may concur on this – but they are wrong.On the right of the spectrum, opposition politicians have been sounding a rapid retreat from the net zero target. In doing so, they are breaking with a strong Conservative tradition – it was Theresa May who signed the target into lawin 2019, with cross-party support. Council elections this spring saw victories for Reform UK, which opposes most net zero policies outright, and argues for an economy based on fossil fuels. Meanwhile, the Labour government has net zero as one of itsfive missions, yet it, too, seems reluctant to make a positive case for action to tackle the climate crisis. It worries there won’t be enough support for policies such as replacing gas boilers or managing demand for flying, and it has been further cowed byunhelpful voices offfrom the former prime minister Tony Blair.In a democracy, politicians should aim to represent people’s views. Of course the climate threat is urgent, and the UK has international commitments to meet. But given our fragile economy, is there an argument that a slower pace of change is justified for now, if this is what people want?Sounds plausible to some, but there’s a catch: this isn’t actually what people want at all.Our researchwith politicians and citizens shows that politicians consistently underestimate public support for climate action. Over the past decade, my colleagues and Ihave tracked politicians’ understandingsthrough detailed interviews with MPs. We have found that politicians from all sides are hesitant to advocate for ambitious measures, because they think the public won’t support them. Yet this isn’t borne out by opinion polls and social research, which show consistently high levels of concern about the climate crisis, and support for action.There is a fundamental disconnect between what politicians believe the country thinks, and what evidence shows is the reality on the ground.Polling by Climate Barometerpoints to a “perception gap”, with half of MPs underestimating levels of public support for the net zero target. And while 72% of people say they would support onshore windfarms being built in their local area, with 17% opposed, MPs assume the opposite. They estimate public support at just 19%, and opposition at 39%.Why is it that politicians get this so wrong? The answer lies in who they are hearing from. Think of public opinion on climate and some caricatures are likely to pop into your head. The climate protesters and campaigners, some so committed that they are willing to risk a prison sentence. And at the other end of the spectrum, an equally noisy minority who question climate science, or express deep scepticism about the solutions, whether windfarms, heat pumps or electric vehicles. These views are amplified by some companies that feel they may lose out from the net zero transition, and media voices stoking controversy. These voices may be loud, but they are not representative of the population. Yet they have a disproportionate hold over political imaginations. Imagine if, in designing education policy, we just heard from those who struggled at school and left with no qualifications, alongside people with postgraduate degrees. Hearing from both these groups is important, but they are not representative. For most people, education is a backdrop to their life, not a defining feature.That’s why, in our research on the climate crisis, we take a different approach. We want to hear from everyone. We convene citizens’ panels, whose members represent the population as a whole, in terms of factors such as age, gender, income and education, as well as political attitudes and levels of concern about the climate crisis. When we first meet, our participants often tell us they were surprised that they were selected, because they don’t have firm views or expertise to offer. We tell them that’s exactly why we want to hear from them.Typically, our participants tell us they are worried about the climate emergency, but it’s not front of mind for them, given the preoccupations of everyday life, like getting kids to school, work pressures or getting by on a tight income. They want to contribute, but they feel that what they can do on their own is limited. As a result, they have clear ideas ofwhat they want from government. They are not happy with how things are at the moment. They don’t hear enough from leaders, and the less they hear, the less convinced they are that plans are credible, and they lose trust. They want politicians to lead the way, explaining what’s necessary, and developing policies that make it easier and cheaper to do the right thing.Not everyone thinks the same, of course. Some want to go further and faster, and others will remain steadfastly opposed. But for most people, there is a way through, if you listen.Increasingly, politicians and policymakers are understanding how important this listening is.More than 30 areashave now held citizens’ assemblies to contribute to local climate strategies. The Climate Change Committee, which I advise, convened a citizens’ panel to find out how people wanted to shape policies in areas such as dietary choices, transport options and home heating, withits most recent projectionsincorporating findings from the panel alongside the usual number crunching and economic analysis.All this points to a way forward to politicians on left and right alike. Although different governments will have different priorities, the basic formula is clear. Tell people that you share their worries on the climate emergency, and that you want to make it easier for them to be part of the solution. Don’t assume that high levels of concern will translate to support for specific policies. Lead with initiatives that improve people’s lives, such as better public transport, financial support for heat pumps and insulation, and encouraging investment in clean industries in areas where jobs are needed. Make sure people get a say in decisions, and local people benefit from projects such as windfarms or grid upgrades. At national level, a permanent citizens’ panel could advise parliament or government on an ongoing basis, so that people’s priorities are reflected in policy.It’s far from inevitable that climate issues will be dragged down by polarised politics. That’s not what people want. But unless politicians stop assuming and start listening, that’s what may happen.Rebecca Willis is professor of energy and climate governance at Lancaster UniversityExplore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsOpinionClimate crisisClimate Change CommitteecommentShareReuse this content"

But that’s where her local family support service came in. Offering breastfeeding advice, a space to come together with other parents and for her son Billy to play with other babies, it reassured Jenna that she was on the right track – and crucially, that Billy was set up to achieve when he got to school.Jenna’s service was the first of Labour’s renowned Sure Start centres in Washington, my home town in north-east England. I knew it well: before becoming an MP I ran a refuge nearby for women fleeing domestic violence. I linked up the women who used our refuge with Sure Start. It was a lifeline for those women who, despite everything, were determined to give their children the very best start in life.But, sadly, after 14 years of Conservative government, stories like Jenna’s, and those of the many women who were offered that lifeline, are much less common. Funding was stripped out of Sure Start centres and services scrapped in rebranded family hubs. Today, 65 councils, and the children and families who live under their authority, have missed out on recent funding. Many more are lacking the childcare places that so many families in our country need.For every Jenna, there are a host of other young mothers, and families, who missed out on crucial pillars of support, whose children have fallen behind before they have even started school.Momentum to revive Sure Start is long overdue – it’s been a lifeline for my son and me | Rhiannon Lucy CosslettRead moreOne in three five-year-olds enters year 1 without the basic skills – likeholding a pencil and writing their own name– that they need to make the most of what education has to offer them. Some haven’t reached essential milestones such as putting on a coat or going to the toilet by themselves.For the most vulnerable children, the situation is graver. Just over half of those eligible for free school meals reach a good level of development at age five. For children in social care, it’s just over one in three. And for children with special educational needs, it’s one in five.The gap in achievement we see between our poorest and most affluent children at 16 is baked in before they even start school, creating a vicious cycle of lost life chances that’s all too visible in the shameful number of young people not earning or learning.It’s this government’s moral mission to bridge that gap, but to do it we must build an education system where all children can achieve and thrive, starting from day one.That is why reforming the early years education system is my number one priority. And it’s why, just 12 months after Labour entered government, I am so proud to be setting out our strategy to give every child the best start in life.Backed by £1.5bn over the next three years, it brings together the best of Sure Start, health services, community groups and the early years sector, with the shared goal of setting up children to succeed when they get to school.We will create 1,000Best Start Family Hubs, at least one in every council area,invest a record £9bnin funded childcare and early years places – and hundreds of millions to improve quality in early years settings and reception classes.These hubs will bring disjointed support systems into one place, allowing thousands of families to access help with anything from birth registration to breastfeeding, from housing support to children’s speech and language development.The strategy takes inspiration from around the world. I’ve been really impressed by what happens in countries I’ve visited, such as Estonia, where early education and family support are bound tightly together with stellar results. Its disadvantage gap is negligible because children get to school ready to learn. Its children outperform those from much larger, wealthier countries in international rankings. The country punches above its weight economically as a result.At the heart of our strategy is the recognition that for our country to succeed in a fast-changing world, it is not enough for only some children to do well in education: every child must have the opportunity and the tools not just to get by, but to get on in life.Working people have always known that education is the best way to break the link between their background and what they go on to achieve, the route to prosperity not just for individuals, but for all of society. It’s a common thread that runs through every Labour government: that we must use education to spread the freedoms that today too few enjoy, so that tomorrow they are common to us all.It’s the essence of our politics, the socialism of extending freedom to allow working people to choose their own path to fulfilment: to get better employment, to achieve a better quality of life or even to start a family.This strategy is a watershed moment for our government, but more importantly for every single family who needs our support. To make it a reality, we will begin unprecedented collaboration between parents, councils, nurseries, childminders, schools and government, enmeshing family support, early education and childcare so deeply that no rightwing government can ever unpick it, as the Tories did with Sure Start over 14 long years.Our plan for change will ensure Jenna’s experience – and Billy’s future success – is shared by every family and every child in our country.Bridget Phillipson is the secretary of state for education and Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland SouthExplore more on these topicsChildrenOpinionEarly years educationLabourDepartment for EducationcommentShareReuse this content"

As a special needs parent, I can tell you: it’s terrifyingMon 7 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 07.41 EDTShareWhat will Keir Starmer and his colleagues learn from the disaster of theirattempt to cut benefits? Most speculation so far has been focused on the prime minister’s prospects, and other ministerial careers. But there are soon going to be more big decisions to make, which will have massive consequences for people’s lives.One policy area in particular is about to return the political conversation to the subject that defined last week’s fiasco: disability. Once again,LabourMPs from all wings of the party are feeling anxious and restless. Campaign groups and charities – not to mention the huge numbers of people who will be directly affected – fear the worst. With the wounds from the welfare bill fiasco still raw, there is a grim sense of a possible reprisal of the same story.And this is why. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, wants to reform England’s system of provision for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities, or Send. Long years of Conservative failure – not least, reformsintroduced a decade agothat were lamentably underfunded, and an exodus of children from mainstream to specialist schools – have resulted in ballooning costs amid disappointing outcomes. The councils that administer everything arecrying out for help. The Treasury, meanwhile, surveys the mess and demands action.A new education white paper will be published in the autumn. Phillipson says the government needs to “think very differently”. She wants to reverse a trend that took root in the Tory years and prioritise the inclusion of Send kids in mainstream schools.There is talk ofsomehow “making sure that all teachers are teachers of special educational needs [sic]”. A newneurodivergence task and finish groupthat will “work alongside the department to drive inclusive education” has been created;£740m of capital fundingis being spent on “adapting classrooms to be more accessible and for creating specialist facilities”.On the face of it, these moves are very welcome. But self-evidently, it will take much more – and a lot of time – to meaningfully turn things around. One of the big teaching unions has already said that without a commensurate increase in day-to-day schools spending, the plans could put “extreme pressure” on teachers. And there is an even bigger tension at the heart of the government’s plans.Since Labour won the election, rising noise has been coming from Whitehall and beyond about drastically restricting the legal rights to dedicated provision that underpin the education of hundreds of thousands of children and young people. Those rights are enforced by the official Send tribunal, and embodied in education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which set out children’s needs and the provision they entail in a legally binding document. Contrary to what you read incertain news outlets, they are not any kind of “golden ticket”: parents and carers used to unreturned phone calls and long waits still frequently have tofight their local councilsfor the help their plans set out. But – and as a special needs parent, I speak from experience – they usually allow stressed-out families to just about sleep at night.For about 40 years, such rightshave been a cornerstoneof the Send system. But their future is now uncertain: councils, in particular, are franticallylobbying ministersto get parents and their pesky rights out of the way. Late last year, a government sourcequoted in the Financial Timesheld out the prospect of “thousands fewer pupils” having access to rights-based provision. Despite the fact that EHCPs are most sorely needed in mainstream schools, a senior adviser to the Department for Education recently said that a consideration of whether EHCPs should no longer apply to children in exactly those settings is “the conversation we’re in the middle of”. There are whispers about families who currently have EHCPs being allowed to keep them, while in the future, kids with similar needs would be waved away, something that threatens a stereotypical two-tier model, another element with worrying echoes of the benefits disaster.View image in fullscreenBridget Phillipson leaves Downing Street after attending the weekly cabinet meeting, 24 June 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesAs a result, parents and carers – and many teachers – are terrified. Whenever ministers are asked about what is going to happen next, they tend to come out with the response: “no decision has been made”. On Sunday, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg challenged Phillipson on whether she is about to “get rid” of EHCPs, which was met with vague words about improved support in schools, familiar claims that the current system is too “adversarial”, and no specific answer. This, needless to say, is not exactly allaying people’s fears.Just under483,000 children and young peoplein English schools now have an EHCP, up 11% on the previous year’s figure. Their numbers have risen partly because ad hoc, informal special needs provision in schools has become so unreliable that the only way of having any chance of securing what a child needs is to apply for one. Official data shows that themajority of applications for EHCPsare initiated by schools and colleges, often as a last-ditch move. In short, many children desperately need them. Without the support such plans are meant to guarantee, even more pupils would either exit mainstream into specialist provision that is often eye-wateringly expensive, or end up joining the increasing numbers of kids who are not in formal education at all.For the foreseeable future, because even an optimist would have to agree that improvements promised by the government will take years to really kick in, all that will remain the case. So the safest and most humane option would be to leave children’s legal entitlements in place, and start to improve Send provision as Phillipson wants, on the basis that boosted ad hoc help will naturally bring down EHCP numbers and costs. Instead, her most vivid move could be an awful rights grab, which would surely heighten the impression that this Labour party has an ingrained problem with issues around disability.A new campaign titled Save Our Children’s Rights was launched over the weekendwith a letter in the Guardiansigned by leading figures from charities and lobby groups, including Disability Rights UK, the National Autistic Society and Mencap – as well as such high-profile Send parents as the broadcasters Christine McGuinness and Carrie Grant, along with the TV naturalist and neurodiversity campaigner Chris Packham (full disclosure: I am helping out, and I was one of the signatories). For the second time in less than six months, are these really the kind of people ministers want to argue with on Good Morning Britain, 5 Live and BBC Breakfast?Schools in England ‘need complex changes’ to take more pupils with special needsRead moreAs I watched the benefits fiasco unfolding, knowing that the special needs story would soon explode, it brought one big thought to mind. Labour needs to stop sowing fear and dread among people whose lives are already full of those things. Instead of picking on vulnerable parts of the population who already view the future with deep anxiety, they should maybe go after much more powerful interests, who might be compelled into helping the government with its financial woes. Instead, fear is swirling around parts of society that are already unable to cope. Labour governments are meant to make people feel less scared, not more. If there is going to be yet another “reset”, this is where it should be focused.There is one point that may yet bring clarity to the government’s thinking. Governing politicians habitually pretend they will win future elections. But there is now every chance that Reform UK might end up in power, possibly in partnership with whatever remains of the Conservatives. Judging by his recent pronouncements, Nigel Farage hasvery questionable viewsabout special needs and disabilities. There is strong evidence that thesame is true of Kemi Badenoch. The current fashion on the political right for nonsense about savagelycutting back the statewould have deep implications for Send families. If Labour takes away so many children’s basic educational rights, it may well end up leaving them at the mercy of politicians who will then vandalise their lives. “No decision has been made,” say ministers. It is time they took the only morally and politically right one, and fast.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsOpinionLabourWelfareDisabilityBenefitsKeir StarmerBridget PhillipsoncommentShareReuse this content"

The answer is increasingly noMon 7 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 12.08 EDTShare“The housing crisis is now as big a threat to the EU as Russia,” Jaume Collboni, the mayor of Barcelona, recentlydeclared. “We’re running the risk of having the working and middle classes conclude that their democracies are incapable of solving their biggest problem.”It is not hard to see where Collboni is coming from. From Dublin to Milan, residents routinely find half of their incomes swallowed up by rent, and home ownership is unthinkable for most. Major cities are witnessingspiralling house pricesand some have jaw-dropping year-on-year median rent increases ofmore than 10%. People are being pushed into ever more precarious andcrampedconditions and homelessness israpidly rising.As Collboni asserts, housing lies at the heart of surging political disfranchisement across mainland Europe. The crisis isfuelling the far right– linked, for example, to the support for Alternative für Deutschland in Germany and the recentvictory of the Dutch anti-Islam Freedom party. Housing has become a primaryengine of inequality, reinforcing divisions between the asset-haves and have-nots anddisproportionately affecting minority groups. Far from offering security and safety, for many in Europe housing is now a primary cause of suffering and despair.But not everyone is suffering. At the same time it is robbing normal people of a comfortable and dignified life, the housing crisis is lining the pockets of a small number of individuals and institutions. AcrossEuropein recent decades the same story has unfolded, albeit in very different ways: power has shifted to those who profit from housing, and away from those who live in it.Councils in England face ‘impossible decisions’ to build or repair homesRead moreThe most striking manifestation of this shift is the large-scale ownership and control of homes by financial institutions, particularly since the 2008 global financial crisis. In 2023,$1.7tnof global real estate was managed by institutional investors such as private equity firms, insurance companies, hedge funds, banks and pension funds, up from $385bn in 2008. Spurred by loose monetary policy, these actors consider Europe’s housing a particularly lucrative and secure “asset class”. Purchases of residential property in the euro area by institutional investorstripled over the past decade. As a London-based asset managerputs it: “Real estate investors with exposure to European residential assets are the cats that got the cream,” with housing generating “stronger risk-adjusted returns than any other sector”.The scale of institutional ownership in certain places is staggering. In Ireland, nearlyhalfof all units delivered since2017 were purchased by investment funds. Across Sweden, the share of private rental apartments with institutional investors as landlords has swelled to24%. In Berlin,€40bnof housing assets are now in institutional portfolios,10%of the total housing stock. In the four largest Dutch cities, aquarterof homes for sale in recent years were purchased by investors. Even in Vienna, a city widely heralded for its vast, subsidised housing stock, institutional players are now invested inevery 10thhousing unit and42%of new private rental homes.Not all investors are the same. But when the aim is to make money from housing it can mean only one thing: prices go up. As Leilani Farha, a former UN special rapporteur, points out, investment funds have a “fiduciary duty” to maximise returns to shareholders, which often include the pension funds on which ordinary people rely. They therefore do all they can to increase prices and reduce expenditure, including via “renoviction” (using refurbishment as an excuse to hike rents), under-maintenance and the introduction of punitive fees. When the private equity giant Blackstone acquired and renovated homes across Stockholm, it increased rents on some of the homes by up to 50%, the economic geographer Brett Christophersfound. “Green” retrofits in the name of sustainability are also an increasingly commontactic.The corporate capture of our homes has not sprung out of thin air. Decades of housing market privatisation, liberalisation and speculation have enabled the financial sector to tighten its grip on European households. From the 1980s in places such as Italy, Sweden and Germany, government-owned apartments were transferred en masse to the private market. In Berlin, for example, vast bundles of public housing were sold overnight to large corporations. In one single transaction, Deutsche Wohnen purchased 60,000 flats from the city in 2006 for€450m; just €7,500 per apartment.With the role of welfare states in housing provision dismantled, many countries reached for demand-side interventions such as liberalising mortgage credit. This fuelled widespread speculation, pushed up house prices and encouraged extreme levels of household indebtedness. The resulting financial crisis of 2008 provided fresh opportunities for investors. Countries such as Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland became a treasure trove of “distressed” assets and mortgage debt that could be scooped up at bargain prices. Despite the widespread devastation caused by the crisis, Europe’s dependence on the financial sector for housing solutions only intensified in the years that followed.As power has shifted to investors and speculators, and governments have become ever more reliant on them, so it has been withdrawn from residents. In order to incentivise or “de-risk” private investment, governments across Europe have weakened tenant protections, slashed planning regulations and building standards, and offered special subsidies, grants and tax breaks for entities such as real estate investment trusts. One group in particular has borne the brunt of this: renters. Renters have seen their rents skyrocket, living conditions deteriorate and their security undermined. In Europe, some investment funds have directly driven the displacement of lower-income tenants and overseen disruptive evictions.Powerful financial actors have done a great job at framing themselves as the solution to, rather than the cause of, the prevailing crisis. They have incessantly pushed the now-dominant narrative that more real estate investment is a good thing because it will increase the supply of much-needed homes. Blackstone, for example,claimsto play a “positive role in addressing the chronic undersupply of housing across the continent”. But theevidence suggeststhat greater involvement of financial markets has not increased aggregate home ownership or housing supply, but instead inflated house prices and rents.The thing is, institutional investors aren’t really into producing housing. It is directly against their interests to significantly increase supply. As one asset managerconcedes, housing undersupply is bad for residents but “supportive for cashflows”. Blackstone’s president famouslyadmittedthat “the big warning signs in real estate are capital and cranes”. In other words, they need shortages to keep prices high.Where corporate capital does produce new homes, they will of course be maximally profitable. Cities such as Manchester, Brussels and Warsaw have experienced a proliferation of high-margins housing products such as micro-apartments, build-to-rent and co-living. Designed with the explicit intention ofoptimising cashflows, these are both unaffordable and unsuitable for most households. Common Wealth, a thinktank focusing on ownership,foundthat the private equity-backed build-to-rent sector, which accounts for 30% of new homes in London, caters predominantly to high-earning single people. Families represent just5%of build-to-rent tenants compared with a quarter of the private rental sector more broadly. These overpriced corporate appendages are a stark reminder of the market’s inability to deliver homes that fit the needs and incomes of most people.Something vital is missing from Labour’s housing policy: council houses | Abi O’ConnorRead moreWhile housing lies at the heart of political disillusionment today, it is for the same reason becoming a primary trigger for mobilisation across Europe. In October 2024, 150,000 protestersmarchedthrough the streets of Madrid demanding action. Some governments, includingDenmarkand theNetherlands, are introducing policies to deter speculators. But real estate capital continues to hold the power, so it continues to get its way – including by exploitingloopholes, and lobbying against policies that put profits at risk. In 2021, Berliners voted in favour of expropriating and socialising apartments owned by stock-listed landlords. But underpressure from the real estate lobby, politicians have stalled this motion. That same year Blackstone – Spain’s largest landlord with 40,000 housing units – opposed plans to impose a 30% target for social housing in institutional portfolios. Struggles against the immense structural power of real-estate interests will be hard fought.In recent decades we have been living through an ever-intensifying social experiment. Can housing, a fundamental need for all human beings, be successfully delivered under the machinations of finance capitalism? The evidence now seems overwhelming: no.As investors have come to dominate, so the power of residents has been systematically undermined. We are left with a crisis of inconceivable proportions. While we can, and should, point the finger at corporate greed, we must remember that this is the system working precisely as it is set up to do. When profit is the prevailing force, housing provision invariably fails to align with social need – to generate the types of homes within the price ranges most desperately required. In the coming years, housing will occupy centre stage in European politics. Now is the time for fundamental structural changes that reclaim homes from the jaws of finance, re-empower residents and reinstate housing as a core priority for public provision.Tim White is a research fellow at Queen Mary University of London and the London School of Economics studying housing, cities and inequalityExplore more on these topicsHousingThe housing crisis in EuropeCommunitiesEuropeEuropean UnionPrivate equitycommentShareReuse this content"

Hecouldspeak, there was no developmental delay, he just mostly chose not to. We were close in age, under two years apart, and – out in the world – I spoke for him. This is, perhaps, a common dynamic: chatty big sister, quiet little brother.I was sometimes reprimanded by well-meaning strangers. ‘Stop talking over your brother,’ they’d chide. ‘I askedhima question.’ And I would quieten down, shamed. My brother would say nothing, but entreat me with frightened eyes to step in.As a small child, I felt my brother spoke without language. I heard his voice in my head, and I believed I was his translator. To me, this felt natural. It’s easy to scoff – the delusions of childhood – but as toddlers we read everything around us. Through immersion in family, we acquire language.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsMaybe, my brother’s non verbal cues felt like language to me. So much of what is communicated between people involves attunement, a subtle reading of one another’s emotional states, micro-expressions and non verbal cues. Perhaps I just hadn’t learned to distinguish. Attuned, I read him as if he was speaking.I thought my sister and I had the worst fights in history. Then I asked the internet | Lucinda PriceRead moreWe’d always been close, but in adolescence our world wasengulfed by grief. We lost my sister and father to suicide, six years apart, while we staggered towards adulthood. I became quieter, but my brother was almost mute. During this time, he was learning guitar, and his music rose to fill the space. The language of loss, the language of yearning. So plaintive, so expressive. There are other ways to speak.Unlike me, my brother doesn’t remember much of our childhood.Trauma has erased it, the way it sometimes seems to. He has no memory of our sister, who we lost when he was 10. In this, we are opposites. For years now I have been writing about what happened in my family – in memoir, in fiction, in essays. Each memory glistens like a pearl on a string. Sometimes, I mourn that he has lost the memory of how adored he was. Baby brother, slant-eyed-smiler, boy of few words. Always the easiest of humans to love. When he read my memoir,Staying, he said, ‘You’ve given me back my childhood’. I’m not so deluded that I don’t see that I’d only given him mine.Nowadays, my brother is a man who leaves space for silence. If you want to hear him speak you must learn to be quiet. I have taught myself how to bite my tongue. And, there is alwaysthe music. Joy, wonder, melancholy, sadness, drama, so much drama. Tension, release, surprise, awe. My brother’s music moves through many moods. In song, his vocabulary is vast, his story unique. All instrumental, it speaks of many influences. The sounds of our childhood. Dylan, Tom Waits, Randy Newman, Neil Young, CSNY, Joe Cocker, Tim Buckley, Roy Harper, Bruce Springsteen, Billie Holiday, early pre-disco Bee Gees, The Beatles, Bob Marley, early Paul Kelly, Paul Simon, Judy Garland, John Lennon, Prince, Peter Gabriel, Talking Heads, Sade, and Sting. Listening, you can catch hints of all this, plus the intensity of an inner world rarely expressed verbally. It’s alive, it’s pulsing. All the history, all the feeling.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Petra Costa was rewatching footage of what has become a historic speech made in 2021 by Jair Bolsonaro, the then Brazilian president, when suddenly she noticed something that went largely unnoticed at the time. Addressing thousands of supporters in São Paulo, the far-right leaderlashed out at a supreme court justice, and said he would only leave the presidency“in prison or dead”. This statement is now cited as evidence againstBolsonaro, who is currently on trial, accused of attempting a coup to overturn his 2022 election defeat to current presidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro denies these allegations.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But what caught Costa’s eye in the footage was Bolsonaro’s gaze. As he shouted into the microphone, the paratrooper-turned-populist repeatedly looked – seemingly seeking validation – at one particular man in his entourage: the televangelist Silas Malafaia. In response, the evangelical leader appeared to be lip-syncing along to the president’s every word. “I watched the scene many times,” says film-maker Costa, “and the only conclusion I can draw is that Malafaia wrote Bolsonaro’s speech. If not, how could he have known every word?”Many people come to the supreme court with great CVs – but the first requirement is to be evangelicalThis footage provides a compelling moment in the 41-year-old’s new documentary, Apocalypse in the Tropics. Oscar-nominated forThe Edge of Democracy, her previous film about Brazil’s descent into populism, Costa this time explores the growing influence of evangelical leaders in the country’s political process. “This film is about Brazil,” she says, “but the story is part of a global phenomenon of religious motivations undermining democracies. We’ve seen the rise of religious fundamentalism joined by a nationalist, conservative and extremist agenda all over the world – from the US to Russia.”View image in fullscreenTheocracy fears … writer and director Petra Costa.Photograph: Virginie KhateebIn many ways, the new film is a continuation of the critically acclaimed previous documentary, which charted the unravelling of the democratic fabric of Latin America’s largest country with rare, behind-the-scenes access to key moments in recent politics, including therise to power of backbench congressman Bolsonaro.Now, through the lens of what she describes as the growing influence of Christian religious fundamentalism, Costa updates that story, covering events such as the January 2023 riot in which Bolsonaro supportersransacked the presidential palace, Congress and the supreme court. As investigations by the federal police and the public prosecutor’s office later concluded, the uprising was allegedlythe climax of acoup attempt that began while Bolsonaro was still in power.A central figure in Apocalypse in the Tropics is 66-year-old Malafaia, one of Brazil’s most prominent preachers, with whom Costa and her team, which includesproducer Alessandra Orofino, conducted about a dozen interviews. Although Bolsonaro had contact with many other Christian leaders during his four-year term, the film-maker believes none wielded as much influence over the president as Malafaia. In 2022, the evangelist even joined theBrazilian president’s delegationto London for Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral. “Next to him,” she says, “Bolsonaro almost seems diminished – like a child in front of a master.”In September 2018, just two days after being elected, Bolsonaro took to the stage at Malafaia’s church, greeted by chants of“Myth! Myth!”, as he is known, from the hundreds of worshippers present. Before handing the microphone to him, Malafaia paraphrased a passage from Corinthians, saying: “God chose the foolish things to shame the wise … God chose the lowly things, those of little value, the despised, the discarded, those that are nothing … to shame the things that are – so that no flesh may boast before Him. That’s why God chose you!” He then pointed to Bolsonaro, who listened with a furrowed brow.Apocalypse in the Tropics also captures a private meeting between the two, inside the presidential office, in which the preacher recalls officiating at Bolsonaro’s wedding. The far-right leader identifies as Catholic but his wife, Michelle, is a Baptist. Malafaia says: “We were waiting for the bride … and this guy came up to me. I say ‘this guy’ because we’re friends … and said, ‘Malafaia, I’m going to run for president.’ And I said, ‘Are you out of your mind?’ … I left thinking, ‘This guy is crazy.’”Shortly after, Costa asks the president if he will follow through on his promise to nominate someone “terribly evangelical” to a vacant supreme court seat. “Yes,” he replies. “Many people come to us with fantastic CVs, but the first requirement is to be evangelical. And, of course, after that, also having legal knowledge.” Bolsonaro kept his promise, appointinganother preacher to the court. In fact, such was the religious influence over Bolsonaro’s administration that Costa found herself wondering if Brazil was turning into a theocracy – a process she believes was halted by Lula’s election, although the risk, with new elections coming next year, “remains very much alive”.Although the former president is barred from running until 2030 by an electoral court ruling, polls suggest that any candidates backed by him – including his wife or one of his sons – could pose a serious challenge to Lula, who has already confirmed he will seek re-election.We approached Bolsonaro about all the claims in this article but his team did not respond.View image in fullscreenIn their pocket? … Jair Bolsonaro during a television interview.Photograph: Francisco Proner/2025 Netflix, Inc.The film weaves together interviews, archive footage and Costa’s narration, accompanied by closeups of apocalyptic paintings such as the depictions of the Last Judgment byFra AngelicoandHans Memling. The rise of evangelicals in Brazil is described as “one of the fastest religious shifts in human history”. In recent years, alongside a congress thatgrows more conservative with each election, gospel singers and religious influencershave become superstars, while Brazil’s still immensely popular telenovelas, or soaps, have increasinglyincorporated evangelical charactersand storylines into their plots.Some experts even predict that Protestants, Baptists, Pentecostals and neo-Pentecostalswill at some point become the majorityin Brazil – the country with the largestCatholicpopulation in the world. The documentary says they are now “over 30%” of the population, although new census data released last month – after the film had been finalised – showedthey make up only 27%, which nonetheless marks a significant increase since 1970, when they were 5.2%. Catholics declined from 91% to 57% over the same period. As they make up more than a quarter of the population, evangelicals represent a major challenge for any non-conservative candidate, such as President Lula, whofaces deep resistance from them.Apocalypse in the Tropics depicts an exchange between a mother and her teenage daughter inside their home, during Brazil’s 2018 presidential campaign. The mother says she plans to vote for Bolsonaro “because he’s a man of God”. She adds that Lula, although “also a man of God”, is “from Candomblé” – an Afro-Brazilian religion that faces persecution from some Christian groups. In reality, Lula is Catholic, but he has expressed support for Afro-Brazilian faiths.View image in fullscreenPowerful figure … preacher Silas Malafaia speaks at a rally in support of Bolsonaro.Photograph: Miguel Schincariol/AFP/Getty ImagesThe mother then asks her daughter to look up a photo of Lula “receiving the sword of Xangô”. In fact, it was an axe – a symbol of theorixá, a divine spirit associated with justice. It was a gift to Lulafrom a university rector in 2017. As the girl begins typing “Lula” on her phone, the autocomplete turns up phrases such as “being consecrated to the devil” and “supports unisex bathrooms”.The filmis not, however, intended as a critique of any specific religion, says Costa, but rather of the “political manipulation of faith, which poses one of the greatest threats to democracies around the world”. She recalls witnessing firsthand how the church can positively influence people’s lives, citing preachers who provided “physical, emotional and spiritual care” infavelas during the pandemic, offering food, jobs and even paying for ambulances.“What we need is a more nuanced perspective,” Costa concludes. “There won’t be a war in which good defeats evil, not from the right, nor from the left. There must be dialogue – and that’s complex and difficult.”Apocalypse in the Tropics is on limited release in UK cinemas on 11 July, and available on Netflix on 14 JulyExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsDocumentaryBrazilfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He wanted to put a flexi-disc on the cover and said: “Can we use Suspect Device?” That was going to be Still Little Fingers’ debut single so I told him he couldn’t have that, but I would write him a song.It’s the old adage – write about what you know. The opening line is: “There’s nothin’ for us in Belfast.” It couldn’t have been more teenage – “God, I’m bored.” Then the second verse referenced the army being on the streets. But that was actually what contributed to the boredom. Because of the situation inNorthern Ireland, bands wouldn’t come and play. The only honourable exception, prior to punk, was Rory Gallagher, who came every year without fail.Gordon Ogilvie, our co-manager, changed a couple of lines and we were good to go. These days, I could knock it up in my home studio and let Gavin hear the rough. But to hear it back then, he had to come to our next live show. We were all excited about what we thought – well, I certainly thought – was a good song. But at the bar afterwards, he told me he thought it was crap!View image in fullscreen‘Lightning in a bottle’ … the cover of Alternative Ulster.Photograph: TheCoverVersion/AlamyThings were happening fast for us because John Peel was playing Suspect Device into the ground. Island, the record label, flew us to London to record some demos. We really thought we’d hit the big time. Ed Hollis was producing – this was a man who had just had a Top 10 hit with Eddie and the Hot Rods’ Do Anything You Wanna Do. But he insisted on hiring in all this equipment we weren’t au fait with, so the demos weren’t very representative of how the band sounded. Unsurprisingly, Island passed.We were thrown into limbo. We’d gone so far down the path with Island that we had quit our jobs. Then out of the blue, we got a phone call from Tom Robinson, who was looking for an opening act. We started to feel a bit of pressure in terms of needing something to raise our profile, and then the Rough Trade label suggested it put out Alternative Ulster.In the interim, Gordon had managed to get the demo tapes from Island. We didn’t have the money to re-record it, but Rough Trade did pay for a remix. The single’s cover photo was taken by Milton Haworth, who had happened to be at a disturbance somewhere. In the midst of it all, he saw the soldier crouched down by a pillar with his gun and thislittle kid on top of the pillar laughing. It was lightning in a bottle in terms of photography.We do an outdoor show every year in Belfast. We always finish with Alternative Ulster and it’s such a unifying call. I find it so pretentious when you say stuff like this – but when you stand on the stage and watch the audience’s reaction, it’s humbling.View image in fullscreenGeoff Travis in the Rough Trade shop, London, circa 1977.Photograph: Estate Of Keith Morris/RedfernsGeoff Travis,producer and Rough Traderecord shop and labelfounderJohn Peel playing Suspect Device was the beginning of everything. We contacted Gordon Ogilvie and started buying large quantities of it to distribute. That’s how we got to know the band. Rough Trade had The Cartel [a record distribution organisation] and the idea was to bypass the existing conventional mechanisms and let the independent sector grow.I never really knew the full story of what happened with Island. We did so well distributing Suspect Device that we simply asked if we could do the next single as a Rough Trade release, a one-off. Alternative Ulster was remixed by me with the engineer, Doug Bennett, at Olympic Studios in London. I didn’t do that much, but maybe made it a bit more lively. That was the first time I’d ever been in the studio. It was quite amusing.What gave me the gall to do that without experience? I guess I just knew how I wanted it to sound. That was the beginning of my producer career. It was the times, it was the whole punk ethic where you just went and did stuff.I’ve said this many times, but I just love Henry Cluney’s rhythm guitar. The way he played, it’s like a bar of steel or something. That was a big part of their sound. And Jake had that really great voice, played great guitar. He meant it – he was convincing. We were quite young ourselves. We didn’t really know huge amounts about SLF’s culture at that time, but we were learning. There wasn’t really time to sit down for a few hours and discuss politics, discuss the future of the world, discuss aims and aspirations. We just did stuff.Alternative Ulster has been rereleased as part of Rough Trade 45s: Volume 1.

As Japan’s beloved Nakagin Capsule Tower resurfaces, we celebrate an architectural marvelOliver WainwrightMon 7 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 12.38 EDTShareLooking like a teetering stack of washing machines perched on the edge of an elevated highway, the Nakagin Capsule Tower was an astonishing arrival on the Tokyo skyline in 1972. It was the heady vision ofKisho Kurokawa, a radical Japanese architect who imagined a high-rise world of compact capsules, where people could cocoon themselves away from the information overload of the modern age. These tiny pods would be “a place of rest to recover”, he wrote, as well as “an information base to develop ideas, and a home for urban dwellers”. Residents could peer out at the city from their cosy built-in beds through a single porthole window, or shut it all out by unfurling an elegant circular fan-like blind, all while remaining connected with the latest technology at all times.Launched to critical acclaim, the Nakagin tower’s 140 capsules quickly sold out, and became highly sought after by well-heeled salarymen looking for a place to crash when they missed the last train home. Never intended to be full-time housing, the pods came stuffed with mod cons: en suite bathroom, foldout desk, telephone and Sony colour TV. But, 50 years on, after a prolonged lack of maintenance and repairs, and disagreements among owners about its future, the asbestos-riddled building was finally disassembled in 2022. The creaking steel capsules of Kurokawa’s space-age fantasy were unbolted and removed from the lift and stair towers, pod by pod.Buildings in Tokyo had an average lifespan of 15 to 20 years. So standing for 50 years makes it a resounding successNow, three years on, a little piece of his dream is back. After a meticulous process of conservation, people will soon be able to get a glimpse of life in one of these sci-fi capsules, thanks to anew exhibitionat the Museum of Modern Art in New York. MoMA acquired a unit in 2023, one of 14 capsules that were carefully restored to their original condition, with oversight from Kurokawa’s office, after the tower was disassembled. “The Nakagin Capsule Tower is one of the world’s most written about works of modern architecture,” says MoMA curator Evangelos Kotsioris. “But the many lives of the building, and its residents, have rarely been told.”View image in fullscreen‘Office, studio, hotel, home, conference room, or urban villa’ … interior view.Photograph: © Noritaka MinamiHe and co-curator Paula Vilaplana de Miguel have pieced together an immersive display that tells the full story of the project in all its facets, from conception to marketing to unexpected afterlife. There will be a wealth of ephemera, from the building’s only surviving sales brochure, to the original promotional film for the tower, alongside video interviews with former residents, and an explorable digital model of the entire building. And of course, there’s the capsule itself, visible in all its freshly white-painted glory through the window of MoMA’s street-level gallery. The museum’s retractable glass facade was opened up for the first time to get it in.Peek through the pod’s porthole window and you will find a streamlined white world that could have been lifted from 2001: A Space Odyssey. A reel-to-reel tape recorder shines out from an angled wall panel, next to a sleek radio receiver and built-in rotary phone, beneath a Sony Trinitron TV. A bright red Olivetti typewriter perches on a fold-down desk, alongside a Sharp electronic calculator – one of the cutting-edge features included in the “super-deluxe” capsule model.“Just as there is a full range of automobiles, from sedans to coupes to sports cars,” Kurokawa explained in the sales brochure, “a capsule house can serve numerous purposes – mini-office, studio, hotel, home, conference room, or urban villa – based on the equipment selected.”View image in fullscreenMedia-savvy salesman … Kurokawa in front of the completed tower in 1974.Photograph: Tomio OhashiKurokawa was the youngest founding member of theMetabolist movement, a group of Japanese architects formed in 1960 that fused ideas about megastructures with those of organic biological growth. They imagined a networked world of interconnecting modular structures that could multiply and spread across the planet like a great branching fungus. But, unlike many of his contemporaries who struggled to communicate effectively with clients and the public through the usual clouds of architectural jargon, Kurokawa was a media-savvy salesman.He produced a sizzling manifesto, The Capsule Declaration, illustrated with Airstream trailers and Nasa space capsules, amniotic sacs and coffins, arguing that “the capsule transcends human and device”. He imagined a seductive plug-and-play future, where capsules could be adapted, expanded and replaced as societal needs changed, presenting a new kind of architecture capable of growth and transformation through “metabolic cycles”. In 1970, he published a punchy magazine-like book, which came with a striking fold-out orange and pinkposterand a 7-inch vinyl recording of his computerised voice reading out his manifesto. On seeing this, as well as Kurokawa’s capsule installation at the Osaka Expo the same year, the Nakagin development company was sold.The 1973 international oil crisis saw construction costs soar – and Kurokawa’s capsule dreams evaporateTheir sales pitch for the “capsule manshon” – a term for high-end apartment buildings – was expounded in a glossy brochure designed like a car catalogue. It included dashing cutaway illustrations of the 10 square metre capsules, drawn by a car magazine illustrator, suggesting that life in one of these pods would be just as thrilling as driving a sports car. The construction company, Taisei, made a 25-minute film, with actors performing a glamorous day in the life of the tower, while buyers were even gifted a lamp in the shape of a building. The marketing worked. Despite their small size, the capsules sold for around 50% more per square metre than the average apartment.The only surviving wooden model of the project will be on show in the exhibition, and attentive visitors will notice that it includes a second capsule tower. Such was the initial sales success, Nakagin started planning a twin complex across the road, to be connected to the first by a raised plinth, as well as towers for several other sites across the city. But their timing couldn’t have been worse. The 1973 international oil crisis saw construction costs soar – and Kurokawa’s capsule dreams evaporate. Still, the first tower remained a success for the next 15 years. Its neighbourhood, Ginza, boomed into a bustling business district, while the capsule prices were ever-inflated by the 1980s bubble economy. Kurokawa, meanwhile, would continue pursuing his penchant for pods elsewhere, building theworld’s first capsule hotelin Osaka in 1979, which spawned a wave of similar micro-hotels across Japan.View image in fullscreenMeticulously restored … the MoMa’s capsule.Photograph: Jonathan Muzikar/The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Nakagin Capsule Tower Preservation and Restoration Project, TokyoBut the Nakagin tower wouldn’t be repeated. Like a giant pixelated bar chart, it reflected the country’s fortunes: when the bubble burst in the early 1990s, so the capsules started to crumble. Residents moved out, maintenance funds dwindled, and rainwater pooling on the capsules’ flat roofs caused extensive corrosion.Kurokawa had always intended that the pods would be replaced after 25 years, to respond to changing needs. But a crucial design flaw made it impossible to remove them individually without first removing every capsule above. Besides, any attempt to refurbish would have required the prohibitively expensive removal of the asbestos insulation. Lured by the value of the site for redevelopment, the individual pod owners voted by majority to sell the building for demolition in 2007, just a few months before Kurokawa died.“Many people see the Nakagin tower as a failed utopian project,” says Kotsioris, but it actually stood for a relatively long time, in terms of Japan’s throwaway building culture. “When buildings in Tokyo had an average lifespan of 15 to 20 years, the fact that it stood for 50 years makes it a resounding success.”View image in fullscreen‘Like a traumatic memory’ … Wakana Nitta (AKA Koe-chan) in the capsule she uses as a DJ booth.Photograph: Courtesy Tatsuyuki Maeda / The Nakagin Capsule Tower Preservation and Restoration Project, Tokyo, JapanAs it turned out, the building’s final years were some of its most vibrant. It won a 15-year reprieve when, after the 2007 financial crisis, the developer that had agreed to acquire the site unexpectedly filed for bankruptcy. Takayuki Sekine, a retired chamber of commerce manager, and his wife, Yumiko, bought a capsule when demolition was already on the cards, and spent every weekend in it. “After I started my blogposts, my articles attracted many readers here,” Takayuki recalls in a video interview. “Some enthusiasts started living here, with many more people joining in. And we had so much fun, with drinking parties at night.”In another video, a DJ called Koe-chan explains how she spotted the tower from the highway. “It stuck with me like a traumatic memory,” she recalls, and she was compelled to acquire a capsule for live-streaming her DJ sets. Others used their pods as offices or libraries, each customised to their new purpose, while the collective efforts to repair and maintain the leaky hulk brought the tower a real sense of community for the first time. “Ironically, the capsules were originally designed as protective wombs for isolation from the city,” says Kotsioris. “But in the end, they turned out to form a really sociable, neighbourly community.”As for Kurokawa, he would no doubt be amused that some of his capsules have found new homes, scattered around cultural institutions and collections worldwideAfter all, he imagined a future where you might undock your capsule and take it with you across the ocean to pastures new.The Many Lives of the Nakagin Capsule Tower is at MoMA, New York, from Thursday until 12 July 2026Explore more on these topicsArchitectureJapanAsia PacificMuseum of Modern ArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In her 2003 debut feature,Thirteen, and her 2008 teen vampire hit Twilight, the writer-director bolstered the stories with environmentally and socially conscious messaging to inspire people to “save the planet”. And with her latest film, Street Smart, which she describes as “a kind of homeless The Breakfast Club”, she is still “sneaking in” her “good values”.Street Smart, now in post-production, is a low-budget ensemble drama, executive-produced by Gerard Butler and partnered with charities Covenant House and Safe Place for Youth, that centres on a group of unhoused teens bonding through music, trauma and humour while fending for themselves on the margins of LA society. It stars Yara Shahidi (Grown-ish), Isabelle Fuhrman (Orphan) and Michael Cimino (Never Have I Ever), as well as a group of unknown actors whom Hardwicke describes as having “big hearts and compassion for others; otherwise, they would be trying to work on a superhero film”.View image in fullscreenKristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in Twilight (2008).Photograph: Summit Entertainment/AllstarHomelessness is a major issue affecting the Californian city. Just last week, US district judge David O Carter ruled that Los Angeles officialshad “flouted” their responsibilityto create new shelters for unhoused people by June 2027. The humanitarian crisis in Los Angeles, exacerbated by the Pacific Palisades and Altadenawildfiresin January, is an issue that longtime Venice Beach resident Hardwicke was keen to explore. “We shot on my street, so it’s very close to my heart,” she says. “It’s a love letter to Venice, because we have so many eccentric, strange characters of all economic levels.“Everybody’s going through so much, and [there’s] such high rent in LA,” she adds. “Even if you have a job, you still might be homeless, crashing here [and] there, because a job doesn’t pay that much. The kids in our movie have jobs – how do you make ends meet?”Hardwicke, who is in Malta as a jury member at the Mediterrane film festival, says her film addresses a bigger target: Trump’s rollback ofprovisions such as reproductive healthcare access, welfare budgets, and diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. “Even though we wrote it before he got elected, Street Smart is directly addressing some of [these] issues,” she says. “It’s telling a compelling story that shows people who do not look like Donald Trump, or think like him.”Hardwicke is no stranger to film-making hardship. Despite her early successes, which included sparking the YA movie boom with the hugely successful adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s novelTwilight, Hardwicke discovered a harsh truth: “No, people aren’t going to hire more women directors. They’re not going to give you the next job and let you do something great. It was an earth-shattering reality right away.”She recalls the offices of Twilight producers Summit Entertainment soon after the film’s initial box-office success in 2008. She knew that successful male directors might be gifted “a car, or a three-picture deal, or [getting] to do basically whatever you want” – but none of that happened. “I walked into a room with all these gifts, and everybody was congratulating the studio, and they gave me a box,” Hardwicke says. “I opened it up, and it was a mini cupcake.”Hardwicke was replaced by Chris Weitz for the first Twilight sequel, New Moon, and male directors were hired to helm the remaining three films in the franchise. Hardwicke went on to direct 2011’sRed Riding Hood, produced by Leonardo DiCaprio and starring Amanda Seyfried, but “it was much more challenging”, she says. “It had a lower budget than we had on Twilight, and it was all fantasy, so we couldn’t shoot any real locations and had to build all the sets. They didn’t give me much freedom.”Still, Hardwicke has been able to exert her will when it comes to casting, and in the process has launched the careers of some of Hollywood’s biggest actors, from Evan Rachel Wood and Robert Pattinson – she was at his birthday party 18 months ago – to Oscar Isaac in The Nativity Story and her “buddy” Jeremy Renner in Lords of Dogtown, which this year marks its 20th anniversary. “I gave him an early shot,” Hardwicke says of the Hawkeye and Avengers star. “I thought Jeremy and Shea Whigham would be funny brothers who sell [cocaine]. I love all of my kids.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Before switching to directing, she was a production designer with credits on Richard Linklater’s The Newton Boys, David O Russell’s Three Kings and Cameron Crowe’s Vanilla Sky, the last of which Cruise starred in and produced. Hardwicke had been a last-minute addition, replacing the previous production designer two weeks into the shoot. She remembers late nights with the actor-producer: “He was inspiring because he does not settle for anything less than excellence.”Hardwicke says Cruise offered to stay late to work out a conference-room set up. “He and I are acting out the scene, we’re rearranging the furniture until one in the morning,” she says. “I’m like, ‘Dude, aren’t you even tired?’ He had to be back at [7 am], but he wanted to get it right. Every chance he had. He never stopped.”Nowadays, Cruise’s intense commitment is mostly seen in the Mission: Impossible franchise, but despite her fondness for Cruise’s work ethic, when asked if she’d ever helm one of his spy films, Hardwicke chuckles: “Not necessarily.”Explore more on these topicsFilmFilm industryHomelessnessTwilight (Film)Twilight (Culture)newsShareReuse this content"

Now receiving a rare production, it captures his conflict between ethics and aestheticsMichael BillingtonMon 7 Jul 2025 07.09 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 07.11 EDTShareWho wrote the following: “When private property is abolished, there will be no necessity for crime”? In one of his plays the same writer has a female revolutionary cry: “How easy is it for a king to kill his people by thousands but we cannot rid ourselves of one crowned man in Europe.” If I reveal that the writer was a London-based Irishman, most people would assume it was Bernard Shaw. In fact, it was Oscar Wilde and, while the first quote comes from his essay The Soul of Man Under Socialism, the last is from his play Vera; or, The Nihilists which is to get a rare professional production at theBrockley Jack Studio theatre, south-east London, in September.The play itself is virtually unknown even to Wildean devotees. It was written in 1879 and loosely based on the story of a 22-year-old Russian revolutionary who had attempted to shoot the St Petersburg chief of police. Wilde’s version is set in Moscow but his heroine, Vera Sabouroff, has a similar political ardour and leads a band of nihilists who plan to assassinate the tsar. That is only the starting-point for a robustly noisy melodrama that was intended for London production in 1881. But the actual assassination of TsarAlexander IIin March of that year and the fact that the Prince of Wales was married to the sister of the new tsarina killed it stone dead. When it was eventually produced in New York in 1883, it was greeted with sneery disdain and, aside from the odd amateur revival, has lain buried ever since.View image in fullscreenA poster for the new production of Oscar Wilde’s Vera; Or, The NihilistsYet, for all its obvious faults, the play has several points of interest and one is what it reveals about Wilde’s own divided nature. We tend to think of that division in terms of his sexuality but there is a comparable split between his radical and aesthetic selves. The two achieve a perfect reconciliation inThe Importance of Being Earnestwhich offers a running commentary on class, money, marriage, morals and the state of society while being an exquisite comic creation. But in an early work like Vera there is a deep, unhealed division between the earnest and the epigrammatic. The play is packed with diatribes against despotism and full of rhetorical hymns to liberty: at one point Vera apostrophises the concept as: “O mighty mother of eternal time, thy robe is purple with the blood of those who have died for thee.”But the play’s most intriguing character is Prince Paul, the Russian prime minister, tsarist apologist and devious word-spinner. He talks throughout in chiselled phrases such as “Experience, the name men give to their mistakes,” and suggests that there is a link between making a good salad and being a brilliant diplomat: the art in both cases is “to know exactly how much oil one must put with one’s vinegar”. He is the prototype of Lord Henry Wotton in The Picture of Dorian Gray and all those languid aristocrats who pepper Wilde’s society dramas with their potted witticisms.View image in fullscreenAristocrat … John Gorick, centre, as Lord Henry Wotton with Rupert Mason and Guy Warren-Thomas in The Picture of Dorian Gray at Trafalgar Studios, London, in 2016.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianOn the one hand, Wilde celebrates revolutionary ardour: on the other, a dandified cynic who claims “life is much too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it”. But this conflict between ethics and aesthetics is not peculiar to Wilde. In 1885, Henry James pursued a similar bifurcation, admittedly with far more subtlety, in his novelThe Princess Casamassima. Its hero, Hyacinth Robinson, is the illegitimate son of an English aristocrat and a French working-woman and his life is as divided as his name suggests. Through his meeting with the titular princess, he acquires a taste for the trappings of privilege. But he also has a passion for social justice that leads him to join a band of political conspirators very like those in Vera and to accept the duty of assassination.James had no great sympathy for Wilde, and in 1895 shamefully refused to sign a petition calling for mitigation of his prison sentence. Yet the two writers had more in common than one suspects and in The Princess Casamassima you find a strange echo of the dilemma posed by Vera: how do you reconcile the desire to change the world with a delight in its culture; or, to put it more simply, how do you achieve a perfect balance between socialism and style?Vera; or, The Nihilists is atBrockley Jack Studio theatre, London, 16-27 September.Explore more on these topicsTheatreOscar WildeClass issuesRussiaSocialismHenry JamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The writers warn of increased book bans and biasMelissa HellmannMon 7 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 7 Jul 2025 11.07 EDTShareSarah Brannen, an illustrator and children’s book author, was riding in the car with her sister when she received an alert on her phone in late June. She was in a group chat with other authors whose books were being debated in aUS supreme courtcase, and the messages soon poured in. Her book, Uncle Bobby’s Wedding, which highlights a same-sex marriage, was at the center of a contentious case that had widespread implications for public school education throughout the nation.As per the27 June ruling, a group of Maryland parents now have the option to remove their public elementary school students from classes where Uncle Bobby’s Wedding and other storybooks withLGBTQ+themes are read. The justices decided through a6-3 votethat the Montgomery county school board violated parents’ right to freely exercise their religion by forbidding kids from opting out of instruction. The parents argued that the board impeded them from teaching their kids about gender and sexuality in a way that aligned with their belief system.US supreme court rules schools must let kids opt out of LGBTQ+ book readingsRead more“I’m terribly concerned that one of the implications of this is that LGBTQ children and children with LGBTQ families will see some children having to leave the classroom because they’re reading a book about their families,” Brannen said. “I think it is just a terrible thing to tell young children that there’s something wrong with them so that some children can’t even hear about their family.”Brannen and other authors whose books are at the center of the case fear that the ruling could lead to parents taking their children out of any lessons that they disagree with in the future, including inclusive tellings of history. Additionally, they contend that it’s important that public school education reflects the world, which consists of diverse family structures, gender and sexual identities. Teaching kids about LGBTQ+ people and diverse families can make them moreempatheticandsocially competent, studies have found. Along with Uncle Bobby’s Wedding, which was illustrated by Lucia Soto, the parents’complaintincluded six other books, including Born Ready by Jodie Patterson, My Rainbow by US representative DeShanna Neal and Trinity Neal, and Pride Puppy! by Robin Stevenson.View image in fullscreenDeShanna Neal speaks in Dover, Delaware, on 17 June 2017.Photograph: Aimee Dilger/AP“When you start to chip away at what public education was created to do,” said Neal, “you are chipping away at the very foundation of what democracy, and liberty and freedom are supposed to be.”‘Critical thinkers that can move America forward’Research has shown that it is never too young to expose children to diversity, said Rachel H Farr, a University of Kentucky professor and associate chair of psychology. Her work focuses on LGBTQ+ parents and families. She has found that kids with LGBTQ+ parents report having higher social competence than their peers because they have learned to accept that it is OK for people to be different. Exposure to diverse family structures through books, she said, could also help kids with heterosexual parents better understand the world around them.“When children learn about people who may be different than they are, that can help with things like understanding … that people can have a different point of view,” Farr said. “That can help with things like perspective-taking, kindness, empathy, a sense of belonging: things that I think many of us would argue are experiences and skills that we want children and people around us to have.”The flip side of not exposing kids to diversity, unfortunately, is that the opposite can happen. It might inadvertently increase bias, suggesting that there is only one right way to thinkRachel H Farr, University of KentuckyIn Born Ready, a transgender boy expresses his frustration with being misgendered, until he comes to a place where he feels affirmed in his gender identity. For Patterson, the recent ruling symbolizes a shift in education from a place where preconceived beliefs are challenged and individual thoughts are formed, to a space where students are taught from a narrow perspective. It is likely that students will encounter LGBTQ+ people throughout their lives, she said, and it is important that they be prepared.“It is imperative to have experiences that are beyond the belief you might hold at that moment, so that we can be a talented country with critical thinkers that can move America forward,” Patterson said. “And I do believe that all the progress that we’ve seen in America has been through collaboration through thought, through bringing opposing opinions together and finding a space that is not necessarily one or the other but a combination.”If parents can choose to opt their children out of subjects that they don’t believe in, she said, “does that also allow for people like Native Americans to opt out of a story about Christopher Columbus or Black families to opt out of what we call American history, which is often unjustly told through the eyes of white men?” Patterson sees it as dangerous for people to not be exposed to ideas that they disagree with, because it makes them singularly informed.In the dissenting opinion of the ruling, Justice Sonia Sotomayorsaidthat the decision “threatens the very essence of a public education”, adding that it “strikes at the core premise of public schools: that children may come together to learn not the teachings of a particular faith, but a range of concepts and views that reflect our entire society”.View image in fullscreenJodie Patterson, author of Born Ready, in New York last year.Photograph: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Human Rights CampaignAccording to Farr’s research, schools are an important platform for children to learn how to form their opinions. Exposure to diversity, she said, has been shown to instill children with values of respect and kindness.“The flip side of not exposing kids to diversity, unfortunately, is that the opposite can happen. It might inadvertently increase bias, suggesting that there is only one right way to think or to be in the world,” Farr said, “as opposed to developing an appreciation that there’s a lot of different ways to be in the world, and to express oneself.”‘Accelerated censorship’: advocates criticize US supreme court ruling on LGBTQ+ booksRead moreStevenson, the author of Pride Puppy!, a story about a queer family attending a Pride parade, thinks that allowing students to leave the classroom will also make queer families invisible. The ruling “segregates books about queer people, books about families like mine, and treats these books differently from other books, and in so doing, it sends a terribly harmful message to all kids, but particularly to kids who are LGBTQ+ themselves, and kids from LGBTQ+ families”, Stevenson said. “It also has the potential to accelerate this epidemic of book bans that we are already in the midst of.”As the US supreme court deliberated on the case, DeShanna Neal, a Delaware representative and co-author of My Rainbow, worked with their legislative colleagues on a bill to protect book bans in the state of Delaware. In My Rainbow, Neal makes a rainbow-colored wig for their trans daughter, Trinity, to help her express her gender identity. TheFreedom to Read Actpassed on 30 June, which Neal sees as a sign that they and their colleagues are working to keep the state safe. After it passed, Neal received a text message from a colleague that read: “You will never have to worry about My Rainbow being banned in Delaware.”Explore more on these topicsUS book bansLGBTQ+ rightsUS supreme courtUS educationTransgenderUS politicsMarylandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s on bucket hats, football shirts, tracksuit tops, T-shirts and, every so often, someone’s face. The fanbase goes across generations and demographics. There are those who were there the first time, and teenagers who grew up on their music. Some have travelled for miles – from Italy, Spain, Portugal and the US. If the crowd is largely white, there’s a contingent of fans from east Asia.Put together, the hordes marauding on the streets ofCardiffbefore the 74,500-capacity sell-out gig at the Principality stadium are united by their love – as one fan described, it’s like going to a football match where everyone supports the same team.Diversity in the fanbase reveals itself in different ways through what they wear. There are the merch fans, who have bought T-shirts on the day. That’s true of Ash Park, Marcus Long and the fortuitously named Joe Gallagher, three friends who have long talked about a potentialOasisreunion.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Ash Parker, Marcus Long and Joe Gallagher in their brand new T-shirtsGallagher – who paid £600 for his ticket – says he won’t wear the T-shirt beyond the gig but he’ll frame it instead. “It’s historic,” he says. Long, meanwhile, is contemplating a tattoo – “it would probably be something like that,” he says, pointing to the logo with the date of the gig on his T-shirt. Helen Durbin, who is wearing a matching T-shirt to her friend Nicky Thomas, says it will likely have the same fate as a lot of music merch – something to wear to bed.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Helen Durbin, Paul Durbin and Nicky ThomasHelen’s husband Paul, meanwhile, is in a different design, with the Gallagher brothers looking moody on the front. “I prefer this one,” referring to the logo’d one his wife has. “[But] I thought it would be a little bit too sweet [to match].”Oasis’s own look – or that of the Gallaghers, anyway – has remained set for decades. Part football terrace classics, part Mod, part 90s, its simplicity – and roots in familiar tropes of British menswear – is why it’s so influential. It has familiar components that are easy to put together: parkas, shirts, anoraks, Adidas track tops, baggy jeans, football shirts and – of course – the bucket hat.There’s a sector of the fanbase that endeavours to bring something of the Gallagher look into their own. “Cool” is a word mentioned a lot, along with – to quote the band – “biblical,” as Ricardo Riquier puts it. With his mop of hair and parka from Liam Gallagher’s fashion labelPretty Green, Riquier, who travelled from Lisbon, says his style was formed in the 90s.View image in fullscreenRicardo Riquier from Portugual“I never had another hairstyle since I was 15,” he laughs. “I’ll die with this hair.” The parka was a non-negotiable. “I didn’t know how hot or how cold it was going to be, but I’m like ‘I’m taking my parka, otherwise I’ll look like an idiot.’”Chris Taylor has travelled from Falkirk. He also loves a parka – he says it is “the best way to cut about”.View image in fullscreenChris Taylor from ScotlandToday, he signals his long-term fandom with a ‘Who the fuck is Liam Gallagher?’ T-shirt, from a solo tour around 14 years ago. “It’s vintage, and I keep it in my collector’s box,” he says. Taylor appreciates the Gallagher style for its “arrogance. They do it and others follow.” They certainly do.Sergio Cid and Jairo Velas have travelled from Madrid, and wear the outfits of those who have followed a band for decades – Cid’s first gig was Oasis in 1997, when he was 12. He wears a vintage Manchester City shirt similar to one the Gallaghers were photographed wearing in 1994, a bucket hat and – crucially – a denim jacket fastened with a single button at the neck, as worn by Liam for the Familiar to Millions gig in 2000.View image in fullscreenSergio Cid, left, and Jairo Velas“He knows more than me about the details,” says Velas (Cid speaks little English). “That’s why we are really disappointed about the hair. Liam has a shaved head. We’re like ‘No, you need to bring 2002 back.’”Ethan Besant is also keen on the classic style – he’s showing that through an outfit which is dominated by Pretty Green, from the logoed polo shirt to the green parka and the badges on the bucket hat. What does he like about Liam’s style? “He’s just cool, isn’t he?” he says. Besant appreciates the fact that what the singer wears has not differed hugely for years. “It’s all pretty consistent,” he says. “I guess when you find your style, you stick to it.”View image in fullscreenEthan BesantWith the Oasis tour one of the events of the summer, their look is something of a fashion moment too – TikTok is full of videos of users showcasing their outfits. Sportswear retailerJD sayssearches for “oasis fashion” were up 913% in June, while Depop says searches for bucket hats are up 61% since last year and – perhaps improbably in a heatwave – searches for parkas are up 1,850%. This take on Oasis style is very much present in Cardiff too – on those who take their style as a jump-off point to make their own look.Tamara Sims bought her denim jacket on Vinted for £20 – with copies of 90s Oasis patches covering it. “You say what patches you want and they make it for you,” she says. Did Sims want a “look” to come to the concert? “I wanted a bit of Adidas,” she says, pointing to her socks, “and I just bought my bucket hat now.” Jae In Yoo, who has travelled from South Korea, wears her zip-up merch track jacket oversized – “I like it big” – with a long gingham skirt. She’ll add a bucket hat when she goes into the gig.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenTamara Sims; and Jae In YooJulia Bussi, seen in the main image, has travelled from Italy with three friends. She cut her tour T-shirt into a crop top (“I prefer,” she says) while her friend Eduardo Pane finishes his look with sunglasses that are “part Matrix, part young Liam”.Lucy Barnett and Ellie Thomas both wear T-shirts from Next, tied at the waist, with lace bubble skirts. “We wanted it to be feminine but comfy at the same time,” says Barnett. Are Oasis cashing in with all these collabs? “100%,” she says.View image in fullscreenLucy Barnett, left, and Ellie ThomasFootball shirts – whether real ones, mostly Man City or Oasis merch styled to look like football shirts – are everywhere. Which makes sense: the fact that the football shirt is nowan established part of young people’s wardrobeis the ripple effect of Oasis style. An image of the brothers in striped Man City shirts in 1994 is familiar to anyone who looks at Britpop style accounts on Instagram. The connection has even gone full circle – as well as the football shirt in the Adidas collaboration, Man City’s fourth kit for 24/25 was designed with Noel Gallagher.Those wearing them today appreciate the connection between football and music. Brandon Woodman and Jamie Winter have travelled from Edinburgh – with Woodman wearing the busy Scotland away kit from the 1990 World Cup, and Winter in the 90s Man City shirt. “We like the way they bring football into a rock’n’roll setting,” says Winter.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBrandon Woodman, left, with Jamie White; and Jennie ConnelyOr sometimes it’s just a look. Jennie Connely wears a football-like shirt, with Supersonic written across it in Oasis’s font, fromMama Established, a brand that makes unofficial merch for everyone from Sam Fender to Pedro Pascal. Although she supports Middlesbrough, she “wouldn’t dare” wear a Boro shirt today. “I wanted to feel comfortable, but I wanted to feel part of this. It’s 16 years in the making, but it feels like it’s brand new,” she says.Kent Garrison, who travelled from Dallas, committed to a look – he wore that Man City fourth kit complete with the socks. “I came with a plan to wear the full kit,” he says. “I was a little nervous, but I said, ‘You know what? This once in a lifetime opportunity, and I’m going to support.’”View image in fullscreenKent Garrison from Dallas, TexasAlthough Garrison is not totally familiar with the Premier League, he appreciates that the Gallaghers were City fans even when the team were finishing close to the relegation places. “They’re not bandwagoners,” he said. “They’ve been Man City since the beginning.”If Garrison and Connely remember the first time – Connelly has seen the band five times – there are plenty of fans that don’t. This sector of the crowd, in their teens and early 20s, are perhaps the most creative with the Oasis look. Jeongsee Park and Seohyeon Shin have mixed it withY3Kstyle – Shin wears reflective contact lenses – and Park’s prized piece is a genuine 1994 City shirt (“Very expensive,” she winces) which she wears with an oversized track top from the latest merch.View image in fullscreenSeohyeon Shin, left, and Jeongsee ParkThe friends say it’s only young women who like Oasis in South Korea – they are surprised by how many older people are in Cardiff. Shin is influenced by Liam’s all-white outfit from Knebworth in 1997. “I thought he was an angel,” she says.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenIwan Strong; Charlie Jenkins; and Taylerann GilderIwan Strong, 18, also loves all things 90s – he’s inspired by bands but also his dad “in old-fashioned Adidas”. He plays in a band and says he would dress like “a mixture of Oasis and Manic Street Preachers” when he plays a gig. Seventeen-year-old Charlie Jenkins, with a blond crop and bright blue braces, likes the Gallaghers’ look as “football hooliganism, masculine, real life. It’s loud.”Taylerann Gilder, 19, wins for her look: an oversized shell suit jacket top bought on Vinted, 90s-style skate jeans and an XXXL Liam T-shirt customised to fit by her mum, with bows along the sides. “I like to rearrange my clothes – I cut a lot of my T-shirts, cropped and stuff like that,” she says. If she has learned about Oasis and their style from her parents, Gilder says the next generation aren’t far behind. “My nephew, he’s seven, he walks around with the sunglasses, the Adidas tracksuits. We all call him little Liam Gallagher.”Explore more on these topicsOasisCardiffPhotographyShareReuse this content"

You write a word on a piece of paper, then fold it over so the next person can’t see what you’ve written, and you end up with a strange sentence. The game is now known as Exquisite Corpse, after the result of their first go:Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau(The exquisite corpse will drink the new wine).Exquisite Corpse gave Breton so much joy because it summed up the essence of the surrealist school of art he was trying to articulate at the time. In his first 1924 manifesto, he told budding surrealists to put themselves in “as passive, or receptive, a state of mind” as they can and write quickly. Forget about talent, about subject, about perception or punctuation. Simply trust, he writes, “in the inexhaustible nature of the murmur”.View image in fullscreenReceptive state of mind … an invitation to Exquisite Corpse from 1927.Photograph: API/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesIn the year of its centenary, the spirit of Breton’s Exquisite Corpse is not just un-dead but frantically rattling the lid of its coffin from the inside. Several modern artists are continuing the surrealist tradition by composing with found materials (words, images, objects), drawn from the accidental debris of the everyday, to make the unexpected.I’ve found extremely beautiful haikus in sordid booksFor a recent show at Frith Street Gallery, the British artist Fiona Banner showed works made with discarded mannequin parts she’d found in an abandoned Topshop in north-west England. In a film, titled DISARM (Portrait), she has emblazoned words like “disarm” on arms, “obsolete” on soles, and “delegation” on legs. At first she thought of it as a concrete poem or a Breton-esque poème objet. Then she realised, she says, that “actually, it’s more liquid than concrete”.For Banner, the power of Exquisite Corpse, “its radical space”, lies not in the finished sentence but on that fold. “I think to not understand is a very important space,” she says. “To be free of human logic.”View image in fullscreenDiscarded mannequin parts from an abandoned Topshop … Fiona Banner’s DISARM.Photograph: Fiona BannerDimitri Rataud, a French actor turned artist, whose work is now on show at HIS Paris gallery, makes what he calls “haikus marinières”: surrealist-inspired concrete poems he finds by blacking out most of the words on a ripped-out page of a random book. The name itself is a word play: the pieces look like Breton tops AKA marinières because of the stripes. And the poems (et soudain … le bonheur– “and suddenly … happiness”) are as light as a feather on the breeze.The printed word, which he handles like a builder might a brick, is useful raw material. And each poem is but a moment. Rataud starts by tearing the cover off the book then opening it on the last page. He can never do the same thing twice. To his gallery’s dismay, he refuses to make copies.Rataud is popular on Instagram, and you can of course see why: Breton tops, French romance, Japanese minimalism. And yet, these found poems are luminous, in the way they balance on that paper-thin edge between accident and intention. “I’ve found extremely beautiful haikus in sordid books.”View image in fullscreenPopular on Instagram … Poème 10 of Haiku Marinière.Photograph: ©Haiku Marinière-2025For the Paris surrealists of the 1920s – crawling out of the wreckage of the first world war – nonsense was a deadly serious matter. When the Centre Pompidou’s exhibition,Surréalisme(a touring mega-show currently at the Hamburger Kunsthalle), opened in September 2024, co-curator Marie Sarré described the centennial movement as one of the most politically engaged of the avant gardes. “Throughout its history, the political and the poetic ran in parallel,” she said. “It wasn’t an artistic movement or a formalism, but a collective adventure and a philosophy.” Contrary to other avant garde movements which embraced the notion of progress, it questioned everything. The surrealists were among the first anticolonialists, the staunchest anti-fascists, proponents of social revolution and proto-eco warriors.“They asked the questions artists today are asking,” said Sarré.To wit, Malaysian-born artist Heman Chong, whose work is currently on show at the Singapore Art Museum. This survey exhibition is organised into nine categories: words, whispers, ghosts, journeys, futures, findings, infrastructures, surfaces and endings. One piece, “This pavilion is strictly for community bonding activities only”, reproduces a sign Chong found in a communal space within one of Singapore’s Housing and Development Board block of flats. “The sentence itself is nuts, right?” he says. “That you would insist on community bonding activities, which means, literally, you cannot be there alone, right? Because you can’t bond with anyone alone.”By contrast, he often makes installations with things people could secrete away – stacks of postcards; mountains of sentences from spy novels shredded on to the floor; a library of unread books. “I would love it if people just take things out of their own accord,” says Chong. “Coming from Singapore, which is an extremely paternalistic, authoritarian state, a lot of my work is not about telling people what they cannot do.”View image in fullscreenShredded sentences … Secrets and Lies (The Impossibility of Reconstitutions) by Heman Chong.Photograph: Heman Chong; Image courtesy of MGSR CollectionIn November 2024, South Africa-based Nhlanhla Mahlangu, who is a long-term collaborator of William Kentridge, gave a performance lecture titled Chant for Disinheriting Apartheid. It collates several spoken word compositions and improvised works, which delve into the brutal flattening of colonial oppression: language stolen, names mangled, bodies which have learned to recognise different guns by the sounds they make.In one section, he performs, one by one, various unrelated sentences in the languages of isiZulu, Sesotho, Xitsonga, Venda, Xhosa. And then, “the language of apartheid”. He stands stock still, in total silence, for two whole minutes.He recounts doing a workshop with children from Hillbrow, a part of inner Johannesburg beset by high crime and intense poverty. They were working on a performance of Aimé Césaire’s 1939 masterwork, Return to My Native Land – a gut punch of a poem against colonialism, which Breton called “the greatest lyrical monument of this time”. Mahlangu’s students, who were witnessing crime and death and abandonment on the way to class, said: “We experience surrealisms every day. We don’t understand why people go to universities and study it. Our lives are surreal.”“Surrealism offers ways to look awry at things,” says Patricia Allmer, an art historian at the Edinburgh College of Art. She recently co-curated The Traumatic Surreal at the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds. “Because you can’t encounter trauma head on, you have to find ways of seeing it, either as a distortion, through a distorting lens or from the side.” For Mahlangu, it is about “bringing fluidity to what seems stable, and understanding that stability can be a weakness. It’s constantly not answering the question, but questioning the answers, asking more questions.”In the 21st century, we may have grown wary of “isms” in art. In a climate of constant technological and economic interruption, the promise of a transformative cultural revolution can feel suspicious; the most powerful movement in modern art, contended a recent article inthe Art Newspaper, may be the art market itself. But it’s worth remembering that when Breton first wrote about his ideas in 1924, he didn’t think of it as a manifesto, just a preface to a book of poems he wanted to publish. And that’s why Exquisite Corpse sums up surrealism’s most lasting legacy to modern art today: a tool that taps you into something unexplored, a game for “pure young people who refuse to knuckle down”.Explore more on these topicsArt and designPoetryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The BBC’s director general, Tim Davie, and chair, Samir Shah, have apologised and disciplinary action is expected for some of those directly involved.However, music industry insiders said the corporation has seriously overreacted, pointing to the fact that extensive Glastonbury coverage has been running for years without serious incident. Several also cited free speech concerns for artists.David Martin, the head of the Featured Artists Coalition (FAC), the UK trade body representing music artists, called for a rethink and said it was a moment for “cool heads and an even-handed approach”.“The BBC is absolutely fundamental to the continued success of British music, and particularly vital to supporting our new and emerging artists’ development,” he said.“The FAC wholeheartedly supports the network’s remit for public service broadcasting, something which is encapsulated by their Glastonbury coverage. That remit also comes with responsibilities. The BBC is rightly held to the highest regulatory, legal and editorial standards. If those standards have been breached, then there should be appropriate guidelines to follow.“But the idea of preemptively grading artists according to their ’risk’ factor feels arbitrary and disproportionate – and a dangerous step towards censorship. That kind of approach could potentially curtail artistic freedom around certain genres and inadvertently punish those who are simply expressing their views. It’s a road I think we should resist going down.“Live music is incredibly important to the UK. It provides entertainment and cultural capital. But it’s also an art form, and our performers should be free to challenge, provoke and take risks.”Naomi Pohl, the general secretary of the Musicians’ Union, said she was very concerned by the BBC’s decision to be more cautious about live music broadcasts.“We really don’t want to see the BBC broadcasting fewer live events,” she said. “It’s such a shame there has been this shadow cast over this year’s Glastonbury coverage, because it has had fantastic viewing figures. It’s been all over iPlayer and people have been tuning in live.“We need to talk to the BBC about it directly. But I don’t want to see any broadcasters now broadcasting fewer live events because they don’t want to take the risk. The whole of the music industry will be feeling that, because it’s so crucial to us to have the BBC.”The BBC’s decision came after significant political pressure. Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, said the incident – together with otherBBC issues over Gaza coverage– could be “a problem of leadership”. Davie currently has the support of the BBC board.There is frustration among some in the BBC that the number of people who actually saw the Bob Vylan broadcast was very small. Others say editorial cuts have aggravated issues around the monitoring of live streams.A BBC spokesperson said: “We will continue to bring audiences a range of music performances, both live and on-demand, and we respect artists’ freedom of expression. However, Bob Vylan’s offensive and deplorable behaviour on one of our Glastonbury live streams was completely unacceptable and we are sorry it appeared on the BBC.“This is why we have made immediate changes to livestreaming music events, and these alongside our editorial guidelines will shape our plans going forward.”Explore more on these topicsBBCGlastonbury festivalFestivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

He once observed: “Nature produces the most amazing varieties of shapes, patterns and rhythms … But merely to copy nature is no better than copying anything else. It is what the artist makes of his observations … that is important.”The exhibition is a partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation in Hertfordshire, which is lending most of the exhibits.Sebastiano Barassi, the foundation’s head of collections, said: “[Moore] had a strong preference for nature over architectural cityscapes because he felt that the organic forms of his sculpture respond better to the organic forms of nature. We’re trying to show visitors that close connection.”The exhibits will include several of his famous reclining figures as well as more abstract pieces such as Large Two Forms – “although Moore disliked the idea of his sculpture being called abstract”, Barassi said. “He always felt there was some connection with nature and many of his pieces started life from an actual object – be it a bone, a stone, a piece of driftwood – which he then reworked into something that belonged in his sculptural language.”Barassi said of Large Two Forms: “It’s clearly organic in inspiration, evoking rocky formations with spaces through which the landscape can be viewed, essentially a merging of the sculpture and the surrounding nature, which was how Moore thought you really appreciate where his sculpture comes from. There’s a wonderful circularity there. You take ideas from nature, make a sculpture and put the sculpture back in nature.”Moore, who died in 1986, also loved to work outdoors and, after moving to Hertfordshire in 1940, he used an adjacent rough farmland to experiment over how to situate his works against the sky and trees.This new exhibition will span Kew’s entire site, in contrast to a 2007 Moore show that was limited to a few specific areas.Paul Denton, Kew’s director of creative programmes, said: “We’re extending our reach of who comes to us, so the idea that we can draw people who may never have encountered Moore before is really important.”He said: “These monumental shapes will sit beautifully in Kew’s landscape. There’s going to be a direct relationship with the landscape, how you see entryways and walkways, how you come across the sculptures and move around them. When there’s a sculptural work or intervention, you might see that site differently – and that’s what we want to do really.“We work a lot with artists because we know they’re key in translating some really quite complex topics that Kew’s trying to talk about, whether it be climate change or biodiversity loss, artists can do that in a really wonderful way. Moore’s work is an extension of that. Even though these are now very much contemporary themes, Moore was still thinking about making us care for the natural world around us by placing works in that surrounding.”Moore once said: “Nature is inexhaustible. Not to look at and use nature in one’s own work is unnatural to me.”Explore more on these topicsHenry MooreKew GardensSculptureArtLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

With an entirely new cast, led by Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey, producers were not overly optimistic of its chances, given that Independence Day is not a traditional moviegoing holiday. Critical reaction has been mixed, withthe Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw being particularly enthusiastic with a four star rating, saying: “It feels relaxed and sure-footed in its Spielberg pastiche, its big dino-jeopardy moments and its deployment of thrills and laughs”.The film’s chances of profitability are also helped by the (relatively) restricted production budget, reported at $180m compared to the$845m spent on its two predecessors, Fallen Kingdom and Dominion.However, analysis shows that the film’s figures fall somewhat short of previous Jurassic World films. Rebirth earned $91.5m over the actual weekend (Friday to Sunday), considerably less than Fallen Kingdom ($148m) and Dominion ($145m) over their equivalent periods, while the first franchise rebootJurassic Worldtook $208m in 2015.Explore more on these topicsFilmJurassic WorldFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Jane Austen’s novels include mentions of working women, such as housekeepers, maids and governesses, but now an exhibition puts their stories in the spotlight.Beyond the Bonnets: Working Women in Jane Austen’s Novels is being shown by theHampshireCultural Trust as part of celebrations marking the 250th anniversary of the author’s birth. It features working women in Austen’s home county of Hampshire in the Georgian era, pairing voiced extracts from her novels and letters with dozens of objects illustrating their daily lives.“Working women were not the centre, the lead characters, in Austen’s novels, but they do play an important role, and sometimes develop the plot,” said Kathleen Palmer, the exhibition’s curator. “They enable the lives of the heroines and heroes. The bustling towns and stately homes wouldn’t function without these women.”View image in fullscreenMiseries of Human Life, after Rowlandson 1807, features in an exhibition marking the 250th anniversary of Jane Austen’s birth.Photograph: SuppliedThrough the lens of Austen’s life and her lesser-known characters, the exhibition focuses on three key areas of work in the 18th century: domestic service, education and childcare, and trade.Stories include that of Susannah Sackree, a nursemaid to the 11 children of Austen’s brother Edward, and later the family’s housekeeper. She worked for the family until her death at the age of 89. Unusually, the family commissioneda portrait of her, and described her on her memorial stone as a “faithful servant and friend” and “beloved nurse”.Another real-life character in the exhibition is Mary Martin, who ran an inn in Basingstoke and organised monthly balls attended by Austen and her sister Cassandra. Martin later ran a draper’s shop, complete with a circulating library. “Then we find Mrs Whitby in (Austen‘s unfinished novel) Sanditon running a circulating library. So Austen was pulling people that she came across into her novels,” said Palmer.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Richard Caspole/SuppliedMartin ran the inn after her husband’s death. Another woman forced by bereavement to step into the world of work was Ann Freeman, who took over her late husband’s business as a glazier and built it into a successful enterprise employing several men.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were under contract, which meant leaving their employment without permission could result in a fine or imprisonment in the County Bridewell prison in Winchester where hard labour awaited them.Domestic tasks such as laundry were onerous, with clothes, bed linen and other household items washed by hand. “It meant hauling water, boiling the cottons and linens, washing them with pungent lye soap, which burnt the skin, rinsing the clothes in clean water, which meant hauling more water from the well or a nearby stream, twisting the cloths to remove as much water as possible, hanging the clothes to dry, and then praying that rain would stay away long enough for the sun to perform its duty as a dryer,” according to the websiteJane Austen’s World.Beyond the Bonnets: Working Women in Jane Austen’s Novels is at the Arc in Winchester, 26 July until 2 November, and the Willis museum in Basingstoke, 12 November until 22 February.Explore more on these topicsJane AustenHampshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Kimonos, however, are acceptable.The venue’s management team reminded people how not to dress for an opera after complaints that some spectators were donning attire more suitable for the beach.A “rules of conduct” sign has been placed at La Scala’s entrance urging its audience to “choose clothing in keeping with the decorum of the theatre”, adding that “spectators wearing tank tops, shorts and flip-flops are not allowed”. Those who arrive inappropriately dressed will not be given a refund. The message has also been placed on tickets and the opera house’s website.The anti-beachwear dress code was introduced in 2015, the year Milan hosted the World Expo and La Scala stayed open for the entire summer, as a way to stop people from turning up in swimming costumes.But until now it has never been strictly enforced, partly because of calls for more tolerance over attire by La Scala’s former French director, Dominique Meyer, who in his youth was criticised by fellow spectators at ParisOperaproductions for his “worker’s look”. Meyer later became the general director of the opera company.“The rules now need to be reinforced, especially due to the heat we’ve been experiencing,” said a spokesperson for La Scala. “Some spectators were getting annoyed after seeing others not dress appropriately, for example in flip-flops, especially in a theatre where people are sitting shoulder to shoulder.”The tank top ban does not prohibit women from wearing sleeveless blouses or dresses, and, according to the Corriere della Sera newspaper, the flip-flop ban does not prevent “Japanese spectators with kimonos and traditional footwear” from entering.Before 2015, there was a message on La Scala tickets recommending a “jacket and tie”, although the formal dress code was not obligatory. However, there is an unspoken rule that people should at least be elegantly clothed.“It is incorrect to tell people how to dress, but they do need to be dressed,” the spokesperson said.The dress code reminder is part of a broader overhaul on etiquette rules at La Scala. Spectators are banned from bringing their own food and drink and from taking photos and filming during performances. In addition, operagoers must not place their mobile phones on the balustrade of balcony boxes after one fell off and hit a spectator seated below.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeOperaTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

Your hate-watch of the summer is hereFrom moaning about the truffle to complaining their towels are too smooth, everyone is absolutely awful in this wild reality show about the super-rich and their minions. Prepare to lap it upLucy ManganMon 7 Jul 2025 16.55 EDTShareWho among us, as the summer months and dreams of sun and cloudless skies begin and the visions of holidays and freedom take on solid form, does not think: where oh where is my hate-watch of the season?Well, fear not,mes chéris– the wait is over! Billion Dollar Playground has arrived and it is a feast for all. Imagine thatThe White Lotus’s characterswere real, but worse, and that none of them – increasingly unbelievably – ended up murdered. One reprobate complains that the bath towels in their luxury beachfront rental in Sydney are “too smooth”. Another derides the chef for putting smoked salmon in her caviar and asks: “Is that the same truffle as yesterday? Then definitely not.” Mo’ canapes, mo’ problems.That has got your glands juicing, hasn’t it? Feel that vitriol start to pump! Remember what it feels like to be truly alive! And I have barely started. Because, unlike at The White Lotus, below stairs isn’t much better.But I am getting ahead of myself. Let’s start at the beginning. Alex and Tom are an Australian husband-and-wife team who own Luxico, a company that manages A$1bn-worth (£480m-worth) of wildly opulent properties for wildly rich people who rent them out to other wildly rich people while, presumably, the owners are staying at one of their other wildly opulent properties. We do not warm to Alex and Tom (“Pressure makes diamonds – and rich people love diamonds!” he says of the efforts his minions must make to serve the wealthy guests), but they are not around enough to hate, so save your energy. We have much to be getting on with.The team whose job it is to prepare the house before a group of self-made millionaires arrive for a girls’ weekend is headed by the chief concierge, Salvatore. He can spot a misaligned chair or a rucked rug at 50 paces and needs everyone to follow orders – and a minutely detailed timetable – at all times so the endeavour doesn’t collapse into a heap of dust and rouse the ire of the vile, whining people (“I thought the beach was private?”) they are gathered to serve.Unfortunately, one of his team members is Heaven. She loves to be around money and doesn’t see why she should be “disrespected” by being required to follow instructions. She sets up great events for the guests – such as getting them exclusive access to the amusement park Luna Park, so it can serve as the backdrop to dessert for their first meal – but doesn’t follow through on details, such as bringing crockery and cutlery. Everyone else must abandon their jobs to save the guests’ night (and Heaven’s backside).Of course, she is endlessly grateful for this. Just kidding. She takes responsibility for nothing and is a piece of work. Her life plan seems to involve finding a sugar daddy then “being able to afford Salvatore” herself. Smashing.Elsie is the housekeeper. She has a robust attitude to the job. When confronted with the problem of four bottles of Dom Pérignon missing from a guest’s luggage, she suggests serving whatever the house already holds. “They won’t be able to tell the fucking difference.” We warm to Elsie.Jay is the maintenance man and driver. He is all teeth and abs. He has a second job as a cover model for spicy romance novels. No, really. He enjoys his life.Matt and George are handsome brothers and chefs. They enjoy their lives, too, and are sanguine about being wheeled out to distract guests with their hotness any time disaster looms. Especially Matt.Nicole is a trainee concierge, keen to do well, but, one suspects, on a collision course to either Jay’s or Matt’s bed – she just has to decide whether she wants a blinding grin or a nice meal afterwards.Jasmine is the new deputy concierge, rapidly promoted to chief when Salvatore – goaded by Heaven’s inability to understand that she is not the centre of the universe – leaves abruptly. This makes him almost as bad as Heaven in my book, but no one is listening to me.JB is the butler. He fancied being the chief concierge himself. By the end of the first two episodes, he is showing signs of being a Gallic Machiavelli. He is also the chief cocktail supplier and a backup hottie to the chefs.The guests? I have spent enough time and words on them already. I wish them nothing but repeat truffles, smooth towels, salmony caviar and painful ends.In short, it’s a winner. Your new escapist watch is here. Next week, it’s tech bros. Enjoy.Billion Dollar Playground airs on BBC three and is available on BBC iPlayerExplore more on these topicsReality TVTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Gradually the other big tech companies followed suit, and now what is technically defined as the “pistol” emoji, supposed to represent a “handgun or revolver”, does not show either: instead you’ll get a water pistol or sci-fi raygun and be happy with it. No doubt this change contributed significantly to a suppression of gun crime around the world, and it remains only to ban the bomb, knife and sword emoji to wipe out violence altogether.As Keith Houston’s fascinatingly geeky and witty history shows, emoji have always been political. Over the years, people have successfully lobbied the Unicode Consortium – the cabal of corporations that controls the character set, including Google, Microsoft, Meta and Apple – to include different skin colours and same-sex couples. It was easy to agree to add the face with one eyebrow raised, the guide dog and the egg. But not every request is granted. One demand for a “frowning poo emoji” elicited this splendid rant from an eminent Unicode contributor, Michael Everson: “Will we have a crying pile of poo next? Pile of poo with tongue sticking out? Pile of poo with question marks for eyes? Pile of poo with karaoke mic? Will we have to encode a neutral faceless pile of poo?”Contrary to popular belief, the word “emoji” has nothing to do with emotions, but instead combines the Japanese terms for “picture” and “written character”. The origin of such sets of symbols has been determined by dogged tech researchers to stretch back much further than the first iPhone, or even the regular mobile phones and electronic PDAs that preceded them. A basic set of emoji could be found in the operating systems of some 1980s electronic typewriters and word processors from manufacturers such as Sharp and Toshiba.Before emojis proper there was a craze for emoticons, made out of regular characters, such as the excellent shrug: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯Long before that, Houston notes, humans used pictographic characters such as hieroglyphs. Later, movable type saw an efflorescence of publishers’ symbols such as the pilcrow (for a new paragraph) and the lamentably under-used manicule (a tiny pointing hand in the margin). And before emoji proper there was a craze for smileys, or emoticons, made out of regular alphanumeric characters, such as the excellent shrug, still sometimes encountered in the wild: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯Indeed, Houston makes the intriguing argument that the age of the mechanical typewriter represented an unusual historical interlude of expressive poverty. Once humans were freed from the unnatural restrictions it imposed, there was bound to be a new flourishing of symbolic play.Such considerations often lead the unwary to suppose that emoji might constitute a “language”, which they definitely don’t. To demonstrate why, Houston recalls the Emoji Dick stunt of 2009, whereby developer Fred Benenson had thousands of people contribute to a crowd-sourced “translation” of Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick into emoji. If this were a bona fide language, it should be possible to translate Emoji Dick back into something close to the original with no knowledge of the source text. It isn’t.As Houston argues, then, emoji are possibly a “script” (a method of writing), and a set of emoji might be a lexicon (a vocabulary), but you can’t communicate anything complex in emoji. It is better, perhaps, to think of emoji as an expanded palette of expressive punctuation.Where next, then, for these little yellow blobs of joy? Unicode has no intention of adding any more flags, the least used category of emoji. The second least popular kind, oddly, is mammals, a fact that has me determined to use more cat faces in future. At some point they will surely have to retire the floppy disk emoji, a picture of an obsolete storage format that millions of younger people have never even seen. Should we even be able, Houston wonders, to create our own custom emoji? As someone who is grateful he doesn’t have to reinvent the full stop every time he reaches the end of a sentence, I doubt most people could be bothered.Face with Tears of Joy: A Natural History of Emoji by Keith Houston is published by Norton (£14.99).

There is nothing remotely happy about twentysomething Sano (Hiroki Sano). His wife has just died suddenly in her sleep, and Sano is visiting the sleepy Japanese seaside town where they met five years ago. He is rude and sullen, and obsessive about finding a red baseball cap he lost on that first visit. In the pain and anger of his grief, everyone sounds vapid and dumb, their words meaningless blah-blah-blah.It’s hard to see where the happy fits in, until the film flips back in time. In the same hotel five years ago, Sano first claps eyes on his wife Nagi (Nairu Yamamoto) in a chance meeting in the hotel lobby. Yamamoto gives the performance of the film as aspiring photographer Nagi: funny, scatty and earnest. She plays it so naturally, so true to life, that Nagi feels like someone you might have actually met. She and Sano wander around town, young and free: dancing in a club, eating instant noodles. There is a glow to these scenes, a bit like in Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise, which similarly bottles the heart-flutter moment of something clicking, flirtation that feels like more than flirting.In essence it’s a love story in reverse. In the part set five years earlier, director Kohei Igarashi’s script becomes almost like a mystery, following the clues dropped like a trail of crumbs in the first part. (Sothatexplains why he’s so desperate to find the red cap!) A young Vietnamese chambermaid who works in the hotel plays an important role – and the point is gently made that she doesn’t have the luxury of wafting around town for a day.There is something in here about chance and fate, but the film is too natural, too intimate to go too heavy on themes. It is gentle, straightforward drama, beautifully acted and emotionally tuned in. Its message is obvious but true: things can be super happy, just not forever.Super Happy Forever is on MubiExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsJapanRomance filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Recently divorced from her husband, actor-director Anne Barbot throws herself into preparing a stage adaptation ofEmile Zola’s classic novel L’Assommoir. In Gervaise, the working-class heroine of the book, Barbot finds echoes of her current situation: both are women who struggle to reclaim professional autonomy in the aftermath of broken relationships. Barbot’s production becomes more complicated when she casts Benoît Dallongeville, a neighbour who is also an actor, in the role of her love interest in the play. Soon, passion and tension begin to spill from personal relationships on to the page, and vice versa.Matarrese’s film keeps the camera strikingly close to Barbot and Dallongeville as the pair embark on a long and physically arduous rehearsal process. Jagged, handheld closeups of minute facial expressions and gestures clue us into private emotions that may be unknown even to the two actors. We can sense that, in the beginning, Dallongeville is interested in courting Barbot, though she is pulling back. Yet, over long takes in which they feed each other lines, a certain chemistry gradually emerges, followed by actual romance. The film keeps this development deliberately opaque, as scene transitions make it difficult to tell whether they are reading a script or communicating as themselves. It is as if the border between performance and life has entirely collapsed.Reflecting the ebb and flow of emotions between Barbot and Dallongeville, the film swiftly moves on and off stage as the couple continue their rehearsals – and later on, heated arguments – over trips to the forest and the beach. While the varied locations offer a sense of spontaneity, the film occasionally feels too beholden to its art-versus-life thesis, which makes moments of catharsis come off as mannered and calculated. It has the look of a John Cassavetes film, but lacks that film-maker’s sense of unpredictability.The Zola Experience is on True Story from 11 JulyExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsEmile ZolaTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Building on a decades-spanning archive from theYangambi National Institute of Agronomic Studies and Research, the film is loosely divided into three sections, each guided by a different voice that speaks to the complicated environmental history of the area. The first segment is informed by the journal entries of Congolese agronomist Paul Panda Farnana. Working both within and outside Belgium’s colonial control during the 1910s and 1920s, Farnana wrote of his frustration with the extractive regime, as well as meteorological statistics related to rainfall and temperature, which are narrated in voiceover. This is combined with largely static shots of present-day Congo, where vestiges of colonial buildings lie next to verdant fields, a haunting reminder from a dark past.This cinematic link through time continues with the second narration, taken from the writing of Belgian colonial official Abiron Beirnaert. A stark contrast to Farnana’s clear-eyed, political perspective, Beirnaert’s contemplations luxuriate in boredom and jadedness. The images that accompany this section are also of sparsely attended archives and abandoned factories that do little to subvert Beirnaert’s imperialist outlook. The third voice, however, grants sentience to the ancient tree of the title, bearing witness to decades of Congolese history.This last is a fascinating stylistic choice that encourages us to let go of our anthropocentric approach to climate change, even if giving a tree an inner monologue seems to be a rather facile way to foreground non-human perspectives. Though perhaps leaning too heavily into an academic visual experiment, The Tree of Authenticity offers a fascinating look at how extraction can take many forms, even within the context of sustainability.The Tree of Authenticity is at the ICA from 10 JulyExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricareviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s a lot to celebrate: few careers are this distinctive, or this successful. And there’s a real sense Minchin has got life where he wants it tonight. With a five-strong band in tow, the balance is better than onhis last tourbetween troubadour and rock Gargantua. And there’s an embrace, too, of his misfit status: who cares if no one knows whether he’s a musician, a comedian, an auteur or a clown – or whether tonight’s show is, as Minchin describes it, “an absolute shitshow of tonal inconsistency”?I mean, he’s not wrong. Minchin has always been a curious mix of cool and uncool, sending up rock theatrics while openly in thrall to them. He is an artist of excess, never knowingly underwritten – and for more than three hours tonight, we get a lot of him.View image in fullscreenCuriously cool and uncool … Tim Minchin.Photograph: PaulwdixonphotographyNone of the songs, selected from a 28-year career, are left to speak for themselves; they’re all chattily placed in the context of Minchin’s life at the time. This one (Song of the Masochist) was written to help his brother get over an ex-girlfriend. That one (Apart Together) touchingly summons a story about his father and recently deceased mum.‘It had to be dark’ – how we made Matilda the MusicalRead moreThe balance is roughly equal between comic songs, serious songs and bits-of-both songs. There are fantastic highs, like a rendition of Revolting Children, fromMatilda, replete with a squawking electric guitar solo courtesy of bandmate Jak Housden, and the show’s newest number, an elegiac, rounding-off-a-life affair palpably written by a man entering his second half century. And there are moments when we fall foul of our host’s refusal to care what anyone else thinks: see his “I love boobs” number, Confessions, at which one feels faintly embarrassed that his whole band are obliged to sing along.But that’s Minchin, for whom honesty or bust (or in this case, both) is a guiding principle. It’s far more endearing than not tonight, in a show that lays on the line his delight to be where he finds himself – and ensures we share in it.Touring the UK until 26 July, then touring Australia, 31 October-7 DecemberExplore more on these topicsStageComedyTim MinchinreviewsShareReuse this content"

And that is precisely the point.The men and women, aged between 65 and 84, are the first cohort of an initiative that aims to introduce those who live around theMatadero arts centrein the south of the Spanish capital to the joys and challenges of contemporary theatre. Last year, mindful of the fact that many of the older residents of thebarriosof Usera and Arganzuela rarely attended contemporary theatre and would be unlikely to darken the doors of the new Nave 10 space, the Matadero and the city council came up with a plan.“The idea of Nave 10 was to create a contemporary theatre space that provides space for relatively young directors and authors,” said Marta Ruiz, who leads the educational outreach work at Nave 10.“But we also realised that the programming you get at a very contemporary art space, such as Matadero, can seem a bit remote to people over 65, who may see it as something aimed at a younger audience. That’s why we decided that, in order to create a dialogue between generations, it would be good to bring older people in and make them feel that they were a part of things.”View image in fullscreenParticipants in Escuela de Espectadores Sénior rehearse plays being shown at the Matadero arts centre.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianLast summer, Ruiz and the actor and director Mariana Kmaid Levy began spreading the word around local cultural centres and day centres that they were looking for two dozen older people to take part in a free project that would involve seeing 10 plays and attending classes, workshops and talks.“From there we put together this group that has spent the whole season coming two or three times a month to see the shows, to do activities and workshops, to get to know the theatre a little more inside and to delve a little deeper into the themes of the works,” added Ruiz.For the past nine months, those enrolled inEscuela de Espectadores Sénior(the Senior Audience School) have watched, dissected and discussed everything fromThe Bitter Tears of Petra Von KanttoJauría, a play based onthe infamous trial of five men who raped a young woman in Pamplona nine years ago. The most recent play was an auto-fiction two-hander by the actors and writers Nao Albet and Marcel Borràsabout two ageing friends.Some of the participants, such as Carmen Horrillo, have been delighted to learn how a production is put together on a technical level, but also to be ​given the tools to decipher some of the forbidding codes of modern drama.“It’s easier for me now to explain why people should come and see this kind of contemporary theatre,” she said.Isabel Cotado, whose membership of the programme has helped her navigate the early days of her retirement, ​f​eels it’s also been about shaking up old perspectives.View image in fullscreenThe school offers classes in contemporary theatre for older people, as well as putting on performances.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The Guardian“I’ve learned about understanding and accepting people as they are,” she said. “I’ve also learned to laugh about my own life and my own problems – it takes the sting out of some of the nonsense you face in life. Life isn’t just about you.”Kmaid Levy said that while the group’s “enthusiasm and life experience” had helped them interpret the works and empathise with the characters, the sessions had also proved instructive for the professionals involved.“This a group of people who speak about theatre in different ways and have another vision and another way of looking at things,” she said.Albet and Borràs ​also said their interaction with the group had yielded a different perspective.“They gave us really interesting points of view about experiences they’d had and that’s always great,” said Borràs. “We normally get reviews and criticisms from friends in the profession or from critics or on social media.”Luis Luque, the artistic director of Nave 10, said the basic idea of the project – which will resume with a new cohort later this year – was to forge links between participants, between local residents and the venue, and between art and a sometimes neglected sector of society.“They’ve seen that contemporary theatre speaks to them, too,” he said. “It isn’t something remote; it’s something that calls to them as men and women and poses them questions.”He highlighted Jauría, which is based on the court transcripts of a trial that provoked a nationwide debate about sexual violence.View image in fullscreenParticipants watch scenes performed by their fellow members.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The Guardian“They’re been very honest and very passionate about Jauría and have felt compelled to speak because they’ve witnessed assaults and some have been abused,” he said. “They come from a generation where there was a very brutal sexism – especially the women. When older men see this, they say, ‘What did we do about all this?’ The questions they’ve come out with have been very interesting. It’s not about taking the blame; it’s about taking responsibility.”Theatre may not point the finger, said Luque. “But it does show you your reflection in the mirror when it comes to how you’ve behaved.”Marta Rivera de la Cruz, Madrid’s councillor for culture, tourism and sport, is keen to fight against the creation of “cultural ghettoes” and the idea that certain kinds of art are only for certain people. Proof of the school’s success came in a recent chat with a participant. “She told me she’d come to the theatre with her grandchildren and that she’d explained what the play was about before they saw it,” de la Cruz said.Or, as Horrillo puts it, nothing ventured, nothing gained. “People should go and see this; they can decide afterwards if they like it or not,” she said. “After all, this is art, too.”Explore more on these topicsSpainOlder peopleTheatreArts policyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

When the ferry docks at Lerwick, the kids, Lydia (11) and Alex (eight), are uncharacteristically silent as we take in the view: the town huddled on a low hill, the water shimmering in the morning sun, and islands as far as the eye can see.We are spending a week in the archipelago, travelling first around Mainland, the main island, and then north to the less populated islands of Yell and Unst, linked by regular ferries. It turns out to be the perfect location for a family holiday: short journey times (it takes 80 minutes to drive from the southern tip of Mainland to the northern) combined with the sea almost always being in view, and the excitement of a boat or ferry trip every day.View image in fullscreenNorthern gannets near their colony on Noss.Photograph: Biosphoto/AlamyOn Mainland, we base ourselves atHayhoull B&B. Mary, the owner, makes us feel like part of her family and cooks us delicious dinners that even my picky son doesn’t turn his nose up at. We wake to spectacular views of St Ninian’s Isle, before heading to Lerwick harbour to join a boat trip withShetland Seabird Tours. Skipper Phil tells us we’ll be sailing up to Noss island to see the gannet colony. Alex turns to me with wide eyes. “They dive like missiles!” he whispers excitedly.First, though, we see eider ducks, paddling just outside the harbour, and fulmars in cosy pairs on the cliffs. The latter, Phil tells us, “have a nasty defence mechanism against birds of prey – they vomit on them and ruin their flight feathers”. The kids are delighted and repulsed at the same time. Then there are sentry-like shags inside a cave, crowds of black guillemots and a solitary puffin bobbing on the waves, which sends a ripple of excitement around the boat.Gannets are shaping themselves into torpedoes, before plunging bullet-like into the deep. It is a phenomenal sightBut it is those gannets that steal the show. They appear as we approach the uninhabited, sheer-cliffed island of Noss, unmistakable with their pointed white beaks and yellow head feathers. As the birds (about 600–700 according to Phil’s estimate) circle and call above us, Phil submerges a long metal tube in the water; he throws a mackerel down it and within seconds the first gannets are folding their wings back and in and shaping themselves into bird torpedoes, before plunging bullet-like into the deep blue water. It is a phenomenal sight. The only word I hear out of either child for the next 15 minutes is “Wow!”In fact, if there’s a word that characterises our visit to Shetland, “wow” is it. AtJarlshof prehistoric and Norse settlement, where thousands of years of human habitation are revealed in the remains of countless buildings, the kids wander off happily with their audio guides, pointing things out to each other with glee; what I had anticipated being a 10-minute visit takes us an hour and a half.Just down the road isSumburgh Head lighthouse, where the season’s first puffins have recently arrived. We listen to a recreation of the sound of the lighthouse foghorn that is so loud the kids cover their ears, and climb up the foghorn tower to see the land drop away into the seemingly endless sea.View image in fullscreenSumburgh Head lighthouse.Photograph: Ian Dagnall/AlamyAnotherboat triptakes us out to the small, uninhabited island ofMousa, an RSPB nature reserve. A huge broch (an iron-age circular tower unique to Scotland) stands on its south-western shore; though it’s closed on our visit, we peer through the gate to look at the layered stone interior and imagine the people and animals that would once have lived there. We have three hours on Mousa, and spend them wandering the two-mile path around it at a leisurely pace, losing time watching seals play in East Pool and spotting nesting fulmars. “Stay away from them,” Alex tells us. “You don’t want to be sicked on.”Back on land, we walk the short distance from our B&B to St Ninian’s Isle, reached via the UK’s largest active tombolo (a sand bar). The kids immediately whip off their shoes to submerge their feet in the soft white sand; while they play, my husband and I walk across to the island. From the top, we have a clear view of both the kids and the skerries (small rocky islands and reefs) that pepper the isle’s south side.Just up the road isWest Lynnecroft (small farm), where the multitalented Cecil Tait shows us around and demonstrates the skills of his sheepdog, Bess, who is convinced that we need herding too. Tait, who also makes furniture and wool, and runs woodworking courses, tells us that all the while we’re talking he’s translating in his headfrom his native Shetland dialect into English. I watch the kids digest this. “Wow, Mum,” Alex says afterwards, “I didn’t know English wasn’t everyone’s main language here.”When the shout to ‘Get down!’ comes, we drop on our fronts and crawl. There in the water is the slick, dark curve of an otterThe next day, we head for Unst, the archipelago’s most northerly island. Getting there involves driving through Mainland and the neighbouring island of Yell, and two short ferry journeys (Mainland to Yell, and Yell to Unst), with the excitement building as we go. Most people come here for the birds and dramatic coastal scenery ofHermaness national nature reserve, on the northern tip of the island, but we decide against a three-and-a-half-hour walk battling the wind (and the children). Instead, we opt to head along the south coast with Catriona Waddington, the chair ofWild Skies Shetland, which has set up interactive “sky stops” to help visitors explore the island.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A listening post invites us to hear a Norse story or a fiddle tune that Catriona says “always makes people waltz”. The kids are soon doing exactly that. That night, they sleep – much to their excitement – in traditional alcove beds at the elegantBelmont House.En route back to Mainland, we pause in Yell for the afternoon, spending more than two hours wandering its gentle north-eastern shoreline on an otter-watching tour with Brydon Thomason ofShetland Nature. Armed with binoculars, the kids tramp happily for miles, stopping every time Brydon does, to join him in scanning the shore and water.View image in fullscreenEmma Gibbs’ children, Alex and Lydia, spotting otters.Photograph: Emma GibbsThere are no complaints about the cold or the distance; there is too much to learn about otters, such as how we have to walk downwind so they can’t smell us, and how to identify their toilets. Brydon has been otter–spotting since he was Alex’s age. “I was excited by the thrill of how hard they were to find,” he tells us. “It’s like being a detective in nature.”The kids are clearly happy being detectives, too. But when the shout to “Get down!” comes, they are more than ready, dropping straight on to their fronts as we follow Brydon’s instructions to crawl on to the beach. There, in the water, is the slick, dark curve of an otter.Brydon sets up his camera so the kids can take photos when the otter comes on to the shore. When she does, though, she is not alone; she is with her two cubs and is busy demolishing an octopus she has caught. We watch, through binoculars and Brydon’s camera, in a silence that is broken only by emphatic wows. “This is why I do it,” Brydon says with a smile. “For reactions like these.”In Shetland, it seems to me, they are the only reactions to have.The trip was provided byvisitscotland.comandshetland.org.

You can assemble all the components for these lovely, fresh lettuce wraps while the chicken poaches in an aromatic broth, and either make up the cups yourself or put all the components down on the table for everyone to help themselves. This was a hit with my three-year-old daughter, and it even encouraged the one-year-old to try lettuce for the first time.Lettuce wraps with aromatic lemongrass chicken and peanut sauceDon’t throw away the aromatic broth: strain it and refrigerate for two days or freeze for up to six months. Use it in soups.Prep20 minCook20 minServes23 slices fresh ginger10coriander stalks1 lemongrass stick, bashed1tsp fine sea saltZest of ½ lime, peeled into strips2chicken breasts, quarteredFor the peanut sauce60gsmooth peanut butter20ml lime juiceZest of ½ lime20ml soy sauce½tsp flaky sea salt1 small garlic clove, peeled and finely grated1tsp dark soft brown sugarTo serve2small little gem lettuces, leaves separated1 carrot, grated10g coriander leaves1 large red chilli, finely sliced, seeds and all2 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced30g salted peanuts, roughly choppedPut a litre of water in a medium-sized saucepan, bring to a boil, then add the aromatics and chicken pieces. Bring back to a boil, then turn down the heat so the surface barely breaks a bubble, and leave the chicken to poach for 15-20 minutes, until cooked through (test a piece by slicing it open). Lift out all the chicken from the broth and set aside.Meanwhile, make the peanut sauce. Vigorously whisk all the ingredients and 20ml cold water, or pulse them in a high-speed blender, until the mix is the texture of thick double cream – you may need a little more water, depending on how thick the peanut butter is. Taste and adjust the salt as needed.Shred the chicken, then arrange the lettuce cups on two large plates. Divide the grated carrot and chicken evenly between the lettuce cups, then drizzle each one generously with peanut sauce. Top with the coriander, chilli, spring onions and peanuts, roll up and eat immediately, with plenty of napkins. Alternatively, put everything on a platter and make up the lettuce cups as you go.Explore more on these topicsSummer food and drinkQuick and easyChickenFoodMeatVegetablesPicnicsrecipesShareReuse this content"

I love making pesto on such evenings, and not just the classic basil-and-pine-nut situation. Jazzing things up with braised greens or a red pesto made from lots of jarred goods are just two directions in which I like to take things for a big hit of flavour.

This salty-sweet chocolate mug cake is elevated into a rich and indulgent dessert with the addition of white miso paste. Be careful not to overcook it, lest it end up dry and rubbery. Sodha uses a plant-based cream on top, and it’s just as delicious with vegan ice-cream.Benjamina Ebuehi’s grilled bananas with bourbon butterView image in fullscreenBenjamina Ebuehi’s grilled bananas with bourbon butter.Photograph: Ola O Smit/The Guardian. Food styling: Benjamina Ebuehi. Prop styling: Anna Wilkins. Food assistant: Alice Hughes.These caramelised bananas hit that sweet spot when you’re craving a little treat but don’t want to bake a whole cake. Grilled bananas are “low effort, high-reward”, Benjamina Ebuehi says, and with just three minutes on a pan, they are transformed into a crunchy, buttery delight. The classic combination of nuts and bananas makes this a simple, satisfying dessert.Julia Busuttil Nishimura’s cinnamon bunsView image in fullscreenA great school holiday project: Julia Busuttil Nishimura’s cinnamon buns.Photograph: Armelle Habib/PlumBake these for the smell alone. Julia Busuttil Nishimura’s buns are made with ground cardamon in the dough and cinnamon in the filling, making this a spicy delight. It’s a recipe that requires a morning or afternoon, but it is a fun activity the whole family can get involved in. Ensure your heater is on to allow the dough to properly rise.Shivi Ramoutar’s warm sticky peaches with spiced coconut creamView image in fullscreenReady in 30 minutes: Shivi Ramoutar’s sticky roast peaches with spiced coconut cream.Photograph: Yuki Sugiura/The Guardian. Food styling: Rosie Reynolds. Prop styling: Louie Waller.Overripe fruit gets a second life in this quick-to-prepare dessert. Peaches (or any fruit that is looking too soft in your fruit bowl) can be transformed with a slather of honey and cinnamon and roasted in the oven for half an hour. What emerges is a golden, warm base that is then topped with coconut cream, crumbled gingernut biscuits and cinnamon. It’s a light, tropical twist on a winter dessert, in a hopeful reminder of warmer days to come.Felicity Cloake’s rhubarb crumbleView image in fullscreenNo rhubarb, no worries. You can sub in any fruit in Felicity Cloake’s crumble.Photograph: Robert Billington/The Guardian. Food styling: Loïc Parisot.There are many dishes that are hard to master, but thankfully Felicity Cloake’s rhubarb crumble is not one of them. “Perfection here is not difficult,” she writes. In her version, the sourness of the rhubarb is complemented by the buttery nutty crumble as it gets nice and jammy. This is a flexible recipe, she says, so any fruit can be subbed for the rhubarb. But as Cloake notes, make sure to adjust the sugar according to the sweetness of the fruit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The tamarind paste is heated with golden syrup, sugar, butter and cream and, as Lee says, it creates a distinctive “sweetly sour profile that offsets the richness of the caramel”. In her recipe, gooey rivers of caramel lace the surface of the brownie, making every square delicious. No more fights over who gets the corner, middle or edge.Benjamina Ebuehi’s honey nut galettesView image in fullscreenWeekend morning pud: Benjamina Ebuehi’s honey nut galettes.Photograph: Luke J Albert/The Guardian. Food styling: Benjamina Ebuehi. Prop styling: Anna Wilkins.Straddling the line between breakfast and dessert, Benjamina Ebuehi’s galettes tick all the boxes for winter: they’re warm, gooey and decadent. You’ll need to set aside about three hours for the prep and cooking, but it’s a perfect weekend-morning treat. The toffee-like filling combines honey, almonds, cream, sugar and butter. It’s best served warm with a side of cold cream.Ravneet Gill’s tinned cherry bakewell puddingView image in fullscreenRavneet Gill serves her cherry bakewell pudding with lots of cream or custard.Photograph: Laura Edwards/The Guardian.

Food styling assistant: Áine Pretty-McGrath.A set and forget it pudding, Ravneet Gill’s cherry bakewell pudding is a crowd-pleaser with minimal effort. The recipe has just four steps, so the hardest part is waiting for it to finish baking. The tanginess of the cherries and creaminess of the custard reminds Gill of the simple pleasure the dessert brought her in her first days of motherhood. She hopes it brings you the same comfort.Explore more on these topicsAustralian food and drinkDessertFoodAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"
