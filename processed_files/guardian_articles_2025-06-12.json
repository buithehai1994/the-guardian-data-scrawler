It is believed his brother was on the same flight.“Thirty seconds after takeoff there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed. It all happened so quickly,” Ramesh toldthe Hindustan Timesfrom a general ward in the civil hospital in Asarwa, Ahmedabad.The 40-year-old British national told the newspaper he was returning to the UK, where he has lived for 20 years, after visiting family in India. Another brother, speaking outside the family home inLeicester, in the East Midlands, said Ramesh had “no idea” how he escaped.Nayan Kumar Ramesh, 27, added: “We were just shocked as soon as we heard it. I last spoke to him yesterday morning. We’re devastated, just devastated. He said: ‘I have no idea how I exited the plane.’”A relative added: “He’s doing well I think. It’s a big shock. I don’t have many words to describe the incident.”Dr Dhaval Gameti, who treated Ramesh, said: “He was disorientated, with multiple injuries all over his body. But he seems to be out of danger.”Initial reports suggested all passengers onboard had died, but local police confirmed they had found one survivor of the flight, which plummeted into a medical college on Thursday, with videos showing a huge explosion and thick smoke in the immediate aftermath.The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, which was carrying 53 British nationals among its 242 passengers, was engulfed in a huge fireball after crashing into the Meghani Nagar residential area minutes after taking off at 1.38pm local time (09:08 BST) on Thursday.The Ahmedabad police commissioner, GS Malik, told the news agency ANI there was one survivor who was in seat 11A. The flight manifest shared by authorities said the passenger in that seat was Ramesh. Malik told ANI the survivor “has been in the hospital and is under treatment”.Seating planRamesh, who lives with his wife and child in London, was anxious to find his brother who was sitting on a different row. He told the Hindustan Times: “When I got up, there were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me. Someone grabbed hold of me and put me in an ambulance and brought me to the hospital.”A video of the crash circulating online showed the aircraft flying over a residential area of Ahmedabad. It disappeared behind trees before a huge explosion was followed by large plumes of black smoke.Images of the aftermath showed parts of the plane embedded into BJ Medical College, with pieces of its landing gear, fuselage and tail protruding from the building.Air India said 169 Indian nationals, 53 British nationals, one Canadian and seven Portuguese nationals were onboard the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Gatwick airport said a reception centre was being set up for relatives of passengers.MapA British couple who run a spiritual wellness centre and yoga studio were reportedly among those on the flight. Fiongal and Jamie Greenlaw-Meek, who run the Wellness Foundry in south London and Ramsgate, Kent, which offers psychic readings, tarot, reiki and yoga, spoke before the flight of their love of India and the “mind-blowing” experiences they had had there.On Tuesday, the Greenlaw-Meeks posted on their social media accounts from their hotel in the city. They spoke of creating a vlog documenting their experience, saying were excited to talk about it. Sitting next to his husband, Fiongal said: “So it’s our last night in India and we have had a magical experience really, there have been some quite mind-blowing things that have happened.”Akeel Nanabawa, his wife, Hannaa Vorajee, and their daughter, who lived in Gloucester, were also onboard, according to the Gloucester Muslim Community, which said in a statement: “Unfortunately, we are led to believe that three Gloucester locals, Akeel Nanabawa, his wife and four-year-old child, were all onboard. Those wishing to do taziyat, please allow the family some time to mourn amongst themselves.”In a post on social media, the Gloucester Muslim Bereavement Council said it was “profoundly heartbroken by the devastating loss of life in the catastrophic crash of Flight AI171, travelling from Ahmedabad to London”.Naming the three victims, it said: “During this moment of overwhelming sorrow, our hearts go out to all those left behind. No words can truly ease the pain of such a profound loss, but we pray that the family may find solace in the tremendous outpouring of compassion and solidarity from communities across the world.”UK officials are being deployed to India to support the investigation, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said. Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, said the crash was “devastating”, while the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said it was “heartbreaking beyond words”.King Charles and Queen Camilla said in a statement they were “desperately shocked”, adding: “Our special prayers and deepest possible sympathy are with the families and friends of all those affected by this appallingly tragic incident across so many nations, as they await news of their loved ones.”Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaAir transportPlane crashesLeicesterSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Carer’s allowance will be protected throughout this period but will end when Pip is withdrawn.The sickest benefit recipients with less than 12 months to live and those with lifelong, often progressive and incurable conditions will automatically get a higher rate of universal credit and will not have to go through reassessments, which take place on average every three years.The new “right to work” scheme for those on health and disability benefits, previously announced by Kendall, will be introduced at the same time as the bill so welfare recipients can try to return to work without risking losing their entitlements.Kendall told the Guardian: “When we set out our reforms we promised to protect those most in need, particularly those who can never work. I know from my 15 years as a constituency MP how important this is. It is something I take seriously and will never compromise on.“That is why we are putting additional protections on the face of the bill to support the most vulnerable and help people affected by the changes. These protections will be written into law – a clear sign they are non-negotiable.”WhileReeves insistedshe would not be rethinking her decision on disability benefit cuts on Thursday, despite speculation that the government could soften its stance, she said she was “taking into account” representations from Labour MPs.Pressed by the BBC on whether she would change her mind, Reeves said: “No, we’re not going to be changing that. It is important that we reform the way the welfare state works so that there is a welfare state there for people.“We are the only developed country where the number of people in the labour market is lower than it was before Covid, the number of economically inactive people of working age is rising.”But she added: “We’ve already announced that we are reviewing the criteria for accessing Pip. Even with these changes, we will substantially be increasing the amount of money we are paying in sickness and disability benefits during the course of this parliament.”Under the changes already announced, claimants would not qualify for Pip unless they score a minimum of four points on a single daily living activity. Government sources have ruled out any further changes to the assessment criteria.Assessments score from 0 to 12 the difficulty that claimants face in a range of living activities such as preparing and eating food, communicating, washing and getting dressed.Just over 370,000 people who claim Pip will lose the payments, while another 430,000 who would have become eligible in the future will not now get it. On average these people will lose £4,500 a year.The government has argued the welfare system needs dramatic reform as 1,000 people a day are newly claiming benefits. Even with the cuts, it will still be spending more on Pip, with an extra 750,000 people receiving payments by the end of this parliament.As part of the measures, the Department for Work and Pensions will spend up to £1bn a year extra on helping people back into jobs.About 170 MPs, including some loyalists, are understood to be preparing to rebel by either voting against the government on changes to eligibility for Pip payments or abstaining.OneLabourMP suggested that making small changes to the plans would not be enough to win over sceptics. “Small tweaks here and there won’t be enough. As long as the welfare reforms punish the most vulnerable, they’ll face opposition,” they said.A government source suggested the numbers were starting to fall after Kemi Badenoch said the Tories would oppose the plans. “The idea of voting against the government becomes more difficult for people if it means walking through the lobbies with the Tories,” they said.Labour whips have suggested that the expansion of free school meals last week and indications from senior ministers that they were open to lifting thetwo-child benefit capwas also helping to reassure concerned MPs.Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsLabourLiz KendallnewsShareReuse this content"

The funding will ensure the wider availability of machines that remove a patient’s sickled red blood cells and replace them with healthy donor cells.More than 20NHStrusts currently offer Spectra Optia technology, a treatment more effective than blood transfusions and having been shown to be highly effective in reducing complications such as iron overload.The investment could save the NHS up to £12.9m every year thanks to a reduction in time spent in hospital for patients and the reduced need for other treatments, according to the government.Sickle cell disease primarily affects people from an African-Caribbean background. In England, about 17,000 people are living with the disease, an inherited blood disorder, with 250 new cases a year.Wes Streeting, the health and social care secretary, said: “People living with rare conditions like sickle cell disease face immense everyday challenges, and can sometimes struggle to get the specialised care they need.“To make our health service fit for the future, we have to harness the power of new technologies, and these machines provide a shining example of how our government is starting to make huge advancements in digital healthcare.“Through our plan for change, this government will be the one that removes the barriers to getting the latest and best tech to our NHS frontline, so patients can access the best care available, closer to home.”Prof Bola Owolabi, the director of healthcare inequalities at NHS England, said: “This is great news for people living with sickle cell disease – a condition that disproportionately affects Black African and Black Caribbean communities.“Sickle cell patients have needed new treatment options for decades and this additional funding will provide greater access to this life-changing technology which has the potential to significantly improve patients’ quality of life.”Owolabi added that sickle cell care in England continued to be among the best in the world, with England the first country tointroduce a groundbreaking gene-editing therapy, which offers a functional cure to the disease.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The European Commission insisted that the British territory had to align its taxation policies with the EU in order to join a customs union, an integral part ofthe deal struck on Wednesday.“The agreement that we have reached is that they will, in a period of three years, reach a level [on a transaction tax] that is acceptable for us,” the person said.The agreement, hailed as “historic”, will erase the border separating the British overseas territory from the rest of the Iberian peninsula. Gibraltar will be connected to the EU’s border-free Schengen zone, meaning Gibraltarians can move freely in the surrounding region, although without rights to work and settle elsewhere in the EU.Passport checks will be carried out at the port and airport by British and Spanish border guards. Spanish officers will be empowered to deny entry to the British overseas territory to any British national who has already exceeded their 90-day stay limit. Under Schengen rules, UK citizens are limited to stays of 90 days within a 180-day period.Spanish customs officials will also check goods entering Gibraltar via the land border, the main entry point for nearly all items. The British overseas territory will eventually enter into a customs union with the EU, which requires a further agreement.Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, has welcomed “the tax convergence process that will ensure that everybody is treated fairly”. He said: “Now Gibraltar is linked to the customs union. There will be fair competition for everybody.”Madrid has long been concerned that cigarettes from Gibraltar were being illegally sold in Spain, whileEuropean anti-fraud investigators have warned about cross-border smuggling by organised crime.The government of Gibraltar, which is responsible for setting taxation on the British overseas territory, has been contacted for comment.The Gibraltar agreement came weeks after the UK and EUagreed on a wider reset. EU sources said completing the unfinished business of Brexit for Gibraltar was necessary to move forward in other areas, such as defence and a veterinary agreement.Spain has been blocking British participation in defence projects and could have proved an obstacle to future deals if the status of Gibraltar had not been agreed. “Everyone wanted to find compromises, solutions, etc, and it was the right moment to do that,” the official said.Explore more on these topicsGibraltarSpainEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

His glasses were stolen, and he was pushed, shoved, kicked and punched while one of the teenagers filmed the incident on her phone.Police received reports of the attack at 11.25pm and on arrival found Rivero unconscious with a severe head injury and in cardiac arrest.Officers later recovered CCTV footage of the assault in which the 17-year-old girl could be seen punching Rivero in the head, causing him to fall backwards. .DI Devan Taylor, from Scotland Yard, said: “Mr Rivero was a much-loved family man who died in a truly tragic incident. I know how much his death has impacted those close to him and the wider community.“I would like to offer my heartfelt sympathy to Mr Rivero’s family for their loss and express my admiration for the dignity they have shown throughout the investigation. I also wish to thank the members of public who went to Mr Rivero’s aid as he lay injured.“The young defendants have now accepted they were responsible for the killing of Mr Rivero, in what was a senseless and completely out of the blue attack on a lone, elderly man. The age of the defendants adds to the devastating nature of this incident and they will now have to deal with the enormity of their actions.”Appearing before the Old Bailey via video link, the teenagers, who cannot be identified because of their ages, pleaded guilty to manslaughter. They will be sentenced by judge Judy Khan KC on 5 September.The victim’s daughter, ex-wife and cousins were in court for the hearing.Khan ordered reports and remanded the defendants into custody.Explore more on these topicsCrimeLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

For poultry farming alone, the UK ranks as having the second-highest number of intensive farms at 1,553, behind France with 2,342.‘I felt hopeful about my daughter’s future’: the farmers fixing our eco crisis – in picturesRead moreThe top 10 countries for intensive pig and poultry farms combined are Spain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, UK, Denmark, Poland, Belgium and Hungary, according to information obtained from the European Commission, and country-specific regulatory agencies and colleges.Intensive livestock units are farms where 40,000 or more poultry, 2,000 or more fattening pigs, or 750 or more breeding sows are being held at any one time in the EU and the UK. The increase in so-called megafarms across Europe comesas the number of small farms has reduced dramatically,and the income gap between large and small farms has increased, according to Guardian research. Therise in intensive farming has coincided with a decline in birds, tree species and butterfly numbers.In the Severn and Wye Valleys, a UK hotspot for intensive poultry farming, there are 79 chickens per human, the Guardian has revealed.Across Europe the rise in large intensive poultry units is akey driver of river pollution. Chicken droppings contain more phosphates – which starve fish and river plants of oxygen – than any other animal manure.In the UK the number of intensive farms grew from 1,621 in 2017 to 1,824 in 2023, and according to data released under freedom of information laws to Terry Jermy, the MP for South West Norfolk, megafarms in England have breached environmental regulations nearly 7,000 times since 2015.The data shows that the Environment Agency carried out about 17 inspections of intensive livestock units a week in which 75% of those inspections found breaches.The breaches include slurry pits in disrepair, causing them to leak and pollute the local environment, and a serious case in which a site of special scientific interest was polluted by animal effluent. There were also some serious air pollution incidents and numerous breaches involving the over-stocking of animals.When serious breaches were found, action against the farms was rare. For the most serious breaches (category 1 and 2), more than half received either no further action, “advice/guidance” or a warning. Fewer than half of the incidents received further action such as a formal warning, and less than 1% received a “recommended” prosecution.Jermy said: “These shocking numbers alongside the severity of the litany of offences clearly show that the huge increase to US-style factory farms since 2017 is harming our land and jeopardising our climate targets and sustainability ambitions moving forward.“In my constituency farming is our lifeblood, as is the environment, and therefore, we must have a serious conversation as to what kind of farming we need moving forwards. It must be one that protects our communities, agriculture and nature, while furthering animal welfare standards as well as harnessing food security.”An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “Environmental permitting provides a consistent, robust form of regulation, which identifies all non-compliances and requires them to be addressed, regardless of severity. In the past two years 98% of intensive pig and poultry farms have been scored in the highest bands for compliance, meaning they present a very low risk to the environment. This follows ongoing high levels of compliance over previous years.“The vast majority of non-compliances identified are low risk, and we work with farmers to achieve compliance. Any high-risk non-compliances, or farms that fail to bring themselves into compliance, will face enforcement action.”Norfolk has been dubbed the “megafarm capital of Europe” with statistics from Compassion in WorldFarmingshowing there are now 122 megafarms in the county and 25,748,309 factory-farmed animals.A megafarm in Jermy’s constituency that would have reared almost 900,000 chickens and pigs at any one time wasrecently blockedby councillors over climate and pollution concerns. There were objections raised over air pollution and the impact on a water-depleted area.Revelations about the scale of livestock megafarms across Europe should be a wake-up call in Brussels, said Reineke Hameleers, the CEO of Eurogroup for Animals.“[It] goes against promises to improve animal welfare and move toward more sustainable farming. It’s important that the European Commission makes smart, informed choices about the future of farming. Funding should go to farming systems that are truly sustainable, competitive, and resilient.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

I stand on their shoulders.”In the years since she finished writing The Safekeep, “the conversation it’s entered into felt all the more important to me, in the face of violence in Gaza and the West Bank and as I’ve said, the violence my own queer and trans community faces worldwide,” she said.The Safekeep is a romantic and family saga set in the Netherlands in 1961 which explores the treatment of Dutch Jews in the postwar period. “This is an impressive debut,” wrote Rachel Seiffert in aGuardian reviewof the novel. “I already look forward to Van der Wouden’s next. She can draw characters with nuance, without fear too; she creates and sustains atmospheres deftly, and ultimately delivers a thrilling story.”Chair of the fiction prize’s judging panel, author Kit de Waal, said: “The Safekeep is that rare thing: a masterful blend of history, suspense and historical authenticity … a classic in the making.”Van der Wouden’s debut trumped novels by the more established writers Miranda July and Elizabeth Strout. The three other shortlisted books were also first novels: Good Girl by Aria Aber, The Persians by Sanam Mahloudji and Fundamentally by Nussaibah Younis.Photograph: AbacusIn The Story of a Heart, Rachel Clarke sets the story of two children connected by a heart transplant against the history of heart surgery. “While there is much to be gleaned here about the minutiae of medical inventions and procedures, Clarke never loses sight of the human impact,” wrote Fiona Sturges in herGuardian reviewof the book.Chair of judges for the nonfiction prize, journalist Kavita Puri, described Clarke’s book as “authoritative, beautiful and compassionate.“This is a book where humanity shines through on every page, from the selfless act of the parents who gift their daughter’s heart in the depths of despair, to the dedication of the NHS workers,” she added.At the ceremony in London, Bernardine Evaristo also received the one-off outstanding contribution award, which wasannounced last weekand awarded in celebration of the Women’s prize’s 30th anniversary.Evaristo has never won the prize, but was shortlisted for her Booker-winning novel Girl, Woman, Other. Winning the £100,000 outstanding achievement prize “more than makes up for it”, she saidin a Guardian interview.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

There’s that horrifying feeling that there will be connections that will lead back here. It’s just unimaginable.”Shah-Levy had joined dozens of others at the International Siddhashram Shakti Centre, close to the high street, to pray and light candles. “I have had this sense of panic and sadness all day that I haven’t been able to shift, and being able to come here and gather collectively in some way, it’s important,” she said.Some of those present had already heard the names of people they believed had been on the flight. Bhupendra Buch, a retired police community officer, said an uncle of his in India had messaged to tell him his two granddaughters were on board, though Buch was unsure if they had been injured or killed. He had also been told that another Indian couple who he had lived next door to many years before had also been killed.View image in fullscreenHarrow councillor Aneka Shah-Levy.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianFew operators fly direct between Ahmedabad andLondon, so this same Air India journey is a trip that many here have taken many times, said Navin Shah, a retired architect and former Labour chair of the London Assembly. Shah was born in a small town 20km (12 miles) from the crash site, and said he knew the area intimately. “As we speak I can vividly picture the whole area.”It had been an exhausting and overwhelming day, he said, apologising for the emotion in his voice. “Since the morning, I’ve been talking to my nephews, my cousins and friends who live in Ahmedabad, within spitting distance. The sense of shock I got from them, phone call after phone call, is that of horror and disbelief.”View image in fullscreenA prayer at the centre in Harrow.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianHe said he believed the majority of those present, as well as in other British Indian communities in places like Leicester and Brent, would have connections with someone who had died.Shah has been discussing with family members in India what they could do for the part of the city where the plane fell, which he said included a slum. “You have got to look, in the gloom, at what good you can do. That’s what I’m looking towards. That something good can and must come out of this event. If we can help regenerate that community, that will be something,” he said.View image in fullscreenShri Rajrajeshwar Guruji (centre), the leader of the spiritual hub.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianFor Shri Rajrajeshwar Guruji, the spiritual leader of the community, the crash was “very, very sad news, it is a very big disaster”. Guruji said he personally knew the names of “13 or 14” people he believed had been on the flight, including Vijay Rupani, the former chief minister of Gujarat, who had previously worshipped at the centre. Rupani has been confirmed as one of those on board.The disaster had had a “big impact” on the British Gujarati community, Guruji said. “I can only try to give them spiritual support, because beyond that, God is the only one who can give them strength.”The community is braced for hard days ahead, said Shah-Levy. “Obviously, it’s still very early days. No one really knows yet. As more names come through, no doubt there will be more prayer meetings. There will be many people among us who have lost someone. This is a day that we won’t forget – for all the wrong reasons.”Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The Department of Health and Social Care will receive 2.8% more on average over the course of the parliament, taking its budget from £189bn in 2023-24 to £246bn by 2028-29.But focusing only on this week’s announcement, which covers the three years from 2026-27, the settlement looks much tighter, with departmental budgets rising only 1.5% on average.Britain on track to become a ‘National Health State’, says thinktankRead moreTaking out certain big-ticket items of government spending, the situation looks tougher still. According to the Resolution Foundation, everything outside of health, defence, education and overseas aid will fall by 1.3% on average – a total of £2.4bn in cuts.Some departments are being particularly badly hit, including the Home Office, which is facing 1.4% annual cuts over the next three years; and the environment department, the budget of which will drop 2.3% each year on average.Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, said: “Spending cuts will be seen as austerity; those are the facts.Labourneeds to pick up the pace on change, otherwise it will be stuck in the political slow lane while other voices get louder.”The chancellor says that the significant rise in capital spending will help offset the impact of reduced day-to-day spending for some departments. Better technology and equipment will help make processes more efficient, for example in the NHS where new scanners and testing machines should help ease the burden on doctors and nurses.Economists also point out that the growth in day-to-day spending is still set to outstrip even the OBR’s relatively bullish growth forecasts.Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: “This is not a period of austerity. This is a long period during which spending will be growing faster than the economy which, given current OBR estimates – which are more optimistic than most – is set to grow by 1.5% a year.”Reeves faces two main problems, however, when persuading the public they are not experiencing austerity. One is that her plan mostly unpicks Conservative spending plans that were never realistic in the first place; without those there would have been significantly deeper cuts pencilled in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not really. Was it austerity? Not really. It looks like a pretty conventional and sensible way of allocating the spending envelope.”The second is that unlike during the previous Labour government, Reeves is increasing overall departmental budgets after years of cuts. Local government, for example, will receive average real-terms rises of 1.1% a year over the next three years. But at the end of that period its central government funding will be 50% lower than it was in 2010.For those on the left, those previous cuts are even more reason to open the spending taps now, even if it means raising taxes at the autumn budget to do so.Theo Harris, an economist at the NewEconomicsFoundation, said: “To deliver the change people voted for, the government should free itself from its self-imposed fiscal rules, recognise the value of social spending and be willing to tax wealth fairly. This may not be austerity, but it doesn’t look like the start of a decade of renewal.”Those close to Reeves, however, point out that she has already announced one of the biggest tax-hiking budgets in recent history to fund an immediate splurge in government spending – something Labour supporters have long called for.“In place of decline, I choose investment,” Reeves said on Wednesday. “These are Labour choices.”Explore more on these topicsSpending review 2025Rachel ReevesLabourAusterityEconomicsEconomic policyPublic financeanalysisShareReuse this content"

As military raids rolled out across her neighbourhood one morning in February 2023, Amani Hashash says she took her four children into a bedroom. When she heard Israeli military coming into their home she called out that they were inside and posed no threat.Moments later the bedroom door was opened and a large, unmuzzled dog launched itself into the room, plunging its teeth into her three-year-old son, Ibrahim, who was asleep in her lap.View image in fullscreenIbrahim Hashash, who was three at the time of the attack.Photograph: HandoutHashash fought to get the animal away as it mauled and shook her screaming son and started to drag him out of the room. “But it was such a big dog, not like any other dog I have seen,” she says. “It kept biting and pulling my son away from me. I screamed and hit it, but it kept pulling at him.”She says she begged the soldiers to call off the attack but they couldn’t control the animal. By the time they managed to drag the dog away, Ibrahim was unconscious and bleeding heavily. The soldiers injected Ibrahim with sedatives and called an ambulance, which took him to hospital where he was rushed into surgery.“When I saw his wounds I was distraught because they were so extensive,” says Hashash. “The doctors said his condition was critical. One wound was six and a half centimetres, another was four centimetres. There were so many wounds the dog had caused, it hadn’t left any of Ibrahim’s back untouched.”Ibrahim needed 42 stitches for internal and external injuries and 21 injections to treat an infection contracted from the bites. Photoraphs of the injuries sustained in the attack seen by the Guardian and ARIJ show extensive wounding and bite marks.More than a year later, Hashash says Ibrahim still has nightmares and his wounds have not healed. “They did this to terrorise us,” she says. Hashash says one of the Israeli commanders had told herthat the dog had been trained to attack the first person it saw. “He’s just a child,” she says. “He hasn’t done anything wrong.”The IDF refused to comment on the case.2:01Amani Hashash shows dog-inflicted injuries on her three-year-old son Ibrahim – videoThe dog that attacked Ibrahim is likely to have been a Belgian malinois, which Hashash identified from pictures of different dogs used by the military. Originally used to herd sheep, the breed is now widely used by Oketz, Israel’s specialist canine unit, feted in Israel and widely feared across thePalestinian territories.According to an investigation by Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) and the Guardian, it is also likely that the animal used was sent to Israel fromEurope, where a steady flow of dogs are traded from specialist trainers into the ranks of the Israeli military.View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers from the Oketz canine unit at a training base in southern Israel.Photograph: Jack Guez/AFP/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenIsraeli military vehicles patrol the streets of Balata refugee camp.Photograph: Nasser Ishtayeh/SOPA Images/REX/ShutterstockLast year, commanders in the Oketz unittold US urban warfare researcher John Spencer, who has embedded with the IDF on multiple operations, that 99% of the approximately 70 military dogs it buys every year were sourced from companies in Europe, a figure that the IDF did not dispute when asked to confirm.Oketz insists it only deploys attack dogs in anti-terrorism operations, but human rights organisations insideGazaand the West Bank say the use of the animals to attack, terrorise and humiliate Palestinian civilians has increased since the beginning of the war in Gaza, leading to multiple injuries and some fatalities.0:52Muhammed Bhar’s mother, Nabila, describes the dog attack that killed her son – videoOne organisation, Euro Med Human Rights Monitor, says it has documented 146 cases of attack dogs being used against civilians by the Israeli army since October 2023.In one incident, in July 2024,an IDF dog attacked Muhammed Bhar, a young man with Down’s syndrome and autism, at his home in Shejaiya in Gaza City. In the aftermath of the attack, IDF soldiers forced his family out of their home, leaving Bhar to die alone of his wounds.View image in fullscreenMuhammed Bhar, left, and bloodstains on the chair in which he was attacked.Photograph: family handoutA video publishedin June 2024 appeared to show an Israeli military dog attacking Dawlat Al Tanani, a 68-year-old woman, in her home in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza, leaving her with injuries.Animal welfare experts have criticised the weaponising of dogs by training them to attack civilians, calling the process “a moral violation”. Dogs reportedly undergo extensive training with Oketz after they arrive in Israel before being deployed in operations.Charities have also raised concern about the high numbers of dogs dying in military operations. InJanuary, Israeli military reports said the Oketz unit had lost 42 military dogs, since the beginning of the war on Gaza, although online references to the number of Oketz dogs who have died have recently been removed.0:23Al Jazeera footage shows dog attack that left Dawlat Al Tanani seriously injured – video“It is unethical to turn dogs, which are naturally social creatures, into instruments of aggression to be used in wars that are solely caused by humans,” says animal behaviour expert Dr Jonathan Balcombe. “Dogs don’t choose to fight, they are made victims in conflicts they don’t understand.”Tahrir Husni was pregnant when she says Israeli soldiers stormed her house in Khan Younis in 2023 and set a dog on her, which then mauled her in an attack that lasted more than 10 minutes.“It was so big, it was impossible to push or kick it away,” she says. “When it was attacking me, I lost all feeling in my leg. When it was over, I sat down on the couch and then I could see my blood and flesh all over the floor.”Husni says hours later she miscarried. “I lost the child I’d waited six years for,” she says. “My leg is so disfigured I can’t bear to look at it. I can’t walk, and the pain is always there.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to testimonies from former detaineesreported by Physicians for Human Rights, dogs have been ordered to bite and maul prisoners and urinated and defecated on them.Amnesty International says that the use of dogs against civilians needs to be urgently recognised in legal instruments and laws regulating the use and sale of conventional weapons.“They should be part of international treaties regulating the use [of weapons], to stop them being used in violation of human rights,” says Patrick Wilcken, an expert on military and security issues at Amnesty.“There is a clear risk that these exports help to promote practices that violate international and human rights law, so companies and states should seriously consider whether their activities are linked to unlawful acts committed by Israel.”Richard Falk, a former UN special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories, says European companies should stop exporting military dogs to Israel, adding that continuing to do so makes them complicit in human rights abuses.View image in fullscreenIsraeli soldiers watch a military dog at a property in the Gaza Strip in February 2024.Photograph: Israel Defense Forces/Reuters“From the perspective of general international law, I have no doubt whatsoever that companies exporting these dogs are complicit, because they know exactly how they are used,” says Falk.The investigation found that a large number of military and police dogs have been sent to Israel by companies in Germany and the Netherlands since the war in Gaza began.The Animal and Plant Health Agency has confirmed 294 dogs were exported from the UK to Israel as pets between February 2022 and December 2024, but says it does not track their breed or purpose. Other countries such as Belgium and the Czech Republic that export dogs to Israel also say they do not have details on what breeds were sent or whether they were trained as military animals.Under current EU regulations, such dogs are not classified as strategic or controlled dual-use items or weapons and therefore do not require export licences, and governments do not have to keep records of numbers exported and for what purposes.According todocuments obtainedby the Dutch Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations thinktank (Somo) , the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) issued 110 veterinary certificates between October 2023 and February 2025. These are the documents required for the export of dogs to Israel by Dutch companies specialising in military and police canines.View image in fullscreenAn IDF dog attacks a Palestinian protester during a demonstration in the village of Kafr Qaddum, near Nablus in the occupied West Bank in 2012.Photograph: Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty ImagesOf these certificates 100 were granted to the company Four Winds K9, a police dog training centre in the Dutch village of Geffen. Four Winds K9 and the NVWA declined to comment on the export of trained dogs to Israel.The German company Diensthunde.eu confirmed it exported Belgian malinois and German shepherd dogs to Israel between 2020 and 2024. The company denies they were used for “protection or offensive purposes”, saying they were for explosives and narcotics detection only, and that the company excluded any training or sale of dogs for protection or offensive purposes in full compliance with German law.ARIJ approached the European Commission for information on EU exports of military dogs to Israel but it says it does not have this information.‘No rules’: Gaza’s doctors say they were tortured, beaten and humiliated in Israeli detentionRead moreIn a statement, the Israeli military said, “The IDF, including the Oketz unit, employs all necessary operational tools required to address threats in the field – this is conducted in accordance with binding orders, operational ethics, and international law. The IDF does not use dogs for punitive purposes or to harm civilians. All use of dogs is based solely on clear operational necessity, under close supervision, and following comprehensive training for both fighters and dogs alike.”The IDF said that it places “great importance on the wellbeing of the operational dogs – who are an integral part of the combat apparatus – and the unit continues to operate with constant efforts to minimise harm to all components of the force, including its dogs.”Additional reporting byAziza Nofal, Zarifa Hassan and Tom LevittExplore more on these topicsIsraelRights and freedomPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaAnimalsEuropeIsrael-Gaza warGazafeaturesShareReuse this content"

They have this childlike quality. These days we’d probably say he’s on the spectrum – there’s a sort of Asperger’s type innocence. He makes the lyrics and the melody speak. It’s so welcoming and without edge; it’s not part of a cynical adult world.I knew some of the big songs – Good Vibrations and so on – but it wasn’t until a mate put me on to Pet Sounds that the penny really dropped. What he was doing in the studio is mind-boggling given the limited technology that he had at his disposal. His ear was just stellar, so he was basically remixing the songs while he was making them. He gives you so many different textures and could shape chord structures in very sophisticated, scholarly, almost classical ways, yet you never lose the feeling. The effortless way that something like God Only Knows unfolds is remarkable to me: it’s just straight from the heart and still sounds so fresh and joyful.I can’t think of another band that created a place as vividly as the Beach Boys. It’s like they asked for our idea of California – sunshine, convertibles, milkshakes, movies – and brought it to us. But Brian didn’t surf; he wasn’t photogenic. He didn’t have the vibe, the looks … he was very awkward and looked like someone living in another world. And so how he articulated the world around him sounded otherworldly.View image in fullscreen‘His ear was just stellar’ … Brian Wilson circa 1964.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesWhen I saw him at the Royal Festival Hall with the Wondermints as his band, doing Pet Sounds for the first time, he was a presence on stage, like Jesus with his disciples. They sounded so beautiful, like Gershwin or something. It was so unusual to hear oboes and clarinets in pop, but it wasn’t a novelty. They never felt stuck on; they were essential.He would compose whole songs in his head and when he heard something, he didn’t miss. One of my particular favourites from Pet Sounds is Caroline, No, which starts with a bit of percussion that’s not even a wood block: he’d imagine these weird sounds and try everything possible to bring them to reality. And then all the noises at the end: the train, the barking dogs. My dog barks back at it when it plays.You can hear him in everything from Pink Floyd to Radiohead to something like The Look of Love by ABC, which is definitely derived from Brian’s amazing mind. He was famously deaf in one ear, and Bob Dylan said they should put the other ear in the Smithsonian.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Washington Post/Getty ImagesJessica Pratt, singer-songwriterI Just Wasn’t Made for These Times is one of my favourites. There’s a yearning, searching, wandering feeling … like a teenage alien come to earth. There are all these lyrics on Pet Sounds, and in this song, about feeling out of place, going to look for something and not finding it, realising that what you sought was wrong, that no one’s reciprocating, etc. A sort of juvenile, detached disappointment; there’s this mentality of “Well, I guess I’ll go kick rocks.”But it isn’t artifice, and the music simultaneously feels as if it’s imbued with God’s infinite wisdom. When the line “sometimes I feel very sad” comes in, you nearly wince in sympathy, the way you can’t help but mirror the expression of a crying infant. You feel it in your chest. It’s a totally unique and uncanny juxtaposition – naivety meets profundity, his own spiritual blueprint.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Chiaki Nozu/WireImageSimon Neil, Biffy Clyro frontmanWhen we started, I said I wanted our band to sound like Metallica meets the Beach Boys – that was before I realised quite how sophisticated the Beach Boys were. From that point on, they’re one of the few bands that have been a constant with me in my songwriting. If ever I am at a dead end, I’ll go and listen to a Beach Boys song. It’s a book of knowledge, a religious text. Brian is a never-ending well of inspiration because of the evolution and consistency of his songwriting – he never just hit a groove, he was always finding new ways to say things.Our first dance was to God Only Knows and I got the lyrics tattooed on my chestThe beauty of Brian Wilson’s songwriting is the simplicity of the complexity. A song can sound like a nursery rhyme, and when you start to actually play it on a guitar, it becomes a symphony from God. I think Wilson is a conduit for something from a different ether. His real life was in his songs – it felt like that was the world he lived in, and then he came to visit us the rest of the time. He’s not necessarily coming from the blues, he’s coming from jazz, Gershwin, everything – it was a re-education for me.There’s a reason why you don’t walk into bars every Friday night and bands are doing Beach Boys songs, because they are so hard to play! But my wife and I, our first dance was to God Only Knows and I got the lyrics tattooed on my chest – so Biffy Clyro did a cover of it for MTV Unplugged. That was a way of trying to thank Brian Wilson. When I was trying to figure out how to do it on acoustic guitar, it made me feel like a child again, learning what a songwas. I love the simplicity of the sentiments of his song – really personal and basic, hidden behind these complex musical structures, and that shows how Brian’s mind worked: in one way he was the most advanced and mature artist, and in another he had the brain of a child.View image in fullscreenSurf’s up … the Beach Boys in 1962.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesI was lucky enough to meet him in 2012, when the band were in London. I got to sit with the entire Beach Boys and speak to Brian Wilson about Sunflower, about Holland, asking him about records – to pick his brain was one of the most important moments of my life. He was a bit of a poor soul; he wasn’t at his physical and mental best. But to sit and look in the eyes of someone I genuinely feel was touched by God – that then gave me the strength to cover God Only Knows. I felt changed after having met him.When I asked him about Holland and Sunflower he really brightened up, talked about how he had a great time out there [recording those albums]. And then the guy I was with made me show him my God Only Knows tattoo – I think that freaked him out a bit. All the Beach Boys were there, too, and to see that connection and love and protection they had for Brian even in that small hotel suite … I think that’s also why I ended up doing God Only Knows, because those guys were a band from when they were 14 or 15, and it was beautiful to see that connection. Also, Brian was a big guy – that’s something people don’t necessarily know about him, he was a bear, a linebacker. Even in his 70s he could have picked me up and squeezed me like a grape.Ben and James in our band, singing together as brothers and twins – there’s a magic when siblings and twins sing together, and that all came from the Beach Boys. Even that sense of family, of growing together, or being with each other through the toughest of times, it’s at all levels the Beach Boys influence. And also, the story of Smile has inspired thousands of musicians – trying to make this perfect thing, and you’re not sure you’ve got there, and the people around you don’t share your vision, so your scaffolding to get there is removed. But the fact that he got back to finish that with Van Dyke Parks, it was just meant to be. That was a real big moment for all of us.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rune Hellestad/Corbis/Getty ImagesRay Davies, the KinksWe worked with the Beach Boys on several occasions at a time when the British Invasion was in full swing – they flew the flag for American surf music and influenced many of the British bands. Brian’s songs were more like hymns, and his body of work is up there with the greatest American composers. My condolences to his family and all who loved him.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Adam Berry/RedfernsGraham Nash, the Hollies; Crosby, Stills, Nash & YoungWhen I was in the Hollies we played with the Beach Boys in – I think – Birmingham, Alabama in 1966 or early 67. We realised what an incredible band they were and how much fun they were having. In the Hollies we did three-part harmonies. They had at least four, maybe five voices: even Dennis [Wilson] at the back on the drums would sing.The vocal harmonies are just unbelievable on Pet Sounds, particularly a song like Caroline, No. As I listened more, I realised that Brian thought every album should be a journey, an idea that influenced the Beatles with Revolver and certainly with Sgt Pepper’s, because that’s again a complete journey from start to finish. I think the record company put Sloop John B on Pet Sounds because they wanted a pop single. It’s a great song, but to me it doesn’t fit musically with the rest of the journey. That album changed the way many musicians thought about what music could do: it wasn’t a fast pop song, two and a half minutes right before the news. Pet Sounds changed a lot of people’s thinking, and I’ll be for ever grateful to Brian.I think the transcendental beauty in his music was born within him in the same way it was born within Bach or Mozart, just in a different era. When Brian was writing pop music he was incredibly successful, but he was always thinking that music could be pushed further and further into the future, which is why it still sounds as fresh as a daisy.We must remember that for God Only Knows Brian wrote the music, but [Wilson’s friend] Tony Asher wrote the lyrics. It was a brilliant combination of music and words. For me, along with the Beatles’ A Day in the Life, it’s the greatest song ever written.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rick Kern/Getty ImagesJim James, My Morning Jacket frontmanOne of the biggest things about Brian Wilson was his mystery. For me, at least, when you looked at him it was like trying to understand the force behind nature or creation itself. He was so interesting because often when he spoke he never knew very clearly what he was thinking, but when he sang and wrote music, you understood profoundly and it hit you like the wind. I love the fact that he couldn’t offer in words or interviews what it was that we all felt was so magical about him, but his music came through so insanely powerfully.Every artist longs to have their Pet Sounds – a moment that’s so important – and I’ve listened, trying to understand. What did he do? I’ve watched all the documentaries, read all the books and I know everything there is know about him, but I still can’t understand. It’s like staring at the stars at night and wondering how the universe works. Music – the creative ideas and inspiration – would just arrive in his head from wherever and then he had the technical expertise to execute these things.Listen to Right Where I Belong, from the soundtrack to Long Promised Road.When I went to be interviewed for the documentary [2021’sLong Promised Road], the people making the film asked if I would be interested in trying to write a song with Brian. Of course I was. They gave me this cassette demo of him at the piano. There were no lyrics, but the playing and melody were really beautiful. I took that home and I wasn’t coming up with much, because I wanted it to be about him, not me. Then it hit me: I should just set some of the things he’s said in interviews to music. I wrote the choruses for Right Where I Belong and then most of the lyrical information came directly from things he’d said in interviews, occasionally losing a word to work rhythmically, or whatever. Sometimes he’d look over at me and go: “Wait. I remember saying these things!” I sang a guide vocal of what I imagined it might sound like and Brian sang along with that, but then just came at it.We all know the story of what he went through with mental illness and so on, but he conquered his challenges in so many ways and so many times. I’m sure it challenged him to the day he died, but simultaneously he had a beautiful family and a beautiful, peaceful life and a lot of people that loved him. He lived to a nice old age and his story is really one of triumph.It was one of the great honours just being in the room with him. Most of the time we were in the studio, he wasn’t feeling very well or was quite withdrawn. But the moment we hit record and he started singing, his entire being exploded through the room. The joy shot out of his voice and it was like seeing him spring to life through music. I think it was one of the last vocals he ever did, but it had so much power. It was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Peter GannushkinWendy Eisenberg, singer-songwriterSome of my earliest musical memories are of my dad covering In My Room to me as a lullaby. He was a huge Brian Wilson fan and would tell me all these cute bits of trivia about early Beach Boys, like release dates, when I was growing up. So he was just kind of elemental. And then my dad was like: here’s this foundational record, Pet Sounds, and you should listen to it. There was such a crunchy, insane, dense texture that was faithful to the songs in a way that was completely surprising – at that point, so many of the songs I had heard were arranged for maximum listenability on the radio.I love him so much that trying to analyse his music seems almost sacrilegious. But the reason that Brian Wilson is so important to me, and why I was so devastated to hear of his passing, is that he’s touched so many people without compromising the idiosyncrasies of how he hears music, and production specifically. The narrative that I was receiving growing up, and now, was that when you play music that’s complex, it alienates people. It would make me feel that my existence as a creative person was inherently alienating. It sometimes seems like, if you’re writing a song, it has to be geared towards some ideal listener who needs to be moved by it. But the secret to a good hook or anything memorable is that you’resurprised. And Brian Wilson always knew that: no matter how honest the song is, the surprises were the things that you’d remember. And it seems like he got that from living his really hard life.There’s a real temptation, when diagnosing Brian Wilson’s musical complexity, to say that he could have been a great composer in classical music. But the other amazing thing about him – for better and for worse, because of the intensity of his sensitivity – is that it seems like he justwaswhere he was, all the time. So he was in California at this time, trying to live a life in music. His compositional gifts, if he were in 1571, would have sounded entirely different. He documents his world. And his world as a writer is complex, and it has a lot of heart, and it’s been through a lot, and it’s towards a childlike honesty and ethos and sensitivity.‘He wants it to be a moment of eternal purgatory or heaven’ … listen to Surf’s Up.I think about how his compositions just evolved and evolved and evolved, and became his philosophy. Like these infinite loops at the end of Surf’s Up, of vocal melodies – it’s like he wants it to be a moment of eternal purgatory or heaven. Like he doesn’t want the song to end. And he does that through an aural illusion. The lyrics there are “a child is the father of the man”, done in an Escher-type strange loop – I think he’s trying to convey the train of how we learn from each other. What I love about him is that this progression of craft is always in service of this really simple, elemental emotion, and if you get close to it, it is so complex – it contains entire worlds.When I’m writing, I try not to judge the parts of the songs that come out conventional, and I try not to judge the songs that come out extremely complex. It’s not: I want a song todosomething. It’s: I want the song that’s coming out of me to be open and vulnerable and to touch me, and also younger me and also future me. I want to be honest. And I think that’s from hearing him and how faithful he was to how the song comes out, line by line.I keep turning to Surf’s Up, because I can’t believe it’s real – there’s a completeness to the idea that comes out when that song is done. And probably when he’s doing it, he’s having so much fun ripping from chord change to chord change or from section to section. It seems like there’s a place for him; the song is the room that he can be comfortable in and then just leap around and be like: oh my God, I’m here! And when I’m writing a song that I really love, I feel that sense of infinite possibility, and that bonds me to him. It’s like: here you are in this world that’s demanding certain things from you that freak you out or that physically harm you. But then, within this world, is a microcosm of a world that’s far, far freer. Which is what you need inthisworld, but it’s far, far harder to come by here.Explore more on these topicsBrian WilsonPop and rockDavid GrayRay DaviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.More so than normal camping, festival packing requires taking the right stuff to be comfortable on your feet all day (and probably night), but packing light enough to be able to lug it all to your site. You can’t change the date of a festival to a weekend with better weather, which could mean heatwaves or thunderstorms. Or both.I’ve been going to festivals since I was 15, and have learned the hard way about what you should and shouldn’t bring. I’ve also asked seasoned festival-goers – from parents of young kids to the Guardian’s own music desk, who cover Glastonbury every year – for their tips and hard-won advice. Many recommended the same things, showing just how useful they are (hiking boots and round shoulder bags, we’re looking at you).From ahead torchto chafe cream, here’s everything they recommend (beyond the obvious), and the things they wouldn’t bother bringing.What to pack for festivalsCamping essentials:Keep out the morning sunView image in fullscreenColeman Darwinfour-person blackout tent£169.99 at Halfords£178.99 at AmazonView image in fullscreenQuechuatwo-person 2-second assembly blackout tent£99.99 at DecathlonI recommend getting a tent with some kind of “blackout” tech. My Coleman one has performed really well, even in the California desert for Coachella. Not only does it keep the tent interior really dark in the mornings, but blocking out the sun means it’s also much cooler than a regular tent. If you’ve rolled into bed at 5am, this is a double godsend!Ben Beaumont-Thomas, music editorNot sure you’ll use your tent beyond the festival? If you buy an own-brand tent from Decathlon between now and 14 September, you can return it once you’ve used it in exchange for a gift card (of the same value you bought it for) as part of the retailer’stent pledge scheme. Decathlon will then re-sell the tent through itsSecond Life programmeat a reduced price, reducing waste and making camping accessible to more people.View image in fullscreenSnoozZy cotton eye mask£10 at Tesco£15 at BootsIf you already have a tent and it isn’t blackout, a good-quality eye mask can also prevent you from being rudely woken up by first light or allow you to catch some winks during the day.Secure your tentView image in fullscreenQuechua camping mallet£4.99 at DecathlonLast year at Lost Village, the ground was rock solid, and we couldn’t peg the tent down properly.

It makes going to and from the showers so much easier as you don’t have to fret about hanging your knickers or PJs on a tiny hook and probably soaking them by accident.

Boxed red wine generally comes out top, then decanted spirits, though the hangovers can be fearsome.

I was once close to them but after having my son I could no longer justify their poor and hurtful behaviour and I made the difficult decision to cut contract with them. They always said they had no interest in having grandchildren and they have made it clear they want no relationship with my son. I am mostly at peace with my decision, as sad as it is, as Ifeel that protecting my child from them is an act of love.What I struggle with is how I will explain thisto my son as he gets older. He is five now, and doesn’t question their absence, but I know this might change. How do I say “my parents are cruel and self-centred people who have no interest in our lives” in a more palatable way and in a way that, most importantly, makes itclear that he is in no way to blame?Eleanor says:I’m so sorry you’ve had to make this decision. In telling him, I think you can be led by what he wants to know. It’s amazing what we don’t think to question when we don’t know anything else. Kids grow up in all kinds of setups – three dads, two mums, raised by siblings, parents unknown – they don’t always have the same sense as adults for what’s noteworthy or what calls out for explanation.My sister is unhappy with her life but does nothing to change it. What can I do? | Leading questionsRead moreOne strategy might be to level the explanations in an age-appropriate way as he gets older. “Lots of families have lots of different relationships, and Grandma and Grandpa aren’t in ours” could be a starting response that becomes incrementally more thorough as he seeks to know more. That way it doesn’t feel as though there’s one big day with one big reveal.When we handle facts gingerly we indicate that they’re scary or that they might blow at any moment. If there’s no sense of a big sombre reveal, we can make the opposite seem true: we can demonstrate that these are facts that don’t have to be feared. People do this sometimes when telling kids they’re adopted, for example. No big “sit down we have to talk” moment, it’s just always part of the wallpaper.A similar thing might be possible for you. He has loving, emotionally intelligent family near him already, there hasn’t been a sudden change to his relationship with his grandparents – even once he learns more about the estrangement it might not occur to him to wonder about the details or think it could be his fault.Also, when you explain to him that they’re not in your life, you don’t have to add the moral adjudication of why not. I’m not sure how incomplete the explanation would be if you just said “we aren’t very friendly with each other so we’ve decided not to hang out”. The concept of “bad people” and especially “bad people in your family” can be tricky for kids, and making your parents figures of Bad or Evil might make them more fascinating than they’d otherwise be.The difficulty with giving full moral explanations of interpersonal conflicts – even if you’re totally in the right – is that it makes them seem heated and therefore more curiosity-compelling, and it raises an imagined right of reply. If it’s just “we don’t get on”, there’s not much more to say. If it’s “they’re bad and we’re better off without them”, the curious listener might want to know more. They might even wonder how reliable the narrator is.You’ve had to make a difficult decision for yourself and your child. You don’t need to submit all the inner workings of that decision to him for it to make sense. You can be led by age-appropriate honesty and his own questions.The letter has been edited for length.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsFamilyLeading questionsParents and parentingAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Does one necessitate the other?vammypI’ve always thought it’s all the same. You just try to be as honest as you can, and if you’re being honest in absurd circumstances then you’re in a comedy. It’s not like I try to be funny or serious – just honest. If you’re watching someone play a bad guy and there’s nothing about the performance that makes you feel for the person or understand them in a deeper way, that’s a fail to me. Because the truth of life is that at a funeral someone always cracks a joke. There’s something so rich about being able to laugh at a funeral. That is what life is to me: all those grey areas, these contradictory things.I’m impressedand baffled by this left turn with Mister Romantic [Reilly’s vaudevillian crooner alter ego]. How did you come up with the character? Why did you pick out the songs that you did?steve__bayleyI made the musical Chicago years ago and played this character Mister Cellophane, and it reawakened my love of musical theatre. In particular, my love of the vaudeville performance style: very presentational, trying to connect with the audience and not aloof in any way. I love performing like that. I wanted to sing all those songs, but I was also looking at the world and I thought: man, things are getting pretty unkind and divisive out there. So I created Mister Romantic. He has no memory of the past and so that puts the show live, in the moment. The whole mission is to create empathy and connection and to explore ideas of love.Watch the video for What’ll I Do?.Who were your main inspirations for this album?EddieHaskellRespect must be paid to the real musical inspirations, such as Harry Nilsson, Irving Berlin,Tom Waitsand Nat King Cole. I’m not saying I’m as good as them by any means, but what those people did was they fell in love with a song and said: this is a beautiful thing, I’m going to share it with the world. I feel part of that lineage. If you really love a song, it can’t be set in amber by one performer; it has to be given life. It’s a little nervy of me, I admit, to try to reinterpret these songs after they’ve been done so beautifully by other people. But life is for living and we have to keep renewing these things if they have meaning for us.Big fan here. Also a big fan of Tom Waits. Do you think Mister Romanticcould be persuaded to record analbum of Waits covers, à laScarlett Johansson?TheManWithoutFearI love thatScarlett Johansson did that. I guess Mister Romantic could do an entire album of Tom Waits songs, but I think it’s more likely that I would. I literally refer to Tom as Saint Tom. He’s a big influence in my life. Not only musically, but also as a performer – his ethos, the way he treats performance and the way he carries himself. I came upon him when I was 18 and he changed my life. I love the way he interprets characters.I’ve had the luck to meet him a couple of times. Once, he was getting ready to do a movie and he said: “Can you hook me up with an acting teacher?” I was like: Tom, with all due respect, you’re one of the greatest living storytellers, what could anyone tell you about acting? But I set him up with Patrick Murphy, my first acting teacher and closest friend, and they met in Sacramento and went to the zoo and talked about character and looked at animals.I thought you really captured the frailty and humanity of Oliver Hardy perfectly inStan& Ollie. What kind of research did you do to prepare for the role? Which Hardy performance is yourfavourite and why?brucevayne1000View image in fullscreenLifelong inspiration … playing Oliver Hardy alongside Steve Coogan’s Stan Laurel in 2018’s Stan & Ollie.Photograph: BBC Films/AllstarI have trouble picking favourites, but I love Brats. It really inspired my absurd sense of comedy. In a weird way, I’d been preparing to play that role my whole life since watching the films on repeat as a child. Oliver Hardy has been a lifelong inspiration and is one of the greatest clowns who ever lived. But one of the great tragedies about him is that he was a beautiful singer, a really incredible tenor, and yet when you look for recordings of him singing there’s only about three or four and they’re all tied to movies. That’s a real shame and I don’t want that to happen to me. If people like my singing, I want them to be able to hear me express myself.Whatcomplimentstill makes you smile?ashtyndsSomeone told me I had a nice butt. I was wearing chaps at the time, which have a way of framing the buttocks in a beautiful way. I have a hard time receiving compliments, actually. I don’t live in a place of narcissistic wonder. I live in a place of wishing I was better most of the time or seeing my shortcomings. It’s good for an artist to keep their ego in check as much as they can.View image in fullscreenOne of TV’s most extraordinary characters … as Dr Steve Brule.Photograph: Cartoon Network/Everett/ShutterstockWhat is it like to be in a film that just doesn’t work or doesn’t find an audience?covskyEvery film is like a prayer and it’s a miracle when they work. Even if you make the perfect piece of art, it can still trip over itself at the box office if it’s not the moment in the zeitgeist when people want that story. I try not to get too caught up in the immediate success or failure of things. If you’ve made something you’re proud of, that is success. I’ve not always felt that way – there were box office disappointments that were devastating – but I’ve learned things can be unexpectedly successful or unsuccessful. In the end, what you carry with you is your personal experience. Yesterday’s reviews are recycling.I’m convinced that Dr Steve Brule [the parodic public TV host played by Reilly between 2007 and 2016] is one of the mostextraordinary characters ever. Nobodycould bring that character to life like you. My question – did you really drink the water from the marina?Was that your idea?papalzalewdSteve definitely drank water from the marina. I was executive producer on that show, so I can’t speak to Steve’s experience. You’d have to check with him, but I’m not sure I would take his advice on everything as a doctor. I’m not even sure what kind of doctor he is. Someone told me once that his mother actually named him “Dr Steve Brule” – that his middle name is Steve and he is not a medical doctor. I’m so proud to be involved with that show and I’m delighted that people love it. I love it as much as they do.Did Magnolia [Paul Thomas Anderson’s 1999 ensemble drama]simply belong to a special time? Can a film in a similar stylehappen again? Why are most films so formulaic, without any of that movie’s surprisesor spontaneity?julian6View image in fullscreen‘Push on no matter what’… with Melora Walters in 1999’s Magnolia.Photograph: Getty ImagesI don’t agree with the underlying sentiment. You could have said the same thing about Badlands: no one makes movies like that any more. But that’s the job of the artist – to push on no matter what it seems like you’re allowed to make. That’s certainly what Paul Thomas Anderson did with Magnolia. I won’t go into it, because he’s a private person, but almost everything in that movie has some personal connection to him. Things come in waves: capitalism and the marketplace get the upper hand, but then humanity has this need for stories and honesty in art and it comes back around. Don’t let yourself get too depressed about the way things are.There have definitely been moments in the last few years, especially with the current state of the movie business, when I’ve felt just like this reader. I went to Cannes film festival a couple years ago, really feeling dejected, like: that’s it, the streamers have taken over, the movie business is dead. But then you watch these movies from all over the world, Mongolia or Sudan, and you realise: oh no, it’s alive and well. This art form is never going to die, because it still works. You just have to seek it out. If you’re worried that there aren’t more things you like out there, then you have to make sure you show up for the things you do. Because that’s what’s gonna keep them alive.What’s Not to Love? by Mister Romantic is released on 13 June on Reilly’s label Eternal Magic RecordingsExplore more on these topicsMusicFilm & Music reader interviewJohn C ReillyTom WaitsPaul Thomas AndersonScarlett JohanssonComedy filmsDrama filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the force of Céline Sciamma’s lesbian love story about an artist and her unwitting sitter on a remote island in 18th-century Brittany is undeniable. As is the integrity of its central dynamic, stripped of power imbalances, hierarchies – and men.24.Diamantino(2018)A low-budget, high-kitsch, torn-from-the-headlines football fantasy about a Ronaldo-esque football star who hallucinates giant pekingese puppies frolicking on the pitch whenever he scores. Throw in a cross-dressing refugee subplot, lesbian spies and a far-right cloning conspiracy and you have a goofy and irrepressible testament to intersectionality.23.We’re All Going to the World’s Fair(2021)Jane Schoenbrun became an A24 sensation with I Saw the TV Glow in 2024, but it is her previous film, a bare-bones chiller about an online horror game, that remains her most original work. Less instantly legible as a trans allegory than her follow-up, perhaps, but all the more disquieting for that.Watch a trailer for Bruce LaBruce’s The Visitor.22. The Visitor (2024)Veteran Canadian provocateur Bruce LaBruce turns Pasolini’s 1968 Theorem into a radical rage against anti-immigrant rhetoric. A gooey Black alien washes up on the banks of the Thames ready to seduce the five members of a London bourgeois household from patriarch to maid. The sex scenes aren’t simulated. Let’s pray the coprophagy is.21. Stud Life (2012)The marketing campaign pitched director Campbell X’s punchy debut as a love story about a butch stud and her femme sex-worker girlfriend, but it is more complicated and original than that: a rallying cry for queer solidarity, a hymn to the friendship between lesbians and gay men, and a celebration of Black British queerness with walk-ons from David McAlmont, Dean Atta, Jay Bernard and Topher Campbell.20.Appropriate Behaviour(2014)Queer cinema finally got its Annie Hall with co-writer, director and star Desiree Akhavan’s wise and hilarious debut. She plays a bisexual “boner-killer” looking back on a failed lesbian relationship. Akhavan skewers everything from the banter at a Persian wedding and the competitive horror of bumping into your ex when you are both out on the arm of your latest squeeze to the very Brooklyn problem of who gets first dibs on attending a discussion group about anti-LGBTQ+ bias in the legal system.View image in fullscreenBrutally frank … Keep the Lights On.Photograph: Cinematic/Alamy19.Keep the Lights On(2012)Ira Sachs used his own doomed real-life romance with the literary agent Bill Clegg as the basis for this brutally frank portrait of compulsion, addiction and heartbreak. An early sex scene, one of the most unvarnished in cinema history, proves that, sometimes, shit happens.18.Crossing(2024)A buddy movie with three heroes: a young Jack-the-lad, a trans lawyer working for the NGO Pink Life and a retired teacher scouring Istanbul’s queer neighbourhoods searching for her trans niece. Levan Akin’s richly compassionate drama uses long-lens cinematography and neorealist techniques to show both the vitality and loneliness of city life.View image in fullscreenDeadpan sensibility … a scene from Lyle Kash’s Death and Bowling.Photograph: T4T Productions17. Death and Bowling (2021)Lyle Kash’s vivid and original debut cocks a snook at the idea that trans film-makers are duty bound to represent the trans experience. When the captain of a lesbian bowling team takes her own life, the ensuing melodramatic beats – the reading of the will, the discovery of a treasure map, the emergence of a long-lost son – collide with a queer aesthetic (Almodóvar,John Waters), Kash’s deadpan sensibility and one of the largest majority trans and non-binary casts in film history.16.Beauty(2011)Anyone craving “queer joy” should steer clear of Oliver Hermanus’s masterful character study of a self-loathing, closeted white Afrikaner obsessed with a handsome young law student. In its single-minded intensity and mounting horror, it’s nothing short of a gay, South African Taxi Driver.15. So Pretty (2019)Not merely a film that knows it’s a film but an adaptation that knows it’s an adaptation, Jessica Dunn Rovinelli’s cool, confident second feature (after her semi-documentary Empathy) concerns a queer Brooklyn house-share in which the polyamorous inhabitants eat, sleep, protest, have sex, make art – and work on a film of Ronald M Schernikau’s utopian novel So Schön. Which, in turn, is exactly what So Pretty is.View image in fullscreenPsychological thriller … a still from O Fantasma by João Pedro Rodrigues.Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy14. O Fantasma (2000)João Pedro Rodrigues has been the by-appointment purveyor of transgressive cinematic phantasmagorias for more than two decades. For confrontational charge and visual eloquence, his debut – a fetishistic psychological thriller about a horny rubbish collector prowling Lisbon for sex in a Latex bodysuit – takes the cake.13.Castration Movie Part One(2024)An “incel”, a trans sex worker and a Terf … No, not the start of a bad-taste gag but just some of the characters in Louise Weard’s highly charged, handheld epic of Vancouver life in the margins. Part One clocks in at four-and-a-half hours, and there are at least another eight hours still to come. Maybe the finished article will turn out to be the greatest queer work of our time – if such binary categorisations weren’t, like, totally normie.View image in fullscreenGasp-inducing … Sebastián Silva’s Rotting in the Sun.12.Rotting in the Sun(2023)In what resembles a sexually-explicit, ketamine-dazed movie-length episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, writer-director Sebastián Silva plays himself as a prissy grouch harassed during a gay beach getaway by comic and social media star Jordan Firstman – a hyperactive attention-seeker with all the social graces of Donkey from Shrek. The film then takes a macabre and gasp-inducing turn. Abrasive and outrageous.11.Weekend(2011)All of Us Strangers merits a place on this list, too. But it is Andrew Haigh’s breakthrough second film – about a Nottingham one-night-stand morphing into a life-changing two-day romance – which remains his most piercing work. Apparently conventional in structure, it actually takes some bold liberties, not least in the way one of the main characters rails against the ubiquity of heterosexual narratives. It’s as if he is willing Weekend into existence before our very eyes.10. Carol (2015)When unhappily married mother Cate Blanchett misplaces her gloves in the department store in early-1950s New York where shop assistant Rooney Mara works, it doubles as the throwing down of a gauntlet, and a provocation to the audience: do you dare reach for the life you want? Adapted from Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel The Price of Salt,Carolisn’t quite Todd Haynes’s masterpiece (that would be Safe, from 1995) but it’s as near as dammit. Carter Burwell’s score has a snake-charmer’s seductiveness, while Ed Lachman’s 16mm cinematography frames the lovers behind glass, smoke and other obstacles, making the viewing experience as tantalising as hearing a tender ballad on a tin-pot transistor radio.View image in fullscreenAutobiographical … Pariah, directed by Dee Rees.9.Pariah(2011)“You need to pop that damn cherry, yo!” Coming-out movies are 10 a penny but Dee Rees’s autobiographical debut, extended from her own 2007 short, is scorchingly fresh. As the teenager tentatively emerging from the closet and into New York’s lesbian club scene, the stunning Adepero Oduye nails both the breathless excitement and the cringe of being queer and horny in a world that wasn’t built for you. “They didn’t have brown?” she says, aghast at the mismatch between her own skin and the colour of the strap-on acquired for her by a well-meaning friend.8.Femme(2023)“We’re all born naked and the rest is drag,” sang RuPaul. Sam H Freeman and Ng Choon Ping’s challenging thriller, stymied and disowned by the queer joy mafia but adored by John Waters, Bret Easton Ellis and Bruce LaBruce, makes that point brilliantly. Weeks after being the victim of a homophobic attack, drag queen Jules (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) spots his attacker (George MacKay) in a gay sauna, and contrives a revenge plan that plunges them both into the shark-infested waters of one another’s worlds.Watch a trailer for The Duke of Burgundy.7.The Duke of Burgundy(2014)Peter Strickland’s third feature, a rapturous and devilishly funny study of a lesbian sub/dom relationship, asks how transgressive or nonconformist appetites survive in everyday life. Sidse Babbett Knudsen is the seemingly imperious dom who would sometimes rather snuggle up in her PJs than wield the whip hand over her sub partner (Chiara D’Anna). Dripping with sensuality (there is even a “Perfume by …” credit in the opening title sequence), the specifics in Strickland’s portrait of “compromise, consent and coercion” are magically universal, applicable to any relationship.6.The People’s Joker(2022)Cinema is safe – or rather, dazzlingly dangerous – in the hands of Vera Drew. Her re-imagining of Joker as a trans coming-out fable is the boldest queer debut since Superstar, Todd Haynes’s Barbie-doll biopic of Karen Carpenter. Drew shot her film in five days then spent several years collaborating with umpteen animators and effects artists on different continents to create its dense visual texture. She stars as the wannabe Gotham City comic who launches a comedy club with The Penguin, falls for fellow trans standup Mr J (modelled on Jared Leto’s Joker from Suicide Squad) and finally confronts Batman, billionaire groomer of teenage boys.5.End of the Century(2019)What if the stranger you hooked up with on a brief Barcelona jaunt turned out to be a figure from your distant past? With a daring use of flashback and a plangent yet playful mood, Lucio Castro’s tale of two men across two decades in one city combines the coolness of Antonioni with the ache of Before Sunrise. The dance/make-out scene to Space Age Love Song by A Flock of Seagulls is euphoric, the film’s ending breathtakingly profound.View image in fullscreenSpellbinding … Tsai Ming-liang’s Goodbye, Dragon Inn.Photograph: Lin Meng Shan4.Goodbye, Dragon Inn(2003)Any of Tsai Ming-liang’s 21st-century films could have ended up on this rundown. But Goodbye, Dragon Inn is a singularly spellbinding achievement, set on the last day of business at a cavernous Taipei picture palace. The camera is alert to each twitch and fidget of the clientele who move from seat to seat like chess pieces in the sparsely populated auditorium. The cruising vibe is at its most pronounced, and its most wickedly funny, in a long sequence in the gents’ toilets.3. The Royal Road (2015)Jenni Olson proves herself the unassuming heir toChantal Akermanin this perfectly calibrated essay film that interweaves California’s bloody history with Olson’s (semi-fictionalised) romantic imbroglios and the tangled roots of her cinematic obsessions – all expressed in a sanguine narration over atmospheric street-and-landscape shots. In a line that captures the essence of queer cinephilia, Olson says: “Experiencing myself as a fictional character has been a mode of survival for me.”2. By Hook or By Crook (2001)Silas Howard and Harry Dodge co-write, direct and star in a twitchy queer caper that celebrates trans masc identity more passionately than any film before it. Shy (Howard) sets out to help his newfound pal Valentine (Dodge) track down his biological mother; along the way, vending machines get boosted and convenience store stick-ups go awry while butch lesbian, trans masc and non-binary viewers get the empathy and representation of which they had long been starved, plus lashings of sex, wit and wildness. Val’s rhapsodic monologue about Shy – “I met a guy! He was very small! He was a little running-away guy! He was a good-guy guy! He was splendid …” – is an endlessly quotable all-timer.View image in fullscreenMasterpiece … Tropical Malady by Apichatpong Weerasethakul.Photograph: Kick the Machine Films1.Tropical Malady(2004)It’s an age-old story: boy meets boy, boy seemingly turns into ravenous jungle beast and is then hunted through the balmy verdant undergrowth.Apichatpong Weerasethakulwon the Palme d’Or with Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives but it is Tropical Malady (in which Uncle Boonmee himself is namechecked six whole years before getting his own film) that remains his masterpiece.

You are likely to find it in the homes of allies, too – this is the holy grail of what-to-feed-my-queer–vegetarian-offspring cookbooks.Not only does The Green Roasting Tin play into stereotypes about gay and bisexual women – all vegetarian recipes, half vegan and supremely practical (the USP of The Roasting Tin series is that all the recipes are oven-cooked in one dish) – but it is also full of indulgence. The tarts, gratins, salads and bakes are dotted with pomegranate seeds or fresh herbs and drizzled with truffle oil or honey. One recipe even has an entire camembert plonked in a tray of potatoes. And that’s what makes it the perfect unofficial lesbian text: its unapologetic goal is pleasure.View image in fullscreenGirlfriend food … The Green Roasting Tin.Composite: Guardian Design; publicity image“This book is for anyone who wants to eat easy veg-based meals that fit around their busy lives,” reads The Green Roasting Tin’s blurb. The joy of this book is that its simplest offerings, such as the all-in-one roasted tomato and bay orzo bake or the crispy kale and bulgur wheat salad, take half an hour, most of which is baking time, when you can be doing something else. And the booked and busy lesbians have got to eat!The recipes from this book that I have made the most frequently are the two that feature crispy roasted gnocchi (a revelation!), especially the completely vegan combination of gnocchi, mushrooms, butternut squash and a herby, garlicky, nutty dressing. It was the first recipe I cooked from the book, which is also perhaps why I associate this book so strongly with queerness: I made it with my girlfriend, now wife, when I had just moved into a flatshare, for lunch with my housemates and their girlfriends. Some of us were meeting that day for the first time, but by the end of the afternoon we were all slouched around contentedly, picking off the last bits of gnocchi from the trays.Big trays of food almost invite you to spend lots of time enjoying them, going back for a second helping or fishing out the last charred mushroom or cube of halloumi. I suppose you could say that this kind of food is a “queering” of the meat-and-two-veg sit-down dinners associated with the traditional heterosexual British family unit. Which is maybe a bit of a stretch – and probably not what Iyer set out to do. But she did put together 75 really easy vegetarian recipes that are all completely delicious. And that, among other things, is exactly what a lot of lesbians want."

The slick, twanging pop-rock was correctly identified at the time by Portishead’s Geoff Barrow as echoing the oeuvre of Shania Twain (though this wasn’t the sick burn he thought it was), over which the LA trio copped to commitment phobia, communication issues and having their heads turned, before skipping into the California sunset with their hearts intact. Well, to commandeer the title of Haim’s debut album: those days are very much gone.View image in fullscreenHaim: I Quit.Photograph: Paul Thomas AndersonI Quit, the sisters’ fourth album, still has plenty of breakup songs, but these are no cheerful odes to dumping dudes in your 20s. Instead, the record fixates on the bitter end of a deeply flawed long-term relationship; at least some of these songs are informed by the love lost between lead vocalist Danielle Haim and Ariel Rechtshaid, the garlanded producer who worked on all three of the band’s previous albums (I Quit is instead helmed by Danielle, Rostam Batmanglij and Buddy Ross). The mood is not desolate – the narrator instigated the split – but it is searching and pained. The ex is portrayed as careless and manipulative, and punches are not pulled (“I swear you wouldn’t care if I was covered in blood lying dead on the street”). There are many references to setting oneself free, reflected in the – perhaps too on-the-nose – sample of George Michael’s Freedom! ‘90, which is woven through the opening track, Gone.The idea of Haim sampling George Michael is more fun in theory than in practice: Gone is initially characterised by a low, flat vocal melody and sludgy instrumentation that manages to strip all euphoria from its co-opted “freedom!” refrain. But then a guitar solo that recalls the White Stripes in their pomp arrives, before this newfound garage-bluesiness is merged with Freedom! ‘90’s bedrock rhythm. It’s a Frankenstein’s monster of a song, but a belatedly brilliant one.On Haim’s last album, 2020’s Women in Music Pt III, the sisters expanded on the perky and sometimes airless rock of their first two records to great acclaim. Gone hints at even more experimentation this time round, so it is disappointing to encounter the wan, plodding country-pop of All Over Me. But hold tight for track three, the absurdly delightful Relationships, which incorporates 80s bombast, the hyper-melodic, pitch-climbing toplines of 90s R&B and a valley-girl-ish take on old-school rap. It is the best pop song they’ve ever made.I Quit peaks, spectacularly, here. The rest of the album’s 15 tracks range from fiercely good and instantly replayable to somewhat bland and instantly forgettable.Haim: ‘We can go toe-to-toe with any male rock band and blow them out of water’Read moreHaim have long been likened to Fleetwood Mac – a comparison Stevie Nicks recently endorsed, telling GQ that collaborating with the trio was “like coming home”. Yet in lieu of that band’s intangible magic and mystery, Haim are undoubtedly best when they add something new to the 70s soft-rock mix, which comes in fits and starts. Slipping intosprechgesang,as on the droll nostalgia-fest Take Me Back, always feels like a wise move, a chance to lean into the sisters’ GSOH, so obvious in interviews but less so in their actual songs. See also Million Years, which employs a manic breakbeat and gloopy synths to wicked, bubbly effect; and the near-nu metal of Now It’s Time’s punchy, synthetic beat, buzzing guitars and whooshing production.I Quit is sonically scattershot, but gratifyingly consistent in one regard. Over its considerable runtime, Haim rake repeatedly over the same heartbreak to construct a candid, complex portrait of a woman working hard to psychologically liberate herself from a relationship, laying out obvious toxicity (“an innocent mistake turns into 17 days”, of conflict, presumably) and harm (“you really fucked with my confidence”), while entertaining the notion that maybe all relationships are like this: “Is it just the shit our parents did? And had to live with it.” As a process, it’s messy, a bit like this album. But ultimately worthwhile, also a bit like this album.This week Rachel listened toMark William Lewis – Tomorrow Is PerfectThe zeitgeist-lassoing film and TV studio A24 is sidestepping into music and Londoner Lewis is their first signing.

As the British Film Institute in London this weekscreens the original 1977 theatrical version of the space opera, which has rarely been shown since the 1990s, readers have shared their recollections of its groundbreaking special effects, iconic heroes and villains, and queueing around the block for tickets.View image in fullscreen‘It immediately put us in the action’ … Marilyn Stacey.Most of those who responded to a Guardian callout recalled being mesmerised by the film’sopening crawl, then “blown away” by the first scene in whichPrincess Leia’s starship is captured by an immense Imperial Star Destroyer. “It loomed right over our heads in the theatre, immediately putting us in the action, alerting us to the huge stakes in this world,” said Marilyn Stacey, a 68-year-old paralegal and actor from Portland, Oregon, who saw the film with her boyfriend in Westwood, Los Angeles, soon after it opened in the US in May 1977.Many readers saidStar Warswas the first “grownup” film they saw as children, with their few previous trips to the cinema being for Disney films such as Mary Poppins or the Herbie comedies about a sentient Volkswagen Beetle.View image in fullscreen‘Even for years afterwards, nothing really compared to it’ … Mark Hannaby.Mark Hannaby, who was six in 1978 when his father drove him from the suburbs of Wrexham, north-east Wales, to see the film at the biggest screen nearby at the Odeon in Liverpool, recalled how it captured his imagination. “At that age, I don’t think you expect the external world to correspond with your internal world,” said Hannaby, 52, now a journalism lecturer at the University of Chester. “Dad said my face never left the screen. I was hungry for the story, and unusually uninterested in the wine gums he offered. Even for years afterwards, nothing really compared to it.”Lois Pass, from Southend-on-Sea, who didn’t have a TV at home when she saw the film as a teenager in 1978, agreed. “To suddenly see battles taking place in space, travel faster than the speed of light, plus this mysterious power – the Force – in a galactic battle between good and evil was simply mind-blowing,” she said.View image in fullscreen‘Obi-Wan Kenobi revealing there is a whole lot more to Luke Skywalker’s life was a potent message’ … Lois Pass.Photograph: Guardian CommunityLike many readers, Cliff Ramshaw’s anticipation for the film had been fuelled by its merchandising. By the time it came out in the UK, Ramshaw, now 58, had already read the novelisation and part of the Marvel comic book adaptation, and had decorated his school haversack with drawings of X-wings and Tie fighters. Unfortunately, his father did not share his enthusiasm for the film when he took him and his younger brother to see it in Sunderland in 1978.“We arrived early and Dad, not wanting to hang around, took us in straight away [to an earlier screening],” he recalled. “We sat down just in time to seethe attack on the Death Star. After the movie ended we remained seated while the audience left and a new crowd arrived. We saw the beginning and middle of the movie and then, when the attack on the Death Star was about to start, Dad took us out of the cinema and drove us home!”Ramshaw, who now lives in the Cotswolds, didn’t get to see the film the whole way through until it was aired on British TV four years later. But his unusual viewing experience did not dampen his love for Star Wars, and he later became a software engineer at George Lucas’s visual effects companyIndustrial Light & Magic.Cliff Ramshaw with his daughter when he worked at Industrial Light & Magic in California.Photograph: Guardian CommunityLuke Skywalker’s journey froma farm boy on a backwater planetto a hero of the rebellion particularly enraptured readers who had grown up in small or remote communities. Back in 1978, Pass, who grew up in the Essex coastal town of Shoeburyness, was grappling with discomfort about her “lowly position on the social scale” at the local grammar school. “There was Luke, a poor, scruffy, nobody from nowhere, just like me, suddenly plucked from obscurity to discover his true calling. Obi-Wan Kenobi revealing that there is a whole lot more to his life than he could ever have imagined [was] a potent message!”Many women who responded to the callout recalled how enamoured they were with Princess Leia’s attitude. Rebecca Pollock, a HR worker from Brisbane, Australia, said: “For a young girl, growing up in a country town in Queensland, watching an amazing heroine like Princess Leia dominate her world gave me a role model who was brave, adventurous and strong in the face of adversity. I loved it when she looked up at Darth Vader and talked back to him, and her banter with Han Solo. Her wit and sarcastic approach was so different to what I’d seen women be.”It wasn’t just children and teenagers who were enraptured. Milton Justice, a former artistic director of theStella Adler Academy of Acting and Theatre, saw the film afterCarrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia, auditioned for a part in a murder-mystery film he was producing.“I remember Carrie’s audition, because she was very quirky as an actor. She didn’t get the part. After Star Wars opened, I went back into the company and said: ‘Are you guys crazy?’ I later knew her socially. She really was one of the funniest people ever. Even some of the line readings she did in Star Wars had that kind of way that she saw life.”Justice, who now runsa podcast about acting, said back then many people in the movie industry thought Star Wars was just a one-off. “In an odd sense, we might have been more respectful of the story than the special effects. I don’t blame Star Wars for the fact that so many movies today have so many special effects that you don’t even see the story. I think it’s very separate from those kind of films.”Explore more on these topicsStar WarsScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For once, the consensus proved spot-on. The government’s main prioritieswere set out on Wednesdayin a blizzard of Commons announcements from Rachel Reeves, some economically substantive, others more for show. The upshot is that the shape of the British state, as Labour intends it, is now decided until the eve of the next election.There are further crossroads still to come, some of them major, as the years covered by the review unroll. Taxes are likely to rise, probably as soon as the autumn budget, to pay for Reeves’s big ticket boosts on Wednesday for defence, health and housing. Council tax could rise too, with possibly dramatic results. The review’s emphasis on capital spending means current spending could be squeezed again, perhaps heralding pay battles. Nevertheless, Labour has set its course.The administrative purpose of the spending review is to define where money is spent in the British state. But the review is also a defining political and cultural moment. It sets out the choices by which the government will stand or fall, and which aim to locate an electoral sweet spot. That spot, still elusive and distant despite Labour’s Holyroodbyelection winlast week, is one in which, as Reeves put it, a sense of renewal “is felt in people’s everyday lives”. Politically, this speech was a moment of truth for the chancellor herself.Reeves has had a tough first year. Some of the grind she will have expected, some of it not. The year has been dominated by thewinter fuel allowance blunder, which was not hers alone but which she inevitably owns. She has maintained a dogged commitment to her strict fiscal rules – she repeated it in Wednesday’s speech – in spite of new global shocks that might allow her to adapt them. Lacklustre macroeconomic out-turns have not helped; inflation and unemployment have both ticked up. Last summer’sdonations rowand questions about thetruthfulness of her personal CVhave done her no favours either.The bookies were starting to mark down the Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, as a potential successor before Reeves spoke. But Reeves did more than enough in her speech to put the lid on that, at least for now. The muttering against her lacks momentum, since it comes from the usual backbench and union critics. Cabinet support, not least from Starmer himself, is meanwhile described as rock solid. “She is universally popular and respected for being straight,” a minister says. If Starmer removed her he would find himself in trouble too. Even so, when Reeves addressed MPs on Wednesday she had something to prove. If her career was not on the line, her authority was.A well-connected former Whitehall mandarin put it very clearly to me a couple of days ago. “It really is a pivotal time for her,” he said. “It has been a really difficult first year. The inheritance was genuinely bad. But the response has blunted her reputation and her options. The main problem is that the government has still not successfully made clear what kind of Britain it is trying to create. If she is to make that vision clear, then this is the time she absolutely needs to do it.”To understand Reeves, it is important to go back to her record as shadow chancellor. Much of her approach was set out in two speeches. The first, given in Washington DC in May 2023,launched the idea of “securonomics”, which she echoed on Wednesday. The Washington speech was the historically bolder of the two. It amounted to an obituary for the era of borderless economic globalisation. It placed national economic security, both for the country and for the public, at the centre of strategy. The second, Reeves’sMais lecture in March 2024, filled this out more watchfully, because the election was nearing. It emphasised the active role of the state in curbing economic decline and inequality, and emphasising the centrality of growth.The connection between those speeches and the announcements this week is clearly umbilical. The spending review’s main focus – defence, health and levelling up – is rooted in the securonomics approach. Reeves may be one of Labour’s most pragmatic ministers. But this absolutely does not mean that she is merely a technocrat without priorities.Indeed she has described herself, in my hearing, as a social democrat. I am reasonably certain she still would. Her record and her priorities bear it out. So did Wednesday’s speech. Her reform of Treasury policy towards growth outside London is a striking example. Few in the cabinet have such a visceral commitment to social and economic mobility. For her, as she made clear on Wednesday, this is personal.Nevertheless, some of what Reeves said in opposition is simply no longer valid. In particular, the assumption in both speeches that the US shares Britain’s values and is a partner for stability has been comprehensively trashed by Donald Trump. Nor, despite the fact that they were given after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, do Reeves’s speeches from opposition contain any hint of the much higher priority now earmarked for defence spending.True, Reeves is not a chancellor who panders to the parts of the Labour coalition whose priorities are unchanged since the middle of the last century. But, as the railways and energy already show, she is open to different ownership models. She was quick to settle with the unions on pay last summer. And she absolutely does not believe, as Liz Truss did, that the key is for government to get out of the way.Ever since she became chancellor, many have been uncertain about whether Reeves can pitch a vision strongly enough to connect with the wider public. She allowed herself to be dubbed an iron chancellor, but she then got involved in the donations furore. Why does she insist on such a tight policy at the Treasury, some ask? The answer is either that she and Starmer think they have no alternative in the circumstances; or, it’s that they are doing it this way because they actually believe in it.Yesterday’s Commons speech was clearly an attempt to show that it is the former not the latter, and given fewer constraints the outlook might be very different. Reeves said repeatedly that her choices were “Labour choices”. So often was this claim made that it all became a bit insistent, but the purpose was clear. It was to stake out distinct centre-left ideological ground for tackling the hazards of the 2020s. Though some will dispute it, it is the thread that runs through the whole of Reeves’s career. The test now is whether that essentially social democratic approach of growing the economy and then redistributing the proceeds will work in today’s world, especially given the entrenched imbalances of the British economy and the increasing volatility of British politics.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSpending review 2025OpinionRachel ReevesEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

The director of theInstitute for Fiscal Studiesis off to run an Oxford college in a couple of weeks and seems determined to go out with a bang. Normally, the scourge of chancellors and all things Treasury is quite measured in what he says. Borderline wonkish in his forensic analysis of financial statements. Choosing his words carefully as he peels back the political spin to deliver his verdict on the true state of the public finances. But for his last outing we got to see the real Paul. Paul Unplugged.The IFS press conference has become something of a tradition. The place where budgets and spending reviews come to die the day after they were delivered. Where the numbers aren’t given a chance to lie. Johnson is nothing if not equal opportunities: no chancellor of either party is given a free pass. If there are discrepancies to be found, the IFS can be sure to find them. To be awarded a grade B from Paul is the sort of result a chancellor can only dream about.This wasn’t to be Rachel Reeves’s lucky day. Johnson had been up through the night crunching the numbers of Wednesday’s spending review and they didn’t look good. Maybe he’d had a bad morning, but for once his language wasn’t couched in any niceties. The chancellor’s spending plans might just about stack up according to her own fiscal rules, but if – as was probable – the Office for Budget Responsibility was to downgrade its forecasts, then Reeves was a “gnat’s whisker” away from tax rises in her autumn budget.It got worse. The £14bn of efficiency savings were just not credible. Rather than going through a line-by-line approach of every departmental budget, the Treasury seemed to have made a blanket 10% cut across the board. “That is not the result of serious analysis,” he said. “I hesitate to accuse the Treasury of making up numbers, but … ” But the government had been making up numbers. We were in the realm of fantasy economics.On we went. Contrary to what Reeves had said, it was his view that the economic forecasts and the public finances had not improved over the last year. He waited to be convinced otherwise. Anyone any ideas? No. Case closed. He ended by saying that all spending reviews are largely a work of fiction. A triumph of hope over experience. Governments always end up having to revise their forecasts upwards and that health and defence were bound to need more cash in three years’ time. With that, he put his copy of the chancellor’s statement into the shredder.Even so, Reeves wasn’t about to give up on her spending review just yet. It was still the only game in town. The Tories had nothing to offer and Reform’s plans extended to bankrupting the entire country within six months. Like it or not, Rachel is the only credible witness in parliament. The only politician with a credible economic plan. She had a programme of renewal where others only had fantasies. There was just the small matter of convincing people she could pay for it all.Over on the BBC’s Today programme, presenter Nick Robinson had also insisted that tax rises were an inevitability. Reeves prevaricated. That wasn’t in the plan but she wasn’t going to plan for what would be in the budget now. The downturn in the April Office for National Statistics growth figures was because of global events: when the quarterly growth figures had gone up, it was entirely down to measures she had taken to stabilise the economy. Everyone would be getting more money and feeling better off apart from the people who wouldn’t. Labour wasn’t about to change its mind about disability payments though it might change its mind about disability payments.This was a masterclass in misdirection. A lesson for any politician in handling a media interview. Say one things and then immediately contradict yourself. Insist that two opposites can both be true. You had to feel for Robinson. He just couldn’t keep up with Reeves. Couldn’t lay a glove on her. And no one was any the wiser about the spending review.Earlier on the Today programme, Kemi Badenoch had been given her chance to make the case for what the Tories might have done differently. Instead, she chose to pick a fight with the presenter Emma Barnett. Mornings aren’t Kemi’s best time of day. Then neither is the afternoon or the evening.What bit of the spending review would you drop, Emma asked. That’s the wrong question, Kemi snapped. After that, it was almost impossible to understand a word as they both talked over one another for the best part of eight minutes. But the rough gist was that Kemi thought that everyone but Kemi was a complete halfwit and that her policies were far better than everyone else’s because her policies were to have no policies.Over in the Commons there were near unanimous congratulations for David Lammy in securing a deal with the EU over Gibraltar. All centring on allowing British and Spanish border guards to be in place at the airport. Much as has happened on the Eurostar services at St Pancras for years. You rather wondered why it had taken so long to think of doing the same on Gib, but Lammy was insistent that this was the apogee of diplomatic relations and was effusive in his thanks to former Tory foreign secretaries for paving the way. Even Priti Patel seemed almost happy.There were just a couple of dissenters. Step forward former foreign secretary James Cleverly. He seemed mostly put out that it hadn’t been him who had secured the deal. He couldn’t help thinking Lammy must have given away far too much to the untrustworthy Spanish. Dave had to explain that the Gibraltar government was totally happy with the deal. No sovereignty was conceded. Jimmy Dimly wasn’t convinced.The previous evening, Nigel Farage had said Gibraltar now felt a little less British. What a sad little world he lives in. Dicky Tice took up the mantle. Could a Spanish border guard turf out a Brit? Lammy smiled. If Dicky was stopped, he would be handed back to the Brits and flown home. After that, the Spanish could ask to have him extradited to Madrid. We can but hope.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesThe politics sketchInstitute for Fiscal StudiesEconomicsEconomic policyTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

But instead of clarity, there was more confusionThu 12 Jun 2025 11.04 EDTLast modified on Thu 12 Jun 2025 14.07 EDTShareIt’s almost two months now since the UKsupreme court rulingon what makes a woman in the eyes of the law, which was hailed as a turning point in the battle over transgender rights.Not long enough for wounds to heal, in other words, but long enough surely to hope for a bit more clarity about what this means for everyday life: which toilets trans people can use, what this means for your local women’s running club or gym, how employers can handle sensitive situations at work without outing or humiliating trans staff in front of colleagues and customers. But instead, the waters are getting muddier with every passing week.On Wednesday, Kishwer Falkner, now in the final five months of her term aschair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) watchdog,was grilled bythe women and equalities select committee about the detailed code of practice she is due to submit to ministers next month, translating the ruling into everyday life. Since years of turning this issue into a political football haven’t helped anyone, in an ideal world MPs could now leave it all in the hands of a trusted neutral arbiter, and resist the urge to meddle. Unfortunately, by the end of the hearing it was clear meddling may be urgently required.Within hours of the original supreme court ruling in April that “woman” means “biological woman” for the purpose of the Equality Act, and to the surprise of some lawyers, Lady Falkner had effectively pronounced inclusiveness dead. The EHRC issued interim guidance saying thattrans people should stop using the toilets, changing rooms or NHS wards of their preferred gender – though for trans men who look male enough to be potentially frightening to women in female spaces, that’s not straightforward – and only play on the grassroots sports teams of their birth sex. But is that really what the court intended? The former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption hasalready warnedof the risks of overinterpreting the ruling, arguing that he took it to confirm that single-sex services are entitled to exclude trans people, but not obliged to if they don’t want to. Falkner, however, is sticking to her guns.Suppose you wanted to start a women’s walking group, the Labour MP Rachel Taylorasked her, but you actively wanted to include trans women. Is that allowed? No, was the eventual answer: of course you can let your trans friend join, but then you’d be a mixed not single-sex group, and would have to also accept any man asking to join or risk getting sued. What the biological women in this group actually want – where they’d draw their own boundaries, or what feels right to them – is irrelevant on this reading, a position that may yet end up being tested in the courts.Why is there such a generational divide in views on sex and gender in Britain? | Susanna RustinRead moreHow any of this might be enforced in real life, meanwhile, seems vague at best. Asked how this imaginary walking group should check that every new member was definitely biologically female, Falkner suggested they might make a judgment on sight, but that nobody was going to be walking around with badges on policing it. Similarly on toilets, EHRC chief executive John Kirkpatrick told the committee that employers would need to provide facilities securing women’s privacy and dignity, but that what that meant would vary locally and could be worked out “on the basis of trust and openness and honesty”. With a large dollop of goodwill and forbearance on all sides, you can see how that might wash – except on this issue, there’s vanishingly little of either to be found.The most awkward question, meanwhile, is whether a battle-scarred veteran of the culture wars such as Falkner is now sufficiently trusted to write the peace settlement. Originally appointed by Liz Truss to shake up an organisation seen by the Tories as too close to Stonewall, Falkner survived both attempted mutiny inside her organisation and vicious personal abuse from outside, as she dragged it into line with what would later end up being the supreme court’s settled position: that trans women are not, in law, quite the same as biological women. She wouldn’t be human if she didn’t feel vindicated, and she was visibly emotional when the gender-critical MP Rosie Duffield (who has been through something similar) reminded her about the placards reading “the only good Terf [trans-exclusionary radical feminist] is a dead Terf” or when protesters in 2022dumped 60 bottlesof urine on her office doorstep.But the legacy of those brutal years is that, fairly or unfairly, many trans people no longer trust the EHRC to defend their rights (as it’s mandated to do for all protected groups). Falkner brushed off the committee’s questions about that, saying she didn’t see why people “should become so fearful” when they haven’t lost any rights (technically speaking, the court merely defined what the limits of those rights were). Yet where people do and don’t feel welcome in society is determined by social norms as well as rights, and the former have swung from one extreme to the other in recent years; you don’t have to disagree with the supreme court’s ruling to see how that could be wildly disorienting.Though Falkner suggested it would be “wise for space to be given to the regulator” to handle this – in other words, that parliament should back off – some Labour MPs are rapidly reaching the opposite view.A law that doesn’t work in real-life scenarios is a law that doesn’t work, full stop. On this evidence, parliament should prepare to roll up its sleeves.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It wasn’t all good news – JD Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy was also enjoying a surge in popularity and Trump was, of course, still about to be president. But Arendt’s famous 1951 work, The Origins of Totalitarianism,was sellingat 16 times its usual rate, which meant that by the time of the protests centred on the inauguration in January 2017, at least some of those people had read it.Arendt’s view of popular demonstrations was complicated. She wasn’t blind to the way authoritarian rulers use public protest as an excuse for a display of physical power, embodied in the police, which turns the state into an army against its people, altering that relationship. If it’s no longer government by consent, it’s rule by force, and they have the equipment. Yet “how many people here still believe”, she wrote of Germany in the 1930s, quoting the French activist David Rousset, “that a protest has even historic importance? This scepticism is the real masterpiece of the SS. Their great accomplishment. They have corrupted all human solidarity. Here the night has fallen on the future.” It’s an elegantly drawn lose-lose situation: if you lose the will to protest, you have been “morally murdered”, but if you don’t, you play into the tyrant’s hands.But theWomen’s Marches of January 2017didn’t spark police violence. Not a single arrest was made across the 2 million protesters gathered in New York, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle. Commentators wondered whether this was due to the essentially peaceable nature of women and their allies, while academics drew comparisons with the hundreds of arrests made during theFerguson uprisingof 2014 (which, of course, happened under President Obama). “Tanks and rubber bullets versus pussy-hats and high-fives” was how one scholar, Abby Harrington, described the contrast, making the case convincingly that protesters were treated differently on essentially racist grounds. It would be wrong, and actually quite sexist, to say that the women weren’t considered worthy of violent suppression because they didn’t seem serious enough. It would be wrong, too, to say that they made no impact – they were enormous, dispersed across 408 places in the US, rallying bysome estimatesmore than 4 million Americans, and spawning protests in solidarity across seven continents, including one in Antarctica.The demand was very broad and consequently pretty loose, however: protesters wanted “vibrant and diverse communities” recognised as “the strength of our country”. They wanted reproductive rights and tolerance and protection from violence; mutual respect; racial equality; gender equality; workers’ rights – it was a call for decency, to which the leader felt no need to respond, almost by definition, since he is not decent.Trump is waging war against his own citizens in Los Angeles | Judith LevineRead moreThe recentUS protestswere sparked last Friday at about 9am, as border patrol agents massed outside a Home Depot in Paramount, a predominantly Latino area in Los Angeles. An assembly member, José Luis Solache Jr, happened to be driving past, so stopped and posted the scenes, which looked chillingly militaristic even days before the arrival of the national guard. Protesters started to arrive, not in huge numbers but with a vast purpose – to prevent what looked like an immigration raid of people trying to do their jobs. It came on the back of the arrest of a senior union official in the Fashion District, and one fatherarrestedin front of his eight-year-old son. The message, when border guards sweep a workplace or a courtroom where people are doing regular immigration check-ins, is quite plain: this isn’t about deporting hardened criminals.The protestrs’ demand was correlatively plain: don’t arrest our friends, neighbours or colleagues, when they pose no danger to anyone. Since then,700 marines have been deployedto the city, and the number of national guards doubled to 4,000. The situation recalls Arendt’s later work, On Violence, in which she argues that power and violence are actually opposites – the state creates tinderbox situations when it has lost the expectation of public compliance. So if the protests were symbolic, they would be playing into the government’s hands: an abstract resistance creating justification for concrete suppression. But the protests are not symbolic – the alternative to protesting against a raid by border guards is to let the raid go ahead and lose those neighbours.The Russian-American columnist and author M Gessen cites a distinction made in political science between faith, where you believe that justice will simply prevail, and hope, where you observe and participate. Gessen wrote in the New York Times: “You can’t take action without hope, but you also can’t have hope without taking action.” Everyone has a line over which they’d be spurred to action – there’s no one who wouldn’t lie down in front of the government van if their child were kidnapped and put inside it by masked men. So the real art of the autocratic state is not just to weaken protective institutions, but also to foster the conditions of fear and hopelessness ahead of a critical mass finding its hard limit. It’s not clear, yet, whether the repression is a deliberate spectacle in order to create that fear, or whether, conversely, it’s the accidental creation of conditions that demand action.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Likethis photographthatElon Musktweeted on Sunday: a shirtless protester wielding the Tricolor atop a vandalized robotaxi as flames billow toward the weak sunlight backlighting the flag. His dark curls fall to his bare shoulders. He stares into the camera.Frankly, the image belongs in a museum.I understand my reaction is not the feeling Republicans hope to inspire in Americans broadly this week. Their messaging thus far aboutthe protests against immigration raidsin Latino communities has largely been alarmist – proof,they say, of an “invasion” of “illegal aliens”.“Look at all the foreign flags. Los Angeles is occupied territory,”said Stephen Milleron X. According to Adam Kinzinger, a former congressman and more moderate voice, the Mexican flags carried by protesters are “terrible … and feeding right into Donald Trump’s narrative”.“I just think that it would be much stronger if they were carrying American flags only,” he said on CNN this week.By this logic, Mexican flags are proof-positive that Mexican Americans are notreallyAmerican; that we are somehow collaborating on a planned “invasion”; that we harbor secret loyalties to Mexico; that we’re here to displace white people and undermine the American way of life via somePlan de Aztlan. In short, none of this is true.View image in fullscreenProtesters hold Mexican flags as cars burn during protests sparked by immigration raids in Los Angeles, California on Sunday.Photograph: Caroline Brehman/EPAIn front of Congress Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, cited the presence of “flags from foreign countries” in LA to legitimize supporting Trump’s deployment of the national guard. Thisunilateral invocation of Title 10by the Trump administration, without the consent of the governor, is exceedinglyaggressive. So is the deployment of700 US marinesto be used to crush American protest in an American city.The subtext here is that bymany metrics, Americans’ patience for Ice and its antics is wearing thin, even as Ice’s deportation numbers areanemiccompared with past administrations. The Trump administration realizes something has to change. Fanning outrage about a flag is both a legal pretext to pursue martial law and a diplomatic means of getting consent from the American populace to do unpopular things in the name of security.But what is it about the Mexican flag that triggers so many people?I’d argue that in the American context, the Mexican flag is not a nationalist symbol but something decentered from Mexico as a nation-state. Historically, it was a key banner of the Chicano movement,flownby supporters surrounding Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez during the California grape boycott in the 1960s. It flew alongside the United Farm Workers flag, the American flag and banners of the Virgen de Guadalupe as a means of fomenting cultural unity. It also served as a reminder of a fundamental truth: we are from here; we are also from there. We’re children of the in-between, or what the Tejana writer Gloria Anzaldúa referred to asnepantlain her seminal work Borderlands/La Frontera. Nepantla is simply Nahuatl for the liminal space between cultures, identities and worlds. To this end, we might think of the Mexican flag as a symbol of double-consciousness in the Mexican American psyche specifically. We understand our middleness, yet we also understand how America sees and defines us: Mexicans. We take that prejudice and transform it into power.Amidst these burgeoning protests, the Mexican flag is a bold articulation: we are like you; you are like usIt’s through this lens that I see the Mexican flag as just one banner among many, a remembrance of roots but also a shared experience between Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants alike. Night after night, you can see captivating scenes with Mexican flags flying in the downtowns of Dallas and Houston and Atlanta and New York, as a solidarity grows between those explicitly targeted by Ice and those soon-to-be targeted by Ice. This is not hyperbole. Today, phenotype and politics are grounds enough for detention: in order for Ice to meet the Trump administration’s goal of 3,000 arrests a day, targetshave increasingly includedstudent protesters, tourists and even American citizens. The only rule is to meet the metric at all costs.Amid these burgeoning protests, the Mexican flag is a bold articulation: we are like you; you are like us. We have struggled and persist in this place together. See me and don’t be afraid; I see you and I am not afraid. To wield the flag amid a protest is to paint yourself a target, to take both your body and your future into your own hands. This is precisely why the marines have been called in. To intimidate these bodies. Or to destroy them.What Trump fails to realize is that the bones of Mexican people are the metadata of the land in California and indeed the rest of the country. Our place here is in the food, in the street names, in the name of Los Angeles itself.Already, I can hear some within my own community admonishing my defense of Mexican flags at American protests as treasonous or ungrateful or something along those lines. To them I might ask: why is it that the protesters’ allegiances are held to higher standards than an American president who seeks to turn the US armed forces against American citizens?From Republican leaders, ​you’ll never hear such questioning rhetoric surrounding other foreign flags that fly prominently in America. The Irish flag on St Patrick’s Day instantly comes to mind. As does the Israeli flag at both political and non-political events. And, of course, the Confederate flag, though white supremacists have explicitly stated goals of both overthrowing the US government and taking back US land. Heritage is the most commonly used defense. Though wouldn’t heritage apply to the Mexican flag as well?View image in fullscreenWomen in traditional Mexican dress participate in a protest against federal immigration sweeps, in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday.Photograph: David Swanson/ReutersI’m reminded of James Baldwin when Mexicans Americans and Mexicans call for restraint from using Mexican imagery in US protests: “In Harlem,” Baldwin wrote, “… the Negro policemen are feared more than whites, for they have more to prove and fewer ways to prove it.” We think our respectability will protect us. But we know historically and empirically that has not been true. Respectability did not protect Japanese Americans frombeing interned. Nor did it protect Vietnamese veterans who fought alongside Americans in Vietnam from facing discrimination in the US. Nor did it protect Afghan translators from having theirvisas revoked.Our American bona fides are not the things that will save us now. Not in the era of detention metrics and collateral targeting and now the prospect of authoritarian violence.It should be said: I don’t go looking for these images. For my sins, having clicked on one, the algorithm floods me with them now. Protesters with Mexican flags getting a haircut in front of police. Protesters with Mexican flags forming a human chain. They just keep coming to me. But other images, too. Likeoneof a guy popping a wheelie past a ton of burning Waymo cars. I mean, come the fuck on – it’s cool. The thing that immediately jumps out to me is the frivolity of the image. A body perfectly in balance, perfectly in motion. It moves of its own volition. It is completely in command of its trajectory and space in the landscape.It is beyond the fascist impulse to live so beautifully as this. Luckily, it also is beyond the fascist ability to remove the memory of this body from the land.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsOpinionTrump administrationMexicoUS politicsElon MuskProtestDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

He was formerly West Midlands cycling and walking commissioner under mayor Andy StreetThu 12 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 12 Jun 2025 09.07 EDTShareThis week, the UK government announced its plans to fast-track driverless vehicle trials in the UK. One of the key companies involved noted that London presents a significant challenge: “It hasseven timesmore jaywalkers than San Francisco.” There’s more than one problem with that statement – and it encapsulates so much of what’s already going wrong in the adoption of driverless cars.For a start, “jaywalking” isn’t even a thing in the UK. We thankfully have no such concept or offence. Unlike in many US cities, pedestrians here are free to cross the road wherever they see fit. And thank goodness for that.The term “jaywalker” was invented in the 1920s by the US motor industry, and it reveals a lot about its attitude to pedestrians. “Jay” was a derogatory term at the time, meaning bumpkin or idiot. The term “jaywalker” was deliberately crafted to stigmatise people walking in the street and it was part of a wider campaign to shift blame for rising road deaths away from cars and drivers, and on to pedestrians themselves.At the time, streets were shared spaces. Pedestrians, cyclists, children playing, street vendors and public transport all coexisted in the road. The car, when it arrived, disrupted that balance, often violently. Faced with growing public anger at the dangers posed by car drivers, the motor industry fought back. Through lobbying, media manipulation and pressure on lawmakers, it successfully reframed the public street as a space primarily for motor vehicles.The campaign was so successful that jaywalking became a criminal offence in many cities. And in many, it still is today. Jaywalking laws have been shown to disproportionately affect marginalised communities. Data collected under the CaliforniaRacial and Identity Profiling Actrevealed that black people are stopped 4.5 times more often for jaywalking than white people.We’re still living with the consequences of the culture created by a system designed to get pedestrians out of the way. And so, when the CEO of a tech company building self-driving cars uses the word “jaywalker” as an obstacle to be overcome, it’s worthy of attention. It suggests that pedestrians are still a problem to be controlled, predicted or designed out. That human behaviour, rather than dangerous vehicles, is a bug that we need to fix.Unlike human drivers, AVs thrive on strict rules, structured environments and predictable behaviour. The messiness of human movement is challenging and a threat to AV adoption. That’s why “jaywalkers” are flagged as an operational challenge, because autonomous systems can’t easily deal with real people doing ordinary things. The risk is that instead of adapting cars to people, we’ll yet again redesign streets to suit machines.I’m not anti-technology. I’d welcome the chance to use an autonomous vehicle for long trips where public transport isn’t an option. I also find driving, frankly, quite boring and tiring. Done right, self-driving cars could plausibly offer a safer, lower-carbon alternative to private car ownership. But only if they are developed in a way that respects people and cities rather than trying to bend both to meet the limits of the technology.The real danger is that we repeat history. The rollout of driverless vehicles must not be an excuse to further diminish the role of the pedestrian in urban life. The streets of the 20th century were reshaped to suit cars, often at enormous social cost. Entire communities were disrupted. Children lost the ability to roam. People stopped walking. Air pollution soared. A sense of community was lost. Road deaths, particularly among the most vulnerable, became normalised. Today, too many of our streets remain hostile, noisy and dangerous.If we want driverless technology to succeed it must be made to serve society, not the other way round. That means recognising that unpredictability isn’t a bug in the system, but part of what makes cities human. And it means resisting any attempt to reframe basic human behaviour, like crossing the street, as a problem in need of control.While a UK jaywalking law is hopefully far fetched, there’s nothing to prevent the gradual restriction of pedestrian movement through street design. After all, there is a lot of money to be made in prioritising the take-up of autonomous vehicles, so it will be tempting for companies to try to tackle anything that gets in their way.According to the government, autonomous vehicles could create 38,000 jobs and contribute£42bn to the UK economy by 2035. That’s not insignificant. But if they do so by reinforcing a worldview where streets are for machines and people must behave or be punished, we’ve learned nothing.So if the trials ever begin, we have a choice to make. We can allow history to repeat itself, and powerful interests to shape our streets in one way. Or we can take a different path – one where we very clearly remember that cities are places where walking, cycling and public transport should be prioritised. It means ensuring that safety, equity and public space are not traded in the name of innovation.Driverless vehicles may still help us solve some real transport problems. But if they come at the cost of our freedom to walk across the street, then we’re solving the wrong ones.Adam Tranter is the co-host of theStreets Aheadpodcast.

His accent was as heavy as his helmet and his words were getting lost in it. At the flats where I live, you’re never more than five minutes away from a weary rider like this turning up bearing someone’s tea, dinner, breakfast, lunch, snack, whatever. They’re not usually there for me, but it has been known.As I parked near the entrance, I saw him hand over his goods to a neighbour, but, unusually, he seemed in no hurry to speed off. He stood there looking up at something, before getting back on his moped and making to leave. But then he looked up again, thought better of leaving and got back off his moped. It was then that he came over to me saying words I couldn’t quite catch. He pointed up at the tree we were standing beneath and then I heard him properly, saying: “Please, if I pick cherry, is that OK?”I found the world’s worst bread recipe – and I love it | Adrian ChilesRead moreIt was sweet of him to ask, not that the fruit of this improbably tall cherry tree is within my gift. It just happens to stand outside my block, so presumably belongs to all of us living there. Either way, I would have needed a heart of stone to have refused him, standing there hot and bothered and tired next to his moped, doubtless freighted with impatiently awaited burgers, chicken, noodles or some such stashed in the box on the back. All that fodder, prepared with varying levels of haste and care, brought here by him, part of an IT miracle in the shape of some app, generating percentages for corporations in far-off places of which we know and understand little. And all the carrier of this cargo wanted was a handful of cherries.I watched him stretching up with difficulty, trying to reach some low-hanging fruit. The dissonance in the scene was astounding. I ran in to get him a stepladder, but when I looked out of the window I saw him riding away. I hope he had some cherries in his pockets.Adrian Chiles is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGig economyOpinionFruitcommentShareReuse this content"

The government is wrong in attacking Harvard, but so is Harvard in its defense.We are part of a group of 27 Jewish scholars of Jewish studies who have filed anamicus briefinHarvard’s lawsuit against the Trump administration. We submitted the brief, drafted by the civil rights attorneyYaman Salahi, because we support the university’s fight against government overreach. Yet in doing so, the institution has committed a different kind of discrimination – one that violates federal civil rights law. We reject Harvard’s troubling assumption that being Jewish necessitates supporting Israel, or that criticism of Israel’s genocide in Gaza constitutes antisemitism.Harvard’s claims about campus antisemitism don’t only misrepresent Jewish diversity – they violateTitle VI of the Civil Rights Actby subjecting Jews to harmful stereotypes about what constitutes “authentic” Jewish identity.Harvard’s owncomplaint and legal filingsperpetuate a pernicious fiction: that protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza stem from prejudice against Jewish students rather than moral opposition to the systematic destruction of Palestinian life. This narrative relies on three false assumptions: that Jewish communities hold monolithic pro-Israel views, that Jewish students cannot tolerate different perspectives on Israel-Palestine, and that exposure to criticism of Israel constitutes a civil rights injury.These assumptions aren’t just empirically wrong – they’re legally dangerous. As the US supreme court established inStudents for Fair Admissions, universities cannot operate on the “belief that minority students always express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue”. The court explicitly rejected “impermissible racial stereotypes” that assume all “members of the same racial group think alike”.The same principle applies when universities assume all Jewish people share identical views aboutIsraeland Zionism. When Harvard treats criticisms of Israeli violence as antisemitism or of Israel as a state for Jews above the other people who live there, it reduces Jewish identity to a political litmus test – one that erases the rich diversity of Jewish thought and experience.This erasure has real consequences for Jewish students and faculty who don’t conform to Harvard’s preferred stereotype. Consider Professor Atalia Omer, one of our co-signers and a Jewish Israeli academic who previously taught at Harvard Divinity School. Harvard’s antisemitism taskforce identified her courses on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as contributing to campus hostility – despite the fact that she designed these courses as a Jewish scholar exploring the complexity of the region through multiple perspectives.AsProfessor Omer wrote: Harvard’s report “attempts to redraw the boundaries of Jewish legitimacy”and effectively declared her “the wrong kind of Jew” – a determination that no educational institution should have the power to make.This experience reflects a broader pattern affecting Jewish students and faculty. Harvard recognizes student organizations such asTzedek(Hebrew for justice), which is “a home on campus for a liberatory approach to Judaism” and “anti-Zionist, non-Zionist, and Zionist-questioning Jewish students”. Similarly, theHarvard Forward-Thinking Jewish Unionexists because some Jewish students felt they were not allowed to question Zionism in pre-existing Jewish campus spaces.These students and scholars aren’t marginal voices.Recent pollingshows that nearly one-third of Jewish Americans agree that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and more than half support withholding arms shipments to Israel. A2020 Pew Research surveyfound that only 45% of Jewish Americans consider “caring about Israel” essential to their Jewish identity.Harvard’s approach doesn’t just erase Jewish diversity – it actively harms Jewish students who don’t conform to expected political views. Administratorstried to stop a Passover sederorganized by anti-Zionist Jewish students, treating their religious observance as inherently problematic because of their political views. Jewish students report facing discipline for passive acts of solidarity like placing protest stickers on laptops while studying in university libraries. In this, Harvard is no outlier, as dissidentJewish students and facultyaround the country have been targeted along with their Palestinian and Muslim fellows.This discriminatory treatment stems from Harvard’s misguided adoption of theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which conflates criticism of Israel with prejudice against Jewish people.This isn’t just bad policy – it’s illegal discrimination under Title VI. As the Israeli law professorsItamar Mann and Lihi Yona argue, when Jewish employees or students are told they have “betrayed their own race” or are “not acting Jewish enough” by supporting Palestinian rights, they face discrimination based on their failure to conform to ethnic stereotypes.The supreme courtestablishedthat employers cannot discriminate against workers for failing to conform to stereotypes about their protected characteristics. The same principle must protect Jewish students, staff and faculty from being punished for holding “the wrong” political views about Israel.We support Harvard’s legal challenge to federal overreach, but we reject the university’s characterization of its own censorship as necessary protection for Jewish students. Many of the students facing discipline and marginalization are themselves Jewish. They don’t need protection from their own political views – they need protection from institutions that would force them to choose between their Jewish identity and their political conscience.Universities must stop policing the boundaries of Jewish legitimacy and start respecting Jewish agency. Jews are capable of forming their own views about Israel, Palestine and everything else. We don’t need institutions to tell us what we must believe to be authentically Jewish.As Jewish scholars who have devoted our lives to the study of Jewish issues and ideas that include a commitment to intellectual freedom and human dignity, we call on Harvard and other universities to abandon their efforts to enforce political orthodoxy in Jewish communities. Stop erasing Jewish voices that don’t conform to your preferred narrative. Stop treating criticism of genocide as antisemitism. And start treating Jewish people as complex individuals capable of thinking for themselves.Our Jewish identity is not conditional on support for any government’s policies. Our commitment to justice is not separate from our Jewishness or from Jewish history – it flows directly from it. Universities that claim to protect us while silencing our voices have fundamentally misunderstood both antisemitism and Jewish identity itself.Barry Trachtenberg, Victor Silverman, Atalia Omer, Raz Segaland Rebecca TAlpertThe authors are among 27 Jewish scholars of Jewish studies who filed an amicus brief in Harvard’s federal lawsuitExplore more on these topicsRaceOpinionHarvard UniversityAntisemitismTrump administrationGazaIsraelcommentShareReuse this content"

However, the UK’s simultaneous 52% to 48% leave vote meant Gibraltarians were denied their own will. As the only British overseas territory sharing a land frontier with the EU’s border-free Schengen travel area, and as the focus of a territorial dispute with Spain dating from 1713, this change threatened Gibraltar’s position with a new impasse. The economy of the Rock, heavily dependent on the 15,000 mainly low-wage Spanish residents who routinely cross the border to work there each day, faced an existential danger.Since 2016, officials from Gibraltar, Britain, Spain and the EU have intermittently attempted to resolve the problems. For years, the process was glacial, and occasionally petulant. In Boris Johnson’s rush to leave the EU, the issue was simply ignored. As recently as 2023, a hard border between Gibraltar and Spainwas saidto be unavoidable. This week, however,a much better dealwas finally sorted. Though the detailed text has yet to be published, it appears to offer the kind of frictionless border crossing on which Gibraltar and the surrounding area depend, as well as being emblematic of the pragmatic reset with Europe being pursued by Sir Keir Starmer’s government.The core of Wednesday’s agreement is for dual passport checks – British and Spanish – on travellers arriving at Gibraltar airport. These will be similar to the British-French checks that have long been familiar for Eurostar train passengers. There will then be no checks on people and goods crossing the land border with Spain, making Gibraltar effectively part of the Schengen area. In addition, Gibraltar’s VAT-free fiscal regimewill end. UK sovereignty over Gibraltar is unchanged, as is Spain’s claim to it. The autonomy of Britain’s military and naval bases is not affected.The foreign secretary, David Lammy, exaggerated when hesaidon Thursday in the Commons that the agreement solves “the last major unresolved issue from our decision to leave the EU”. That is surely wishful thinking. Nevertheless, Mr Lammy’s problem-solving approach has helped make the deal possible. The agreement is good for the Gibraltar economy, good for UK-EU relations and good for Britain’s relations with Spain, whose robust economicgrowthrate Rachel Reeves can only dream ofmatching.The UK’s change of government has also made a quiet difference on the opposition benches. Even towards the fag end of the Tory years, obsessive pro-Brexit MPs would still mountindignant campaignsagainst the, to them, horrifying thought that a Tory foreign secretary, David Cameron, might be prepared to allow Spanish passport checks at Gibraltar airport. There was no echo of that in the Commons on Thursday. Even the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, gave the deal a broadly bipartisan response.Ms Patel also made an important point that deserves wider support. The deal will eventually become a draft treaty. When that happens, MPs should be able to debate and vote on it. This does not automatically happen, even now, with UK treaties. Parliament can only examine them under limited powers codified ina 2010 law.This law no longer measures up to the national importance of treaties in the post-Brexit era. On Thursday, the foreign affairs committee chair, Emily Thornberry, rightly described this system as rubbish. Mr Lammy should waste no more time. Parliamentary scrutiny of treaties should be brought into the 21st century.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A new deal is urgently neededEditorialDiplomacy can do more to slow Tehran’s alarming progress than threats from IsraelThu 12 Jun 2025 14.12 EDTLast modified on Thu 12 Jun 2025 19.54 EDTShareAyear into his first term, Donald Trumppulled the US outof the hard-won international deal that hadslowed Iran’sadvance towards nuclear weapons, and imposed punishing sanctions. Europe tried to keep the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) on life support. But the strangling of Iran’s economy, and the US assassination of Qassem Suleimani, the powerful head of its Quds force, undermined the country’s moderates and the progress on non-proliferation.The fallout of Mr Trump’s Iran policy is still becoming evident. On Thursday, the UN nuclear watchdog found, for the first time in two decades, that Tehran wasnot in compliancewith the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Iran vowed to “significantly” increase production of enriched uranium in retaliation, following a pattern of escalation in response to International Atomic Energy Agency criticism. US and European officials say that Israelappears readyto strike its adversary’s nuclear facilities. Fear of the consequences reportedly drove the US decisionto withdraw non-essential diplomatic personnelfrom Iraq, Bahrain and Kuwait.There isvery good reason to be scepticalabout an attack. Israel has prepared for strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities before and drawn back. Without US help, suggest many analysts, it could not destroy them and might instead spur Iran into rushing for the bomb, as well as retaliating by other means. Talking up an attack might be intended to draw Mr Trump in, though the US president does not look cooperative. He wrongfooted Benjamin Netanyahu in April when, sitting beside the Israeli prime minister, he announced US talks with Iran. Thepresident’s remarkon Thursday that an Israeli strike “could very well happen soon” sounded mostly like it was intended to push Iran towards concessions in the next round of discussions,due to be held in Omanthis weekend.Yet progress has been limited, and if things go badly this time there is cause to be concerned. Mr Netanyahu is clinging to office with increasing desperation. All eyes are on Israel’s slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza, but the prime minister talks of war “on seven fronts”: strikes in Syria andLebanoncontinue.Last year, Israel decapitated not only Hamas but, critically, Hezbollah and – when Tehranretaliatedwith a missile attack –hit Iranian military targets. It may believe that it can now cause maximum damage to an existential threat at minimal cost to its forces – and that the window will soon close, as Iran reconstructs its air defences and its nuclear programme rapidly advances.But Steve Witkoff, the US Middle East envoy, hasreportedlytold Republican senators that Israeli defences could be overwhelmed by Iranian retaliation. Allies must make clear to Mr Netanyahu their absolute opposition to a reckless move that would further imperil the region.Iran’s alarming progress is part of agrim picture of nuclear proliferationinternationally. The immediate priority must be ensuring that Israel pulls back from the brink again. But the real prize would be a nuclear deal with Iran. Mr Trump claims one is “fairly close”, but has demanded an end to enrichment. Tehran is only likely to agree to limiting nuclear progress – the kind of deal Mr Trump walked away from, but which could perhaps be repackaged for him as a bold new accord by a master negotiator.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "Content": "Sushi at Fujiyama in Karachi. Photograph: Noorulain AliOnce upon a time, Pakistanis scorned raw fish. Now sushi is everywhere from Ramadan meals to wedding buffets – and it all started with one man and a dreamBySanam MaherThu 12 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareWhen the 17-storey Avari Towers opened in Karachi in April 1985, it was the tallest hotel in the city. “It felt otherworldly,” said one chef who worked there as a teenager. “It was there that I saw a swimming pool for the first time,” he remembered, “and swimsuits.” By December 1986, this $32m building had another novelty to offer – Fujiyama, a Japanese restaurant at its summit. There had been no advertisements for Fujiyama, and for its first six weeks, the only way to get in was with an invitation; these began to land in the homes and offices of the city’s bankers, businessmen, doctors and other members of Karachi’s elite. By the new year, the restaurant was so busy it had waiting lists. There were now two kinds of people in the city of 6 million: those who had tried sushi and those who had not.In the late 80s, a Japanese restaurant like Fujiyama was an expensive proposition: foreign chefs had to be hired, staff trained, and ingredients, from wasabi to rice, constantly imported. Sushi – raw fish – in a country where daal roti is a staple and vegetables are often cooked down until they lose their crunch: who would take such a risk? And yet, somehow, it paid off. Fujiyama was the first place to serve Japanese cuisine inPakistan, and it was where many Pakistanis encountered sushi for the first time.Today, you can finish your day of fasting during Ramadan at a sushi buffet or host a wedding reception for a small (by Pakistani standards) gathering of 100 or more at a Japanese restaurant. When restaurants closed during the pandemic, waiters zipped across the city on motorbikes to deliver sushi. In May 2022, the cash-strapped government attempted to impose a ban on the import of “luxury items” to Pakistan – including Norwegian salmon and nori from Dubai – but the finance minister later had to admit that “even though we had the ban … you could still find salmon and sushi in restaurants”.While much of it may not be good – with gummy rice or chalky, bland wasabi – it’s clear today that Pakistanis want sushi. It is on the menus of fine dining restaurants in hotels, and in the many pan-Asian restaurants that have mushroomed across Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad. By the time I encountered “chapli sushi” (a chapli kebab and cucumber maki roll) at a restaurant in Lahore, I wondered: how did we get here?To understand the risks associated with bringing an expensive novelty like sushi to Pakistan, you have to understand the men of the Avari family. They were entrepreneurs – hustlers, really – of a kind we rarely see in present-day Pakistan.Byram Avari – “Baba” to employees of the Avari hotel chain and Fujiyama – lived by the same simple edicts as his father, Dinshaw. A Zoroastrian migrant from Bombay, Dinshaw moved to Karachi as an insurance agent in 1929. “Rules are made for fools, and donkeys and mules, and children in schools,” Dinshaw liked to say.Who makes the rules? You and I. Who can amend the rules? You and I.Byram and Goshpi Avari on holiday in Hong Kong.Photograph: Sanam MaherIn 1945, Dinshaw bought Karachi’s Bristol Hotel, which had until then been under the private management of Englishmen. However, as soon as the sale went through, the hotel was requisitioned by the army. Dinshaw approached the revenue commissioner, Sir Sidney Ridley, a friend from the Rotary Club, to intervene. Dinshaw wanted his hotel back – he had used all his savings and borrowed money to pay the purchase price. “How can a bloody Indian run an English hotel?” the provost marshal asked Sir Sidney. However, when Dinshaw said that he would reduce charges for lodging, the hotel was derequisitioned.Who can amend the rules?Dinshaw was clever: he reduced the rates but doubled the charge for one peg of whiskey, then paid a sergeant commission for each soldier sent to stay at the Bristol. Rooms were filled with up to six soldiers at a time. When Dinshaw saw that soldiers were stealing his imported crockery and ashtrays as souvenirs, he stamped them with “Stolen from the Bristol Hotel” and put them up for sale. They were a hit.In 1947, right before India was partitioned, Dinshaw stood on Chinna Creek in Karachi and imagined a waterfront resort hotel on its marshy sands. At a reception for Lord Mountbatten in the days before partition, the then-chief minister of Sindh, Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, introduced Dinshaw to the viceroy thus: “Excellency, please meet the madman who wants to build a hotel where even the dogs won’t go, and who will later commit suicide in the creek next to it.”But Dinshaw knew what he was doing. In the decades that followed Pakistan’s independence, the Beach Luxury Hotel became the place of New Year’s Eve balls, garden dinners and, by 1962, a nightclub named 007 in homage to the newly released Dr No. In certain quarters, a whiff of disapproval lingered over each of Dinshaw’s new schemes. When he introduced buffet-style meals for guests, some papers wrote that he was making people eat like cattle. But, as Dinshaw, and later, his son Byram, would say: “A leader leads the pack.” These edicts guided the Avari men as they took chances. They believed their ideas would catch on.View image in fullscreenAn advert for the Avari Towers hotel in Karachi.Photograph: Sanam MaherThis is why, when Byram found himself mesmerised by a chef’s theatrics at Benihana, a Japanese restaurant in Hawaii, in 1986, he trusted his intuition. A similar restaurant at the top of the new Avari Hotel would be a great draw, he thought. As Byram’s teenage son Xerxes watched every flipped shrimp and silver flash of a knife, he said, with delight: “It’s Japanese kat-a-kat!” (Kat-a-kat is a dish made of offal, and the name comes from the sound that two blades make on the griddle as the meat is diced up and cooked.)Even so, common sense dictated that raw fish would never be accepted in Pakistan – even Xerxes shrank away from the nigiri at Benihana. But Byram was determined. He travelled with his wife, Goshpi, to Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong, where they ordered Japanese food for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day.Over time, Byram’s notebook filled with names of dishes and notes on their presentation. “I was very excited,” he said to me in 2022, “and more than that, my father was very excited and very happy.” There was no doubt in the pair’s minds that this would succeed, because they knew what they were promising their customers: something to brag about. “Whenever we held French or Belgian food festivals at the Beach Luxury or the Avari Hotel, we would get quite a crowd,” Byram explained. And it didn’t matter that customers may not have been familiar with the food. “You see, they wanted to say: ‘I went to the Avari for some French food.’ It was a status symbol. A fancy thing to do.”Byram poached a Japanese chef, Keni Hara, from a hotel in Dubai, and an interior decorating firm in Bangkok was hired to design the space. There were three teppanyaki counters, and the restaurant was intimate and dimly lit, keeping the city’s harsh sunlight out. A private dining room with curtains offered discretion. Waiters were hired and training commenced at the Avari Towers. “The chef’s wife, who we called Momo, taught us,” recalled Vincent Francis Rodrigues, one of the waiters at the time. “We learned aboutojigi– bowing – and how to hold chopsticks, so we could show the guests.” The chopsticks had a little fixture at the top so they were as easy to use as tongs.The servers had to try the food so they could guide guests. Chef Keni offered sashimi. Some of the waiters refused to eat the raw fish. Rodrigues had never tasted anything like it. His Goan family regularly made prawn curries or fried surmai; white and black pomfret; mackerel and sole. But this? It was at once salty and a little sweet, a soft yet yielding bite that made his eyes water.Chef Arshad Mehmood, now 47, started his career as a 16-year-old banquet waiter at the Avari. On his first day in the Pakistani banquet kitchens, he was given 40kg of onions to dice. When he was moved to the Fujiyama kitchens, he was carving rosettes with cucumbers and carrots. He saw a pink fish – salmon – for the first time. Why give that up? When Chef Keni insisted he eat tuna sashimi, Mehmood closed his eyes, said a prayer, and put it in his mouth. Mehmood showed me the sketches he made as he learned to plate meals. He matched the Japanese names of dishes to Urdu words to remember them: teriyaki wastarri, the gleam of the sauce like the film of oil skimming a curry.View image in fullscreenChef Arshad Mehmood, once of Fujiyama and now at Izakaya.Photograph: Noorulain AliDespite the high prices, the restaurant was often booked out once it opened to the public in January 1987. Fujiyama’s windows looked out on to the great expanse of the city, but Karachi’s noise and heat and crowds were a world away. In this room, you would learn that a sliver of sheer pink ginger cleansed your palate so you could appreciate the difference between the Norwegian salmon and the sweet crab. Byram found that people sitting in the private dining room would request for the curtains to be opened so they could “see and be seen”.“If you can’t go to Fujiyama, you can’t talk sushi and wasabi and gyoza,” said Ayaz Khan, who worked as a food and beverages manager at Avari Towers a decade after Fujiyama opened, and is now the proprietor of Okra, one of Pakistan’s best restaurants. A demand had been created.A leader leads the pack.In the 38 years since Fujiyama opened, sushi has gradually gained popularity and adapted to Pakistani culture. Back in 2001, when Chef June Gallo joined Sakura, one of the top Japanese restaurants in Karachi, he found that staff were throwing away salmon roe, bought for £140-160 a kilo, because it expired before any customers ever ordered it. They did not know what it was. The chef who had previously run the kitchen had diligently recreated the simple, fresh flavours he encountered during his training in Japan. But customers complained that the food was bland. When that chef resigned, Chef June began to experiment. He tempered everything with red chilli powder, sugar syrups, soy, Tabasco and togarashi. Octopus and lobster were taken off the menu. In just three months, Sakura went from 40 covers a night to 60, and then up to 180.Today, customers in Pakistan’s major cities do not have to visit fine-dining restaurants in hotels to get sushi. While we don’t have the grab-n-go maki of convenience stores or the bright plates of nigiri rolling by at sushi train restaurants, the chefs at upscale sushi restaurants – most of them Filipino – have taken recipes with them as they move from one establishment to another. This means that the garlic rice you pay 1,290 Pakistani rupees (roughly £3.70) for at Sakura can now be eaten for Rs620 (£1.80) at Cocochan, a pan-Asian restaurant in Karachi. The difference is the quality of ingredients (is the wasabi from Japan, or is it a powder from Dubai?).View image in fullscreenA sushi chef at Fujiyama in Karachi, 1995.Photograph: Sanam MaherSome spots even try to lure customers with novel experiences: is your sushi brought to your table, or does it arrive – as at the Karachi-based restaurant Nori – on a “sushi boat”, bobbing along a makeshift river? At Chop Chop Wok, a chain of restaurants modelled on Wagamama (down to the menu’s design), the salmon nigiri and sashimi are the priciest dishes on offer, and sushi will often be ordered as a side dish alongside the popular Korean fried chicken or crispy beef with broccoli.As sushi has become ubiquitous at mid-tier restaurants in Pakistan, high-end ones are seeking new ways to maintain its allure. The fine-dining restaurant Izakaya caters to the kind of customer Fujiyama may have attracted in 1987: moneyed, and seeking experiences that make for good cocktail-party stories. The restaurant, which opened in 2022, is all marble floors and designer furniture, with pieces from Art Basel and Japan. Each of the six rooms follows a theme. There’s the Shah Room with a baroque chandelier hanging low over the table, while the secret Polo Lounge reveals itself behind a bookshelf. Each room has a dedicated server, private music system, butler and chef. Among customers here, eye-watering prices are welcomed. Anyone can pay Rs4,700 (£14) for nine pieces of salmon nigiri at a pan-Asian restaurant; only a select few can drop Rs36,000 (£103) for the 20-course “experience” at Izakaya’s omakase bar.Izakaya’s proprietor, Mustafa Sardar, is the grandson of the singer Madam Noor Jehan, one of the most famous singers and actors in Pakistan after Partition, beloved as the “Queen of Melody”. He is also a graduate of Le Cordon Bleu. When we met, Sardar was dressed in a pristine cream shalwar kameez and black Hermès sliders. Izakaya is located in a residential neighbourhood, and there is no sign outside. A house across the street displays angry signs reminding people that commercial activity is not allowed in such a neighbourhood. But if you know the right people and have enough money, a sign is easy enough to ignore.At Izakaya, the food is secondary. “[Of] the people that have the money to come here, 95% of them don’t know what a Michelin star is,” Sardar said. He has served truffle foam only to have customers query,“Ye jhaag kya hai?” (“What is this foam?”) Give them tuna sashimi and they say, “Thora saa jalaa do” (“Char it a bit”). I asked Mustafa if this was frustrating. “I miss being around people who like food,” he said. “But I like money. You want fried rice? I don’t give a shit. I’ll make you fried rice.”I asked about Sardar’s earliest encounters with Japanese food. As a teenager, he would visit Sakura after school to have lunch before tuitions. “I’m hella spoiled,” he said. As a freshman at college in the US, he flew to Mykonos for a break and encountered “food theatre” at Nammos, the luxury beach club and restaurant. There was drama to the whole thing: chefs presenting him with knives to cut the Angus beef, the still-wriggling fish displayed before it was salt-baked. “That’s what Izakaya is,” Mustafa explained, “an experience.”View image in fullscreenMustafa Sardar outside his restaurant Izakaya.Photograph: Noorulain AliIzakaya was not the first experience Mustafa pioneered: after his stint at Le Cordon Bleu in London in 2017, and work experience at restaurants in London and Antwerp, he returned to Pakistan for a break. Then the pandemic hit and, bored in Karachi, he converted the basement in his mother’s home into a kitchen and restaurant and invited friends and family for elaborate plated services. Word spread and he was summoned to politicians’ and celebrities’ homes to cook.“Gangsters, underworld dons, people who can’t just turn up to a restaurant – no, I can’t tell you who – would give me a call,” he said. “The most wanted criminals. That’s who I was cooking for.” And what do dons and criminals like to eat? “I make a mushroom rice and a garlic rice with mushroom stock – they love that sort of thing,” Sardar told me. “They’re actually very nice, simple people.” For these meals, he charged up to Rs20,000 (£58) per head, often serving 30 or 40 people for a party. His business boomed and, while he won’t disclose how much he made, he does show me photographs of two Italian mastiffs he imported to Pakistan. He was able to buy horses and start playing polo: a boyhood dream come true.Sardar wanted to replicate this privacy and exclusivity of the basement venture at Izakaya. “Imagine you’re at the fanciest restaurant in Karachi, enjoying some wine and cheese with your girl, and then you see the girl’s uncle,” he said. “You gotta hide that bottle of wine! Or if you lied to someone about being sick so you couldn’t come to their party, but they see you out for dinner. Awkward! I thought there had to be a better way to have a night out.” Members can bring their pets to Izakaya – one gentleman dines alone with his pet parrot – and there’s a dog walker and Filipina nanny available on request. Sardar gets calls from mothers wanting to send daughters and their friends for a dinner – the girls want to dress however they wish without being ogled by strangers. “Izakaya is a ‘safe space’,” he said.Until recently, Izakaya’s Instagram did not feature photographs of the restaurant, and menu updates were shared only via Instagram stories, disappearing after 24 hours. Patrons often take photos in front of the restaurant’s distinctive duck-egg blue door – you’d recognise it if you’d been. “People want to show off,” Mustafa shrugged. #IYKYK.With all the talk of Norwegian salmon and nori imported from Dubai, it is easy to forget that Karachi is a coastal city. On a December morning, I joined 13 people on the docks at Ibrahim Hyderi, a fishing harbour on the outskirts of Karachi, for the mahigeer boat tour through the mangroves (“mahigeer” means “fisherfolk” in Urdu). The tour was led by Fatima Majeed, an activist and member of the community, and her father, Abdul Majeed. While father and daughter told stories about the community and their history, others prepared a meal of fried fresh fish, prawn biryani and prawn karahi.The winter sun warmed our backs as the boat gently wound along Karachi’s coastal mangroves. Two men sat in a small space below deck, oil bubbling in a wok on a stove at their feet. They coaxed fillets of mushka (croaker fish) into the oil. Fatima tore warm roti into pieces, spooning chutneys on to them as she talked. “These mangroves, this water, they are the auliya and wali [protectors] for the people of Karachi,” she said.Between 2010 and 2022, the WWF estimates that 200 hectares of mangroves in Karachi were lost to coastal land reclamation and commercial projects, leaving the city vulnerable to windstorms, cyclones and flooding. Fisherfolk have been protesting against the deforestation for years, to little avail. Despite its potential impact on the city, the problem feels removed from the average Karachiite’s life, and this sense of disconnection spills over into how we eat; we ignore our coasts as worthy providers of the foods we consume. In Karachi, most people are hesitant to cook fish, which they have not grown up eating regularly. Crucially, good fish can be expensive, so the average household budget prioritises chicken or meat.View image in fullscreenChef Asad Monga making sushi on the beach in Karachi.Photograph: Noorulain Ali“We do not eat like we are a coastal city,” Asad Monga, a Karachi-based chef, told me when we spoke. “We don’t have a connection to our sea.” Until 2022, Monga worked at buzzy new restaurants. Then he quit his job and began to take trips with local fisherfolk, learning about the fish in Karachi’s waters (surmai, boi, tuna, ghissar, parrotfish, barracudas, squid and prawns). He would cook for them, using a fatty fish like snapper to make sashimi seasoned with lemon, salt and chillies. They loved it. This was the kind of cooking Monga had not been able to do in any of the kitchens he’d worked in – using entirely local ingredients from the city in which he was raised.One day, Monga gathered seaweed and clams at Karachi’s most popular beach, Clifton Beach. He dipped the seaweed in a batter of besan, salt, chilli and sesame seeds and fried it up. He called these “seaweed pakoras”. Then he added the clams to mayo to make a dip, which he used to top the pakoras. He shared the dish on Instagram and took orders for two days, selling boxes for Rs700 (£2) each. It was such a hit that Monga made a higher-end version for a charity benefit at Izakaya (I laughed when he told me this: the patrons of Izakaya would never set foot on the trash-strewn sands of Clifton Beach). At Izakaya, the dish was modified to fit: the delicate wafer of a webbed pakora was topped with sashimi and served with prawn-head mayonnaise.There have been other attempts in Karachi to encourage us to appreciate local ingredients. In 2021, siblings Anum and Mustafa Karim opened Fishop, a hole-in-the-wall restaurant on Karachi’s Boat Basin “food street”. Fishop sold fresh and marinated fish – like red snapper, lobster, eel, calamari, tuna and pomfret – alongside English-style bekti fish and chips, fish burgers, nuggets and sushi. The siblings were keen on giving the city something different: affordable, good-quality sushi (you could get tuna maki rolls for Rs1,000, or £2.50). “We’re so used to eating budget-friendly sushi abroad, and we wanted to have sushi that was accessible for everyone,” Anum explained. “Why should it be so expensive when the fish is from your own shores?”While other restaurants in the area served barbecued tikkas and kebabs, the 14 plastic tables outside Fishop filled up on weekends with people trying sushi for the first time. Fishop was a deliberate far cry from the air-conditioned environs of Fujiyama or Sakura. Often, people from the nearby Ismaili Jamat Khana would stop by on their way home and order platters of sushi to take away (the crispy California rolls accounted for almost 50% of all orders). By 2023, however, Fishop had closed. Between their day jobs and the demand for sushi, Anum and Mustafa were unable to give the restaurant the time it needed.While these attempts to celebrate the local and seasonal find some curious customers, they have not been consistent enough to build a movement or change the ingredients found in most high-end restaurant kitchens in Karachi. Whereas sushi is prized for the freshness of its ingredients, the patrons who have the money to keep such businesses going like to know how far food has travelled to get to their plates: rice from Okinawa, tsukemono, wakame, and wasabi from Japan; nori and king crab from Dubai; and octopus, lobster, eel and yellowfin tuna available on demand from around the world. In Pakistan, the local is ordinary and, often, suspect. “We would rather pay for foreign ingredients than our own,” Monga explained. “We assume our own Pakistani produce is third-rate.”In 1986, the thrill of something new lured people through the doors of the Avari Hotel – just as in 1948, when Karachiites were curious about the first water-front hotel in the city. But now, four decades after Fujiyama first opened, there is a generation of globalised mobile consumers in Pakistan for whom very little is truly new. Chefs like Asad Monga and Mustafa Sardar understand that to keep these Pakistanis’ interest piqued, you must present them with something novel in the most familiar settings. Seaweed from a local beach; a hole-in-the-wall restaurant serving up the freshest tuna sashimi in the city; a members-only restaurant with no sign, tucked away in a residential neighbourhood.The life and death of Homaro Cantu, the genius chef who wanted to change the worldRead moreIn 2024, Fujiyama reopened after an extensive three-year renovation. The Avaris hope this revamp will draw curious people in. “We’re the new kid on the block now,” Byram’s son Dinshaw Jr told me. “Well, the old new kid.” When I visited Byram in 2022, his three Labradors – Blondie, Barney and Buddy – ambled around the office and snoozed as he told me stories about his father. Byram remembered playing at his father’s feet with a bucket and spade as he surveyed the land and dreamed up a creek-side hotel. “All of this,” Byram said, pointing out the windows to the palm-tree-lined hotel gardens, “all of this was barren land.”Byram Avari passed away in 2023. His office at Beach Luxury Hotel has been left as it was, and his sons Xerxes and Dinshaw Jr, along with their children, continue to work in the smaller adjoining offices. Byram and Dinshaw Sr’s edicts have been framed, and they now line the walls of the office.Who makes the rules? You and I,they read. Who amends the rules?

McIlroy has been in uncharted, strange psychological territory since completion of the career grand slam at Augusta National in April.Oakmont and theUS Openthen jabbed back in the manner only Oakmont and the US Open know. By the time McIlroy walked from the ninth green, his last, he had taken 74 shots including a second half of 41. He took a double-bogey five at the 8th. McIlroy’s demeanour showed he still cares.US Open golf 2025: Spaun leads at Oakmont as McIlroy and Scheffler struggle in first round – as it happenedRead moreThis score was not in itself disastrous. McIlroy missed the cut here in 2016, meaning pre-event expectations may not have been particularly high. Shane Lowry, playing in McIlroy’s company this time, slumped to a 79. Justin Rose could manage no better than 77. Scottie Scheffler 73, Dustin Johnson 75. Johnson, Oakmont’s champion in 2016, clean shanked an iron from the middle of the fairway at one point. It is just difficult to square the sensation that wasMcIlroy donning the Green Jacketwith what has transpired since.His situation is multi-faceted. The mindset adjustment required after winning not only the Masters but the major set and a first of the big four in more than a decade is complicated. It is easy to understand why McIlroy might not be suitably motivated having reached his holy grail. He has enjoyed being only the sixth career slam winner in history, which is to be commended.There are also technical issues. McIlroy was 50th overall for driving accuracy at Augusta and 46th in the field during round four. At the Players Championship,which he also won, he hit 27 of 56 fairways. Glory in 2025 thus far has therefore been on account of spirit and occasionally magical recovery play rather than battering courses into submission with tee shots. The truth is he still looks unconvinced and uncomfortable with his driver in hand. Oakmont, where rough is brutal, exposes that. McIlroy’s putter was unable to save him.Tommy Fleetwood, Hideki Matsuyama and Matt Fitzpatrick matched McIlroy’s score in the morning wave. So too did Phil Mickelson in what may be his final US Open. Cameron Smith managed no birdies at all en route to his 75. The defending champion, Bryson DeChambeau, was under par through seven but later signed for a 73.As big names faltered, JJ Spaun stood tall. His round of 66, which was bogey free, was terrific. Golfers swung and missed at Spaun throughout the day. He ended it with a one-stroke lead over Thriston Lawrence.Spaun won a lot of hearts and minds with his attitude after losing to McIlroy at the Players. Mixing it with the best now seems to come more easily to the 34-year-old. Spaun has matched the lowest US Open first-round score at Oakmont.View image in fullscreenJJ Spaun tees off from the ninth hole.Photograph: Jared Wickerham/EPA“Everyone knows that the more you put yourself there you are going to have better results and the better you’re going to play,” Spaun said. “Eventually you will turn one of those close calls into a win.“The Players gave a spring in my self-belief because it wasn’t like I faked it. You can maybe fake it at the Sony Open or Cognizant Classic or whatever, but to do that at the Players, a course where I’d never done well historically, and to go head to head with Rory on Sunday, and then the playoff was great for my confidence. Unfortunately I didn’t win, but it was great for me to lean back on that experience and know I can perform on the biggest of stages and handle it with the pressure. There’s going to be a lot of pressure this week too.“I used to be kind of scared to want the ball, or I guess you could say have the lead or be the one that everyone is chasing. I always was [more] comfortable kind of being a chaser than the one being chased. I was like: ‘You need to embrace this, stop being scared.’ You don’t want to look back thinking, what if I didn’t embrace this, who knows what I would have done, versus yes, I want to be that guy.”Like Spaun, Robert MacIntyre revelled in the challenge. The Scot dropped a shot on the last but could still be perfectly content with a level-par 70. MacIntyre branded Spaun’s four under “unbelievable”, adding: “It’s just so hard. It’s just every shot, you’re on a knife-edge. Off the tee, this is the most demanding course I have ever played.“My game’s in great shape. The results haven’t been great, but that’s partly to do with how I’m reacting to disappointment at times.”Im Sung-jae reached minus five but shipped three shots over the closing stretch. Brooks Koepka’s 68 and the 69 posted by Jon Rahm as shadows lengthened felt notable. Koepka revealed he was subject to a 45-minute “scolding” from his coach, Pete Cowen, on Monday. Oh to have been a fly on that wall.Explore more on these topicsUS OpenGolfRory McIlroyEuropean TourPGA TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Pat Cummins claimed six wickets to put his team in the ascendancy but on a whirligig day of constantly oscillating fortunes, the Proteas promptly bowled themselves back into contention, with Australia reaching stumps on 144 for eight, nursing a lead of 218.“It’s an amazing chance, and we’re all excited about the opportunity to win,” said Bedingham. “It could go either way but us as a team are very, very excited and there’s a lot of belief in the dressing room. We’re very confident. When they started batting in their second innings we would definitely have taken this score. So very confident, there’s massive belief in this team.”Australia and South Africa wickets tumble to leave WTC final on a knife-edgeRead moreBut Australia will feel equally optimistic after their second innings was rescued from impending disaster by Alex Carey, who towards the day’s end dominated the scoring in a 61- run partnership with Mitchell Starc after Australia had fallen to 73 for seven. “Kez has been brilliant, he’s dragged us out of that,” Cummins said. “The mood in the changing room was pretty positive towards the end there. It was a great partnership. It was almost like a run chase, with each four getting loud claps. It was a pretty good way to end the day.”A total of 14 wickets fell across the second day, precisely as many asin the first. It started with South Africa losing their last six wickets in adding just 95 runs to their overnight total, 51 of them provided by the partnership between Bedingham – who top-scored with 45 – and Temba Bavuma. “I don’t think Australia gave us any bad balls. That’s why they’re the best in the world,” Bedingham said. “Hopefully going forward we can counteract that and win the title. I don’t think Cummins ever misses. There’s always energy on the ball. He bowled 18-odd overs and the energy from his first over to his 18th was exactly the same. He’s world class.“There are six quality seamers out there, I think that makes batting tough. The bowlers have the ability to take it in with the slope, which means the ball moves more, and they also have the ability to take it away. Just having world-class bowlers on a pitch that can move both ways makes it quite tricky.”Lungi Ngidi, the least successful of South Africa’s bowlers in Australia’s first innings, made amends in their second by taking three key wickets across what became the second-longest spell of his Test career. “I was struggling a bit from one side, but I swapped ends and I felt a lot better,” he said. “Once you get a moment like that you don’t want to let it go because it could change the game. I just kept going until my legs told me, ‘That’s enough.’“Once we started bowling we realised there was still enough in the wicket to make it closer, to bring that margin down. Just finding a bit of rhythm, that’s all I was looking to do. If you’d told me this was the position we’d be in at the end of the day I’d definitely have taken it. I guess that’s what a Test championship final should bring. A lot of guys have put their hands up. It’s been very exciting, very tough cricket out there.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It doesn’t make a difference to me, opinions or whatever it is.”Earlier Cummins had taken five of the last six South African wickets to fall – the other was a run-out – to end the day with 300 Test scalps, becoming the 40th man, and the eighth Australian, to reach the mark. “As a fast bowler, 300 is something I always kind of thought about as a pretty good sign of durability and resilience and longevity, so I feel pretty proud to join that group,” he said. “I still feel like I’ve got lots of miles in the legs.

The 51-year-old Dane joins from Brentford on a contract that runs until 2028, and succeeds Ange Postecoglou,who delivered Europa League gloryto end Spurs’ 17-year trophy drought but was sacked because of dismal results in the Premier League.Spurs moved to line up Frank before dismissing Postecoglou last Friday, holding talks via ­intermediaries and plainly keen to avoid a protracted search for the ­person to lead them forward after a season in which they finished 17th with 38 points. Only once in club history have they had a worse league record – in 1914-15.Ange Postecoglou’s triumphant sacking holds the key to modern football | Jonathan LiewRead moreWhen Frank, who has impressed with his work in charge at Brentford during a near seven-year period, gave the green light, Spurs knew he was within their grasp because of a £10m release clause in his contract. They have spent the past few days negotiating the finer details, plus the transfer of some of Frank’s coaches from Brentford.The writing had been on the wall for Postecoglou, with the expectation that he would depart even if he led Spurs past Manchester United in the Europa League final on 21 May. The club said they could not “base our decision on emotions aligned to this triumph” whenthey announced Postecoglou’s departure.The move for Frank has been pushed by Tottenham’s technical director, Johan Lange, a Dane who has a longstanding relationship with his compatriot. Lange gave Frank his first full-time position in the game as a youth coach at B93 in 2004, although they did not spend much time together at the club as Lange soon left.The pair were reunited not long after at Lyngby where Frank came to the attention of the ­Danish ­Football Association, who hired him as the coach of their under-16s, under-17s and later the under-19s. From there Frank got his break in senior ­management at Brøndby in 2013, managing them for almost three ­seasons before going to Brentford, where he worked initially as the assistant to Dean Smith. He succeeded him as the manager in October 2018.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Spurs have been impressed by more than the headline items of Frank’s Brentford tenure – the ­promotion from the Championship via the playoffs in 2021, how he has established them in the Premier League, finishing 13th, ninth, 16th and 10th. Frank consistently over-achieved in relation to his financial means at Brentford; they have one of the smallest budgets in the division. An excellent ­communicator and noted developer of young ­talent, he has also shown himself to be ­tactically flexible. A Spurs statement read: “We are delighted. In Thomas we are ­appointing one of the most ­progressive and ­innovative head coaches in the game. He has a proven track record in player and squad development and we look forward to him leading the team as we prepare for the season ahead.”Justin Cochrane will join Frank at Tottenham as his assistant while he has also brought the head of ­performance, Chris Haslam, and first-team analyst Joe Newton with him from Brentford. Another assistant coach, Andreas Georgson, will arrive from Manchester United.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That said, Brentford could still build through the thirds and they were the joint-fifth highest scorers in the league during this past season. His preference is for a back three and wing-backs, which could suit Spurs’s current full-backs Pedro Porro, Destiny Udogie and Djed Spence.Frank has yet to win silverware or manage in European competition beyond Europa League qualifying stages; Spurs are back in the Champions League after the Europa League triumph. But he is not short of high-profile backers. Pep Guardiola predicted last September that Frank would one day join an elite-level club. “It is just a question of time,” said Manchester City’s manager. “I’m good in a few things, one of which is reading when the manager is good. It is going to happen. Thomas is one of the best. What his team does always makes sense. Every corner is a headache. They are compact. This season they have a high press.”Jürgen Klopp described Frank as “a cool guy” who he respected a lot in November 2023. “He plays against possession teams one way and plays against other teams when all of a sudden they are a possession team themselves,” the then Liverpool manager said. “It’s really interesting.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

While Lee Carsley has played down his youthful squad’s chances of emulating Dave Sexton’s back-to-back triumphs in becoming European champions in 1982 and 1984, a convincing and mature victory over a boisterously backed Czech Republic team hinted that it may not be beyond the realms of possibility.Goals from Harvey Elliott and Charlie Cresswell sandwiched by another from Jonathan Rowe were enough to allow England to take a commanding position in Group B after brief hopes of a comeback from the Czech Republic. Victory over Slovenia, who were beaten 3-0 by Germany in their opening match, on Sunday would assure a place in the quarter-finals.Czech Republic 1-3 England: European Under-21 Championship – live reactionRead moreCarsley had warned that an inexperienced squad that contains just two of those who won in Georgia two years ago could look “a little bit clunky”. But while Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson managed to pick up a booking after just 17 seconds for a misjudged tackle, England made an encouraging start with the captain, James McAtee, employed as a false 9 in the absence of Liam Delap, who is one of several players missing due to Club World Cup commitments.Omari Hutchinson forced Czech Republic goalkeeper Lukas Hornicek into a reaction save at his near post before Vaclav Sejk was inches away from connecting with a cross that fizzed across the face of goal at the other end. The large contingent of red-shirted supporters who had made the short journey across the border and made up 90% of the crowd sensed an opportunity for a country that has failed to get past the group stage of this competition since 2011.View image in fullscreenCharlie Cresswell heads home England’s third goal.Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/ReutersIt needed a solid save from Brighton’s James Beadle, who spent last season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, to keep out Stepan Chaloupek’s header from a free-kick when the Czech Republic captain found himself totally unmarked before Alex Scott did well to block a goalbound shot from a corner. With Liverpool’s Jarell Quansah and Charlie Cresswell of Toulouse looking shaky at the back, England were riding their luck as Carsley assumed his favoured touchline position on his haunches.Such is the depth of talent in this age group that seven members of Thomas Tuchel’s latest senior squad – including Jude Bellingham, Levi Colwill and Cole Palmer – were still eligible to take part here.Newcastle’s Tino Livramento, who has already won a senior cap during Carsley’s spell as interim manager, was instrumental in the opening goal. His cross was almost deflected in but McAtee kept the ball in play and it was drilled in by Elliott.Beadle then had to be alert to prevent the ball from trickling over his line after it had come off Qunasah’s arm following a goalmouth scramble moments after England had taken the lead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the Czech Republic hit back immediately when Livramento was caught out by a cross from Sejk and Daniel Fila gratefully headed in.“We’ve got to play,” came the message from Carsley as his side attempted to wrest back control. The introduction of Birmingham’s Jay Stansfield and Ethan Nwaneri of Arsenal from the bench for the last 20 minutes was an indication that the job was not done.It didn’t take long for Nwaneri to make an impact, producing a cheeky nutmeg before setting off on a mazy run that saw his shot deflect just wide. Cresswell sealed the victory minutes later when he headed in Scott’s corner to give Carsley the perfect start.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipEngland Under-21snewsShareReuse this content"

As ice-breakers go, frowning over the passports and visa stickers of the long-haul crowd on matchday minus four of the FifaClub World Cup, the border guard was at least in tune with the zeitgeist. What is football doing here?What are Lionel Messi, Trent Alexander-Arnold and the massed engines of the football-industrial complex doing hovering like an alien landing party over this fun, sinking sandbank of a city, a strip of land where the ocean seems to be punching a mulchy green hole in the asphalt every few miles, a place that from the air seems to be made entirely from deep-fried crumb, tropical weed and traffic?Is football ready for the Club World Cup? Football Weekly Extra - podcastRead moreAnd yes, theFifaClub World Cup is only partly here at this point, glimpsed on highway billboards that also promote accident-chasing lawyers called things such as Chuck Flip-Burger III, still to emerge from the endless noise of the US’s rolling leisure economy. But it is still an excellent question that deserves a proper answer.Even the strangely literal-minded obsession with the trophy itself seems to admit to the vacant space at the heart of this thing. Never mind the basic sense of apathy. Here is a magnificent sinister golden plate that, at the turn of a key, can be transformed into a magnificent sinister golden sphere. Here is a trophy that seems to lurk, to tick and hum and buzz, that looks as if it almost certainly houses sinister things in its secret drawers – stolen moon rock, the head of a pigeon.The question of what football is doing here is even present in the Club World Cup marketing. Dazn, Fifa’s broadcast partner, is billing its breakthrough global event with the taglineUncontested. It’s a good word, meaning ultimate, the best; but also with a sense of something unmoored, floating out beyond any real sense of accountability.Often the best way to explain something is to pick at a thread. As the clock ticks down to Saturday night’s opener in Miami, as much of the pre-converted football world scratches its head at an event Gianni Infantino described this week as football’s “big bang”, perhaps the most helpful thread is Dazn itself.Need an explainer for the Infantino-shaped universe? Follow the football and you’ll find the usual noses at the trough. Follow the money and who knows where you might end up. And Dazn is the money here.It is no secret that the Club World Cup would not be happening in the way it is now happening without Dazn. In December 2024 Dazn offered Fifa ajaw-dropping $1bn (£787m) for the broadcast rights, all the more startling in a market that was, to that point, also Uncontested.A month later Saudi Arabia concluded its own deal to buy a 10% stake in Dazn in return for – guess what – another $1bn. Two months after thatFifa announcedits vast tournament prize fund, also, by coincidence, $1bn, thereby ensuring full compliance from its invited guests.In the middle of this, around the time the soon-to-be-Saudi-part-owned Dazn was concluding its Fifa TV rights deal, Fifaawarded the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabiavia a show of Uncontested applause from its members, thereby completing what is no doubt an entirely illusory circle of hand-washing.So far, so old school. We have a sense of this world now. It seems essentially untouchable, just the way power works. Strongman shall speak unto strongman. But there is another, more structurally vital way that Dazn tells the story of what is happening here, a process that may have a profound effect on the way football, sport, that thing you love, is made available from here.View image in fullscreenThe Club World Cup Trophy is displayed at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.Photograph: Eva Marie Uzcategui/Fifa/Getty ImagesThis is a case of dramatic foreshadowing. Watch any of the huge number of Star Wars spin-off prequels in circulation and it soon becomes clear the key plot device is the slow reveal, titillating glimpses of the road to full Death Star. The senate is always in a state of uproar. The empire is creating a secret army on the cloud planet Garff. Known evil things – storm troopers, imperial fighters – are glimpsed in chillingly casual pose. An ambassador dressed in robes will stand on a doom-shadowed causeway and talk of plans for a mysterious new weapon. And as ever the mood is one of head-scratching distraction.Perhaps in years to come it may be said that the greatest trick the Club World Cup pulled was convincing those who care about football’s structures that it doesn’t really exist, that this is a business model that can be defeated by not liking it or not following it, that will simply fade back into the swamp.Whereas in reality the empire does have a powerful new weapon, one that is being winched into place in front of our eyes, that is already in play, already digging its fingers into domestic leagues, already unmooring the spectacle.The best way to understand this is to tug again at the Dazn thread. The company was launched in 2015 by thebillionaire Len Blavatnik, who made his fortune in Russian smelting and metal, and now, with ties to Russia cut, is the third-richest person in the UK. Dazn was billed as the Netflix of sports, as all ambitious tech entities must be the Netflix of something, its method to offer a simple, all-in streaming service for sports, shot through with betting, gaming, e-commerce, NFT stuff.For a while it rumbled along in the background. The boxing partnership with Saudi Arabia was a step up into serious-player status. By 2023 Dazn had 20 million subscribers worldwide. The Fifa deal, aided in turn by Dazn’s Saudi deal, is a company making its move.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAnd right now the big thing about Dazn, its superpower through all this, is that it is not actually a money-making entity in any sense of the phrase. Why else would anyone pay $1bn for rights to a product it thengives away for free? This is instead a means of taking a place at the table, a stake in the product, all the while happily swallowing vast losses. Dazn reportedly lost $1.4bn in 2023, up from $1.2bn the year before, all the while fearlessly expanding its footprint, happy to disrupt and take ownership.In this sense it is essentially irresistible, all the more so with the backing of the world’s greatest loss-leading sports propaganda project. And it has now found the perfect partner in Fifa, with its own expansionist aims, and also in the current generation of elite club ownership.Everyone in football wants to find the next platform. It is a refrain at any gathering of leaders, owners and rainmakers. The long-term future of this sport is as an enabler, a source of cut-though, piggyback for some future global tech service, and from there access to the real Zuckerberg money.View image in fullscreenInter Miami’s Lionel Messi has been gerrymandered into place by Fifa.Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty ImagesDazn and the Club World Cup is to some extent a trial run for this process, a way of shaking off the shackles of all those baffling legacy interests. Dazn has always denied ever having any interest in the beached European Super League, which was bound up in constructing exactly this kind of global broadcast platform. But now we have this instead, a World Super League, a product no one seems to like, but which Dazn believes will become the most live-streamed event in sports history, all cut through, all positioning, all future-building.There is an overlap of style and ambition even in the way the Club World Cup will be presented. The marketing pitch is about individuals, leveraging the social media following of star players and the power of mass celebrity fawning. Even the shirts have been tinkered with and detribalised just a little on the grounds of creating a better optic for the six-inch screen in the world’s pocket.This is why Messi has been gerrymandered into place by Fifa, why the Dazn home screen is shot through with faces not badges, stars not clubs, why theUncontestedpitch is about goalscorers, top guns, names.Even clicking onthe homepageis a strangely gripping experience, like having your brain syringed through a small lighted screen crowded with endless shouted voices, from clips of Jude Bellingham admitting the Club World Cup is definitely a thing, to Dazn’s Global Football Creator Program, based out of “a creator house” not far from Fifa HQ in Miami, which aims to “mobilize over 100 digital creators, reaching more than 32 million followers across platforms”.Here it is, global reach, global cut-through, the “immersive, multi-platform experience” of Pêche Football, AT Frenchies, Lisa Zimouche, BFordLancer, Alex Ramos, Jessica Vincent, Jen Munoz, Mike WoZ, Shepmates, Fabrizio Romano. This is also why it doesn’t really matter whether legacy fans love the Club World Cup, why talk of unsold tickets or a lack of competitive robustness seems to miss the point, stuck in the old metrics of value.This has been billed by some as a trial run for the 2026 World Cup, as though what everyone here is really interested in is seeing if the stadiums work or the transport is any good. It feels more like a trial run for a version of the future.The Club World Cup may pass in a haze this summer. Dazn may or may not last the course, may itself end up a beta version, planetary destructor ray Mk1. But the question of why football is here is not one that can be quietly ignored; not without that uncomfortable sense of a future that is already out there flexing its claws.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupFifaFootball politicsSaudi Arabia and sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The second, after you’ve explained, apologetically, that you don’t actually follow football, is usually an awkward pause. There are all sorts of reasons why you may prefer any other sort of sport, but after 20 years of variations on this conversation, I’ve learned that unless you want to come across like someone who insists actually they prefer art-house cinema and free jazz, it’s best to have a straightforward explanation. Mine is that I grew up in Bath.They do play football in Bath, out at Twerton Park. The club have never been in the Football League (right now they’re in National League South), and most weeks they draw a crowd of around a thousand. Which isn’t so very many more than you’ll find crowded around the stone balustrades of the city’s parade gardens, trying to peer across the weir and see into the Rec when the rugby club have a home game. Bath’s football has always been bad. But in the 80s and 90s Bath’s rugby was so good that the brand still stands for something, even after they have been mediocre for a large part of the past 30 years.Owen Farrell to air views on dad Andy and the Lions on Sky for tour openerRead moreIt was Jack Rowell’s team and, after Rowell took the England job, Brian Ashton’s. It was the team of Gareth Chilcott, Victor Ubogu and Graham Dawe, of Andy Robinson, Nigel Redman, John Hall and Martin Haag, of Stuart Barnes, Tony Swift, David Trick, Mike Catt, Jon Callard, Richard Hill, Simon Halliday, Phil de Glanville and Jeremy Guscott, and too many more to name them all. It was the team that won the league six times in eight years and the cup 10 times in 12, and the team who beat Brive, by a point, in the European Cup final in 1998. Which, looking back on it now, was the club’s high-water mark. The place where the wave broke.They were already losing their way. They had made a series of bizarrely extravagant signings, agreed to an embarrassing cross-code challenge against Wigan Warriors, in which they got battered 82-6 playing rugby league at Maine Road, and an excruciating six-part behind-the-scenes documentary on the BBC which began with Hall, who had now taken over as director of rugby, promising to “build the most formidable club in Europe”, the “Manchester United and Liverpool of rugby” and ended, a few weeks later, with Hall being told he was being “let go” by his old teammate Swift, who was now the club’s chief executive.All of which is water under Pulteney Bridge. Bath’s advantage in those years was that Rowell turned them into something like a professional team while everyone else was playing an amateur game. Once other clubs caught up, Bath slipped back into the middle of the league. They have grown-up fans who before this season have only ever known them as underachievers, with a solitary victory in the European Challenge Cup in 2008. You will run out of fingers before you finish listing all the coaches who have had a crack at getting them back where they belonged in the years since.View image in fullscreenThe Rec has been in need of redevelopment for some time but plans have never come to fruition.Photograph: Matt Impey/ShutterstockOver time, you would hear whispers that players had started to see it as a comfy billet, a place where they would be well paid and have a nice life doing it, especially after the owner, Bruce Craig, built them a new training facility on the grounds of Farleigh House.Whatever else they used to say about Bath back in the day, it never was that they were soft. Johann van Graan has got a lot right since he became their latest director of rugby, not least his recent remarks on the BBC that he felt the club “didn’t understand who they were” when he joined them. The city around it is different too. Ken Loach (who is one of those 1,000 or so Bathonians who prefer Twerton Park)complains it has become too clean, too sharp, too geared towards the day trippers visiting the city for their weekend shopping.Bath,Loach says, has always been a city of two halves. It is surrounded by farming communities and former coalmining towns, and is rough enough in the bits the tourists don’t go. At their best, the rugby team have always combined both of them. Craig’s money has done a lot of the work, no doubt about it, it paid for Finn Russell, among others. Russell, as a marquee player, is exempt from their salary cap, but to be honest the club’s economics still feel a bit of a mystery. Somehow they have found the money to bring in Santiago Carreras and Henry Arundell next season. But they have a lot of academy players coming up through the squad too, some nicked from elsewhere but a lot of them locals, from Beechen Cliff state school up top of one of the seven hills overlooking the city.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And the Rec is still a ramshackle old place. The club have been arguing with obstinate locals about whether or not they can redevelop it for almost as long as anyone can remember, and will go on arguing about it well into the future. The latest complaint is that their plans could interfere with an old copper beech tree nearby. But the team are winning again; they have an ugly pack, backs worth paying to watch and a handful of local lads in the thick of it. This weekend their supporters will be making the trip to Twickenham for the big match against their old enemy, Leicester.

Raducanu has not been the highest-ranked player in the country since June 2023 when she was recovering from surgeries to her wrists and ankle. She missed a total of eight months in 2023 and consequently fell out of the top 300.Wimbledon lifts prize pot to £53.5m but tells players more money is no quick fixRead more“It’s nice, but I wouldn’t say it’s the most important thing for me,” said Raducanu. “Having Katie in front, it was nice for me to have something to chase. Now I’m sure she’s going to enjoy that with me. The grass season is still young, and so is the rest of the season. But regardless, we have a healthy competition between us two. I want to see her do well; she wants to see me do well. It was nice to also play doubles with her this week.”As in her first-round win, Raducanu opened the match returning brilliantly, immediately putting Sramkova under consistent pressure by taking returns early and looking to dominate the Slovak’s second serve. She flitted to a 5-0 first-set lead but, as she attempted to close out the set, Raducanu lost all momentum and intensity. She was pulled back to 5-4 before resetting and closing out the set with an authoritative service game.Although Sramkova, the world No 41, is a good player and an excellent athlete, her counterpunching style is better suited to slower surfaces. Raducanu was in total control of most exchanges and, aside from her brief detour in the first set, was dominant from the baseline. She established a 5-1 lead in the second set, and this time did not let it slip.Raducanu is joined this week by both Mark Petchey, who is working with her throughout the grass-court season and her previous coach Nick Cavaday. Raducanu and Cavaday had worked together for about 14 months until the end of the Australian Open in January when he decided to step back due to health reasons. The presence of two trusted voices in her team appears to be another positive step forward for the 22-year-old.View image in fullscreenKatie Boulter went down to the fifth seed Diana Shnaider 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 at Queen’s.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersBefore the tournament, Raducanu revealed that her preparation for Queen’s had been disrupted by her continuedissues with back spasms, which had affected her days before the French Open at the Strasbourg Open. However, she has looked in good shape this week. She started her grass-court campaign with an excellent performance in her dominantwin over the qualifier Cristina Bucsa. She also played two doubles matches with Boulter, only the second doubles appearance in her career, a good indication of her physical shape.Friday will offer a good test of Raducanu’s actual level when she faces Zheng Qinwen, the top seed, who overcame McCartney Kessler in a tough three-setter late on Thursday evening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At 21 years old, Shnaider is the second-youngest player in the top 20 behind her fellow Russian Mirra Andreeva and she is a devastating ball-striker. “I’m very happy for Raducanu to be British No 1,” said Boulter, who will be ranked No 39 at best by Monday. “But at the same time, it’s going to be fun for me to chase her now, and I think she’s been doing that for a while. Now it’s kind of my turn.”After enthusiastically celebrating another solid victory, Raducanu immediately thought of her doubles partner and friendly singles rival, signing the camera: “Long live Boultercanu.” She later explained that it had been difficult to bounce back aftertheir doubles quarter-final defeatby the top seeds Erin Routliffe and Lyudmyla Kichenok on Wednesday.“Honestly, it was actually a real challenge for me today,” said Raducanu. “I’m not used to playing doubles. I lost the match yesterday and I was really upset. I really felt I was out of the tournament. So to get myself fired up for this one was really difficult. I’m really happy to get myself through this one. I really want to play with Katie again in the future.”Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisKatie BoulternewsShareReuse this content"

Hamilton described the recent Spanish Grand Prix – where he was ordered by Ferrari to move aside for teammate Charles Leclerc and was then passed by Sauber driver Nico Hülkenberg in the closing laps – as one of the worst races he has ever experienced.Hamilton is 23 points behind Leclerc, and 115 adrift of the championship leader, Oscar Piastri, before this weekend’s Canadian Grand Prix. But speaking on the eve of the race in Montreal, the 40-year-old, who is in the first of a two-season deal withFerrari, said: “I have literally only just started with this team. I am here for several years and I am in it for the long haul.F1 2026 calendar revealed: Madrid joins 24-race season as Imola falls off listRead more“There is no question as to where my head is at, and what I want to achieve with his team. There are zero doubts so please stop making up [reports about his future].”Since his blockbuster move from Mercedes, Hamilton won the sprint round in China in March, but his record in the main events so far for Ferrari reads 10th, disqualified, seventh, fifth, seventh, eighth, fourth, fifth and sixth. Ferrari are already 197 points behind McLaren in the constructors’ standings with reports in Italy claiming Fred Vasseur’s position as team principal is under threat.But Hamilton said: “I don’t think that is on the cards as far as I am aware and I certainly would not be supportive of that. Firstly, I love working with Fred. He is the main reason I am in this team, and I got the opportunity to be here because of Fred which I am forever grateful for.“We are in this together, and things are not perfect. I am here to work with the team but also Fred. I want Fred here and I believe he is the person to take us to the top.“Most people don’t know what is going on in the background. It is not easy, we are having to make changes, there is a lot of work to do, and there is pressure because we want to win, but that [Vasseur leaving] is not a discussion at the moment. I am here to win with Fred and he has my full support.”Explore more on these topicsLewis HamiltonFerrariFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Among the top athletes he signed were Olympic champions Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Gabby Thomas, though two other American track stars, Sha’Carri Richardson and Noah Lyles, did not race in the league.Olympic champion Gabby Thomas followed and heckled by gambler at Grand Slam Track meetRead moreThe first three events, in Kingston, Jamaica, Miami and Philadelphia, raised about $9.45m, with another $3m expected to be paid in LA. Bonuses were expected to go to season-long winners of the categories.The news on Thursday about the abrupt scrubbing of the meeting, scheduled for the last weekend in June at Drake Stadium, follows USA Track and Field’s decision to take an event set for earlier in June – the LA Grand Prix – off the calendar.Max Siegel, USATF chief executive, told the Associated Press that the federation pulled its event because it was not viable to hold two major track meets in LA in the span of three weeks.A person with knowledge of the Grand Slam Track decision told the AP it was because of economic problems with the venue. The person added the new track league is looking towards 2026 and is expected to announce new investors next week. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision had not been publicly announced. A meeting with the athletes was slated to take place later on Thursday.Siegel said leaders at USATF “understand the significance of the [LA] market” and that there are plans for leaders to meet later this summer to coordinate the future of track there and throughout the United States, starting in 2026.“It highlights the complicated way the [sport] works, and how difficult it is to financially sustain track meets,” Siegel said. “The only way to do it in a sustainable way is collaboration and partnerships.”In the short term, USATF is looking to find meetings for a handful of athletes who still need to reach standards or collect points to qualify for world championships later this year and were planning to compete in Los Angeles.The news was far from what Olympic and track leaders were hoping as they head towards the first Summer Games in the United States since 1996 in a city that, 12 years before that, put Carl Lewis, Edwin Moses, Evelyn Ashford and others in the spotlight.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Policymakers meet next week, but are not expected to reduce the cost of borrowing from its 4.25% level until August at the earliest.Vasileios Gkionakis, a senior economist at Aviva Investors, said the consistent depreciation of the dollar since Trump’s inauguration was probably owing to a lack of faith that theUS economyunder Trump would grow at the exceptional pace it had in recent years.He said higher US government debts, which Trump has indicated will escalate once his tax bill passes both houses of Congress, was another deterrent to buying dollars.“All this is agitating markets, who in order to lend to the US would require a combination of higher [interest rates] and a weaker exchange rate,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDollarCurrenciesTrump administrationUS economyUS politicsEconomicsUS interest ratesnewsShareReuse this content"

It raised council tax by 15% shortly afterwards.London’s largest borough, with nearly 400,000 residents, was second only to Birmingham in the amount of exceptional financial support it got this year – £136m for 2025-26, up from £50m granted to the council in 2024-25.The latest announcement suggests Croydon could follow Birmingham with a series of brutal budget cuts and council tax hikes. Perry said he would not support cuts that would “decimate local services” or any further council tax increases above the cap of 5% a year.Council leaders have criticised the government for failing to use Wednesday’s spending review to address the hole in local authority finances.Tim Oliver, the chair of the County Councils Network, said the sums announced “fall well short of filling the projected £2.2bn funding gap faced by county and unitary councils next year, and consequently further service cuts will be hard to avoid”.Louise Gittins, the chair of the Local Government Association, said many authorities would have to increase council tax to try to protect services, but would still need to make further cuts.Explore more on these topicsLocal governmentLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Both charges concern accusations of forcing oral sex on women in 2006. Those verdicts still stand.But the foreperson complained on Wednesday that he felt bullied by another juror, and on Thursday said he would not go back into the jury room, leaving the jury left considering the third charge, a rape accusation dating to 2013.The jury of seven women and five men unanimously reached the first two decisions last Friday, the foreperson later told the judge. The verdict was delivered on Wednesday only because Judge Curtis Farber asked whether there was agreement on any of the charges.The group was stuck on the third charge, however: a rape accusation involving a woman who also said she had a consensual relationship with the Oscar-winning producer. UnderNew Yorklaw, the third-degree rape charge carries a lesser penalty than the other two counts.Weinstein denies all the charges. In an unusual exchange with the judge during some legal arguments before the partial verdict was disclosed on Wednesday, he insisted it was unfair to continue the trial after two jurorscame forward with concernsabout the proceedings.“I can’t be judged by a situation that’s going on like this,” said Weinstein, 73, saying the judge was “endangering” him.Jury-room strains started leaking into public view on Friday, when a juror asked to be excused because he felt another was being treated unfairly. Then on Monday, the foreperson complained that other jurors were pushing people to change their minds and talking about information beyond the charges.The man raised concerns again on Wednesday. In a closed-door discussion with prosecutors, defense lawyers and the judge, the foreperson said another juror was yelling at him for sticking to his opinion and at one point vowed: “You going to see me outside.”“I feel afraid inside there,” the foreperson told the judge and attorneys, according to a transcript.The judge sent the jury home for the day after the partial verdict, but the foreperson later asked to come back and recapped his concerns to Farber in court. The foreperson said he was willing to return on Thursday, with Farber saying the man would not be forced to go into the jury room if he did not want to.The third accuser, Jessica Mann, who agreed to be identified, is left still waiting for an outcome. The hairstylist and actor testified for days – as she did in 2020 – about the rape she said she endured in a Manhattan hotel room and about why she continued to see and have consensual encounters with Weinstein afterward.“Rape can happen in relationships – and in dynamics where power and manipulation control the narrative,” Mann said in a statement on Wednesday.Weinstein also was convicted of raping another woman in California. He is appealing that conviction.Explore more on these topicsUS newsHarvey WeinsteinNew YorkRape and sexual assaultUS crimeLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Police said it was unknown if he had deliberately targeted her.The 59-year-old teacher was killed along with nine pupils – six female and three male – aged between 14 and 17. Nine people are still being treated in hospital for their injuries, including a male teacher, but all were stable and the last two in intensive care were to be moved out during the course of the day, health officials said.It also emerged on Thursday in a report by the state broadcaster ORF, which was confirmed by a spokesperson for Austria’s military, that the killer had recently failed a psychological test to enter the armed forces.However, he had even more recently passed the psychological checks required to be in possession of the weapons he used to carry out the killings, which he carried legally, police said.The man, who had attended the school and dropped out three years ago, was an apprentice at an industrial school. He lived alone with his mother and was not previously known to police.The shooting rampage, the worst in Austria’s history, has sparked an emotional debate over the state of the country’s gun laws, which critics have said are too lax.During a visit to Graz on Wednesday evening, Austria’s president, Alexander Van der Bellen, said it was necessary for politicians to review the laws and to “look into how it is possible for a 21-year-old to own handguns and long weapons and have the opportunity to purchase the appropriate ammunition for them and to cause this mayhem”.Austria’s national security council, set up in light of the 9/11 attacks in the US, was due to address the issue when it met on Thursday afternoon. Discussions have also begun about tightening security in schools, with some calling for the installation of metal detectors at school gates.Michael Lohnegger, the head of the Styrian state criminal police office, said the man planned the attack in minute detail. He described how the man entered the main entrance of the BORG Dreierschützengasse school at 9.43am on Tuesday carrying a backpack containing his weapons and ammunition. Between 350 and 400 pupils were present on site at the time.“He went into a toilet on the third floor and took various objects out of his rucksack. He put on a weapons belt with a hunting knife, a pair of shooting glasses and a headset, took out a Glock 19 pistol, a sawn-off Mercury shotgun and loaded the weapons.View image in fullscreenA condolence message written in Romanian and German hangs on the gate to the BORG Dreierschützengasse school in Graz.Photograph: Erwin Scheriau/APA/AFP/Getty“At 9.47 he proceeded to carry out a seven-minute rampage through the school, going from the third to the second floor, and opened fire randomly on people in the school, who were from the 5th class.“He finally went to the third floor where pupils of the 7th class were … fired at the closed doors of the classrooms until he was able to open them and then randomly shot at the people he found there.”He finally returned to the toilet cubicle on the third floor where he subsequently shot himself in the head at 10.07am, Lohnegger said.Owing to the fact that the first team of armed police entered the school building at 10.06am and heard no shots, investigators are working on the assumption that Arthur A might well have planned to carry out more killings, as he had plenty more ammunition on his person, but his knowledge that police were in the building may have prompted him to stop.There was no evidence that the killer knew the pupils he shot, Lohnegger added, but it had been established he had been taught by the teacher who was killed. There was no evidence that this was a motive behind the killing, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had informed himself extremely precisely and given a lot of thought as to when he would approach each floor.” There was no information as to when he abandoned plans to deploy ahomemade pipe bomb, found at his home, after it proved to be dysfunctional, although Lohnegger said it “in theory contained all the components necessary” to work.Arthur A bought the shotgun in mid-April and the handgun several weeks later. He had been attending shooting practice at a range in Graz since March, Lohnegger said.He said people at the school had reacted “very well” to the incident, after recent training in what to do in case of a shooting, by shutting doors and barricading themselves into classrooms.Police said they had yet to rule out that the killer may have had an accomplice who helped him in his planning or in his execution of the attack.Lohnegger described Arthur A as someone who lived a “very reserved” life and “was not very willing to participate in real life”.Austrian school shooter planned to detonate pipe bomb, say policeRead moreA search of the flat where he lived with his mother in a suburb south of Graz had uncovered a suicide note “directed as an apology towards his family”.The first details of some of the victims began emerging on Wednesday evening. A 15-year-old Bosnian-Austrian girl called Hana was one of the first to be killed, her family said. She had been preparing to give a lecture to her class.Speaking on behalf of her Bosnian Muslim family, Sabahudin Hasić, a local imam, said they were “utterly destroyed, as is our whole community. This deed is completely unimaginable.” Hana had wanted to study medicine, he said, describing her as a “sunshine”.In a post on social media, her father wrote: “My little mouse, may God give you paradise”.Standing next to her in class had been Lea B, who was also killed. The 15-year-old’s family had come to Austria from Kosovo, and she was born in Austria. Sokol Haliti, the mayor of Viti, the family’s home town in Kosovo, told Austrian media that the community where her father was born and where her grandparents still live was in mourning.“It is a terrible tragedy. Not only for Austria. Lea was also one of us,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAustriaGun crimeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.Fury as Republicans go ‘nuclear’ in fight over California car emissionsRead moreCalifornia has some of theworst smog and air quality issuesin the nation, and has for decades been able to seek waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency that have allowed the state to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.But Trump, who has pledged to revive the US auto manufacturing industry and boost oil and gas drilling, called California’s regulations “crazy”.“It’s been a disaster for this country,” he said at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.In his first term, Trump revoked California’s ability to enforce its own standards, which Joe Biden reinstated in 2022.The move is the latest in an ongoing battle between theTrump administrationand heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, LGBTQ+ rights and immigration.The state is already involved in more than two dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed on Thursday.“The federal government’s actions are not only unlawful; they’re irrational and wildly partisan,” Bonta said. “They come at the direct expense of the health and the wellbeing of our people.”The three resolutions Trump signed will block California’s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.“I like Tesla,” Trump said.In remarks that often meandered off topic, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed “are killing our country”, the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he’d risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.“I’ll take electrocution every single day,” the president said.When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but, for those that prefer otherwise, “if you want to buy electric, you can buy electric”.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major carmakers, applauded Trump’s action.“Everyone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,” John Bozzella, the group’s president and CEO, said in a statement.Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, said Trump’s action was a continuation of his “all-out assault” on California.“And this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process,” Newsom said in a statement. “We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a president who is a wholly owned subsidiary of big polluters.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

YorkshireWaterreservoir stocks dropped 0.51% over the last week to 62.3%, significantly below the average of 85.5% for this time of year.Last month,north-west Englandentered drought status as reservoir levels fell to half their capacity. Much of the rest of the country is in prolonged dry status, which is the step before drought.Warm and dry weather is forecast, and long-range forecasts suggest a greater-than-normal chance of a hot summer.Met Office data shows Yorkshire recorded its warmest spring for mean temperature this year since records began in 1884.Dave Kaye, the director of water at Yorkshire Water, said: “We had one of the driest springs on record, which has impacted our reservoir levels, meaning they are much lower than normal for this time of year. Without significant rainfall in the coming months, temporary usage restrictions are a possibility.”The impacts of drought are already being felt in the region. Hot and dry weather can increase wildfires, and there have been several on the Pennine moorland, including large fires at Marsden Moor, Wessenden and Rishworth Moor. Farmers have also reported the beginnings of crop failures.Low water levels have made navigation difficult on canals and some rivers in the region, and there are a number of closures and restrictions in place to preserve water across the Canal & River Trust network, predominantly on the Leeds & Liverpool canal.People acrossEnglandhave been asked to conserve water as summer begins amid low river flows, groundwater levels and reservoir levels.Claire Barrow, the Environment Agency’s planning manager for Yorkshire, said: “Our climate is changing, and we had 22 days of almost no recorded rainfall in May.“While we have had some rain at the start of June, it has not been enough to reverse the impacts of the prolonged dry weather.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

For most of the year, the people of this Colombian municipality live above water and have developed ways to manage the fluctuating river levels. A network of makeshift wooden boards connects the houses in the town, allowing people to move between them.Despite the resilience of these communities, their increasingly harsh environment is beginning to overcome all the methods and systems designed to tame it, causing crop destruction, hunger and deepening poverty.View image in fullscreenRiosucio, Chocó, seen from the air – a place built between the river and the swampA recent studyby theNational Administrative Department of Statistics(Dane) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows that food insecurity increased in Colombia’s rural areas in 2024, despite an overall decrease of 0.6%. Chocó, where Riosucio is situated, experienced the largest increase, from 18.9% in 2023 to 36.3% in 2024.“Salaquí is the main food pantry of Riosucio, but it is now dying,” says Benjamin Palacios, 76, a subsistence farmer and community leader. “When the river swells, it forces them to run backwards, surrounding them and damaging their land and plantations.”View image in fullscreenBenjamin Palacios, farmer and community leaderThe Salaquí area in Riosucio comprises 12 Afrodescendant and Indigenous communities, all situated along the banks of the Salaquí River and its tributaries. According to Dane, nearly 40,000 of Riosucio’s 53,000 people live in rural areas, and about 46,000 are Afrodescendant – 71% of the population suffers from multidimensional poverty.The crisis further intensified last year when the Chocó region was hit by severe flooding. Many communities are now experiencing food insecurity, as people in the Salaquí River basin rely heavily on agriculture. They primarily plant plantain and cassava, both of which are vulnerable to flooding. Although cocoa plantations were also common, they have disappeared due to extreme weather conditions.“There are times when we only eat once a day or eat the plantain on its own,” says Berta Lozano, a Riosucio farmer with nine children, four dependent on her.View image in fullscreenBerta Lozano, mother of nine, in front of her house. Hers is one of many families in Riosucio who struggle to eat three meals dailySince the floods, farmers have been forced to travel long distances from their homes, raising costs and lowering income, as transport is mainly by boat and petrol is expensive. Poor road conditions are yet another obstacle. It is common to see trucks that have become stuck or have overturned while transporting food.Before, the rainy season would begin in April and continue until November … Now, everything is messed upAparicio Vásquez, farmer“In November, I lost my plantain production completely. Every time a neighbour told me they had nothing to eat, I’d give them from here. Now, everything is gone,” says Aparicio Vásquez, who had half a hectare with different crops by the side of the river.Communities attribute changes in weather patterns to the climate crisis and say that producing food has become much more challenging. “Before, the rainy season would begin in April and continue until November. Then it dried up, and we were able to harvest the crop. Now, everything is messed up, and we can’t figure out when is the right time to plant our crops,” he says.View image in fullscreenAparicio Vásquez keeps an eye on the flooded area. The rainy season is just starting, and the high water level worries him as it should be dry at this time of yearAs a result of the food crisis, many residents have left. Vásquez decided to stay. “Here we are subsisting, but if we are forced to leave, it would be harder,” he says. “Where would we go? What would we live from?”As well as the climate issues, the region has also been severely affected by Colombia’s armed conflict, increasing displacements. The Gaitanist Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AGC) control local movements in the area, tagging wooden houses with “AGC” to announce their territorial dominance.The Guardian was granted access to the communities of Regadero and Coco Arenal but was prohibited from visiting a third. Both communities are affected by logs and sediment blocking the Salaquí River and its tributaries, which hinders the transportation of people and goods, occasionally leading to crop losses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are rebuilding to return, but it is not easy,” says Chalá, while walking over the remains of his neighbours’ houses.Colombia’s Wayúu people live on land rich in resources.

Today, with a 1,000-metre trammel, you’d be lucky to catch 150 fish. There are even fishing trips that end with zero catch,” says Daniel Palacios Mosquera, legal representative of the artisanal fishers association, Asopescar.With food crops and fish becoming scarcer, prices have risen, further hurting those who have little. “Fish should be abundant, but they’re difficult to find, and the few we find are very expensive because they’re scarce,” says Evangelina Murillo, who works with the Association of Community Councils and Ethnic-Territorial Organisations of the Lower Atrato, an environmental group.Last November, Colombia’s president,Gustavo Petro, declared a state of emergency for 12 monthsdue to extreme weather conditions in Chocó, La Guajira and Bogotá, aiming to mitigate the effects of floods and droughts. His government has also implemented the “zero hunger” programme.View image in fullscreenActivist Evangelina Murillo. She is one of the 90% of people in the Atrato River basin with a high level of mercury in their systemDespite that, the recent Dane and FAO reports indicate that these policies were insufficient to prevent food insecurity in the Chocó region.

They’re affordable and have a long shelf life, which is essential for many people in the US like Johnson, who earns a low income and works two part-time jobs in addition to being a full-time student in Omaha,Nebraska.In the days after Donald Trump’srecent decisionto double tariffs on steel and aluminum, Johnson says he’s worried.“I know that some people have been resorting to stocking up only on non-perishable goods now before they get more expensive,” said Johnson, who has used the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) to make ends meet. “There’s a feeling of panic and having to prepare in the coming months.”One of Trump’s key campaign promises was to lowergrocery costsfor consumers who have had to contend with pandemic supply chain issues, rising food prices and inflation in recent years. But his new steel and aluminum tariffs, which took effect on4 June, threaten to do just the opposite. The new 50% tariff rate could raise food prices in a matter of months, industry trade groups and supply chain experts warn.Tariffs on canned goods, which could raise prices for items in steel cans byup to 15%, would create what some anti-hunger experts are calling a “double-whammy” for people using Snap, now that the program isfacing the biggest cuts in history. The Republican House budget bill, which passed in the House and is now under review in the Senate, would slash Snap, which is considered the US’s most effective tool in fighting hunger, taking food off the table for millions of Americans – including 2 million children – at a time when the cost of key staples is set to grow.“As grocery prices continue to rise and Snap benefits are reduced, families across the country will be left with fewer resources to meet even their basic needs,” said Gina Plata-Nino, Snap’s deputy director at theFoodResearch & Action Center (Frac). “We are likely to see a rise in food insecurity, housing instability and homelessness as more individuals and families are forced to make impossible choices between paying for food, rent, transportation and other essentials.”The current average Snap benefit is only about $6 a day per person.Parke Wilde, a food economist at Tufts University who studies food security, hunger and the economics of food assistance programs such as Snap, agreed that hunger could “worsen substantially” over the next two years as a result of these policies. “This is a sharp retrenchment in the strength of the hunger safety net,” he said.If Snap cuts are signed into law and metal tariffs are not overturned or exempted for food production, more pressure will also be placed on hunger relief organizations and food banks.“Non-perishables, including canned goods, are always part of our strategy because of their long shelf life and versatility,” said Michelle Orge, executive director of Second Harvest Foodbank of Southern Wisconsin. “Increased costs of canned goods will affect our ability to procure the amount that we have planned for and that our partners and neighbors are relying on. We will either buy less or we will buy less variety if we find a good price on certain items, but not others.“Increased costs from tariffs could also potentially affect non-perishable food donations since the cost of those items will be higher and folks may be less likely to donate them,” she said.The Can Manufacturers Institute, an industry trade group,saysthe latest tariffs would inflate canned food prices and give foreign canned food producers in Asia, including China, a chance to “undercut” US farmers and food producers.“The tariffs are a food security issue,” said Scott Breen, president of CMI. “We want to be able to manufacture cans here and fill them with food grown in the US. The tariffs create an unnecessary cost that someone has to bear: the can maker, the retailer, the brand and the consumer.”American can makers import nearly 80% of tin mill steel, the type used for products such as canned beans, tuna, chicken broth and tomato paste, a result of the cut in domestic production after the 2018 tariffs on tin mill steel during Trump’s first term. Since then, American steelmakers have shut down nine tin mill lines with only three domestic production lines remaining.CEOs from companies such as Del Monte, Goya Foods, Bush’s Beans and Hormel Foods have alreadycalled onTrump for targeted tariff relief on tin mill steel and aluminum produced by allies such as Canada before the tariff was doubled from 25% to 50%, however it is unclear if an exemption will be granted.The Aluminum Association, which represents companies that make most of the aluminum and aluminum products shipped in North America, said in a recentstatementthat the tariff of 50% “threatens to undermine the very industry the administration aims to support”.Although Trump says he is attempting to revive US manufacturing with his tariffs, rising grocery prices would be part of a ripple effect that could raise costs across various industries.In the end, it’s regular people who will pay the price.“Food insecurity is not going away … and people’s food prices are not going down,” said Frac’s Plata-Nino. “GOP policymakers haven’t thought about those things because the lived reality of average Americans is very different from those who live in wealthy places.”Explore more on these topicsFoodOur unequal earthTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hours before thecentre was set on fireby a mob of masked youths on Wednesday, Lyons had posted on social media that the building was being used to accommodate several people who had fled from Ballymena, about 20 miles (32km) away.Staff and customers, including children learning to swim, were in the leisure centre at the time of Wednesday’s attack, which coincided with violence in Ballymena amid tensions over immigration.View image in fullscreenGordon Lyons said no other party could force him to quit.Photograph: Liam McBurney/PAHours before the attack, Lyons posted on social media that “a number of individuals were temporarily moved to Larne leisure centre in the early hours of the morning after the disturbances in Ballymena.“As a local MLA [member of the legislative assembly] for the area, neither I nor my DUP colleagues were made aware or consulted on this decision until late this afternoon,” he added. “Protesting is of course a legitimate right but I would encourage everyone to remain peaceful.”Speaking to reporters on Thursday, O’Neill, of Sinn Féin, said Lyons had failed to show the correct leadership. “I think that his commentary falls very short and very much strays into the territory of inflaming the situation,” she said. “So, I think he should consider his position.”The Sinn Féin finance minister, John O’Dowd, also called on Lyons to resign, while Matthew O’Toole, the SDLP and opposition leader, said he would refer Lyons to the standards commission. “The actions of the communities minister cannot be ignored,” he said. “He is the minister responsible for the housing executive and lives are at stake.”Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary, also called on Lyons to reflect on his comments.Lyons is defying the calls, saying that under Stormont’s system of government no other party can force him to quit: “That is not in their gift.”Lyons told the BBC his message “was posted because rumours had been circulating that the leisure centre was being turned into a permanent centre” and that was no longer the case. He said he was trying to defuse the situation.The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Jon Boutcher, said the recent disorder in Northern Ireland was “absolutely race-motivated”.Speaking at a news conference he said 41 police officers had been injured and 14 arrests had been made so far. Addressing targeted communities, Boutcher said: “We stand shoulder to shoulder with you. These bigots and racists will not win the day.”O’Neill and the deputy first minister, Emma Little-Pengelly, appeared together on Wednesday to condemn the violence.Echoing comments from the police, the first minister said: “It’s pure racism, there’s no other way to dress it up.” Little-Pengelly described the scenes in Ballymena as “utter thuggery”.Police came under attack for a fourth consecutive night on Thursday as unrest spread to multiple towns across the region.In Portadown, missiles were thrown at officers during a protest, continuing a pattern of disorder that began earlier in the week in Ballymena. While tensions remained high, Thursday’s incidents appeared to be of lower intensity compared with previous flare-ups.Police said a separate protest in east Belfast concluded early in the evening without major incident.The latest disturbances follow strong words from Northern Ireland’s police chief, who said “bigots and racists” were behind the violence.There were calls for urgent action after the names of streets and addresses in Ballymena were posted on a Facebook page with some designated “local”, the apparent suggestion being that they should not be targeted.The local Sinn Féin MLA, Philip McGuigan, has called on the police and Meta to take action. “This is a very dangerous situation in Ballymena, and what is happening is absolutely disgusting and disgraceful,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandRaceDemocratic Unionist party (DUP)Northern Irish politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The scale of the demand inspired specialists such as Lindt to launch their own versions as well as supermarkets from Lidl toWaitrose.The FSA’s chief scientific adviser, Prof Robin May, said: “The vast majority of food in the UK is safe, but some imported Dubai-style chocolate products don’t meet our standards and could be a food safety risk, especially for consumers with allergies.“We advise sticking with trusted retailers, like the ones you’d use for your weekly shop, as products are more likely to be made for UK consumers and so are safe to eat.”By law, products made to UK standards should have labels in English that carry a list of ingredients, with the allergens emphasised. The packet should also give the name and address of the UK or EU business responsible for the product information.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not a choice between assisted dying or palliative care – I firmly believe we should take a holistic approach to choice and care for terminally ill people.”Critics of the bill say the prohibition of advertising is not strong enough because of a loophole that would allow any future health secretary to determine exceptions to the ban. The Labour MP Paul Waugh, who opposes the bill, has tabled additional protections that would allow communications only between health professionals and those who had already requested to find out more about an assisted death.Leadbeater said she was still meeting and hearing from MPs about ways the bill could be improved. “One area where supporters and opponents, both in parliament and in the country, agree is that if we are to pass this legislation it should be the best and safest bill possible. I’m confident it can and will be,” she wrote.She said the bill would have received up to 200 hours of consideration if it passes the House of Lords, “placing it among the most heavily scrutinised bills in recent times”.Other amendments tabled by Leadbeater include a clause on the regulation of substances used to hasten the death of patients who choose an assisted death. The bill would allow those in England and Wales with less than six months to live, who are terminally ill and of sound mind, to have an assisted death. There is relatively little detail on what that would mean in terms of the procedure contained in the bill.There would also be extra duties on the health secretary to consult people with learning disabilities, providers of health and care services including palliative and end-of-life care, and people with protected characteristics – such as race, religion and belief.Leadbeater said she would back an amendment from the Liberal Democrat MP Munira Wilson – an opponent of the bill – for the government to undertake a detailed assessment of the state of palliative and end-of-life care.“I fully support it. It is not a choice between assisted dying or palliative care – I firmly believe we should take a holistic approach to choice and care for terminally ill people,” Leadbeater said. “This amendment also has the backing of Marie Curie and others in the charitable and end-of-life sector.”MPs will have their final vote on the bill next Friday with more than a dozen believed to have switched sides to oppose the bill, though at least three have moved to support it.On Wednesday the Labour party chair, Ellie Reeves, who abstained at the last vote, confirmed she would vote for the bill. But two others, including the former health minister Andrew Gwynne and the Labour MP Paul Foster, suggested they would now oppose the legislation.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingDeath and dyingLabourAdvertisingnewsShareReuse this content"

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have warned Palestinians not to approach food distribution points before 6am. The GHF reportedly claimed on its Arabic Facebook page that it had carried out a 3am food distribution.The GHF did not respond to inquiries about the night distribution but its newly appointed chair, the evangelical preacher and Trump adviser Johnnie Moore, said on social media: “These dear people were murdered by Hamas because they just wanted to feed their people. They were not militants. They were humanitarians, many of them young people.“The principle of impartiality does not mean neutrality. There is good and evil in this world. What we are doing is good and what Hamas did to these Gazans is absolute evil.”Hamas has not commented on the GHF claims, but said it had killed 12 members of the Israeli-backed Abu Shabab group after detaining them overnight. There have been increasingly bloody clashes in recent days between Hamas and the militia led by an Israeli-backed local warlord,Yasser abu Shabab. Reports from Khan Younis in southern Gaza said Abu Shabab members were publicly executed overnight in the city.Israeli forceskilled at least 60 Palestinians in Gazaon Wednesday, nearly two-thirds of them as they were seeking food from GHF food points, according to local health authorities.There were more mass casualties reported on Thursday morning. The Palestinian civil defence agency told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that Israeli forces had killed 22 people across Gaza, of whom 16 had been waiting to collect food.View image in fullscreenRelatives mourn near the body of Ahmed al-Sharbasi, a Palestinian father of nine children, killed by the Israeli army while waiting for food in Gaza City.Photograph: Anadolu/GettyThe distribution of food and basic supplies in the war-ravaged Gaza Strip has become increasingly fraught and perilous, exacerbating the territory’s deep hunger crisis.A civil defence official, Mohammed al-Mughayyir, told AFP that al-Awda hospital received 10 dead and about 200 wounded, including women and children, “after Israeli drones dropped multiple bombs on gatherings of civilians near an aid distribution point around the Netzarim checkpoint in central Gaza”.In parallel with the GHF effort, Israel has begun allowing limited UN food aid to enter Gaza for the first time in three months after themass casualtiessince the attempt to set up the militarised US-Israeli alternative.The IDF said on Thursday morning that 56 humanitarian aid trucks from the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) had crossed into Gaza the previous day through the Zikim crossing at the northern end of the occupied territory. The food was allowed in “with the approval of the political echelon and on the recommendation of the security authorities”, an IDF statement said.The WFP confirmed it had been able to get some food into Gaza over the past few days but not to distribute it in any organised way. After several incidents of looting, the aid agency has been driving trucks into populated areas and allowing local people to unload the food themselves.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“Since the limited resumption of humanitarian assistance into Gaza on 19 May, WFP has been able to bring only small amounts of food into Gaza. This is largely due to delays or denials of permission for humanitarian movements due to expanded military operations,” the WFP said in a statement.It said fewer than 7,000 metric tonnes of aid had entered Gaza by 11 June. Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on 9 March, partly lifting it in May for the WFP and GHF supplies, but it will not allow the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, to carry out distribution.Unrwa has by far the biggest aid distribution network in Gaza but it has been banned by Israel on the grounds of allegations of complicity with Hamas. After an internal investigation,Unrwa fired nine of its 13,000 employeesin Gaza in August 2024 on suspicion of involvement in the Hamas attack the previous October, but found no evidence to substantiate Israel’s broader claims. Israel cut all ties with Unrwa in January, with backing from the Trump administration.Israeli forces kill at least 60 Palestinians seeking food in Gaza, health officials sayRead moreThe GHF is intended to be a substitute for Unrwa but its method of delivering food to a limited number of sites in heavily militarised areas has led to more than 160 deaths since it began operations two weeks ago as Israeli forces have opened fire on desperate Palestinians trying to reach the food distribution points.The GHF’s plan to set up a militarised food delivery system wascriticised by humanitarian expertsand its first directorresignedbecause he said the scheme ran counter to “humanitarian principles”.“The so-called new way of handling assistance in Gaza is most degrading, humiliating and puts lives in danger,” Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, said on social media. “This ‘model’ will not address the deepening hunger. The dystopian ‘Hunger Games’ cannot become the new reality. The UN including Unrwa have the knowledge, expertise & community trust to provide dignified and safe assistance. Just let the humanitarians do their jobs.”The UN said on Thursday that there was a full internet blackout in the Gaza Strip, which was likely to have been caused by military activity damaging the last cable into the territory, which has paralysed aid operations.“Lifelines to emergency services, humanitarian coordination and critical information for civilians have all been cut. There is a full internet blackout, and mobile networks are barely functioning,” the deputy UN spokesperson, Farhan Haq, told reporters.“In a context already limited by physical access restrictions and widespread damage, emergency services are cut off, and civilians cannot access life-saving support.”Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warHamasUnited NationsPalestinian territoriesAidMiddle East and north AfricaShareReuse this content"

Courts previously have upheld the legality of such laws.But Trump’s administration has sued Colorado, Illinois, New York and several cities, including Chicago and Rochester, New York, asserting their policies violate the US constitution or federal law.Illinois, Minnesota and New York also were among 14 states and hundreds of cities and counties recently listed by the Department of Homeland Security as “sanctuary jurisdictions defying federal immigration law”. The list later was removed from the department’s website after criticism that it erroneously included some local governments that support Trump’s immigration policies.Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor and Kamala Harris’s running mate in the 2024 presidential election, was the first to testify on Thursday. He rejected the assertion that Minnesota is a sanctuary state. It has no statewide law protecting immigrants in the US illegally from deportation, though Minneapolis and St Paul both restrict the extent to which police and city employees can cooperate with immigration enforcement.“Enforcing immigration law is not the role of local and state governments,” said Walz.Heavily Democratic Chicago has been a sanctuary city for decades. In 2017, the then Illinois governor, Bruce Rauner, a Republican, signed legislation creating statewide protections for immigrants.Governor JB Pritzker, who succeeded Rauner in 2019, said that violent criminals “have no place on our streets, and if they are undocumented, I want them out of Illinois and out of our country”.The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, said law enforcement officers still can cooperate with federal immigration authorities when people are convicted of or under investigation for crimes.“What we don’t do is civil immigration enforcement – that’s the federal government’s job,” Hochul said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationNew YorkPam BondiUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the transition, the image’s visual contrast appears to be manipulated, slightly lightening Mamdani’s skin but also giving him the appearance of a longer and significantly fuller beard.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueThe mailer,first revealedby a reporter from the Forward, was aimed at Jewish voters. It accuses Mamdani, who is openly critical of Israel’s war in Gaza which he calls a genocide, of refusing to recognize Israel and supporting the boycott movement against the state.A spokesperson for Fix the City, Liz Benjamin, said that the mailer had not been released in the form that Mamdani found objectionable. “The mailer was proposed by a vendor; upon review it was immediately rejected for production and was subsequently corrected.”She added: “We are disturbed that this was posted online without our consent.”Mamdani, who would become the first Muslim mayor of New York should he prevail in the Democratic primary on 24 June and go on to win the general election in November, said the altered image amounted to “blatant Islamophobia”. He added a dig at Cuomo, referring to his big money donors who also backDonald Trumpand the president’s Make America great again movement.The image, Mamdani said, was a demonstration of “the kind of racism that explains why Maga billionaires support [Cuomo’s] campaign”.Mamdani also cast the altered image as a sign that Cuomo and his donors were afraid of losing the mayoral race. Recent polls have suggested a tightening contest, with one recentinternal poll, disputed by the Cuomo campaign, indicating that Mamdani was edging in front.The New York mayoral race is being followed very closely in political circles, partly because the city is the largest in the US and partly because the clash between Cuomo and Mamdani could be a referendum on the future of the Democratic party. Cuomo, 67, is a consummate machine politician who was elected as governor three times beforeresigning in 2021following accusations of sexual harassment which he denies.He has been endorsed by Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of the city.Mamdani, by contrast, is a progressive state lawmaker from Queens who immigrated to the US from Uganda when he was seven. He was elected as a member of theNew Yorkstate assembly four years ago.A self-identified democratic socialist, he was endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the leading progressive member of Congress. He is running on a platform of making the city affordable to working New Yorkers, through a combination of rent freezes, free childcare and free and faster bus transport.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsNew YorkAndrew CuomoDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was also recently attached to a new Care Bears film.While Spaceballs received mixed reviews upon release, it gained a cult following in the years after. The original also starred John Candy, Rick Moranis and Bill Pullman.Deadline is alsoreportingthat sources have claimed Pullman and Moranis will return for the sequel with Keke Palmer also joining. Palmer enjoyed a sleeper hit earlier this year withOne of Them Days.In a 2014 interview, Brooks said he wouldn’t do a sequel without Moranis. “Without Rick, I wouldn’t do it,”he said. “I’ve got the helmet in storage, just waiting for him.

As Payne appears in Building the Band, we delve into the unnerving world of posthumous televisionStuart HeritageThu 12 Jun 2025 07.41 EDTLast modified on Thu 12 Jun 2025 08.47 EDTShareAt first glance, Netflix’s new series Building the Band comes off as a weird amalgam of every singing competition show you loved a decade and a half ago. There’s the core DNA of X Factor. The singers perform out of sight of everyone else, so it cribs fromThe Voice. Clearly, there’s heavy borrowing from Making the Band. Plus, this is Netflix, so everything looks a bit like Squid Game.But this odd mishmash of a format isn’t what will keep you away from Building the Band. No, what will keep you away from Building the Band is the posthumous appearance ofLiam Payne.Last year, Payne was named as a member of the Building the Band judging panel. He filmed his parts for the series in August 2024. However, two months later, he died aged 31 in circumstances that the tabloids feasted upon for months.Yesterday the first clip of Building the Band was released, and producers confirmed that the One Direction star will still appear as a member of the onscreen judging team. “Liam Payne’s family reviewed the series and is supportive of his inclusion,” Netflix said in a statement. And suddenly what looked at first like the most inoffensive piece of background fluff has become uncomfortably charged.Unfortunately, this is not a unique problem. Several productions have had to contend with the unexpected death of their talent. How this is handled relies entirely upon the nature of the star, the death and the production.The most drastic but perhaps the most appropriate thing to do in this situation is to shut down production entirely. This, after all, is what happened on the 1962 film Something’s Got to Give after the death of Marilyn Monroe. Admittedly it was a troubled production from the start, with Monroe being fired and rehired due to her lateness and inability to remember lines, but the film was impossible to complete without her and now exists as a handful of scraps of footage.View image in fullscreenFacing it head-on … Glee returned with an episode devoted to Cory Monteith after he died.Photograph: Startraks Photo/Rex FeaturesAnother option is to acknowledge what happened upfront. When Cory Monteith died between seasons of Glee, the show chose to return with an episode devoted to the death of his character and the impact it had on those around him. Similarly, John Ritter’s death was treated by his show 8 Simple Rules as a way for the cast, crew and audience to grieve for him together, blurring the lines between character and actor in a way that remains incredibly touching.Less successful are the productions that attempt to keep the dead alive. Perhaps the only misstep in the entire run of The Sopranos was its effort to complete the storyline of Livia Soprano after the death of Nancy Marchand. Her final scene was cobbled together with unused footage and ham-fisted CGI in such a way that it was impossible to suspend disbelief. Yes, it was a horrible decision, but in retrospect the haphazard execution wasn’t particularly fair on the character or the performer. Plus, let’s not blame this creepiness on emergent technology, since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker did the same thing with Carrie Fisher and the end result was just as eerie.View image in fullscreenA digitally enhanced image of Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.Photograph: Lucasfilm LtdSo what will Building the Band do? Well, the team have evidently not shut down production, and we can assume they haven’t built a CGI re-creation of Liam Payne. From all the available information, it doesn’t seem as though Payne was a central part of the show – the Hollywood Reporter describes his role as “guest judge”, which might mean his participation was limited to a single episode. If that’s the case, the show will be able to package his appearance as a tribute to his life and career, which seems like the most respectful outcome.But if Payne was present for more episodes, the show will be faced with an uncomfortable transition. One moment he will be there, and the next minute not. This sort of porous judging panel used to happen on a fairly regular basis on X Factor, but the circumstances are far more serious this time. The show doesn’t have to brush off a backstage tantrum or scheduling conflict. It has to reckon with the tragic death of a young man. It isn’t an edit that can be easily smoothed over.Ultimately, you suspect that Building the Band as a whole is destined to be overshadowed by the fate of Liam Payne. His appearances, however short, are going to be scrutinised, either for signs of promise that were sadly snuffed out or for glimpses of the pain that was evident in his final days. When there’s something that heavy going on, a bunch of hopefuls crooning on a stage simply don’t stand a chance.Building the Band is onNetflixfrom 9 JulyExplore more on these topicsTelevisionLiam PayneReality TVNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The result is a powerful indictment of our justice systemAmelia GentlemanThu 12 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareThe directors of Holloway use a simple but powerful visual device to demonstrate how badly the British prison system is failing the women it incarcerates. Towards the end of their eponynmous documentary, six former inmates are invited to play a version of Grandmother’s Footsteps in the chapel of the deserted ex-prison, where they have been filming for five days.They begin lined up against the wall and a voice tells them: “Step forward if you grew up in a chaotic household.” All six women step forward, before being instructed: “Step forward if you experienced domestic violence growing up.” Again, they move ahead in unison. “Step forward if somebody in your household has experienced drug use. Step forward if you grew up in a household where there wasn’t very much money. Step forward if a member of your family has been to prison …”When I got to my cell, I felt my 18-year-old self cry outBy the time the exercise is over, almost all the women have silently made their way from one side of the room to the other, starkly highlighting the film’s fundamental theme: the UK’s prisons are full of vulnerable women being punished – at great expense – and not helped.Shortly before Holloway prison began to be demolished in 2022, directors Sophie Compton and Daisy-May Hudson secured permission to film inside the abandoned site in London, watching as six women returned to the cells where they were once held, to explore how they all ended up imprisoned as young women. Directors of a more conventional documentary might have plonked the participants on the bare iron frames of their old prison beds and instructed them to pour out their life stories, poking and prodding them for all the shocking details. Compton and Hudson take a subtler approach, arranging the women in a circle, supervised by a trained therapist, and waiting to see what emerges.View image in fullscreen‘I’m angry that some kids are born into certain circumstances’ ... Aliyah Ali, left, and Mandy Ogunmokun.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianIt is a risky strategy. The flow of the conversation is faltering, interrupted by nervousness about how their words will be used, suspicion about the directors’ intentions – and a sudden, uncomfortable request for the most difficult conversations to continue without the cameras rolling. The film includes all this uncertainty: they debate whether they should proceed before realising their desire to talk about the justice system’s failures mostly outweighs their concerns about sharing chapters from their complicated pasts.Compton (Emmy nominated for her documentary on deepfake pornography,Another Body) and Hudson (who won a Bafta Breakthrough award for her filmHalf Way, documenting her own family’sexperience of homelessness) have the confidence to make their subjects collaborators on the project, inviting them into the editing process, to ensure everyone feels happy with how their experiences have been handled. “They could say what they did and didn’t like,” Hudson says. “They wanted more laughter included. Our wish was that they felt proud of the film.”Once western Europe’s largest women’s prison, Holloway has a significant place in British history. More than 300 suffragettes were held in a wing of the original building during the early 20th century. Ruth Ellis was hanged there in 1955, the last woman to be executed in the UK. Greenham Common protesters spent time here. Sarah Reed, who had previously been a victim of police brutality in 2012,died in her cell in 2016.This is not the story the film sets out to tell. “It’s not a film about Holloway; other films can tell a historical story or show the realities of being in prison,” says Compton, who I meet along with Hudson and two of the film’s participants, Aliyah Ali and Mandy Ogunmokun. “This is about a group of women returning to Holloway, and finding they are not the same people they were when they were in prison.”The women each respond differently when they walk through the corridors of the site, which closed in 2016. Some take delight in defying forgotten rules, skipping along walkways that were previously out of bounds. One begins by cheerfully telling the cameras how she viewed her time at Holloway as a holiday camp experience – it takes days for her to admit the extent to which her attitude is just a protective front. Another observes approvingly the way that brambles and ferns have started to reclaim the space, springing from beneath the plug sockets and creeping through the windows. “It feels kind of healing to see that Holloway prison is falling apart,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘They wanted more laughter included’ … directors Sophie Compton, left, and Daisy-May Hudson.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianSome remember with horror the noise of night-time screaming, but several are surprised by the unexpected feelings of affection the building triggers. “It was probably the first time that I was in an environment which was controlled and felt safe,” Ali, 31, tells me. “It’s sad that for a lot of us, the first time we felt that connection of belonging and sisterhood, we found it in prison. What does that say about society?”She was sent to Holloway at 18. “Growing up how I grew up, you’re conditioned to just brush things off and get on with things, and wear masks and stay strong. When I went back to my first cell, I felt my 18-year-old self cry out.”Ali is initially the most reluctant of the six participants. The founder of a non-profit organisation,The Daddyless Daughters Project, she has rebuilt her life, radiates strength and seems visibly irritated by the entire setup. “I was worried they could edit our voices and create a narrative that we weren’t hoping for,” she says. “I was thinking, ‘We’re trusting them with a level of vulnerability that we’re not comfortable with. What are these people going to do with it?’”Gradually she was reassured and slowly began to reveal some of the childhood events that catapulted her into prison – family breakdown, domestic violence, a move to a women’s refuge, then later into a residential children’s home at the age of 12. Her problems escalated when she got caught up in county lines dealing, as a child exploited by criminal gangs to move and supply drugs. “I was introduced to selling drugs, which I was very good at, and it was the first time that I started to feel a sense of worth,” she finally reveals on camera.She is dismayed to remember how little support she received as a child. “The system saw me as a bad girl … as somebody who asked for all of this,” she says in the film. “It was always, ‘What’s wrong with you? Why can’t you just behave? Why can’t you just stop doing this?’ Nothing was asked about what actually happened to me,” she says.View image in fullscreenUnexpected feelings … one of the women who returned to Holloway takes a photograph in a cell.Her fury is echoed by Ogunmokun. “It’s so frustrating to see how similar the stories of people going in and out of prison are. Change is so slow,” she says. The daughter of a woman who struggled with addiction, she also spent some of her childhood in care, went to Holloway first aged 20, and was in and out repeatedly for two decades until she shook off her own drug addiction aged 40. “I’m angry that some kids are born into certain circumstances, and what chance do they have?”Ogunmokun, 66, has dedicated the 25 years since leaving Holloway to helping former addictsbreak the cycle of addiction and offending. “Every time I reoffended the judge would say: ‘You haven’t learned anything.’” She didn’t get the support she needed to change while she was in prison, through no real fault of the prison staff. “The officers see horrific things, but they’re not trained counsellors – they’re not mental health trained, they’re not sex-trafficking trained, they’re not domestic violence trained. They’ve got a regime they have to run by.” She hopes the film might persuade viewers that there needs to be a revolution in the way that female offenders are treated.I was an addict, a prisoner, a sex worker. I thought the world had written me off – but I saved myselfRead moreIt is almost 20 years since the seminalCorston reporton vulnerable women in the criminal justice system called for a radically different strategy, but many of the report’s key recommendations have yet to be implemented. Hudson and Compton struggled for several years to raise funding to finish their film. Now they feel happy that it is being released at a time when there is some emerging optimism about the possibility of change. “The simple truth is that we are sending too many women to prison,” the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said earlier this year. “We need to do things differently.” The film will be screened at an event with the prisons minister, James Timpson, in parliament later this month.Hudson’s first fiction film,Lollipop, which comes out this month too, also features a woman who has recently left prison. She says both projects examine the way vulnerable women are shamed and blamed, as well as trying to showcase “the power of women that society tries to put on the outskirts”.Ali is satisfied with how the film has turned out, and wants it to be shown to young people in prisons, to offer hope that lives can alter course. Despite her early reservations, she is impressed by the directors’ creation. “It’s been emotionally turbulent,” she says, “but they’ve done an amazing job.”Holloway is in UK cinemas from 20 June.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsWomenPrisons and probationUK criminal justicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately, it also leaves the viewer in suspense about her motive for so long it feels horrifically manipulativeLucy ManganThu 12 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 12 Jun 2025 09.05 EDTShareWell, what doyouthink a 90-minute documentary entitled Confessions of a Parent Killer is going to be about? That’s right, well done! It’s the story of amurder by an (adult) child of her parents. Virginia – Ginny – McCullough killed her mother, Lois, and father, John, and confessed immediately to police when they raided her home in 2023 that she had done so four years previously. The twist was that she had been living with their bodies ever since. “She was weird at school,” says a childhood friend. “But not ‘kill your parents and hide the bodies’ weird.”You can probably tell from such unimpeachably phlegmatic commentary that this case occurred in England. Great Baddow,Essex, to be exact, and the film paints a portrait of quintessential small-town, almost-rural life in these sceptred isles that has gone unchanged for generations and, you suspect, will survive for many more.Everybody knew the family, yes. Grocer Paul; Alan, who rented John and Lois various bits of kit from his electronics shop on the high street; florists Rachel and Debbie and, of course, a number of thirtysomething women – “Ella”, Bethan, Kirsty, Lisa – knew Ginny from school. Everyone thought the family was a bit odd, yes. There were rumours that John, a university lecturer who liked a drink (“very curt, brusque”, never said goodbye to Alan after he paid his monthly rent), was relentlessly strict with his daughters and that was why they all left home as soon as they could, though Ginny kept having to come back when her various jobs left her short of cash. And Lois was strange, quiet, unsmiling, “subdued”, “withdrawn”.Ginny was more outgoing. She started coming in instead of her mum or dad to pay Alan. Spent a lot of time and money in the florist, too, since she came back to sort the house out four or five years ago. Always full of stories (“a bit of a fantasist”, “always some drama going on”), perhaps a little needy and annoying; you can see in the descriptions of her as an adult the shadow of the bullied, friendless child Bethan et al remembered. “I don’t like my mum at all,” young Ginny once told Bethan, on whom she lavished presents that “she’d obviously just nicked from around the house” when they sat next to each other in year 2.‘Cheer up!’ Ginny cajoles the shocked officers. ‘At least you caught the bad guy!’But, well, every community has these people, don’t they? It takes all sorts. You just accommodate them, make allowances, they don’t hurt anyone. Until. Unless. Then you look back and, you wonder, don’t you? Ginny returned the equipment to Alan in 2021 – she said her parents had moved to Clacton. People do.It was their GP who first contacted the police, after becoming concerned that John and Lois had missed numerous appointments. It turned out that no one had seen them for years. Investigations resulted in the raid. Bodycam footage shows an unfazed Ginny assuring officers of her cooperation and telling them that her father’s body is in the sitting room. And mum? “That’s a little bit more complicated,” says Ginny, delicately. Mum is in a sleeping bag in a wardrobe upstairs, the doors taped against the flies and maggots that had been struggling to escape. “Cheer up!” she cajoles the shocked officers. “At least you caught the bad guy!”Woman pleads guilty to murdering parents at family home in EssexRead moreBut why did she do it? Here, the programme becomes as manipulative as any psychopath. Numerous suggestions are trailed. “Exclusive” letters (written, it seems, to one of the film-makers) from McCullough herself suggest an abused child of a mentally unwell mother and alcoholic father, who finally cracked. Some of the Great Baddowan testimonies appear to back this up. But a detective insists that she is a cold-blooded killer. A forensic psychiatrist – not the one on her case – does the intensely annoying thing of dressing up common sense as professional insight (she may have kept the bodies because she felt connected to them, or it may have been because it is so hard to dispose of corpses. Either way, it must have been “psychologically taxing”).It is not until the final minutes that all the facts are laid before us. The new ones make it clear that psychopathy and a financial motive should have been given more weight, and that the viewer has been kept in a state of much greater uncertainty and intrigue than we would or could otherwise have been. A narrative must be shaped and an amount of storytelling leeway granted – but this goes far beyond that and taints the overall endeavour to an unpalatable extent.Confessions of a Parent Killer is on Paramount+ nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionDocumentaryCrimeEssexreviewsShareReuse this content"

It has an unhurried, thoughtful and very human quality;Helen Mirrenwon the best actress award at Cannes for her performance here and in fact it is very well acted across the board by a blue-chip cast.Mirren plays Marcella, a woman from a Catholic background, married across the sectarian divide to a reserve police officer murdered at his parents’ farmhouse by an IRA man who had bullied a bewildered local guy into being his getaway driver; this is Cal, played by the gauntly intense John Lynch. Cal lives with his widowed father; a gentle performance by Donal McCann, who was Gabriel Conroy in John Huston’s The Dead. But as the only Catholics in a Protestant neighbourhood, they are burned out of their home by loyalist gangs. Having quit his job at the gruesome abattoir, Cal gets a job labouring at Marcella’s farm and is allowed to live in an outbuilding; Marcella’s fiercely Protestant brother-in-law and mother-in-law (excellent performances from Ray McAnally and Catherine Gibson) take pity and almost a shine to the poor, put-upon Cal. And Cal, despite or because of being secretly complicit in the murder of Marcella’s husband, and intensely aware of her loneliness and ambiguous nameless yearning, falls deeply in love with her.There can’t be many movies about love in which the principals don’t so much as kiss until an hour and a quarter into the running time. What leads up to the main event is an observant, bleak, sometimes mordantly funny and compassionate account of everyone’s melancholy existence; it then becomes an almost Hardyesque romance of the countryside as Cal initially gets a job potato-picking and is ferried out to the fields with all the other hired hands in the back of a van.Having nothing to do most of the time, Cal is always being chivvied into doing “jobs” for his overbearing mate Crilly (Stevan Rimkus), who is in awe of the local republican hard man, Skeffington (John Kavanagh). There is one black-comic scene in which Cal has to be the driver when, to boost IRA coffers, Crilly robs a cinema showing Superman III. There is much ambient detail to notice, including Sinn Féin posters showing the face of Martin McGuinness. (Could anyone have guessed that 28 years later he would be shaking hands with the queen?) Lovers of classic 80s British cinema will appreciate that a tough RUC man is played by Daragh O’Malley, who would go on to play the dodgy guy shouting “perfumed ponce” in a Camden pub in Withnail and I. Most of all, Mirren and Lynch’s love scene is a model for how to show sex in a grownup, candid, non-exploitative way; this was a career highlight for Mirren and an outstanding debut for the young Lynch.Cal is in UK and Irish cinemas from 13 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRomance filmsFilm adaptationsNorthern IrelandHelen MirrenPeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But while his studio work was extensive, it was the huge volume of recordings made officially and unofficially at his recitals across more than 40 years that really bulked out his discography, with multiple versions available of many of the core works in his repertory. For those reasons the rediscovery of “Lost Tapes” might not initially seem so remarkable. The performances, of fourBeethovenpiano sonatas, Opp 31 no 3, 90, 101 and 110, are taken from recitals that Richter gave in 1965. Op 110 comes from a performance at the piano festival he had founded the previous year at La Grange de Meslay near Tours, the others are taken from a concert in Lucerne three months later.View image in fullscreenSviatoslav Richter: The Lost TapesThere are recordings of Richter’s performances of all four sonatas already in the catalogue, but the immediacy of these versions is startling. He was never content to keep on replicating the interpretation of a particular work; temperamentally, I suspect, he could not contemplate such lazy routine. Instead, each work was approached afresh each time he played it, always finding something new, whether it’s the joy that courses through the third of the Op 31 set, the myriad colours and subtleties he brings to Op 101, or the serene, almost liturgical seriousness with which he presents the fugues in the finale of Op 110.The original recordings were made by Deutsche Grammophon engineers, who were following Richter around Europe that year, and the sound has been refined for this release. What has proved more intractable has obviously been the piano tone itself, which, in the Lucerne performances especially, seems very bright and rather shallow, sometimes sounding almost like a mid 19th-century instrument. It does take a bit of the gloss off the performances, but the playing is still glorious.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

It contains an outstanding account of one Britten’s greatest orchestral achievements, the Sinfonia da Requiem, and a fine one of a suite (Gardner’s own selection) from Britten’s only full-length ballet, The Prince of the Pagodas, together with the first recording of a fascinating orchestration by Robin Holloway of Britten’s Thomas Hardy song cycle Winter Words.View image in fullscreenBritten: Sinfonia da Requiem, Winter WordsIn a note on his orchestrations, Holloway declares that Winter Words is his favourite among Britten’s song cycles and that Britten and Hardy “seem made for each other”. But in its general tone and subject matter – nature, the changing seasons, and man’s place among them – and Britten’s treatment of them there’s an introspection and intimacy, which doesn’t automatically suggest the large scale “public” exposure of an orchestral song cycle. But Holloway’s interventions are wonderfully discreet and subtly imaginative, especially in his use of the marimba and xylophone, and tenor Nicky Spence’s careful performance certainly respects that.(Not available on Apple music and Spotify)Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBenjamin BrittenLondon Philharmonic OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

When a neighbour, K, hears her screams, he rushes over to help, cracking raw eggs over the scalds to soothe the pain. “So I began as K’s patient though he ended as mine,” Sashi reflects.Set in 1980s Sri Lanka, VV Ganeshananthan’s coming-of-age novel – which won the 2024 Women’s prize for fiction – is an epic and hard-hitting tale of family and survival as it documents life during the civil war between Tamil separatists and the Sinhalese majority that lasted three decades. Before fighting breaks out, Sashi’s most pressing problem is whether she will pass her exams at school. But soon violence and kidnapping become the norm, communities are left “brotherless” and ordinary citizens are turned into what the outside world calls terrorists.Sashi, who becomes a trainee doctor, begins working as a field hospital medic, and finds her loyalties put to the test. She must also reckon with her feelings for K, who has filled her thoughts ever since he came to her aid in her teens, and who becomes a high-ranking Tamil Tiger official.Nirmala Rajasingam is the narrator, her mellifluous reading drawing out the subtle intimacy and compassion in Ganeshananthan’s prose. Contemplating her love for K, Sashi reflects: “I wanted the life on the other side of the war’s looking-glass, the future we might have had, and which no longer existed.”Available via Penguin Audio, 13hr 28minFurther listeningOld God’s TimeSebastian Barry, Faber, 8hr 34minStephen Hogan narrates this Booker prize-longlisted tale of a retired policeman whose solitude is interrupted by two ex-colleagues looking for assistance on a case.We All Shine On: John, Yoko & MeElliot Mintz, Penguin Audio, 9hr 9minMintz, the one-time radio host and publicist to the stars, documents his close friendship with John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

It was tender, ravishing, shattering – you believed every word of it. The book had an effortless narrative authority that most first-time novelists would kill for.Love Forms is every bit as alive and convincing, and returns us to Trinidad, with its potent fizz of colour, heat and political instability. But unlike the earlier book, it’s also set partly in south London – the writer’s own home turf – and has a mother, rather than a father, at its heart.Dawn, our “white, young, rich” narrator, is the youngest child of a well-known Trinidadian fruit juice dynasty. At 16, after a brief encounter with a tourist at carnival in Trinidad, she finds herself pregnant. Petrified of the stigma, her otherwise caring parents make a “pact” never to speak of it again, dispatching her, under cover of darkness, on a terrifying and chillingly evoked boat trip to Venezuela. Here she spends four months with nuns who deliver her baby – a girl she never sees again – then is returned to Trinidad to resume her schooling as if nothing has happened.But somethinghashappened. And 40 years later, now an ex-GP living in London, divorced with two grown-up sons, Dawn is still bereft, still searching. Not just for her daughter but, because her memories of her time in Venezuela are so cloaked in shame and secrecy, for what feels like a missing part of herself.Her family kept to their pact and the episode has never again been mentioned, but for Dawn the questions have only grown more pressing with time. What part of Venezuela was she sent to? Who exactly were the nuns? Most of all, who was that traumatised teenage girl who gave up her baby so easily? After years of emotionally exhausting research – letter writing, internet forums, DNA tests – she’s still no closer to the truth. And then one night a young woman in Italy gets in touch. So many of her details seem to fit. Could this be Dawn’s long-lost baby?Adam is great on the unsaid, the half-said, and the way feelings will unravel and morph over the yearsIt’s a situation rich with logistical and emotional possibilities, all of which Adam mines with subtlety and finesse. What could all too easily have been a straightforward case of will-she-won’t-she find her long-lost child is somehow both more mundane and more unsettling.Would Dawn have had a better life if she’d kept her baby? In many ways, probably not: she was able to go to medical school and make a career for herself. Yet still the terrible, unspoken loss has left its mark on every member of the family: not just her parents, but her older brothers, her somewhat disengaged ex-husband and her sons, whose understandable priority is to protect her from further hurt.It’s her parents who, believing they were acting in her best interests, are most infuriated by Dawn’s apparent inability to hold on to the good life she’s made for herself. “The man had enough!” her mother explodes in frustration when, after years of putting the search before everything else, her daughter’s marriage breaks down. All they ever wanted was for her to have done well despite her “trouble” – her mother’s elation at noting, on a visit to the marital home in leafy Wandsworth, that she has a cooker with eight rings, is a lovely touch.Still, Dawn’s abiding sense of loss, the instinctive feeling of her daughter’s absence, which “always arrived somewhere in my abdomen, the sudden shock, like remembering laundry left out in the rain or children not picked up from school”, is something whose power cannot be overestimated. Adam is great on the unsaid, the half-said, and the way feelings will unravel and morph over the years. “Mothers will fight off lions,” Dawn tells her father in a rare, late moment of reckoning. “Actually it was you I should have been fighting … you were the lion. I didn’t realise it back then.” It’s credit to this novel’s ability to wrongfoot you that at this moment you find yourself feeling a flicker of sympathy for her father.And this sense of uncertainty and unease continues to the end. The final pages, which unfold at the family’s beach house on Tobago, are as gripping as any thriller, and the ending, when it comes, feels as right as it is devastating.Love Forms by Claire Adam is published by Faber (£16.99).

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It is impressively gargantuan, with rooms as big as aeroplane hangars. Within them there are tight tunnels made of wicker or white padded material, the latter reminiscent of Punchdrunk’sViola’s Room, also staged in a vast space.Conceived byLiana Patarkatsishviliand produced by Sage & Jester, Storehouse is certainly grand in ambition and immaculately conceived in design, with an intricately created lexicon, too.The backstory is that a now dead company boss conceived a global project to record every online message, meme and utterance in the hope to build the formation of a greater truth – a “Truthtopia” – in the world above this alternate underground realm. Except that this archiving process, named “the great aggregation”, has missed its deadline for the revelation of truth.We meet its employees who seem willingly imprisoned underground and frozen in time like New Romantic throwbacks. They follow random rules such as falling into dance every time Culture Club’s Karma Chameleon is blasted out of a loudspeaker. We, the audience, are positioned as trustees of the company and are being shown around in the hope to inject fresh blood amid low morale and a recruitment crisis.There are shades ofSeveranceto the setup, with blind obedience among some employees rubbing up against the discontent and disobedience of others.

So the ideas float aimlessly in this great space without being tethered to enough actual story. The script has been conceived in a writers’ room usually associated with US screen dramas. This brings no less than six co-writers (Katie Lyons, Tristan Bernays, Sonali Bhattacharyya, Kathryn Bond, Caro Murphy and Rhik Samadder) alongside story producer, Donnacadh O’Briain.It seems like a case of too many cooks; dialogue spins from data control to algorithms, the (mis)use of information, truths and lies (“Truth lies here” is a perplexing refrain). Themes are not only telegraphed but tub-thumped in the final scene with big questions thrown out to the audience such as: “What gives you hope?” (“My cat,” says one participant). There is earnest talk of tree hugging and disconnecting from social media. It’s nothing you do not already know, with no new take to offer.Disembodied instructions are spoken through the public address system across the rooms (the voices of Toby Jones, Meera Syal, Billy Howle and Kathryn Hunter), and four combinations of cast perform the show simultaneously. Having seen two of these performances, I am still uncertain of why.Some actors bring a little more depth to their character, especially Harriett O’Grady as a stacker (responsible for organising shelving of data) along with Chris Agha and Dawn Butler as bookbinders. It all comes together around a giant inkwell, when the plot is revealed in what seems like a Scooby-Doo style ending, with motives and culprits fully explained amid rather too basic reasoning.Despite the alarm sounds and disturbed lighting through the show, there is no danger or jeopardy. The final moments open up to big electronic sound, laser light and Kraftwerk concert optics (lighting design by Ben Donoghue, sound design by James Bulley). It looks spectacular.

Added to this, Beckinsale alleges that the workout equipment and physical trainers she had requested to “stay in top shape for the physical demands of the role” were not provided, and she subsequently suffered “a complex meniscus tear in her left knee” as a result of a scene in which she was thrown into a wall, which was aggravated when she was “coerced” into performing “unsafe action sequences” after she returned to work.The document adds that Beckinsale’s stunt performer broke her ankle and “rather than replace her with a competent and qualified stunt [performer]”, the producers “hired an unqualified stunt woman who was simply the girlfriend of the stunt coordinator”.The legal complaint also includes communications between Beckinale’s agent Shani Rosenzweig and the film’s producers, with Rosenzweig criticising the lack of preparation and training for the film’s action sequences. Rosenzweig wrote: “No one is actually taking real action to put a plan in place to fix this situation …” Before demanding to know: “How you are … making sure your lead actress works 12 hour days and has time to prep for work on her own when she leaves the set while getting the rest her body so desperately needs. If you’re trying to kill a person, you’re doing a great job.” A message in response from John Zois, one of the film’s producers, reads: “I don’t know what else to say other than you’re right … The days are too packed for the pace we are moving and it’s CLEARLY not sustainable.”The Guardian has contacted Zois and the film’s sales representatives Anton for comment.Explore more on these topicsFilmKate BeckinsalenewsShareReuse this content"

Images of lonely moors, mist-drenched mountains and driving rain provided backdrops for some of my favourite books, poems and films. But for me, the raucous energy of Manchester had an almost religious pull. It was the birthplace of bands I loved – Oasis, Happy Mondays, Joy Division, A Guy Called Gerald – and home to that palace of techno and acid house music, the Haçienda, which I dreamed of visiting.I grew up at the rural borderland between England and Wales, but moved to Manchester when I was 16. It was my first time experiencing a real city with its cacophony of police sirens, shop alarms and drunken revelry, a far cry from the woodlands I’d grown up with. It was also the first time I realised I spoke with an accent. Against nasal Mancunian colloquialisms, my broad west country twang made me feel that I was from a different planet. But one of Manchester’s great charms is how its people throw their arms open to strangers. The city quickly became my home and I became a proud northerner.View image in fullscreen‘Thinking of the north gives me a feeling of rootedness. It grounds me.’  Composer Gavin HigginsPhotograph: PREvery city, town and village in the north of England has its own unique cultural identity, while the surrounding wild places – the moors, mountains, and coalfields – have an almost mythical allure for poets, painters and hikers alike. Walking the Lakes and Peak District – the beauty and melancholy of those landscapes permanently etched in my mind – changed the way I think about nature and our place within it. Experiencing community spirit at the annual Whit Friday marches in Saddleworth shaped my feelings towards the importance of community and ritual. The vibrancy of Manchester turned me from a provincial country boy to a card-carrying, coffee-drinking urbanite. Even my west country accent, an integral part of my identity, was changed for good, the singsong “hello there” replaced by a succinct “y’aright?”. I began to question the nature of my sense of Englishness, of my British identity. How do you even define such a thing?View image in fullscreen‘A mythical allure’ … Coniston Water in the Lake District.Photograph: Nicky Beeson/AlamyAs a composer, the north remains a place of keen inspiration for me and one I was eager to revisit. So when soprano Claire Booth approached me to write a song cycle about “the idea of the north”, I was intrigued to explore more. The very idea of northernness felt so clear in my mind. But as I dug deeper, it proved more elusive and hard to pin down.My new song cycle,Speak of the North, is a vast and sprawling journey across the moors, mountains, cities and coasts of the north of England. Set to words from a host of northern poets such as Katrina Porteous, Tony Williams and all three Brontë sisters, the 11 songs explore ideas around regional and national identity, our place within the wild places of the north, and navigating life and hardship at the very edges and borderlands of England.InGreat Northern Diverby Michael Symmons Roberts, Manchester is slowly revealed from above, from districts to stadiums to factories to pubs until we are on the very pavement itself, the earth rushing up to meet us as the rhythms of acid house music pound in the background. Here we learn the spirit of Manchester is not in its buildings or roads, but in the people who live there: “so what keeps this city alive is you”.View image in fullscreenRavers on the main stage in the Haçienda, ‘that palace of techno and acid house’ in 1989.Photograph: Peter J Walsh/PYMCA/Avalon/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesZoe Mitchell’s Sycamore Gap–written before the tree was felled – places us in border land, looking north to Scotland and south to England, not knowing which side is home. These liminal places fascinate me, challenging our absolutisms around identity. Where does Englishness stop and Scottishness start? Where does the north begin and where does it end?InOffcomerby Katie Hale, the very idea of northern identity is questioned. Through a series of visionary statements, she confronts her roots, her heritage and the way landscape has shaped her. “My skin is a prairie, / my hair and eyes an Irish peat and sky, / my bones a Midlands town,” we are told. “But put your ear to my chest […] you will hear / water, the raucous gathering of clouds.” This dichotomy is at the heart of this song cycle. Are we defined solely by our place of birth? Or by the movement of our ancestors, wars, stories, language, the weather?These are timely questions. Over the past decade, there has been a concerted effort from the right to push their definition of Englishness into public discourse, a definition that feels completely at odds with my own. Though these songs ask questions about northern identity specifically, they also invite a broader discourse about what it is to be English and to live in these isles.There’s been a concerted effort to push a definition of Englishness into public discourse that’s completely at odds with my ownThe simplicity and directness of folk music stands as a testament to the tenacity of ordinary people, holding a mirror to our deepest passions and concerns. The “folk” is never far away in my composition. Whether through the inclusion of a folk-like violin part, or the leaping fifths and ninths in the vocal writing, mimicking the open strings of the violin, the use of folk ideas to explore class struggle resonate throughout the song cycle.The final song is a setting of the Northumbrian folk song Here’s the Tender Coming, and leaves us on a sombre note. Here, a mother whose husband has been press-ganged faces the reality of her child being brought up in a broken home. This could equally be the story of a struggling single mother, or a wife mourning the loss of her husband in an industrial accident, and we are reminded that political choices made far away, by privileged people in fancy houses, can have a devastating impact on the lives of ordinary people.Though the cycle is made up of 11 clearly defined movements, melodic and harmonic motifs are heard throughout in different guises. The invigorating fanfares that open the piece return at a later point softer and muted, the dream of the north slipping through our fingers. The vocal leaps are littered throughout the cycle: at times jubilant and invigorating, at others stark, cold, relentless.View image in fullscreen‘Different sound worlds’ … Hadrian’s Wall in Northumberland.Photograph: Martin Bache/AlamyIn other moments, entirely different sound worlds are explored. In Sedimentary, the music is low and resonant, the pianist asked to play “like a brass band” – a nod to the musical tradition that grew in the coalfields of the north. In Here’s the Tender Coming, the piano part is prepared with Blu-Tack so that the strings resonate out of tune, tolling like a distant ship’s bell. Techno piano rhythms feature throughout Great Northern Diver, beginning quietly as if from afar, later pounding as though we are on the dancefloor itself.The idea of the north is complex. It is a place of industry, of rolling moors and mountains. Of brass bands and acid house. It’s a place of rain and proud, weather-worn people, of struggle and of survival. And it is also place of deep friendship and core memories: my friend and I deciding to climb Helvellyn but our plans being thwarted when she turned up in high heels; my first time in Manchester’s gay village, the bar lady with a knowing wink giving me more money back in change than I’d handed her to pay for my drink; night swimming in the Lake District and then watching the sun rise over the mountains.Thinking of the north gives me a feeling of rootedness. It grounds me and reminds me of who I am and, in returning to the north for this song cycle, I feel like I’ve come home.The world premiere of Gavin Higgins’ Speak of the North is at theAldeburgh festival on 17 June. It is also at theRyedale festival on 12 July.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicNorth of EnglandSnape MaltingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And, since I’m baring all, I will add that I loathe people who drive extremely fast in obnoxiously large cars. Which, unfortunately, seems to be every third person in the US. In short, I’d wager I’m probably not the target audience for theFast & Furiousfilms.I’m sure I don’t need to explain the blockbuster franchise to you: the first instalment came out in 2001 and the series has generated billions. But if you are somehow unfamiliar with them, the basic premise is that a ragtag team of misfits and street racers travel around the world, driving cars fast and furiously, beating up baddies.View image in fullscreenPaul Walker and Vin Diesel in Fast & Furious 6.Composite: Guardian Design;  Universal Pictures/AllstarTarget demographic or not, I’m a big fan. Ever since I watched The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) on a plane I’ve been obsessed with the films. Which, I will concede, are very stupid (my four-year-old could come up with the “plot” for a typical F&F movie). But they are also great fun. And extraordinarily gay.First, there’s the fact that they are completely over-the-top. As camp as they come; the drag queens of the cinematic world. In F9 they send a Pontiac Fiero to space for God’s sake: the film is so gay it defies gravity. F7, meanwhile, featuresone of my favourite super-camp scenes(don’t judge): Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson is in hospital with his arm in a cast but realises he has to drive fast cars and beat people up so busts open the cast by flexing his huge biceps while announcing, “Daddy has to go to work.” I mean,come on,talk about the performance of gender.Speaking of performance, there’s also the Rock’s name. There is something just a tinge lavender about a man called Dwayne Douglas deciding to go by “the Rock” instead. And then you’ve got Mark Sinclair, who plays Dominic “Dom” Toretto in the franchise. Mark’s stage name, of course, is Vin Diesel. I would absolutely give myself a name like that if I was going to be a drag king. Vin Diesel, Von Biceps, Tommy Testosterone – something along those lines.As any fan will know, ultimately Fast & Furious is about family.Dom Toretto says the word “family” about 100 times in each movie and he doesn’t mean his nuclear family. Rather the word refers to his ride or die crew of friends – who happen to be a very diverse bunch. It’s cheesy, yes, but this emphasis on a chosen family is also quietly radical and queer-coded.View image in fullscreenThe ‘family’ in Fast & Furious 7.Photograph: Universal Pictures/AllstarI came out more than 20 years ago, when the world was a lot more homophobic than it is now. My family has always been supportive but I know plenty of people who haven’t been so lucky. A2013 Pew studyfound that about 39% of LGBT Americans have been rejected by a family member or close friend because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Finding your chosen family, and redefining what “family” means, has always been part of queer culture.I feel particularly conscious of what “family” means at the moment, as my wife and I raise a four-year-old. She is our only child but she has a number of half-siblings through the sperm donor, and we are in contact with these families: we are all woven together now. We spend a lot of time talking to our child about how every family is different, and try to expose her to different types of families. Still, looking at the world through her eyes, I have become hyperaware of how ingrained the idea of the heterosexual nuclear family is in society.According to a 2023 study, only 47% of Americans see a married gay or lesbian couple raising children together as completely acceptable. The idea that a proper family consists of a married mum and dad with two kids (preferably one of each gender), is reinforced in everything from cartoons to commercials.Fast & Furious would never be described by anyone as “woke”. And yet it has always had diverse talent in front of and behind the scenes – one reason it’s been so popularacross many demographics. In 2015 Vin Dieselnoted that: “It doesn’t matter what nationality you are. As a member of the audience, you realise you can be a member of that ‘family’.” This is the beauty of F&F: it doesn’t try to hit you over the head with political messaging, but it does constantly reinforce the idea that love is love."

Until recently this Unesco world heritage city, whose beauty can more than compete with its flashier neighbours, Palermo and Taormina, was blighted by organised crime and bad governance. But this is now changing, and fast. A decades-long crackdown on the Cosa Nostra has borne fruit, and previously no-go areas are now welcoming tourists and new businesses. My father’s family hails from San Cristoforo, the city’s poorest neighbourhood, and our conversations often centre on how the good times are finally arriving in Catania. But price points haven’t yet caught up with the city’s new-found buzz, especially in its many restaurants.Nuova Trattoria del ForestieroView image in fullscreenPasta alla norma, the signature dish of Catania.Photograph: Albert Gonzalez/AlamyAffectionately known as Rosanna’s by locals, Trattoria del Forestiero has been serving home-style dishes since 1965. My British-born mum was a waitress at the restaurant in the 1990s and one afternoon, after a night of heavy drinking, my dad, to whom she was teaching English at a language school in the city, popped in to cook her something to help with the hangover. He stuffedcotoletta, the breaded veal cutlet loved in Italy, with mozzarella, tomatoes and lots of garlic, andCotoletta alla Ciccowas born (Cicco being the diminutive of my late dad’s name, Francesco). It’s a must-eat dish, as is pasta alla norma, named after the Bellini opera, which is Catania’s signature dish. Rosanna’s version is particularly delicious because of its fresh hand-cut pasta, which is made daily.Mains about €10; onInstagramLa PescheriamarketView image in fullscreenLa Pescheria, Catania’s famous fish market.Photograph: Konstantin Kalishko/AlamyMembers of my family have been working on the stalls of this centuries-old fish market for ever. Growing up, I was taught to judge a fish market by its smell, or lack thereof, and so it’s a source of great familial pride that La Pescheriasmells of the sea. If you’re staying in an apartment (there are now many Airbnbs in the city), buytelline, tiny triangle-shaped, colourful clams, and cook them as you wouldvongole,served with spaghetti. The market is also home to Antica Trattoria La Paglia, which has been feeding visitors and vendors for more than 200 years. The fish restaurant has a longstanding rivalry with Rosanna’s – a ringing endorsement in locals’ books.

For me, Giammona,founded in 1912, has the upper hand. Run by Francesco Giammona, who took over from his father in the 1980s, the art nouveau kiosk has retained its original marble-clad bar and stained glass windows. Although Giammona’smenu has expanded in recent years to accommodate tourists’ tastes, Sicilians go-to thirst quencher isseltz al limone: sparkling water, lemon juice and a generous pinch of salt. Please note that although Italians are big on food categories they don’t, for some mysterious reason, differentiate between lemons and limes – so say if you wantlimoni gialli(lemons) orlimoni verdi(limes).Drinks start from €1.50 at both kiosks.

However, I challenge anyone to find a restaurant in a more scenic setting or one cooking tastier grilledbistecca di cavallo(horse steak). Situated in Piazza Federico di Svevia, its regular diners know to request an outdoor table, where they can look out on to Castello Ursino, a staggeringly imposing Norman castle a few feet away from the restaurant.

The neighbourhood bar was set up by a cultural association along with other initiatives to “help the people of the [San Cristoforo] ghetto”, and regularly hosts music events and book clubs. Earnest politics aside, my family are regulars because the drinks are cheap and strong. There is a menu, but it’s perfunctory – most customers will describe what they’re in the mood for, and a bartender will make a drink for them.

Unfortunately, this means many are missing out on the island’s blossoming Asian food scene. Catania’s Bangladeshi population makes up nearly 7% of the city’s 13,000 foreign-born residents, and community restaurants are popping up across the city. The unassuming-looking Bangla Spicy Food, which backs on to the historic A Fera O’Luni market on Piazza Carlo Alberto(where my great-nonna once sold fruit and vegetables) is good and cheap: you can order several dishes and get change from a fiver. Don’t leave without trying the aromatic dal bhuna and flaky, buttery parathas.

Legend has it that in the ninth century, when Sicily was under Moorish occupation, Arabs mixed the snow of Mount Etna (Europe’s most continually belching volcano) with fruit juices, and granita was born. Whatever its history, Sicilians are inordinately proud of granita and have strict rules when it comes to its flavour combinations.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Lebanon has one of, if notthemost ancient winemaking traditions in the world, so it stands to reason that we ought to drink more of it. This historic wine industry started way back with the Phoenicians, who spread viticulture throughout the Mediterranean, and then, in 1857, Jesuit monks planted vines from Algeria in the Bekaa valley, in an area that is today one of the country’s most prestigious wine-producing regions.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Today there are some 80 wineries in operation in the Bekaa, most of them with a decided focus on French grapes – cabernet sauvignon, cinsault, merlot, sauvignon blanc and chardonnay all get a lot of love – but native grapes such asobaideh,merwah, jandali and hamdali also feature in the production of wine and arak, a distilled anise spirit.The best of these wineries are defined by their altitude. Whereas the areas by the coast are flat and hot, and perhaps too much so to produce complex wines, the more mountainous regions of Mount Lebanon, Jezzine, Batroun and the Bekaa valley are able to yield wines of good quality. The higher altitude allows for a distinct diurnal temperature range – that is, the difference between day and night temperatures in the vineyard – and a large range can allow grapes to develop properly (heat in the day to ripen the grapes and coolness at night to train acidity).The outlier for these modern, prestige wines is, by far, the renownedChâteau Musar, which may well be the first and only Lebanese wine many of us have tried. Inspired by his travels to Bordeaux, Gaston Hochar first planted vines on what became the Musar estate back in 1930, and during the Lebanese civil war, his eldest son Serge switched the winery’s focus to exports, especially to the UK, a move credited for its prominence in the west today. That’s why you can now find Musar at many prestige importers, as well as a couple of supermarkets.Musar’s is a story defined by a Lebanon at war, which continues to this day – last year, the eastern Bekaa valley was one of the areas most severely affected by Israeli air strikes – but this is not something that will define Lebanese wine, insistsHenna Bakshi, an award-winning wine journalist who has reported extensively on war-zone wines: “No region will ever want to be known for war,” she says. “We must understand that – this is historical context. The quality of wine coming from the region, despite the impossible, is still absolutely incredible. I’d suggest blind tasting top Lebanese producers to understand the quality of their winewithoutthe context.”Local winemakers are finding new ways to overcome adversity, too: “During airstrikes last year, Eddie Chami ofMersel Winelost all power and electricity,” Bakshi says, “and he was making wine with a headlamp; he [even]documented it on video, and on one of his Instagram stories you could hear the drones in the background.” For more on how Lebanese winemakers are being affected by war, I’d very much recommendBakshi’s account for Wine Enthusiast,which details how, amid all the unpredictability, life goes on.Four Lebanese wines to exploreChâteau Oumsiyat Mijana£9.75 Waitrose, 13%.

During the warm conversation, Romito, who is one of Italy’s most visionary chefs and whoseRistorante Realein Abruzzo has three Michelin stars, spoke about the first time he ate at Tassa’sNu’ Trattoria Italiana dal 1960in Acuto, which is in the province of Frosinone about an hour south of Rome. Romito recalled the homely atmosphere and Tassa as an old-school host: welcoming, communicative and the conduit (which didn’t sound pretentious when he said it) between local traditions, producers and those who came to eat. But Romito also described a dish of onions, simply braised, but of such goodness that he couldn’t stop thinking about and imagining them. In fact, Romito credits those onions as being the starting point for one of his own most well-known dishes: “absolute” onion broth with parmesan-filled pasta and toasted saffron. Tassa returned the affection and respect, before both chefs reminded those of us listening that everything begins and ends with the ingredients.On the bus on the way home, I kept thinking about Romito thinking about those braised onions, which led me to think about the times I have left a table in a trattoria, restaurant, cafe, pub, chip shop or friend’s housereallythinking about something. And how those thoughts are quite rare and completely different from simply remembering a dish or liking something; they are vivid and intrusive thoughts. The deep-fried mashed potato and mozzarella ball from the canteen just under our flat last week; the gravy around the liver and onions at a local trattoria; hazelnuts on the salad at the same trattoria; a plate of green beans that tasted like butter; the honey dressing on a salad that has been nagging me since January.This week’s column is an attempt to deal with some of that nagging by combining elements of two salads that have stayed with me like an anxious memory. The first is the bitter greens and toasted hazelnut salad at a trattoria calledPiatto Romanohere in Testaccio, while the second is the radicchio, almond, gorgonzola and honey salad fromBocca di Lupoin Soho, London. I did feel a bit like Romito, taking the inspiration into my kitchen, although I can’t claim to have invented anything. I can confirm, though, that there is no better way to dress a salad than with hands (very clean or covered with those very thin rubber gloves), because it means every single leaf gets the benefit of the dressing. You can use any leaves, but a mixture of something crisp such as romaine, little gem or beluga chicory alongside the softer leaves of round radicchio all work well. And look out for creamiergorgonzola dolce(sweet) rather than the firmergorgonzolapiccante(sharp).Alongside bread, and with the option of more cheese, this salad is a light meal for two; it also goes well with roast chicken, baked potatoes or alongside a couple of other salads. I would suggest putting it with deep-fried potato balls, but I have not worked through that thought yet.Salad with hazelnuts, gorgonzola and honey dressingServes2-41 romaine lettuce, or two little gems1 small headradicchio6 tbspextra-virgin olive oil1 tbsp honey1 tbspred-wine vinegar1 tspdijon mustardSalt100g toasted hazelnuts150ggorgonzola dolce,broken into small piecesBreak all the lettuce into leaves, wash them in cold water, dry thoroughly, then rip into bite-sized pieces.Working in a large bowl, use a balloon whisk to mix the olive oil, honey, red-wine vinegar, dijon mustard, a teaspoon of warm water and a pinch of salt into an emulsified dressing, adjusting to taste.Add the leaves to the bowl and toss really well so every leaf is coated – your hands are easily the best tool for this.

But among the congratulations, one grumpy social media user had posted: “I hope you have a good rest.”“I snapped back and said that view is part of the problem,” he says, speaking from theHouse of Commons. “Paternity leave – any parental leave – is not rest, it’s essential caregiving at the start of a child’s life.”This summer the 29-year-old will become the first male MP to take extended parental leave and employ a locum, his office manager, to cover his constituency work while he is away.“Being an MP is a privilege. It’s one of the busiest jobs in Britain, but I’ve got to be a dad first and an MP second,” says the Labour member forYorkOuter. “I think it’s really important to kind of model that behaviour and sort of lead by example.”Charters is a part of a new group of MPs agitating for better leave for fathers, not only because it is good for them and their kids, but also because it is a way ofsteering young men awayfrom “toxic influencers” and the lure of Reform.With only two statutory weeks of leave – paid at £184.03 a week – the UK has one of theworst paternityleave offerings in Europe; recent research foundone in three UK fathers took no paternity leaveafter the birth of their child. But after many years offemale MPsand campaign groups arguing that better parental leave for fathers would improve gender equality and boost productivity in the UK, the paternity leave push has gained traction in recent months.On Monday the cross-party women and equalities select committeecalled for new fathers to be given six weeks off work, arguing that the UK’s statutory parental leave system was “one of the worst in the developed world” and had “fundamental flaws”.Two days later, after a spending review from Rachel Reeves that did not improve the deal for fathers, theDad Shiftcampaign group organised adad strikein which men and their babies gathered outside the Department for Business and Trade in London.Meanwhile, MPs wrote to parliament’s spending watchdog to urge it to increase the amount of paid paternity leave given to its staffers,reported Politics Home. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) replied with the news that a change was in the works, the Guardian has learned: qualifying new fathers would now get four weeks of paid leave, rather than two. Ipsa was “continually looking at ways to support a family-friendly parliament”, said its chair, Richard Lloyd.Alex Latham-Reynolds, who works for the MP and paternity leave campaigner Shaun Davies, will likely be the first father to get the enhanced offer when he takes time off in September to welcome his new son. “From our perspective, and definitely from my perspective, it’s a big win,” he says. “I think it shows there’s a shift in perspective happening, that the importance of dads being around is being recognised.”The battle for better parental leave for MPs and staff in Westminster has been protracted. Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, became the first to use a pilot providingfull locum cover for her first childin 2020. A year later the government pushed through a billgiving ministers access to six months of maternity leave on full pay. Earlier this year, the secretary of state for Scotland, Ian Murray, became the first cabinet minister to take full paternity leave, following the birth of his second child.Things are changing, says Charters. “This is a much younger parliament, you see a lot of toddlers and babies now, probably more than you have done in the past.” He hopes by taking extended paternity leave – and talking about it – he can encourage others to join the push for change. “My message is: we’re fighting for you to have enhanced paternity leave regardless of how busy your job is. If you can, do spend those important first few weeks with your son or daughter, building those lifelong memories. Nothing is more important.”Explore more on these topicsMaternity & paternity rightsWork & careersHouse of CommonsLabourYorkNorth of EnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now I’m having a style crisisSarah MillerThu 12 Jun 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 12 Jun 2025 13.37 EDTShareI’ve had a torn meniscus in my right knee for eight years. My knee was OK for 47 years, and then I went on the easiest hike in recorded history and stepped up on a not-very-high ledge. That was it.It’s not ideal. I can walk, but I can’t run or sit cross legged. But whenever I’m about to bite the bullet on surgery, it seems like the wrong time to be sitting around for six weeks or longer. Or someone says: “That surgery didn’t work for me.”The time I got closest, I suddenly needed shoulder surgery, which seemed more pressing because reaching over your head is kind of important in day-to-day life. In middle age, it’s hard to know which physical problem to deal with first.In the meantime, I’m having a massive style crisis about what shoes to wear. I’ve never been a serious heels person, but I do like wedges and I really love boots – especially the Frye harness boots I’ve had for 15 years. But every time I’ve asked a health professional which shoes are least hard on the knees, they say sneakers. I absolutely hate the way sneakers look on me. I feel instantly un-hot the moment I even look at a pair.There were more than700,000 knee replacementslast year in the US, at least the same numberof meniscus repairsand about400,000 ACL repairs. So I can only imagine others are struggling with the knowledge that they need sensible footwear.I texted my friend Lauren Sherman, a fashion journalist at Puck. Was there a shoe that was comfortable but not hideous?I whispered to myself, Please don’t say sneakers.“I assume just sneakers?” she responded. God, millennials really love sneakers. It’s a sickness!What if I didn’t want to wear sneakers everywhere? They look so bad with jeans (on me). And with dresses and skirts – sob. I would rather just not go anywhere ever again.Gen Z in the US: tell us how you spend your moneyRead moreThe professionals were no help. “You should aim for well-fitted, comfortable shoes so as to not affect your gait, how you walk, stand, move,” says Dr Cassandra Lee, professor of orthopaedic surgery at UC Davis School of Medicine. She citeda Stanford studywhere women wore a flat athletic shoe, a low heel and a higher heel. Guess which was the worst for your knees and which was the best?“As much as we like the look of heels, there is a lot of evidence they do not love us back,” Lee said. The higher the heel, the more weight is pitched forward, the more your gait is changed, and your knee affected.She did not say “sneakers”. But Theresa Marko, founder and owner of Marko Physical Therapy in Manhattan, did: “I recommend a supportive sneaker, such as a running sneaker. These provide cushion and arch support, which help support the knee in a neutral alignment. They also help soften the forces that the foot transmits when it strikes the ground, which travel up towards the knee.”She added that every body is unique – if someone is experiencing pain, they should see a physical therapist to address their issues, develop a personalized treatment program and review what footwear might work best.I did not think running shoes worked best for me. They made me feel weird and wobbly. To my surprise, Marko acknowledged that running shoes can feel unstable. This is because of something called the heel drop, or how much lower the toes are than the heels in a given pair of shoes. I was glad to know this, even if the heel drop situation didn’t seem to be my Waterloo.The reason I hate running shoes is they make me feel like I’m walking on stilts, or on stage. When my foot is separated from the earth by a thick piece of rubber and molded plastic, I feel like I’m perched above the earth, floating in the ether. Then my gait is off because I feel unmoored, and an off-gait is precisely what you’re not supposed to have.“The wrong shoes and [their effect on gait] can cause a slight torque in the knee, which could cause rubbing on the cartilage or improper tracking,” said Carrie Collins, founder of Stretch Chi, a stretching and movement studio in Chicago. This resonated with me! My boots felt comfortable, but they were definitely not snug around my foot like a sneaker or another less rigid shoe would be.I could not ignore that all the experts were suggesting sneakers. Well, fine. But if I had to wear sneakers, they could not have laces. Otherwise, I’d be too lazy to put them on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are not sexy or cool at all, but there is something subtle and under-the-radar about them. The shape is also slightly aerodynamic, space-agey – at least they have some personality. I don’t love them, but I don’t hate them. I will admit that they are nice and snug around the top of my foot, and the entire bottom of my foot is supported. Yesterday, I had to walk thirty blocks and I wore them with a sundress and no one died.I have to say that wearing sneakers, despite being sad, is just the right thing to do. But what about when I absolutely cannot bring myself to wear them? Like a job interview or dinner anywhere other than Chipotle?“If someone must wear a heeled shoe, I advise rubber bottoms and a very low heel – one to two inches,” said Marko. A round toe is better than a pointed one (more room in the shoe for your foot) and a block heel is better than, say, a stiletto, because there’s more surface area to support your weight and distribute it more evenly over the bed of the shoe.She mentioned some brands. Unfortunately, I would not be caught dead in any of them.I called up Brandon Holley, who was my boss a long time ago when she was the editor of Lucky magazine, and I had two amazing, working knees. Holley, a consultant to fashion brands, had an ACL and meniscus repair in college, and sent over a few suggestions. One was a sneaker – LOL – and one was a loafer. Loafers are “in” right now, but sadly, I look ridiculous in them.First my left knee, then my right: my middle-aged body’s betrayalRead moreBut two options stood out. Onewas a lace-up suede flatwith a rubber bottom and a very low heel, the sort of thing you could wear to weddings, summer parties or a bar. It came in a pretty color, and had ties encircling the ankle, or, as Holley said, “wrap-around sexiness”. The other was aslip-on sandalwith a two-inch block heel.If I could wear sneakers 80% of the time, and an acceptable alternative 20% of the time, would that work? Like those people who eat mostly spinach, boneless chicken and blueberries, then have the occasional piece of chocolate, enormous sandwich or martini.Nope. If my meniscus tear is actively hurting me, I should not be wearing heels “for any amount of time,” said Marko. If I had an old meniscus tear that had healed, maybe. But “it really depends on the individual and their needs”.Sounds like it’s sneakers for me. And maybe the next place I should wear them is an orthopedist’s office.Sarah Millerwrites for many publications, including NewYorker.com, ParisReview.com, Dirt and n+1.

Settlers and the government soon followed, claiming ownership of the thick cedar forests, the fjords and the abundance of life. Heiltsuk elders were confused. “If these are truly your lands,” they asked, “where are your stories?”For the Heiltsuk, stories explain everything from the shape of a local mountain to the distinct red fur fringes on thesea wolves stalking shores. They tell of the flesh-eating monsterbaxbakwa’lanuxusiwe, whose entire body was covered with snapping mouths before it was destroyed by a shaman and became a cloud of mosquitoes.Passed down over generations, in ceremonies forbidden by Canada’s government, the stories weave together the physical world, the supernatural and the liminal space that binds the two.1:04Indigenous nation in Canada ratifies its first written constitution – videomap showing Heiltsuk nationSuch stories are also the bedrock of the Heiltsuk’snewly created constitution, a document recently ratified through ceremony that asserts the nation’s long-held convictions that they are the original inhabitants and rightful stewards of the region’s future.The declaration comes at a time when Canada’s own sovereignty is under threat, and when the first peoples are increasingly using their political power to reclaim territories and customs from a colonial project that once sought to destroy them.Tucked inside the north-east tip of Campbell Island, the town of Bella Bella is the largest outpost for the Heiltsuk nation, a seafaring people 40,000 strong who once populated dozens of villages within the broader archipelago along British Columbia’s central Pacific coast.View image in fullscreenA view of Heiltsuk’s territory in western British Columbia.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianThey warred, traded and allied with surrounding nations, finding sustenance and wealth in the lands and waters of the rugged coastline. And over thousands of years, the Heiltsuk and their neighbours developed systems of governance that relied on hereditary chiefs to serve as political, cultural and environmental caretakers.But decades of hostile government policies – including theforcible removal of Indigenous children from their families, and asystem of residential schoolsthat attempted to kill off the culture of Indigenous peoples – upended such systems of governance. For decades until 1973, staff at the Bella Bella hospital forcibly sterilized Heiltsuk men and women, who were classified as wards of the state under federal law.“We’ve had the foot on our throats … and it’s been hard to make the leap across the hatred, discrimination and racism towards our people,” said λáλíyasila Frank Brown, a Heiltsuk hereditary chief. “But the constitution marks that transition away.”View image in fullscreenHereditary chiefs dance ahead of the ratification of the Heiltsuk nation’s new constitution.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianAfter decades of consultation with legal experts and community members, the new Heiltsuk constitution enshrines a framework in which power and decision-making authority is shared by hereditary leadership, the elected chief and council, and the nation’s women’s council. It governs the relationship with the land and ocean, citizenship, language and culture. While it does not have the force of law in the eyes of the provincial or federal governments, the move marks an attempt to restore a system of coherent governance destroyed by colonial powers.Quick GuideWhat is Canada's Indian Act?ShowWhat is Canada's Indian Act?Canada’s Indian Act – first passed in 1876 and a version of which is still in effect today – is a controversial piece of legislation that governs the relationship between the federal government and Indigenous peoples.When first introduced, the law imposed strict control over the lives of Indigenous peoples. They were made to live on reserves and couldn’t leave without permission from federal agents.Under the act, children were forcibly removed from their homes and forced to live in institutions that had the aim of stripping away their culture, language and identity.Until 1951, the Act barred Indigenous peoples from retaining legal counsel and those with ‘Indian status’ were seen as wards of the federal government, similar to minors.Even though Indigenous people fought for Canada during two world wars, it wasn’t until 1960 that ‘status Indians’ were permitted to vote in federal elections. At times, the federal government stripped people of their ‘Indian status’ meaning they lost rights granted to them under treaties.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.View image in fullscreenQ̓íx̌itasu Elroy White serves as both a hereditary chief and elected councillor.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianThe 1876 Indian Act – legislation that governs the country’s relationship withIndigenous peoples– created elected band councils with the aim of stripping away authority from hereditary chiefs.“People were confused,” said Q̓íx̌itasu Elroy White, who serves as both a hereditary chief and elected councillor. “They weren’t sure who held power and many felt the elected band members didn’t have legitimacy. This new constitution changes that.”The Heiltsuk have long seen a clear distinction between the hereditary chiefs, who oversee cultural preservation through oral history, and the bureaucratic role of councillors.By enshrining the power of both elected members and hereditary chiefs, the nation has established a political system ready to weather internal fractures. Elsewhere in British Columbia,hereditary chiefs of the Wetʼsuwetʼen people broke with the elected council over a natural gas pipeline, prompting a feud which spawned intense protests and police raids. The Heiltsuk, aware that outsiders hope to one day log their forests or fish their waters, want a unified voice in any proposal.“We’re now the architects of certainty for ourselves and for other governments operating within our unceded territories,” said Brown, noting that like most nations in the province of British Columbia, the Heiltsuk never signed away their lands in treaties, nor did they surrender them in battle.View image in fullscreenChildren outside the Bella Bella Big House.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianIt waswomenwho kept Heiltsuk culture alive during sustained efforts by the federal government and the province to crush Indigenous identity. In 1885 Canada passed a law banning the potlatch, a ritualized ceremony that underpins the legal, political, economic and social networks binding the communities with neighbouring nations. A mandatory jail sentence was imposed on anyone breaking the law, which was only repealed in 1951.Frances Brown was nine years old when elders began teaching her the songs and stories of her people. “At the time I didn’t understand, but I know now they were grooming me to be a strong Heiltsuk woman. They were working to keep our songs and our stories alive through me.”Brown, now 66, serves on theW̓úm̓aqs du M̓ṇúyaqs– the women’s council – that advises elected councillors and hereditary chiefs.View image in fullscreenFrances Brown, a member of the women’s council.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The Guardian“We [women] have always been brought up to believe and know that we are the backbone of our community. We are the advisers to the chiefs,” she said. “Through the constitution, they’re formally returning our rightful place in our traditional governance system.”Brown, whose mother is one of the few remaining fluent speakers of the Híɫzaqv language, has also spent the last two decades fighting to ensure the language, woven into the constitution, is protected.“Híɫzaqv connects us to our creation stories. It connects us to our land, our seas, our way of life and laws of our ancestors that were practiced prior to colonization,” said Brown. “We never gave up on that as a people. And today, we’re renewing and reclaiming our ancestral laws.”The constitution has been ratified at a time when Canada’s own sovereignty has come under pressure. Donald Trump has brazenly threatened to annex the country, and separatists in the Prairie provinces – motivated by long-held grievances towards eastern political elites – have angered Indigenous groups by ignoring the treaties that give legitimacy to the region that now wants to secede.Against that backdrop, members of the Heiltsuk Nation have not sought recognition from any external governments, including the Crown. While other Indigenous nations were invited to the ratification feast in late May, Canada’s provincial and federal governments were not.“We know who our leadership is and what we stand for,” said Marilynn Slett, the community’s elected chief. “That’s what led us to where we are today.”23:54Racing to keep our language alive: H̓ágṃ́ṇtxv Qṇtxv Tx̌ (We’re all we got)To the beat of the singers’ drums, children performed dances, gifted to the Heiltsuk bythe Haida nation, on the sandy floor of the Gvakva’aus Hailzaqv, or House of the Heiltsuk.The two nations, which renewed their alliance through a peace treaty potlatch in 2015, are both leading a push for greater sovereignty over their lands.In 1996, the Heiltsuk won a landmark supreme court case when the justices found the nation had a pre-existing right to harvest herring eggs commercially.View image in fullscreenA ceremony marking the new constitution.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianAnd last year, after decades of negotiation, the province of British Columbia said more than half a million hectares of Crown land would be returned to the Haida nation. Canada’s federal government followed suit earlier this year. Both cases marked the first time either level of government had willingly recognized an Indigenous nation’s inherent right to the land they occupied before colonization.But the Heiltsuk’s decision to develop and implement their own constitution has also resulted in friction with neighbouring nations. In a February letter, members of the Nuxalk, Kitasoo Xai’xais and Wuikinuxv nations said they “strongly disagree[d]” with the territorial claims made in the Heiltsuk constitution and called on the Heiltsuk to correct the “inaccurate and historically false” territorial claims.Slett said they had invited concerned nations to visit and discuss the issue using traditional protocols.View image in fullscreenThe town of Bella Bella is the largest outpost for the Heiltsuk nation.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianFor a younger, and often highly educated generation, the fight for a constitution reflects a broader shift in how they conceive of their community’s identity and place within the Canadian project.“The previous generation wanted to tear down colonial systems. We want to rebuild our own,” said Saul Brown, a 32-year-old lawyer and councillor. A key figure in the drafting of the constitution, Brown anticipates there will be challenges when Heiltsuk law runs counter to Crown law, but he said those fights were secondary to a broader aim of his people.“It’s not just this hatred or righteous anger at these historical and contemporary wrongs. It’s the love for our own people. We’re not turning our back from state recognition. We’re just saying we don’t need it. We need to recognize our law first.”View image in fullscreenThe Heiltsuk, aware that outsiders hope to one day log their forests or fish their waters, desire a unified voice.Photograph: Leyland Cecco/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsCanadaIndigenous peoplesAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Lake District is a national park, with protected and designated sites of special scientific interest.The fact that sheep farming and hefted livestock grazing has been core to its management for over 3,000 years suggests it has created something of value. How ironic that rather than celebrate (and further fine-tune) its farmers and graziers, and the surrounding rural infrastructure that depends on this primary activity, ecologists want to see sheep farming’s demise.Given the right policy framework  and the public being prepared to support local food producers, the Lake District’s farmers will be able to continue to adapt and deliver what it wants – the enhancement of natural resources, a nature-rich countryside, and a vibrant society with cultural heritage and a contribution to food security. That surely is what conservation should be about – a recognition of the whole, and not just singular outcomes.Finally, while sheep farming enterprises in these harsh regions may be financially marginal, if they are considered within an economy where money is recirculated locally, creating jobs and enterprise and supporting a rural community, then they’re not such poor performers.Public support helps farmers to do more for nature and protect water and other resources. Farmers want to continue looking after the land they have farmed for centuries, ensuring public access, balancing farming with nature, and managing the landscape in a viable way for future generations.Phil StockerChief executive, National Sheep AssociationHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

In 1999, while still residing in my home county of East Sussex, I began a conservation grazing initiative using Exmoor ponies to combat the growing threat to the South Downs’ chalk grasslands from a very similar grass,Brachypodium(tor grass), which back then I estimated was affecting well in excess of 200 hectares. This grass is of little use to farmers and also seriously depletes biodiversity.In 2004, we began to get increasingly involved with the extensive acid grasslands in the high, acid heath and grasslands of the Ashdown Forest area, involving four different landowners – SussexWildlifeTrust, Sussex Police Authority, the Ministry of Defence and the Conservators of Ashdown. Here, pony grazing was mainly to combat the rampant spread of molinia. The most spectacular result was on the MoD’s 200-hectare training area, which had not been grazed within living memory. This was transformed from mainly thick molinia to open swards within several years of grazing 32 Exmoors year-round. It also minimised the previous extensive fires caused by army pyrotechnics.I too consider the rampant spread of these two grass species as being due to nitrogen pollution, aided to a lesser extent by less grazing. I retired in 2017, then running 85 ponies. Today in East Sussex, there are in the region of 150 Exmoors carrying on what I initiated a quarter of a century ago.Monty LarkinSt Dogmaels, PembrokeshireHaving been an upland farmer for half a century, I share George Monbiot’s concerns about the growing domination of moliniain some regions. However, a century ago,Robert Wallace, professor of agriculture and rural economy at Edinburgh University, explained in his book, Heather and Moor Burning for Grouse and Sheep,that control of this plant can be ensured through the time-honoured combination of rotational winter-burning and active shepherding.These ancient skills ensured that the growth of moliniawas checked by managing the flock to graze off its early-spring shoots.After the animals had been moved to their in-bye lambing fields, the moor’s later-emerging, more fragile plants were able to thrive. To prevent neglected moors from turning into lifeless deserts of overgrown molinia and tick-infested bracken, perhaps we should be paying more attention to the wisdom of our forebears.Aidan HarrisonSnitter, NorthumberlandFar from crowding out other plants and wildlife, purple moor-grass is in fact a key indicator of an increasingly rare habitat – known in Devon as culm grassland and in Wales as rhôs pasture – that is home to rare plants like devil’s-bit scabious and butterflies such as the marsh fritillary, which depends on it for food and reproduction. On our former farm in north-west Devon, we now manage the land precisely to protect this highly threatened ecosystem.George Monbiot is right to point out that walking over such land is far from easy, owing to the plant’s tussocky nature, but I suggest he takes a leaf out of Devon Wildlife Trust’s excellent short film about the culm,Never Mind the Tussocks (Here’s the Wildlife). He might learn something useful.Adam NeweyPancrasweek, DevonRe molinia grass sucking the life out of biodiversity, the solution is hiding in plain sight: England’s last semi-wild pony population – the iconic Dartmoor hill ponies.Studies, tests and surveys published in prestigious scientific journalsconfirmthat Dartmoor semi-wild ponies not only eat molinia, but are also perfectly adapted over millennia of roaming Dartmoor to thrive in the highest and harshest parts where that job is needed most.George Monbiot and the campaigner Tony Whitehead should not despair for Dartmoor biodiversity. Instead, they should focus their efforts on asking Defra to ensure its policies nurture and sustain the number of Dartmoor hill ponies, and biodiversity will be burgeoning here once more.Charlotte FaulknerDartmoor Hill Pony AssociationExplore more on these topicsConservationFarmingBiodiversityWildlifelettersShareReuse this content"

That’s been the tactic since his second period in jail beginning in 2019.”What has become clear to Seif, and others campaigning to release him, is that the treatment of her brother is being driven by a very personal animosity directed at Abd el-Fattah and his family by Egypt’s president.“It seems very personal,” says Seif. “Since 2019 the unofficial messages we have been getting from different Egyptian institutions is that our file is with Sisi.”Abd el-Fattah was a familiar and always approachable figure in Tahrir Square during the 2011 mass protests that led to the fall of the government of Hosni Mubarak. Articulate, passionate and thoughtful, his great skill was seen in bringing different groups together.View image in fullscreenMona Seif, left, and her sister Sanaa Seif protest against their brother’s imprisonment outside the Foreign Office in London in October 2022.Photograph: Hollie Adams/GettySentenced to jail for organising a political protest without permission in 2015, Abd el-Fattah was briefly released in March 2019 but was rearrested months later and charged with spreading “fake news undermining national security” for a retweet.One person with a personal insight into what Abd el-Fattah has been through is the activist and poet Ahmed Douma, who was imprisoned during his first spell in jail in Tora, where for 10 months the two men were in separate, solitary cells facing each other, until the authorities decided their proximity was a problem.Unlike Abd el-Fattah, Douma was pardoned and released by Sisi in 2023. January 2011 – when 18 days of mass protests led to the resignation of the then president, Hosni Mubarak – “was, still is, and will forever remain a personal enemy to Sisi. And Alaa was one of the symbols of that period,” Douma told the Guardian.“At the same time, he’s an activist who has audience and influence – a thinker with his own philosophy and interest in how political movements develop, how people move, how they understand things.“And of course, he also became a symbol of the stupidity of the authorities.“The truth is that even one hour in prison inevitably leaves an impact, and it’s not trivial,” adds Douma, who spent more than 10 years in prison. “There’s depression from what happened in prison, whether things that happened to you directly or which you witnessed. Torture, assault and so on.View image in fullscreenAlaa Abd el-Fattah was sentenced to jail for organising a political protest without permission in 2015.Photograph: Courtesy Omar Robert Hamilton/Reuters“It’s not just the impact on the body, but on the mind. At some point, you realise that you’ve been in solitary confinement for days, months, days or years, with no communication. I haven’t even begun the journey of recovery from the effects of those 10 years.”Aida Seif El-Dawla, a psychiatrist, human rights defender and co-founder of El Nadeem Center for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence, says: “Look, in Egypt, detention is a psychological torture. I don’t know what those people are punished for except that they expressed an opinion. And to put people in prison because they expressed an opinion, that’s not a legal punishment. But apparently, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi thinks otherwise.“This is the punishment of the saddest father who tortures his children for non-obedience.”What is clear is that the Egyptian authorities regard Abd el-Fattah’s detention as open ended, holding him beyond his originally scheduled release date and also holding another potential prosecution over him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s already been brutally punished. He has spent almost 10 years in prison solely for practising his human rights. Alaa’s case is extremely extraordinary, especially as Egypt has a history of releasing dual nationals who are arbitrarily detained.View image in fullscreenThe Egyptian activist Ahmed Douma on his release from prison in August 2023.Photograph: AFP/Getty“I think the fear is that if he was released, he would go abroad and criticise the government from there. But that’s not a reason to keep him arbitrarily in prison.”His lawyer, Khaled Ali, says: “Alaa should have been released on 28 September last year.” Instead, the courts have declined to include his period of pretrial detention, prior to ratification of the sentence, meaning he will not be released until 2027 – if then.Ali says: “He was sentenced to five years in prison and he has been detained since 28 September 2019. His sentence should have ended on 28 September 2024.”After a hunger strike in 2022, Abd el-Fattah has been allowed access to books and now a television in Wadi al-Natrun, from where he is able to write and receive letters from his family.“Alaa and my mum are both big science fiction fans and so he reads a massive amount,” says Seif. “Science fiction, graphic novels and anything to do with science. Now he is allowed a television, he follows tournaments. He’ll treat a tournament as a whole project. If Wimbledon is on, he will follow for the day.“But because of the way the prison was constructed, the exercise area is a big hole with concrete walls and no ceiling. He hasn’t walked in sun for over five years.”The family are able to monitor his mood via his response to the cats that have sought shelter in the prison and whom he has adopted. “If his mood is good he shares lots of pictures of the cats.” His mood in recent months as his release date has come and gone has not been good.View image in fullscreenLaila Soueif on 16 May.Photograph: Amr Abdallah Dalsh/ReutersAttempts by successive British governments and EU officials – among others – to intervene behind the scenes have been a failure as Egypt has faced no consequences for its human rights abuses. Lacking interlocutors with influence within Sisi’s immediate circle, Abd el-Fattah’s case is stuck, even as his mother’s health inLondonhas dangerously worsened.One person who has been involved in advocacy for Abd el-Fattah says: “The policy of private engagement has been going on for over 10 years.

Even the slightest indication of independence they see as defiance. The whole thing is a senseless act of pure vengeance that leaves us to keep guessing, what is it for, and when will be enough.”Ahmed Douma adds: “If I could send him a message and tell him anything, I would tell him that we are with him.

While it offered 6GB a month at a subsidised rate of 360 pesos (about $1 at black market rates), prices would rise to 3,360 pesos ($9) for the next 3GB.There was immediate uproar across a country where monthly state wages start at 2,100 pesos ($5.70) and the internet has become the route by which much of the population hears news, buys necessities, runs small businesses and communicates with relatives abroad. The average Cuban uses 10GB a month, according to the government.The students, some of whom called their protest “brave, revolutionary and respectful”, said that while the internet was the trigger, real anger is aimed at Cuba’s communist government’s increasing reliance on US dollars.In recent months, state supermarkets have opened across Cuba that only accept hard currencies. Gasoline stations are switching away from the peso. There are rumours electricity is about to follow. Each of these measures comes with foreign packages that encourage Cubans to ask their relatives abroad to pay.“The ultimate responsibility for the problem falls not on the managers and employees [of Etecsa] but on those who implemented a chaotic, if not non-existent, economic model,” read a statement from the telecommunications and electrical engineering department at CUJAE, one of Havana’s universities.Tania Velázquez, Etecsa’s president, tried to explain on state television. “We find ourselves in an extremely critical situation due to the lack of foreign currency and the significant reduction in revenue in recent years,” she said.But the student body of Havana University’s mathematics and computer sciences faculty (Matcom), swiftly expressed a widely held skepticism that any new money raised would lead to improvements.It asked for a meeting with “those primarily responsible for the measures taken, where the context under which they were taken is clarified in details and transparency”. Meanwhile, it called for its students to stay away from classes.The government blamed the six-decade old US embargo but, clearly concerned, responded. Miguel Diaz Canel, Cuba’s president, called the students “beloved”, organised meetings with them and suggested the error had been one of communication. A concession was offered: a second highly subsidised package for university students alone. This was met with scorn by the engineering students from CUJAE, who called it “an attempt to silence the student vanguard”.The protests have left the government’s usual critics in Miami wrong-footed as well, as they do not conform to the left/right debate that rages across the Florida Straits. Many student bodies made it clear they felt Etecsa’s move does not conform to the principles of the Cuban revolution, quoting revolutionary heroes including Fidel Castro.It reflects a growing sense on the island that the government is moving away from its socialist principles, while not liberalising the economy enough to allow people to earn the money now needed to live.Founded in 1922, the FEU once fought against Cuba’s pre-revolutionary dictatorships, but has been quiet since.Michael Bustamante, chair of Cuban and Cuban-American studies at the University of Miami, said: “I don’t think there is any comparable pushback to a government measure on this scale since university autonomy ended as it existed prior to the revolution.”But the measures do come at a tough time for final-year students, with only about two weeks of the semester to run, followed by important exams. On Monday, Matcom voted to return to classes, despite the new rates “not being validated by real and convincing data”.Transgressions in Cuba, political or otherwise, can lead to lifelong consequences for students, losing not only the ability to graduate, but also to find jobs.A mother of a psychology student expressed her fears: “I support my daughter in whatever she decides,” she said. “But I feel her ambivalence and anguish. Her heart wants to be involved, but common sense tells her that she has to graduate.”But another student, who asked to remain nameless, said a precedent has been set: “This has awakened something historic,” she said. “We have gained confidence and organisation for everything that troubles us in the future.”Eileen Sosin contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsCubaUniversitiesHigher educationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Tesla just about remained the biggest seller of EVs globally in 2024.Tesla has since been hit by a backlash over Musk’s role in Donald Trump’s administration. Registrations for new Teslas in Europehalved in Aprilcompared with the same month a year earlier. Musk remains the world’s richest man, worth more than $400bn (£295bn), according to Forbes.Electric cars are alreadymuch cheaper to own than their petrol equivalentsfor most people, but the arrival of smaller models with a comparable sticker price to fossil fuel cars is seen as important in persuading lower-income buyers.Analysts suggest that BYD has a lot of room to cut the price of the Dolphin Surf further. The company sells a near-identical model under the Seagull name inChinafor about £6,000, although Chinese safety regulations are significantly less onerous.The company’s European growth has come despite the EU imposing17.4% tariffs on BYDon the grounds of allegedly unfair state aid from China.In contrast, the UK has not added tariffs on Chinese electric cars, and has therefore been the biggest target market for Chinese brands. BYD sells through a network of dealerships across Britain.The UK accounted for 30% of all Chinese electric models sold in Europe in March, according to Matthias Schmidt, an electric vehicle analyst, with brands like Xpeng, Leapmotor and Jaecoo, owned by state-controlled Chery also trying to win market share.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Citroën ë-C3 starts at £18,305, while Renault’s well-received 5 model starts at £22,995.The Dolphin Surf has an official range of up to 137 miles, but also has some features that are generally found on more expensive models, such as a rotating touchscreen and driver assistance functions like intelligent cruise control and automatic emergency braking.BYD has taken a deliberate decision to offer much of the same technology on lower-end models as are found in its premium vehicles, in an effort to drive down the cost of sensors and software whilemaintaining its lead over rivals.The Surf uses BYD’s Blade battery, which relies on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for its cathode. LFP batteries are made from cheaper materials than lithium batteries that use more expensive nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC) – although the latter offer better performance such as longer range.While carmakers in Europe have until now mostly focused on NMC batteries to help assuagerange anxietyamong early adopters, LFP batteries have proved to be hugely popular among Chinese buyers looking for a cheaper upfront cost. More than 80% of electric cars sold in China in 2024 used LFP batteries, according to data cited by Kallanish Commodities, an industry news provider.BYD’s main Chinese battery rival,Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited(Catl), has also invested heavily in LFP technology in the race to dominate the global electric vehicle industry. Both companies are also competing to offer full recharging in minutes.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsChinaTeslaAsia PacificMotoringTravel and transportnewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, urged Beijing to prevent a repeat of the incident, which took place at the weekend.Hayashi said the near miss, which occurred in international waters, could have caused an accidental collision.Chinese aircraft carrier group enters waters near Japan’s easternmost island for first timeRead moreJapan’s defence ministry said a J-15 fighter jet from the Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong had engaged in other “dangerous” activity, including passing in front of an SDF aircraft flying at the same altitude about 900 metres away.Although there was no damage to the Japanese plane or injuries among its crew, Japan had “expressed serious concerns” over the “abnormal approaches”, the ministry said.On Thursday afternoon, China’s foreign affairs ministry rejected Japan’s claim. “The root cause of the risk to maritime and air security was the close reconnaissance of China’s normal military activities by a Japanese warplane,” the ministry’s spokesperson, Lin Jian, told a regular press briefing. “The Chinese side urges the Japanese side to stop this kind of dangerous behaviour.”Chinese military officials have previously accused Japan’s military of “highly dangerous” actions with its surveillance of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) activity. But this week’s incidents have added to concern across the Asia-Pacific region about China’s increasingly bold naval and air activity.Chinese fighter pilots have been accused of dangerous manoeuvres by several countries, including Australia, the Philippines, the US and Canada, as recently as February. That month the PLA also held live-fire drills in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand.Chinasees its carrier groups as essential to its goal of projecting power in the region’s oceans. It routinely sends coast guard vessels, warships and warplanes to areas arounddisputed islandsin the East China Sea, but it appears to be extending its reach.Earlier this week, however, the foreign ministry defended the dual aircraft carrier drills in the Pacific, urging Japan to “view those activities objectively and rationally”.“China’s military vessels’ activities in relevant waters are fully consistent with international law and international practices,” Lin said. “China pursues a national defence policy that is defensive in nature.”The dual carrier drills, which officials said were designed to test “troops’ capabilities in far-sea defence and joint operations”, are a sign of China’s intention to expand its presence beyond the first and second island chains that border its eastern coastline.The first chain refers to the Pacific archipelago off the Asian mainland that includes Japan,Taiwanand part of the Philippines; the second is a strategic line that extends to Guam, a US territory in the Pacific. Last weekend wasthe first time a Chinese carrier had sailed east of the second chain.Japan’s defence minister, Gen Nakatani, said: “China apparently aims to elevate its capability of the two aircraft carriers, and to advance its operational capability of the distant sea and airspace.”Chinese state officials and media insist the naval activity is not aimed at a specific country or entity, but the PLA is openly working towards being able to launch aland invasion of Taiwan.On Wednesday, Chinese state media accused Japan of potentially breaching its postwar constitution, which limits its armed forced to a strictly defensive role, with plans to deploy new missile systems to the southern main island of Kyushu. The reports said the deployment, along with other weapons procurement, was “confrontational” and would “ultimately affect the peaceful development prospects of the entire region”.The Shandong and a second Chinese aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, entered an area of Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) – an area within 200 nautical miles (370km) of its coastline – in the Pacific for the first time last weekend.The Shandong sailed through waters 550km south-east of Japan’s Miyako Island in the southern prefecture of Okinawa on Saturday, the Japanese defence ministry said, adding that it had conducted takeoff and landing drills involving fighter jets and helicopters north of Okinotori, Japan’s southernmost island, and inside its EEZ.The Liaoning was spotted the same day 300km south-west of the easternmost island of Minamitori, before leaving Japan’s EEZ to conduct similar exercises on Sunday, the Kyodo news agency said.Explore more on these topicsJapanChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Curriculum changes would be made in 2026 and 2027, with mergers and reductions largely attributed to low enrolment figures.The proposal, released to staff on 3 June, said the prospect of international student caps and “uncertainty” in domestic student growth meantAustralian universitiescould no longer rely on boosting enrolments to ensure financial sustainability.“The objective of the changes … is to resize the workforce in areas where current staff profile and capacity is not aligned to student demand.”Five vice-chancellors in Victoria paid more than $1m in 2024, prompting claims of ‘largesse’Read moreStaff have less than a month to provide feedback about the cuts. A final decision is expected to be made in early July.A spokesperson for Macquarie said the proposed curriculum changes were designed to ensure education remained “transformative” for students.“The needs of employers and students are evolving and universities, including Macquarie, need to adapt to modern demands,” they said.“While we are preserving traditional humanities subjects such as history, philosophy and English literature, we are at the same time offering majors and courses that are focused on employability and meeting areas of student interest and demand.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe president of the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) and an academic at Macquarie, Dr Alison Barnes, said she had been receiving “constant calls” from academics worried about changes at their institutions.More than a dozen universities are undergoing restructuring, including ANU, UTS, Western Sydney University and the University of Wollongong. The NTEU estimated thatmore than 1,000 roles were on the line, less than five years aftermore than 17,000 job cutsduring the Covid pandemic – 13% of the workforce.LiveWho screwed millennials out of affordable education? Episode three – video“Another round of job cuts is extremely damaging to people’s wellbeing, they’re living with systemic uncertainty,” Barnes said.“It’s also having a corrosive impact on students. They need to be able to study things that they are inherently interested in.”At Macquarie, ancient history and archaeology, creative arts, politics and international relations and the school of sociology would all lose up to, or more than, half of their FTE staff. Media and communications – which jointly operates the 2SER radio station with the University of Technology, Sydney – would be reduced by about a quarter under the proposed changes.Majors would also be discontinued in a string of study areas including politics, gender studies and performing arts, while a number of bachelor degrees would be abolished, including music, ancient history and archeology – which would be incorporated into a new bachelor of history. The number of media majors would also be reduced from six to three.Ten new research positions would be created in science and engineering, and two in education.Australian universities urge Albanese to join NZ in $170bn Europe fund amid Trump attacks on educationRead moreBarnes said it “shocked” her that the humanities wasbeing particularly targeted.“It’s this hollowing out of our institutions. You’ve got people who’ve worked their entire lives in these disciplines, and then that knowledge is lost, which is why I think these decisions are so incredibly damaging and shortsighted.“It’s a travesty, and it’s heartbreaking.”The acting president of the Australian Historical Association, Prof Kate Fullagar, said the cuts were part of the “ongoing devaluation” of humanities at Macquarie and most Australian universities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The curriculum you study will be more purposeful. Your pathway to graduation will be easier.”An associate professor in the department of history and archaeology at Macquarie, Paul McKechnie, who has worked at the university for almost 20 years, said it would be challenging to adequately cover teaching with “so few staff”.McKechnie said he was “sceptical” about Macquarie’s claims that the cuts were being made because of falling student numbers. A change paper seen by Guardian Australia, which was published by the university and distributed to staff last year, showed the arts generated $133m in annual profit but cost $48.6m to run.The vice-chancellor of Macquarie, Prof Bruce Dowton, said universities in western democracies were facing a “range of external pressures” and Australia was no exception.Macquarie has run a deficit for five of the past six years, including a $4m loss in 2024. It cut its workforcein 2020 and 2021around the time of the pandemic.“We understand that changes of this nature can be unsettling and we do not take them lightly,” Dowton said.“Our community can be assured that we are proposing these changes because they are needed.”The NTEU branch president for Macquarie and a senior lecturer in quantitative sociology, Nicholas Harrigan, said the cuts were a “disgrace”.“That is simply stealing from students.”The Macquarie spokesperson said the proposed changes were the result of “careful planning and reflection”. Teaching overall was “generally financially sustainable” but that wasn’t “uniformly true”.“Courses and units with low enrolments are generally more likely to be loss-making after all costs are fully allocated,” they said.“Strategic realignment allows us to focus on areas of sustainable strength, invest in emerging disciplines and make choices to safeguard our future.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian universitiesHigher educationNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

I had two snake catchers come to the property to relocate them, this also assisted with the cleanup as I was too frightened of picking things up or entering the shed,” Botfield told Guardian Australia on Wednesday.Mid-north coast mother Julie Botfield and her children found a large number of snakes and spiders when they returned home.Photograph: Julie BotfieldThe NSW floods were bad enough.

The European Commission insisted that the British territory had to align its taxation policies with the EU in order to join a customs union, an integral part ofthe deal struck on Wednesday.“The agreement that we have reached is that they will, in a period of three years, reach a level [on a transaction tax] that is acceptable for us,” the person said.The agreement, hailed as “historic”, will erase the border separating the British overseas territory from the rest of the Iberian peninsula. Gibraltar will be connected to the EU’s border-free Schengen zone, meaning Gibraltarians can move freely in the surrounding region, although without rights to work and settle elsewhere in the EU.Passport checks will be carried out at the port and airport by British and Spanish border guards. Spanish officers will be empowered to deny entry to the British overseas territory to any British national who has already exceeded their 90-day stay limit. Under Schengen rules, UK citizens are limited to stays of 90 days within a 180-day period.Spanish customs officials will also check goods entering Gibraltar via the land border, the main entry point for nearly all items. The British overseas territory will eventually enter into a customs union with the EU, which requires a further agreement.Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, has welcomed “the tax convergence process that will ensure that everybody is treated fairly”. He said: “Now Gibraltar is linked to the customs union. There will be fair competition for everybody.”Madrid has long been concerned that cigarettes from Gibraltar were being illegally sold in Spain, whileEuropean anti-fraud investigators have warned about cross-border smuggling by organised crime.The government of Gibraltar, which is responsible for setting taxation on the British overseas territory, has been contacted for comment.The Gibraltar agreement came weeks after the UK and EUagreed on a wider reset. EU sources said completing the unfinished business of Brexit for Gibraltar was necessary to move forward in other areas, such as defence and a veterinary agreement.Spain has been blocking British participation in defence projects and could have proved an obstacle to future deals if the status of Gibraltar had not been agreed. “Everyone wanted to find compromises, solutions, etc, and it was the right moment to do that,” the official said.Explore more on these topicsGibraltarSpainEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

All deny any wrongdoing. A former PSOE member was recently implicated in an alleged smear campaign against the Guardia Civil police unit investigating the corruption allegations.The pressure on his administration increased further on Thursday when the judge announced he had “firm evidence” that suggested Santos Cerdán, the PSOE’s organisational secretary, had discussed taking kickbacks on public contracts with the former transport minister, José Luis Ábalos, and one of the minister’s aides, Koldo García. Cerdán stepped down from his party role and resigned his parliamentary seat shortly after the news broke.Speaking at a hastily convened press conference at his party’s headquarters, Sánchez asked for the forgiveness of Spanish citizens and of PSOE voters but said he had known “absolutely nothing” about the allegations concerning Cerdán until details of the Guardia Civil investigation appeared in the media.“Until this very morning, I was convinced of Santos Cerdán’s integrity,” he said. “This morning we learned the full extent of the evidence and the evidence is very serious. Very serious. That’s why, as well as asking for Santos Cerdán’s resignation as organisational secretary of the party this afternoon … I will set up an external audit of the socialist party’s accounts.”The prime minister added: “Like any other person, I have my virtues and I have many shortcomings. Many shortcomings. But I have always believed in working for clean politics and fair play in politics.”However, Sánchez said there would be no snap general election despite the PP’s repeated calls for a fresh poll in response to the corruption allegations.“There will be no election until [the scheduled one] in 2027,” he said. “Because this isn’t about me or the socialist party or PSOE MPs; it’s about a political project that’s doing good things for the country.”In a statement announcing his resignation, Cerdán insisted he was innocent and said he was standing down in order to “focus exclusively on defending myself and on providing relevant explanations that will show … that I have never committed an illegal act nor been complicit in one”. He said he would voluntarily testify before the supreme court, as requested, on 25 June.Ábalos was sacked from Sánchez’s cabinet in 2021 andsuspended by the PSOEin February last year after refusing to resign when his assistant, García, was accused of taking bribes to facilitate mask contracts during the Covid pandemic. Both are the subjects of ongoing corruption investigations and both have denied any wrongdoing.The PP,which organised a large demonstration in Madridon Sunday to protest against the Sánchez government and to call for an early general election, said the case against the prime minister and his circle was utterly damning. The party’s leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, described Sánchez’s response as “insufficient and disappointing” and called again for a return to the polls.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Police said it was unknown if he had deliberately targeted her.The 59-year-old teacher was killed along with nine pupils – six female and three male – aged between 14 and 17. Nine people are still being treated in hospital for their injuries, including a male teacher, but all were stable and the last two in intensive care were to be moved out during the course of the day, health officials said.It also emerged on Thursday in a report by the state broadcaster ORF, which was confirmed by a spokesperson for Austria’s military, that the killer had recently failed a psychological test to enter the armed forces.However, he had even more recently passed the psychological checks required to be in possession of the weapons he used to carry out the killings, which he carried legally, police said.The man, who had attended the school and dropped out three years ago, was an apprentice at an industrial school. He lived alone with his mother and was not previously known to police.The shooting rampage, the worst in Austria’s history, has sparked an emotional debate over the state of the country’s gun laws, which critics have said are too lax.During a visit to Graz on Wednesday evening, Austria’s president, Alexander Van der Bellen, said it was necessary for politicians to review the laws and to “look into how it is possible for a 21-year-old to own handguns and long weapons and have the opportunity to purchase the appropriate ammunition for them and to cause this mayhem”.Austria’s national security council, set up in light of the 9/11 attacks in the US, was due to address the issue when it met on Thursday afternoon. Discussions have also begun about tightening security in schools, with some calling for the installation of metal detectors at school gates.Michael Lohnegger, the head of the Styrian state criminal police office, said the man planned the attack in minute detail. He described how the man entered the main entrance of the BORG Dreierschützengasse school at 9.43am on Tuesday carrying a backpack containing his weapons and ammunition. Between 350 and 400 pupils were present on site at the time.“He went into a toilet on the third floor and took various objects out of his rucksack. He put on a weapons belt with a hunting knife, a pair of shooting glasses and a headset, took out a Glock 19 pistol, a sawn-off Mercury shotgun and loaded the weapons.View image in fullscreenA condolence message written in Romanian and German hangs on the gate to the BORG Dreierschützengasse school in Graz.Photograph: Erwin Scheriau/APA/AFP/Getty“At 9.47 he proceeded to carry out a seven-minute rampage through the school, going from the third to the second floor, and opened fire randomly on people in the school, who were from the 5th class.“He finally went to the third floor where pupils of the 7th class were … fired at the closed doors of the classrooms until he was able to open them and then randomly shot at the people he found there.”He finally returned to the toilet cubicle on the third floor where he subsequently shot himself in the head at 10.07am, Lohnegger said.Owing to the fact that the first team of armed police entered the school building at 10.06am and heard no shots, investigators are working on the assumption that Arthur A might well have planned to carry out more killings, as he had plenty more ammunition on his person, but his knowledge that police were in the building may have prompted him to stop.There was no evidence that the killer knew the pupils he shot, Lohnegger added, but it had been established he had been taught by the teacher who was killed. There was no evidence that this was a motive behind the killing, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had informed himself extremely precisely and given a lot of thought as to when he would approach each floor.” There was no information as to when he abandoned plans to deploy ahomemade pipe bomb, found at his home, after it proved to be dysfunctional, although Lohnegger said it “in theory contained all the components necessary” to work.Arthur A bought the shotgun in mid-April and the handgun several weeks later. He had been attending shooting practice at a range in Graz since March, Lohnegger said.He said people at the school had reacted “very well” to the incident, after recent training in what to do in case of a shooting, by shutting doors and barricading themselves into classrooms.Police said they had yet to rule out that the killer may have had an accomplice who helped him in his planning or in his execution of the attack.Lohnegger described Arthur A as someone who lived a “very reserved” life and “was not very willing to participate in real life”.Austrian school shooter planned to detonate pipe bomb, say policeRead moreA search of the flat where he lived with his mother in a suburb south of Graz had uncovered a suicide note “directed as an apology towards his family”.The first details of some of the victims began emerging on Wednesday evening. A 15-year-old Bosnian-Austrian girl called Hana was one of the first to be killed, her family said. She had been preparing to give a lecture to her class.Speaking on behalf of her Bosnian Muslim family, Sabahudin Hasić, a local imam, said they were “utterly destroyed, as is our whole community. This deed is completely unimaginable.” Hana had wanted to study medicine, he said, describing her as a “sunshine”.In a post on social media, her father wrote: “My little mouse, may God give you paradise”.Standing next to her in class had been Lea B, who was also killed. The 15-year-old’s family had come to Austria from Kosovo, and she was born in Austria. Sokol Haliti, the mayor of Viti, the family’s home town in Kosovo, told Austrian media that the community where her father was born and where her grandparents still live was in mourning.“It is a terrible tragedy. Not only for Austria. Lea was also one of us,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAustriaGun crimeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

For poultry farming alone, the UK ranks as having the second-highest number of intensive farms at 1,553, behind France with 2,342.‘I felt hopeful about my daughter’s future’: the farmers fixing our eco crisis – in picturesRead moreThe top 10 countries for intensive pig and poultry farms combined are Spain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, UK, Denmark, Poland, Belgium and Hungary, according to information obtained from the European Commission, and country-specific regulatory agencies and colleges.Intensive livestock units are farms where 40,000 or more poultry, 2,000 or more fattening pigs, or 750 or more breeding sows are being held at any one time in the EU and the UK. The increase in so-called megafarms across Europe comesas the number of small farms has reduced dramatically,and the income gap between large and small farms has increased, according to Guardian research. Therise in intensive farming has coincided with a decline in birds, tree species and butterfly numbers.In the Severn and Wye Valleys, a UK hotspot for intensive poultry farming, there are 79 chickens per human, the Guardian has revealed.Across Europe the rise in large intensive poultry units is akey driver of river pollution. Chicken droppings contain more phosphates – which starve fish and river plants of oxygen – than any other animal manure.In the UK the number of intensive farms grew from 1,621 in 2017 to 1,824 in 2023, and according to data released under freedom of information laws to Terry Jermy, the MP for South West Norfolk, megafarms in England have breached environmental regulations nearly 7,000 times since 2015.The data shows that the Environment Agency carried out about 17 inspections of intensive livestock units a week in which 75% of those inspections found breaches.The breaches include slurry pits in disrepair, causing them to leak and pollute the local environment, and a serious case in which a site of special scientific interest was polluted by animal effluent. There were also some serious air pollution incidents and numerous breaches involving the over-stocking of animals.When serious breaches were found, action against the farms was rare. For the most serious breaches (category 1 and 2), more than half received either no further action, “advice/guidance” or a warning. Fewer than half of the incidents received further action such as a formal warning, and less than 1% received a “recommended” prosecution.Jermy said: “These shocking numbers alongside the severity of the litany of offences clearly show that the huge increase to US-style factory farms since 2017 is harming our land and jeopardising our climate targets and sustainability ambitions moving forward.“In my constituency farming is our lifeblood, as is the environment, and therefore, we must have a serious conversation as to what kind of farming we need moving forwards. It must be one that protects our communities, agriculture and nature, while furthering animal welfare standards as well as harnessing food security.”An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “Environmental permitting provides a consistent, robust form of regulation, which identifies all non-compliances and requires them to be addressed, regardless of severity. In the past two years 98% of intensive pig and poultry farms have been scored in the highest bands for compliance, meaning they present a very low risk to the environment. This follows ongoing high levels of compliance over previous years.“The vast majority of non-compliances identified are low risk, and we work with farmers to achieve compliance. Any high-risk non-compliances, or farms that fail to bring themselves into compliance, will face enforcement action.”Norfolk has been dubbed the “megafarm capital of Europe” with statistics from Compassion in WorldFarmingshowing there are now 122 megafarms in the county and 25,748,309 factory-farmed animals.A megafarm in Jermy’s constituency that would have reared almost 900,000 chickens and pigs at any one time wasrecently blockedby councillors over climate and pollution concerns. There were objections raised over air pollution and the impact on a water-depleted area.Revelations about the scale of livestock megafarms across Europe should be a wake-up call in Brussels, said Reineke Hameleers, the CEO of Eurogroup for Animals.“[It] goes against promises to improve animal welfare and move toward more sustainable farming. It’s important that the European Commission makes smart, informed choices about the future of farming. Funding should go to farming systems that are truly sustainable, competitive, and resilient.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

TheTrump administrationhas privately told Israel that it would not participate in a strike, according to Axios.Trump conceded an Israeli attack against Iran’s nuclear programme “could very well happen”.“There’s a chance of massive conflict,” he said. “We have a lot of American people in this area. And I said we have to tell them to get out soon. And I don’t want to be the one that didn’t give any warning and missiles are flying into their buildings.”On Thursday the commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, said the retaliation to any Israeli aggression would be “more forceful and destructive” than in past offensives, after Tehran said it had been alerted to a potential attack.US orders non-essential embassy staff out of Iraq amid growing Middle East tensionsRead moreThe US decision to pull personnel from embassies and bases in the Middle East sparked concerns over an impending military strike but also speculation that the Trump administration may be increasing pressure on Iran to concede to a deal in order to avert a regional war.Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, will travel to Oman for a sixth round of talks with Iranian officials on Sunday, a source familiar with his travel plans said on Thursday.Trump said: “I want to have an agreement with Iran. We’re fairly close to a pretty good agreement … as long as I think there is agreement, I don’t want [Israel] going in, because I think it could blow it.”He later added in a social media post that Iran would never obtain a nuclear weapon. “We remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue!” he wrote. “My entire Administration has been directed to negotiate with Iran. They could be a Great Country, but they first must completely give up hopes of obtaining a Nuclear Weapon.”The motion by the UN nuclear watchdog on Thursday focused on Iran’s refusal since 2019 to explain activity at three secret nuclear sites, but also on Iran’s buildup of its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, close to weapons grade. The European powers said the IAEA had not been able to guarantee that Iran’s nuclear programme was exclusively peaceful.The watchdog’s vote is a necessary precursor to European powers using their right to reimpose UN-wide sanctions on Iran in the autumn. The motion was passed with 19 votes in favour, three against and 11 abstentions. In a joint statement, the three European powers and the US said: “It is not the board that is forcing this step on Iran, but Iran who is forcing this step on the board.”Iran’s nuclear chief, Mohammad Eslami, disclosed that a new, previously secret third enrichment site had been built and was ready to operate when equipped with machinery. He said advanced sixth-generation enrichment machines would replace first-generation machines at its Fordow fuel enrichment site.The sense of imminent drama intensified late on Wednesday when the US state department said it had ordered the departure of all non-essential personnel and their dependents from its embassy in Baghdad.Simultaneously, a US official said the defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, had authorised the voluntary departure of military dependents from countries across the region, including Bahrain and Kuwait. American soldiers in the region were not affected by this order.View image in fullscreenThe US has ordered the departure of all non-essential personnel and their dependents from its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq.Photograph: Hadi Mizban/APThe key sticking point in the nuclear talks is Iran’s right to enrich uranium domestically.Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said Iran would not back down on its right to enrich and said his country would go its own way. In return for the lifting of sanctions, it has offered to enrich uranium inside its country subject to greater IAEA inspection and previously agreed limits on enrichment of 3.67%.In what could be a preparation for an Israeli attack, but may yet be Trump loading the psychological bargaining chips before Sunday’s talks, Israel’s strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, and the Mossad intelligence agency head, David Barnea, will meet Witkoff in advance of the Oman-brokered nuclear talks.Iran regards the Trump demand not to enrich as unreasonable since other nuclear non-proliferation treaty states are allowed to do so, and Iran’s right had been accepted by the Obama and Biden administrations.Iran says its nuclear ambitions are confined to a civil nuclear programme, but Israel claims past Iranian deceit means military action is the only certain way to remove the threat of Iran acquiring a nuclear bomb.Israel believes that after its two military exchanges with Tehran last year, Iranian air defences are uniquely vulnerable, and Iran’s preparations for a bomb are so advanced that delay would be a historic error.David Albright, the president of the Institute for Science and International Security, said: “If you are at 60% enriched, you are 99% of the way to weapon-grade uranium, which is the ideal material for nuclear weapons. So this programme does not look like a civil programme. It looks like they are going up the ladder to get toward weapon-grade uranium while not actually making the weapon-grade uranium.”He said Iran could get to weapons-grade uranium within a week, while a crude nuclear explosive device could be attached within months.Albright said Israel had very good intelligence on the layout of Iran’s nuclear sites, especially the Fordow fuel enrichment plant. He said: “They know exactly how the tunnels go, where they start, how they zig and zag, where the ventilation system is, the power supplies. And without it, you don’t have to bring down the roof of the enrichment hall to put that facility out of operation for a long time and make it very hard to get into.”It is contested whether Israel, lacking the US’s 30,000lb bunker-bustingMoab ( “mother of all bombs”), has the capability to destroy the Fordow facility due to its depth underground.Explore more on these topicsIranIran's nuclear programmeIran nuclear dealIsraelTrump administrationUS foreign policyInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)newsShareReuse this content"

Each time, however, Israel has held back in the absence of US support.US orders non-essential embassy staff out of Iraq amid growing Middle East tensionsRead more“This pattern of behavior repeats like a script kept in a drawer, dusted off and updated,” Yossi Melman, a veteran Israeli military and intelligence analyst, wrote inHaaretz newspaper this month.“Israel won’t attack Iran’s nuclear sites,” Melman concluded. “Without American assistance in both defence and offence, such a strike would be ineffective and send millions of Israelis into the shelters for long stints.”In going it alone, the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, risks a ballistic missile backlash on Israel’s cities, with no guarantee he can deal an enduring blow to Iran’s deeply buried nuclear facilities, such as the enrichment plants in Natanz and Fordow, and the third site which Iran says is now ready to receive equipment.Unlike the incipient Iraqi and Syrian nuclear programmes, which Israel struck with decisive effect in 1981 and 2007, Iran’s nuclear infrastructure is highly advanced, very well protected, spread over many sites and, by now, almost entirely indigenous.Destroying enrichment chambers deep underground or dug into the side of mountains would require intricate knowledge of the defences and very big bombs, such as the 30,000lb (13,600kg) Massive Ordnance Penetrator, which the US has and the Israeli air force does not.Even with such a bomb, a study in March by theRoyal United Services Institutesuggested it “would likely require multiple impacts at the same aiming point” to have a good chance of penetrating the underground facility at Natanz and the mountain facility at Fordow, both estimated to be 80-100 metres deep.“Strikes with lesser penetrating weapons could still collapse entry and exit tunnels given good intelligence about their exact layout and location,” the study said, but that would be a more temporary setback for the Iranians.To reach Iran’s multiple far-flung facilities and come back in successive waves to bomb buried targets would be an enormous endeavour. Any damage could be repaired because Iran has enough homegrown expertise in every stage of the nuclear cycle and, theoretically, in weaponisation. This deep reservoir of knowhow will be all but impossible to eradicate, though Israel has tried in the past with an assassination campaign against Iranian scientists.UN watchdog finds Iran failing to comply with nuclear obligationsRead moreTo wound Iran but fall short of killing off its nuclear programme could be a fatal own-goal. The Iranians could rebuild bigger and deeper than before or, at worse, the supreme leader could order a dash to construct a usable warhead, the fatal last step that Iran has avoided until now.Meanwhile, as Iran has made clear in the past few days, it would fire back with all its might. With the help of the US and other allies, Israel weathered drone and missile attacks in April and October last year with little damage, but those were calibrated Iranian responses to earlier, limited, Israeli actions. Tehran did not go all out and did not aim at Israeli cities. Netanyahu could not rule out a mass casualty Iranian counter-strike.For the time being, the Israeli moves are more likely to be designed to create the most favourable conditions for a sixth round of US-Iran talks in Oman on Sunday. However, as diplomatic off-ramps go, this seems particularly narrow and badly thought out.Donald Trump and his favoured troubleshooter, Steve Witkoff, have so far locked themselves in a maximalist negotiating position, stipulating that Iran must give up all uranium enrichment, a condition Tehran is highly unlikely to accept no matter what compensation they are offered. If Trump thought the regime would give up something that has become an embodiment of its sovereignty, it was almost certainly a miscalculation.If the Oman talks collapse, the credibility of Trump’s threats will be in question and he will come under redoubled Israeli pressure to facilitate an attack. Netanyahu and his top security officials, who are going to brief Witkoff in person before Sunday’s talks, will make the argument that there is a narrow and closing window for the attacks.Israel badly damaged Iran’s air defences in its retaliation for the October missile attack and they are still being rebuilt.If there is one thread of consistency in Trump’s otherwise chaotic foreign policy approach, however, it is his deep distaste for war. He will know that US bases, embassies, ships and planes would become targets if the US takes part in strikes. Iran could also block the strait of Hormuz, the bottleneck in the oil supply route from the Gulf.The consequent oil price increase is likely to dwarf the inflationary surge that hobbled the Biden administration. Peace, diplomacy and low inflation are central to Trump’s self-justification before next year’s congressional elections.There are compromises available. Scholars at Princeton University have recently refined a longstanding proposal for aregional enrichment consortiumin the Gulf which would address proliferation concerns.The historic finding by the International Atomic Energy Agency board that Iran is in violation of its legal obligations offers a return to more cohesive international sanctions as an alternative to war, to give more time for diplomacy. Whether these last-ditch options are grasped is ultimately down to Trump.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIranDonald TrumpTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuanalysisShareReuse this content"

The decree also asked men not to be shirtless when not swimming.“Visitors to public beaches and pools, whether tourists or locals, are required to wear appropriate swimwear that takes into account public taste and the sensibilities of various segments of society,” the tourism minister, Mazen al-Salhani, said in a statement.The guidelines would not apply to luxury resorts, where the decree said “normal western swimwear” was permitted.The order provoked outrage and accusations that the Islamist-led government was trying to impose its version of morality on Syrians, many of whom, but not all, prefer conservative clothing.The government was quick to clarify that the directive was merely advice and there would be no legal penalties for those who did not follow them. Instead, the government quickly published a list of beaches where western-style swimwear such as bikinis can be worn and other beaches where burkinis are preferred.“This does not mean that beaches where modest clothing is preferred that western clothing is prohibited, but that we respect public preferences and cultural, religious and social diversity in Syria,” Ghaith al-Farah, the deputy tourism minister, said in an interview with the Syrian channel Al-Ikhbariyah on Wednesday.He further said the directives had been published as part of general guidelines for public conduct and safety during the summer, which included advice on not getting sunburnt and avoiding certain fish. The tourism ministry said authorities would only patrol the perimeter of beaches, and it published pictures of beaches with people in bikinis on X on Thursday.Despite the seeming walking back on the decision, some Syrians worried this indicated a desire from the Syrian government to impose its own standards for women’s dress.It was the first time the new government had made any decrees on women’s dress since the toppling of the former president Bashar al-Assad in December, and fanned fears among Syria’s religious minorities. Though the Assad regime curtailed most freedoms in Syria, it was fiercely secular and did not control women’s dress.Maya Saloum, a 24-year-old English teacher from Jaramana, a suburb of Damascus, said: “It’s not their call to make decisions for others and decide what to wear and where to wear it.”Sara, a 20-year-old student in Damascus using a pseudonym, said: “Neither the government nor anyone else should interfere in such matters. In my view there are far more important issues the country needs to address than interfering with and limiting people’s freedoms.”She complained that since December she had received verbal harassment for wearing shorts or sleeveless tops in the streets from individuals and some security forces.Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has previously promised to protect freedoms and religious diversity in Syria and to guarantee women’s rights under his rule.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaWomennewsShareReuse this content"

The plane crashed into a hostel housing medical students, doctors and their families in the Meghani Nagar residential area and at least 24 people on the ground died.On Thursday night, Air India confirmed that 241 of those on board had been killed in the crash, with a Briton, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, the sole survivor. The combined death toll makes it the world’s worst aviation disaster for more than a decade.India’s home minister, Amit Shah, said the intense heat caused by burning jet fuel meant that had been little chance for anyone who survived impact to escape. “There was 125,000 litres of fuel inside the plane and it caught heat so it was impossible to save anyone,” he said. The final death toll would only be known after the DNA testing had been completed on the victims’ remains, he said.Videos of the aftermath showed smoke rising over the area and firefighters on charred streets as people were moved on stretchers. In other images, people were seen assessing the damage while part of the mangled plane could be seen sticking out of a building. Pieces of the aircraft’s landing gear, fuselage and tail protruded from the wreckage. Residents said the crash sounded like a bomb blast and felt like an earthquake.Satellite map showing path of planeIndia’s aviation minister said a formal investigation had been opened, as emergency teams searched the wreckage for clues, including the black box flight recorders. It is not yet known what caused the accident but CCTV footage showing the entire incident will be crucial evidence for investigators.Ramesh, from London, described seeing bodies all around him after the crash.“Thirty seconds after takeoff, there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed. It all happened so quickly,” Ramesh, who still had his boarding pass, told theHindustan Times. He said he had “impact injuries”, including bruising on his chest, eyes and feet, but was otherwise lucid and conscious.“When I got up, there were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me. Someone grabbed hold of me and put me in an ambulance and brought me to the hospital.”1:16At least one survivor from Air India plane crash, Ahmedabad police say – videoFootage filmed shortly after the crash showed Ramesh bloodied and limping as he walked to an ambulance. Police said he had been sitting in an emergency exit row and had managed to jump out.The Ahmedabad police commissioner, Gyanendra Singh Malik, told ANI there was one survivor who was in seat 11A, which corresponded to Ramesh’s seat on the flight manifest.Seating plan graphicVidhi Chaudhary, a police officer, told Reuters: “Approximately 294 have died. This includes some students as the plane crashed on the building where they were staying.”Three of the Britons who died in the crash have been named as Akeel Nanabawa, his wife, Hannaa, and their four-year-old daughter, Sara, according to a statement posted by Gloucester Muslim Community on Facebook.Air India’s chair, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, described the crash as a “tragic accident”.A video obtained by local media showed the aircraft flying over a residential area before crashing, creating what appeared to be a large explosion.0:30Social media footage shows moment Air India plane crashed – videoAccording to air traffic control at Ahmedabad airport, the aircraft departed at 1.39pm (9.09am BST) from runway 23. It issued a mayday call after which nothing more was heard from the flight deck.The 242 people onboard included two pilots and 10 cabin crew. The passengers included 217 adults, 11 children and two infants, according to Reuters. Of them, 169 were Indian nationals, 53 were Britons, seven Portuguese, and one Canadian, Air India said.What we know so far about the Air India flight 171 crashRead moreChandrasekaran said a support team had been set up for families seeking information. In a post on X, he said: “With profound sorrow I confirm that Air India flight 171 operating Ahmedabad London Gatwick was involved in a tragic accident today.“Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with the families and loved ones of all those affected by this devastating event. At this moment, our primary focus is on supporting all the affected people and their families.“We are doing everything in our power to assist the emergency response teams at the site and to provide all necessary support and care to those impacted.”View image in fullscreenThe plane crashed into a residential area of Ahmedabad, which included a hostel for doctors and medical students.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesTata Group, the parent company of Air India, said it would provide 10m rupees (£86,000) to the families of those killed in the crash. The company said it would also cover the medical costs of those injured and provide support in the “building up” of the medical college hit by the plane.India’s civil aviation minister, Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu, posted on X that rescue teams had been mobilised and all efforts were being made to ensure medical aid and relief support was available at the site.Residents told Agence France-Presse about the aftermath of the crash. “When we reached the spot there were several bodies lying around and firefighters were dousing the flames. Many of the bodies were burned,” said Poonam Patni.Another witness, who did not want to be named, said: “We saw people from the building jumping from the second and third floor to save themselves. The plane was in flames. We helped people get out of the building and sent the injured to the hospital.”The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said in a statement: “The scenes emerging of a London-bound plane carrying many British nationals crashing in the Indian city of Ahmedabad are devastating.”0:37David Lammy addresses Air India plane crash in parliament – videoThe UK Foreign Office said officials were working with Indian authorities to establish the facts around the crash and provide support to those involved. Gatwick airport officials said a reception centre was being set up for relatives of the passengers.The flight tracking website Flightradar24 said the signal from the aircraft was lost less than a minute after takeoff. In a post on X, it said: “We are following reports of a crash of Air India flight AI171 from Ahmedabad to London.“We received the last signal from the aircraft at 08:08:51 UTC (shortly before 9.09am BST), just seconds after takeoff. The aircraft involved is a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with registration VT-ANB.”This is the first crash of a Boeing 787 aircraft, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaAir transportPlane crashesSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

It was an entirely normal day – although hotter than usual for the time of year in north India – and an entirely normal flight, except for the fact that the plane, an 11-year-oldBoeingDreamliner, landed 20 minutes early.After more than two hours on the tarmac parked at Terminal 2 of the sprawling Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel international airport, captain Sumeet Sabharwal, an experienced pilot, taxied on to the single runway and prepared for takeoff.Map of Gujarat state and surrounding area.Now flying as AI171, Sabharwal’s destination was London’sGatwick airport, and onboard for the 10-hour flight were 12 crew and 230 passengers – mostly Indian nationals, with 53 British citizens, some Portuguese and a Canadian too.According to the passenger list, travellers included parents with three children, several other families, and a British businessman and yoga practitioner. In seat 12 was a retired senior official of India’s ruling party. In 11A, next to the emergency door on the left side of the plane, was Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, a 40-year-old man from London who was in Gujarat visiting family with his brother, who was sitting in 11J.Among the crew were Clive Kunder, the first officer, and Nganthoi Sharma Kongbrailatpam, a 21-year-old flight attendant from Manipur in India’s far north-east who had been working for Air India for two years.Seat map of flight AI171.CCTVand mobile phone footage showed what happened immediately after takeoff at 1.38pm.First the Dreamliner climbed about 160 metres, reaching a speed of 322km/h, according to the minimal flight data available. Then, 10 seconds after leaving the ground, its upward motion stalled and the plane began to lose height.Nose up, tilting slightly, it sank steadily downward for five seconds before crashing in the crowded neighbourhoods surrounding the airport. Sabharwal had issued a distress call to air traffic control but made no further communication.The massive blast as the plane’s full fuel tanks exploded was heard across the city, and sent flames and a column of thick black smoke into the sky.Satellite view of airport and crash site.Keyur Prajapathi, a 27-year-old doctor at Ahmedabad civil hospital, about a kilometre from the airport, was on duty. “I looked outside the window and saw black smoke. Within seconds, our phones … started to ring. It took me another two to three minutes to understand what had happened,” said Prajapathi.The Dreamliner, weighing more than 200 tonnes and carrying more than 100,000 litres of fuel, had crashed into accommodation for doctors at the hospital, including a hostel where medical students live.Dust, debris and smoke filled the air when first responders arrived at the scene. The tail fin of the plane was wedged in the front of the hostel, ash and burned oil coated the ground, with wreckage spread among the buildings.“The first person I helped was a young woman who had sustained severe burn injuries. Before we could take her to the hospital, she succumbed in the ambulance,” Prajapathitold the Hindustan Times.With as many as 200 lunchtime diners in the hostel’s canteen, there were fears of mass casualties among the medical students. The exact toll was still unclear on Thursday evening as emergency workers were often unable to distinguish between victims on the ground or in the plane.A doctor named Krishna said: “The nose and front wheel landed on the canteen building where students were having lunch.” He said he saw “about 15 to 20 burnt bodies”, while he and his colleagues rescued about 15 students. At least 30 bodies were recovered from a building at the site of the crash, Reuters reported, citing rescue workers at the site. More people were trapped inside the building, the workers said.View image in fullscreenVishwash Kumar Ramesh’s ticket.Photograph: Hindustan TimesOne survivor was soon identified– the British man who had been in seat 11A and had somehow escaped the crash almost unharmed except for cuts and bruises. Ramesh was able to walk away from the crash in a ripped T-shirt with his phone in his hand and boarding card in a pocket. Guided to an ambulance, he was taken to hospital.“Thirty seconds after takeoff, there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed,” Ramesh told local reporters from his hospital bed. “It all happened so quickly … When I got up, there were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me.”On Thursday night, Air India confirmed that the other 241 on the plane had all been killed.The airline has organised two relief flights to Ahmedabad, one each from Delhi and Mumbai, for the next of kin of passengers and crew, as investigators begin to look for the cause of the crash, the first involving a Dreamliner.Boeing said it was “working to gather more information” on the incident, while the UK and US said they were dispatching air accident investigation teams to support their Indian counterparts.In Awang Leikai of Thoubal district in Manipur, the family of flight attendant Kongbrailatpam had gathered in grief. Imagesbroadcast by Indian televisionshowed relatives kneeling on a floor, holding an album of pictures of the young woman. Amid sobs, a woman is heard calling out: “My child, my child, I raised with these hands, where have you gone? I want to see you.

It is believed his brother was on the same flight.“Thirty seconds after takeoff there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed. It all happened so quickly,” Ramesh toldthe Hindustan Timesfrom a general ward in the civil hospital in Asarwa, Ahmedabad.The 40-year-old British national told the newspaper he was returning to the UK, where he has lived for 20 years, after visiting family in India. Another brother, speaking outside the family home inLeicester, in the East Midlands, said Ramesh had “no idea” how he escaped.Nayan Kumar Ramesh, 27, added: “We were just shocked as soon as we heard it. I last spoke to him yesterday morning. We’re devastated, just devastated. He said: ‘I have no idea how I exited the plane.’”A relative added: “He’s doing well I think. It’s a big shock. I don’t have many words to describe the incident.”Dr Dhaval Gameti, who treated Ramesh, said: “He was disorientated, with multiple injuries all over his body. But he seems to be out of danger.”Initial reports suggested all passengers onboard had died, but local police confirmed they had found one survivor of the flight, which plummeted into a medical college on Thursday, with videos showing a huge explosion and thick smoke in the immediate aftermath.The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, which was carrying 53 British nationals among its 242 passengers, was engulfed in a huge fireball after crashing into the Meghani Nagar residential area minutes after taking off at 1.38pm local time (09:08 BST) on Thursday.The Ahmedabad police commissioner, GS Malik, told the news agency ANI there was one survivor who was in seat 11A. The flight manifest shared by authorities said the passenger in that seat was Ramesh. Malik told ANI the survivor “has been in the hospital and is under treatment”.Seating planRamesh, who lives with his wife and child in London, was anxious to find his brother who was sitting on a different row. He told the Hindustan Times: “When I got up, there were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me. Someone grabbed hold of me and put me in an ambulance and brought me to the hospital.”A video of the crash circulating online showed the aircraft flying over a residential area of Ahmedabad. It disappeared behind trees before a huge explosion was followed by large plumes of black smoke.Images of the aftermath showed parts of the plane embedded into BJ Medical College, with pieces of its landing gear, fuselage and tail protruding from the building.Air India said 169 Indian nationals, 53 British nationals, one Canadian and seven Portuguese nationals were onboard the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Gatwick airport said a reception centre was being set up for relatives of passengers.MapA British couple who run a spiritual wellness centre and yoga studio were reportedly among those on the flight. Fiongal and Jamie Greenlaw-Meek, who run the Wellness Foundry in south London and Ramsgate, Kent, which offers psychic readings, tarot, reiki and yoga, spoke before the flight of their love of India and the “mind-blowing” experiences they had had there.On Tuesday, the Greenlaw-Meeks posted on their social media accounts from their hotel in the city. They spoke of creating a vlog documenting their experience, saying were excited to talk about it. Sitting next to his husband, Fiongal said: “So it’s our last night in India and we have had a magical experience really, there have been some quite mind-blowing things that have happened.”Akeel Nanabawa, his wife, Hannaa Vorajee, and their daughter, who lived in Gloucester, were also onboard, according to the Gloucester Muslim Community, which said in a statement: “Unfortunately, we are led to believe that three Gloucester locals, Akeel Nanabawa, his wife and four-year-old child, were all onboard. Those wishing to do taziyat, please allow the family some time to mourn amongst themselves.”In a post on social media, the Gloucester Muslim Bereavement Council said it was “profoundly heartbroken by the devastating loss of life in the catastrophic crash of Flight AI171, travelling from Ahmedabad to London”.Naming the three victims, it said: “During this moment of overwhelming sorrow, our hearts go out to all those left behind. No words can truly ease the pain of such a profound loss, but we pray that the family may find solace in the tremendous outpouring of compassion and solidarity from communities across the world.”UK officials are being deployed to India to support the investigation, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch said. Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, said the crash was “devastating”, while the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, said it was “heartbreaking beyond words”.King Charles and Queen Camilla said in a statement they were “desperately shocked”, adding: “Our special prayers and deepest possible sympathy are with the families and friends of all those affected by this appallingly tragic incident across so many nations, as they await news of their loved ones.”Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaAir transportPlane crashesLeicesterSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Five months later, Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, a Boeing 737 Max 8,crashed after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing 157 passengers and crew members.What do we know about the cause?There has been no official word on possible causes, though the aviation safety consultant John Cox told Associated Press one of the questions investigators would be asking was whether the plane was properly configured for flight.Cox emphasised it was too early to reach any conclusions but said the grainy images of the flight suggested one area of inquiry was likely to be whether the slats and flaps were in the correct position as the plane attempted to climb.In aviation, crashes are statistically most likely to happen during landing or takeoff. An aviation safety expert told the BBC the weather had been stable and clear at the time.Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaPlane crashesGatwick airportAir transportSouth and central AsiaexplainersShareReuse this content"

In England, about 17,000 people are living with the disease, an inherited blood disorder, with 250 new cases a year.Wes Streeting, the health and social care secretary, said: “People living with rare conditions like sickle cell disease face immense everyday challenges, and can sometimes struggle to get the specialised care they need.“To make our health service fit for the future, we have to harness the power of new technologies, and these machines provide a shining example of how our government is starting to make huge advancements in digital healthcare.“Through our plan for change, this government will be the one that removes the barriers to getting the latest and best tech to our NHS frontline, so patients can access the best care available, closer to home.”Prof Bola Owolabi, the director of healthcare inequalities at NHS England, said: “This is great news for people living with sickle cell disease – a condition that disproportionately affects Black African and Black Caribbean communities.“Sickle cell patients have needed new treatment options for decades and this additional funding will provide greater access to this life-changing technology which has the potential to significantly improve patients’ quality of life.”Owolabi added that sickle cell care in England continued to be among the best in the world, with England the first country tointroduce a groundbreaking gene-editing therapy, which offers a functional cure to the disease.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hours before thecentre was set on fireby a mob of masked youths on Wednesday, Lyons had posted on social media that the building was being used to accommodate several people who had fled from Ballymena, about 20 miles (32km) away.Staff and customers, including children learning to swim, were in the leisure centre at the time of Wednesday’s attack, which coincided with violence in Ballymena amid tensions over immigration.View image in fullscreenGordon Lyons said no other party could force him to quit.Photograph: Liam McBurney/PAHours before the attack, Lyons posted on social media that “a number of individuals were temporarily moved to Larne leisure centre in the early hours of the morning after the disturbances in Ballymena.“As a local MLA [member of the legislative assembly] for the area, neither I nor my DUP colleagues were made aware or consulted on this decision until late this afternoon,” he added. “Protesting is of course a legitimate right but I would encourage everyone to remain peaceful.”Speaking to reporters on Thursday, O’Neill, of Sinn Féin, said Lyons had failed to show the correct leadership. “I think that his commentary falls very short and very much strays into the territory of inflaming the situation,” she said. “So, I think he should consider his position.”The Sinn Féin finance minister, John O’Dowd, also called on Lyons to resign, while Matthew O’Toole, the SDLP and opposition leader, said he would refer Lyons to the standards commission. “The actions of the communities minister cannot be ignored,” he said. “He is the minister responsible for the housing executive and lives are at stake.”Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary, also called on Lyons to reflect on his comments.Lyons is defying the calls, saying that under Stormont’s system of government no other party can force him to quit: “That is not in their gift.”Lyons told the BBC his message “was posted because rumours had been circulating that the leisure centre was being turned into a permanent centre” and that was no longer the case. He said he was trying to defuse the situation.The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Jon Boutcher, said the recent disorder in Northern Ireland was “absolutely race-motivated”.Speaking at a news conference he said 41 police officers had been injured and 14 arrests had been made so far. Addressing targeted communities, Boutcher said: “We stand shoulder to shoulder with you. These bigots and racists will not win the day.”O’Neill and the deputy first minister, Emma Little-Pengelly, appeared together on Wednesday to condemn the violence.Echoing comments from the police, the first minister said: “It’s pure racism, there’s no other way to dress it up.” Little-Pengelly described the scenes in Ballymena as “utter thuggery”.Police came under attack for a fourth consecutive night on Thursday as unrest spread to multiple towns across the region.In Portadown, missiles were thrown at officers during a protest, continuing a pattern of disorder that began earlier in the week in Ballymena. While tensions remained high, Thursday’s incidents appeared to be of lower intensity compared with previous flare-ups.Police said a separate protest in east Belfast concluded early in the evening without major incident.The latest disturbances follow strong words from Northern Ireland’s police chief, who said “bigots and racists” were behind the violence.There were calls for urgent action after the names of streets and addresses in Ballymena were posted on a Facebook page with some designated “local”, the apparent suggestion being that they should not be targeted.The local Sinn Féin MLA, Philip McGuigan, has called on the police and Meta to take action. “This is a very dangerous situation in Ballymena, and what is happening is absolutely disgusting and disgraceful,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandRaceDemocratic Unionist party (DUP)Northern Irish politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

There’s that horrifying feeling that there will be connections that will lead back here. It’s just unimaginable.”Shah-Levy had joined dozens of others at the International Siddhashram Shakti Centre, close to the high street, to pray and light candles. “I have had this sense of panic and sadness all day that I haven’t been able to shift, and being able to come here and gather collectively in some way, it’s important,” she said.Some of those present had already heard the names of people they believed had been on the flight. Bhupendra Buch, a retired police community officer, said an uncle of his in India had messaged to tell him his two granddaughters were on board, though Buch was unsure if they had been injured or killed. He had also been told that another Indian couple who he had lived next door to many years before had also been killed.View image in fullscreenHarrow councillor Aneka Shah-Levy.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianFew operators fly direct between Ahmedabad andLondon, so this same Air India journey is a trip that many here have taken many times, said Navin Shah, a retired architect and former Labour chair of the London Assembly. Shah was born in a small town 20km (12 miles) from the crash site, and said he knew the area intimately. “As we speak I can vividly picture the whole area.”It had been an exhausting and overwhelming day, he said, apologising for the emotion in his voice. “Since the morning, I’ve been talking to my nephews, my cousins and friends who live in Ahmedabad, within spitting distance. The sense of shock I got from them, phone call after phone call, is that of horror and disbelief.”View image in fullscreenA prayer at the centre in Harrow.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianHe said he believed the majority of those present, as well as in other British Indian communities in places like Leicester and Brent, would have connections with someone who had died.Shah has been discussing with family members in India what they could do for the part of the city where the plane fell, which he said included a slum. “You have got to look, in the gloom, at what good you can do. That’s what I’m looking towards. That something good can and must come out of this event. If we can help regenerate that community, that will be something,” he said.View image in fullscreenShri Rajrajeshwar Guruji (centre), the leader of the spiritual hub.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianFor Shri Rajrajeshwar Guruji, the spiritual leader of the community, the crash was “very, very sad news, it is a very big disaster”. Guruji said he personally knew the names of “13 or 14” people he believed had been on the flight, including Vijay Rupani, the former chief minister of Gujarat, who had previously worshipped at the centre. Rupani has been confirmed as one of those on board.The disaster had had a “big impact” on the British Gujarati community, Guruji said. “I can only try to give them spiritual support, because beyond that, God is the only one who can give them strength.”The community is braced for hard days ahead, said Shah-Levy. “Obviously, it’s still very early days. No one really knows yet. As more names come through, no doubt there will be more prayer meetings. There will be many people among us who have lost someone.

Carer’s allowance will be protected throughout this period but will end when Pip is withdrawn.The sickest benefit recipients with less than 12 months to live and those with lifelong, often progressive and incurable conditions will automatically get a higher rate of universal credit and will not have to go through reassessments, which take place on average every three years.The new “right to work” scheme for those on health and disability benefits, previously announced by Kendall, will be introduced at the same time as the bill so welfare recipients can try to return to work without risking losing their entitlements.Kendall told the Guardian: “When we set out our reforms we promised to protect those most in need, particularly those who can never work. I know from my 15 years as a constituency MP how important this is. It is something I take seriously and will never compromise on.“That is why we are putting additional protections on the face of the bill to support the most vulnerable and help people affected by the changes. These protections will be written into law – a clear sign they are non-negotiable.”WhileReeves insistedshe would not be rethinking her decision on disability benefit cuts on Thursday, despite speculation that the government could soften its stance, she said she was “taking into account” representations from Labour MPs.Pressed by the BBC on whether she would change her mind, Reeves said: “No, we’re not going to be changing that. It is important that we reform the way the welfare state works so that there is a welfare state there for people.“We are the only developed country where the number of people in the labour market is lower than it was before Covid, the number of economically inactive people of working age is rising.”But she added: “We’ve already announced that we are reviewing the criteria for accessing Pip. Even with these changes, we will substantially be increasing the amount of money we are paying in sickness and disability benefits during the course of this parliament.”Under the changes already announced, claimants would not qualify for Pip unless they score a minimum of four points on a single daily living activity. Government sources have ruled out any further changes to the assessment criteria.Assessments score from 0 to 12 the difficulty that claimants face in a range of living activities such as preparing and eating food, communicating, washing and getting dressed.Just over 370,000 people who claim Pip will lose the payments, while another 430,000 who would have become eligible in the future will not now get it. On average these people will lose £4,500 a year.The government has argued the welfare system needs dramatic reform as 1,000 people a day are newly claiming benefits. Even with the cuts, it will still be spending more on Pip, with an extra 750,000 people receiving payments by the end of this parliament.As part of the measures, the Department for Work and Pensions will spend up to £1bn a year extra on helping people back into jobs.About 170 MPs, including some loyalists, are understood to be preparing to rebel by either voting against the government on changes to eligibility for Pip payments or abstaining.OneLabourMP suggested that making small changes to the plans would not be enough to win over sceptics. “Small tweaks here and there won’t be enough. As long as the welfare reforms punish the most vulnerable, they’ll face opposition,” they said.A government source suggested the numbers were starting to fall after Kemi Badenoch said the Tories would oppose the plans. “The idea of voting against the government becomes more difficult for people if it means walking through the lobbies with the Tories,” they said.Labour whips have suggested that the expansion of free school meals last week and indications from senior ministers that they were open to lifting thetwo-child benefit capwas also helping to reassure concerned MPs.Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsLabourLiz KendallnewsShareReuse this content"

The Department of Health and Social Care will receive 2.8% more on average over the course of the parliament, taking its budget from £189bn in 2023-24 to £246bn by 2028-29.But focusing only on this week’s announcement, which covers the three years from 2026-27, the settlement looks much tighter, with departmental budgets rising only 1.5% on average.Britain on track to become a ‘National Health State’, says thinktankRead moreTaking out certain big-ticket items of government spending, the situation looks tougher still. According to the Resolution Foundation, everything outside of health, defence, education and overseas aid will fall by 1.3% on average – a total of £2.4bn in cuts.Some departments are being particularly badly hit, including the Home Office, which is facing 1.4% annual cuts over the next three years; and the environment department, the budget of which will drop 2.3% each year on average.Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, said: “Spending cuts will be seen as austerity; those are the facts.Labourneeds to pick up the pace on change, otherwise it will be stuck in the political slow lane while other voices get louder.”The chancellor says that the significant rise in capital spending will help offset the impact of reduced day-to-day spending for some departments. Better technology and equipment will help make processes more efficient, for example in the NHS where new scanners and testing machines should help ease the burden on doctors and nurses.Economists also point out that the growth in day-to-day spending is still set to outstrip even the OBR’s relatively bullish growth forecasts.Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said: “This is not a period of austerity. This is a long period during which spending will be growing faster than the economy which, given current OBR estimates – which are more optimistic than most – is set to grow by 1.5% a year.”Reeves faces two main problems, however, when persuading the public they are not experiencing austerity. One is that her plan mostly unpicks Conservative spending plans that were never realistic in the first place; without those there would have been significantly deeper cuts pencilled in.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not really. Was it austerity? Not really. It looks like a pretty conventional and sensible way of allocating the spending envelope.”The second is that unlike during the previous Labour government, Reeves is increasing overall departmental budgets after years of cuts. Local government, for example, will receive average real-terms rises of 1.1% a year over the next three years. But at the end of that period its central government funding will be 50% lower than it was in 2010.For those on the left, those previous cuts are even more reason to open the spending taps now, even if it means raising taxes at the autumn budget to do so.Theo Harris, an economist at the NewEconomicsFoundation, said: “To deliver the change people voted for, the government should free itself from its self-imposed fiscal rules, recognise the value of social spending and be willing to tax wealth fairly. This may not be austerity, but it doesn’t look like the start of a decade of renewal.”Those close to Reeves, however, point out that she has already announced one of the biggest tax-hiking budgets in recent history to fund an immediate splurge in government spending – something Labour supporters have long called for.“In place of decline, I choose investment,” Reeves said on Wednesday. “These are Labour choices.”Explore more on these topicsSpending review 2025Rachel ReevesLabourAusterityEconomicsEconomic policyPublic financeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Outside the room, he is pinned to the floor and placed in handcuffs.‘Snatching off the streets’: Ice targets churches, car washes and workplacesRead moreEmerging afterward, Padilla, the ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on immigration, citizenship and border safety, said he and his colleagues had repeatedly asked DHS for more information on its “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions” but had not received a response to his inquiries.“If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the DHS responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they’re doing to farm workers, to cooks, to day laborers, throughout the LA community and throughout California and throughout the country,” Padilla, the son of immigrants from Mexico, told reporters. “We will hold this administration accountable.”The extraordinary scene stunned his Democraticcolleagues from Capitol Hill to California, though his actions drew criticism from Republicans, including the House speaker,Mike Johnson, who called for Padilla’s censure. It comes amid escalating tensions between California and the federal government, after Donald Trump deployed national guard troops and US Marines to LA to quell protests prompted byimmigration raids, over the objections of the state’s governor and the city’s mayor.“I am shocked by how far we have descended in the first 140 days of this administration,” Adam Schiff, the junior senator from California said in a speech from the Senate floor shortly after viewing the video of the incident. “What is becoming of our democracy? Are there no limits to what this administration will do? Is there no line they will not cross?”View image in fullscreenThe homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, was in Los Angeles on Thursday to accompany immigration agents.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesIn a statement, the DHS said the senator “chose disrespectful political theatre” and disrupted a live news conference. They falsely claimed that Padilla had failed to identify himself and believed he was an attacker when he “lunged toward” Noem as she delivered remarks.“Mr Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers’ repeated commands,” the department said in a statement posted on X, adding that officers responded and “acted appropriately”.The deputy FBI director Dan Bongino accused Padilla of “not wearing a security pin” and said he “physically resisted law enforcement when confronted”.“Our FBI personnel acted completely appropriately while assisting Secret Service and we are grateful for their professionalism and service,” Bongino added.Noem was in Los Angeles to accompany federal agents onimmigration operationsin the area.Noemsaid Padilla’s approach“wasn’t appropriate” and that she wished he had reached out to her office before interrupting the event. Following the incident, she and the senator met for 15 minutes, according to DHS. Noem told reporters that they had a “great” and “productive” conversation and exchanged phone numbers.Democratic officials said they were stunned by what the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, described as the “manhandling” ofa sitting US senator.The California governor, Gavin Newsom,calledPadilla “one of the most decent people I know”, before adding: “This is outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control. This must end now.”In 2021, Padilla became California’s first Latino senator when he filled Kamala Harris’ seat after she was elected Joe Biden’s vice-president. Harrisweighed inon his removal from the press conference, calling the incident “a shameful and stunning abuse of power”.“Padilla was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this Administration’s actions in Southern California,” she wrote on X.Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader,wroteon X that “watching this video sickened my stomach, the manhandling of a United States Senator, Senator Padilla. We need immediate answers to what the hell went on.”Jimmy Gomez, a California representative,wrote on X: “This isn’t just shocking, it’s a threat to the rule of law and democratic accountability. Sen Padilla is conducting oversight over the lawlessness of the Trump and the violations of the #RuleOfLaw. If this can happen to immigrant communities, it can happen to anyone.”View image in fullscreenAlex Padilla speaks to reporters after he was forcibly removed.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesNorma Torres, a California representative, lambasted the treatment of Padilla in an impassioned video,writing: “Senator Alex Padilla was dragged and handcuffed out for daring to question Secretary Noem. This wasn’t a threat – it was dissent. They’re not keeping us safe – they’re silencing us.”The clash with Padilla comes just days after the Democratic representative LaMonica McIver of New Jersey was indicted on federal charges alleging she assaulted and interfered with immigration officers after a clash with law enforcement at a May protest outside a detention facility in Newark. Democrats have cast the charges as a politically motivated attempt by the Trump administration to intimidate the opposition.As he exited the floor of the House of Representatives, Johnson said the senator had been at fault, accusing him of “charging a cabinet secretary at a press conference” and calling his actions “wildly inappropriate”.“A sitting member of Congress should not act like that,” he said. “It is beneath a member of the Congress, it is beneath a US senator.”Johnson said he believes Padilla’s behavior “merits immediate attention” by Congress and “at a minimum, it rises to the level of a censure” by the Senate.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsLos AngelesKristi NoemUS politicsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

And after maxing out those cards, she went on to use Affirm, which offers buy-now, pay-later (BNPL) services that allow customers to pay out their purchases in installments.By 2023, Hartman had $30,000 of debt on Affirm and $88,000 of credit card debt. Her household income is $150,000 a year.“How I was able to, at one time, have almost $30,000 on Affirm is insane to me,” Hartman said. “Like how did I even get approved for $30,000? It just blows my mind.”Credit card debt has ballooned to more than $1tn in the US over the last several years, and consumer advocates are worried that the debt burden is even worse with the growth of BNPL.“Companies like BNPL because it leads people to spend more and make things look more affordable than they are, by focusing people’s attention on one-quarter of the price rather than the full price,” said Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center. “It can lead people to take on more debt than they can really afford.”Line chart showing that in 2021, families earning less than $50,000 were more likely to use buy, now pay later. The percentage rose each year through 2023In recent months, BNPL companies such as Klarna and Affirm have been expanding their reach across different retailers, partnering with companies such as DoorDash, Walmart and eBay so that nearly every purchase can be made using BNPL.At the same time, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the US federal agency that was built after the Great Recession to be a consumer watchdog, has largely been gutted by the Trump administration. Last month, the CFPB said it wouldn’t enforce regulation against BNPL companies that put them under similar regulations that credit card companies must follow.New York watchdog warns Trump cuts will usher in ‘open season’ for scammersRead moreBNPL companiessaythat their services offer a healthier alternative to credit cards because they are fixed terms and can be interest-free. And the BNPL companies are more accessible for those who don’t have high credit scores as BNPL doesn’t require the same hard credit score checks as credit cards. But easier access to credit often comes at a higher price.“Each purchase is essentially a different line of credit, and so each has a different repurchase schedule. You buy something and every two weeks, you get a deduction from your bank account, and that can be difficult for people to manage,” said Ed deHaan, a professor at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. “You can do what’s called ‘debt stacking’: max out one BNPL, and go to another.”Researchthat DeHaan and colleagues published in 2023 found that while many BNPL users were able to make their payments without problems, other users were prone to overspending with BNPL and started to see early indicators of financial distress, such as not paying down other credit balances, within weeks of using the services.“What you need to think about is the rest of the consumer’s portfolio. If they’re making BNPL payments … maybe they’re not paying off their credit card, maybe they’re not paying their cellphone bill, and that’s actually more concerning,” DeHaan said. “They’re essentially substituting one payment for another.”The CFPB in January published areportshowing that the majority of BNPL borrowers had multiple loans at once and were more likely to have higher balances on other forms of credit, such as credit cards.Kelly Klingaman, a financial adviser in Austin, Texas, said that she often works with clients who have built up BNPL debt with purchases that they bought largely on a whim.“It’s offered to you anytime you check out now,” Klingaman said. “You may not be fully aware of the total interest you’re paying and how it may be really jacking down your overall finances.”Now that BNPL can be used to make smaller purchases, like everyday groceries or necessities, data has shown more Americans may be turning to it for necessities.In a recent survey from LendingTree, nearly a quarter of BNPL users in the US said they have used the service to pay for groceries. Four out of 10 users also said they’ve had a late payment on the platform.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionDatacompiled by the Federal Reserve shows that about 68% of BNPL users with family incomes under $50,000 said that using the services were the only way they could afford their purchase. Only 32% of those with family incomes over $100,000 said the same.And the service is used more by Americans with lower credit scores. Only 10% of those with credit scores above 720, which is considered to be a very good credit score, use BNPL, compared with 30% of those with credit scores below 620.BNPL “is promoted as purely free, interest-free, affordable payments that are ended fairly quickly. It could be useful for occasional larger purchases, but it’s really quite ill-suited for everyday use. It makes no sense to put off three-quarters of the price of this week’s groceries when you have more groceries to buy in the coming weeks,” Saunders said. “It prompts people into spending more than they can really afford.”In the first three months of 2025, Klarna said that its customer credit losses, which are due to late or missed payments, shot up 17% compared with the same period last year. The company absorbed $137m worth of these losses.Overall, the company said it doubled its losses from the first quarter from $99m this year compared with $47m last year – reports about which led many on social media to believe that Klarna was going bankrupt.But the company said that its losses stemmed from one-time costs, including fromreducingits workforce by 40% after making heavy investments into AI. And the company actually saw its revenue increase 13%, to $700m, in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, and its user base climbed 20%, to 100m.In astatementto NBC News, Klarna said that the increase in consumer credit losses “does not tell you much about the US consumer” and said that credit losses made up 0.54% of all “gross merchandise value” for loans – a slight increase from 0.51% last year, “but still very low”, the company said.Under the Biden administration, the CFPB had started toregulateBNPL servicers such as credit card companies, requiring that BNPL companies provide users with legal protections that are offered to credit card holders, such as the right to dispute charges.Last month, the CFPBsaidit will no longer enforce these regulations against BNPL services, saying that it will “keep its enforcement and supervision resources focused on pressing threats to consumers”.Hartman said that while she was initially grateful that she was allowed access to more than $100,000 in credit, which she ultimately paid down completely, the process of learning how expensive it was to use such easy credit was painful.“It’s just so eye-opening how much interest you’re getting charged on, for things you didn’t really need,” she said. “It helped us when we needed it, but we ended up paying probably twice as much than we needed to.”Hartman said that self-education, including learning the dangers of easy credit, enabled her to pay down her consumer debt in less than two years.“Had I been taught these things in school, I would have had a different outlook,” she said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsConsumer affairsConsumer spendingConsumer rightsShareReuse this content"

Boeing rejected the claims by the former engineer and said it was fully confident in the plane.0:23Smoke rises above Ahmedabad in first images from Air India plane crash – videoThere are more than 1,100 787s in service, with most major international airlines using them. The model has been prized for its far better fuel efficiency and lower noise than the types it replaced.The two major crashes that were due to faults on Boeing planes were using the then new 737 Max model, in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019. That model was taken out of service for almost a year, before being relaunched and returned to widespread use.Last month, Boeing agreed to pay $1.1bn (£812m) in a deal with the US Department of Justice to avoid prosecution over the two crashes that together killed 346 people – a deal that lawyers for some of thevictims’ families called “morally repugnant”.India’s aviation safety history has been chequered, but as the airline industry has boomed and passenger flying has become more and more common, its safety record has improved.The last Air India crash, in August 2020, involved a smaller Boeing 737-800 Air India Express that was landing at Calicut airport in bad weather when it skidded off the runway.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tata Group bought the airline from the Indian government in 2022, and announced plans last year to revamp and upgrade its fleet, including refurbishing its 787s. Problems holding up Boeing deliveries have meant that Air India, like other airlines, has continued to operate older planes for longer than planned.The Indian-led crash investigation will include experts from the UK Air Accident Investigation Branch, because of the number of British victims, the US National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing.Map showing the impact of the plane crash siteA Boeing spokesperson said: “We are in contact with Air India regarding flight 171 and stand ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.”Investigators will hope to swiftly locate and analyse the black box data recorders, including the cockpit voice recorder. Despite its human toll, the Ahmedabad crash was relatively low-impact.CCTV footageshows the plane starting to descend just seconds after leaving the runway.According to flight-tracking information on Flight Radar, the plane had reached a maximum height of just 190 metres (625ft).Plane crashes are statistically most likely to happen during landing or takeoff, but experts said there appeared to be no obvious explanation for the crash. Weather conditions were benign. Images show the plane’s nose in the air, indicating the pilots were trying to keep it aloft, although the landing gear was apparently lowered.David Gleave, a former accident investigator, told the BBC: “It’s a very unusual accident … it’s a very unusual situation, so soon after takeoff, and it is a very safe aeroplane.”John McDermid, a professor at the University of York, said: “Pilots can abort takeoff until quite late. So it seems like the problem occurred very suddenly … and was sufficiently serious to be unmanageable.”Passenger aircraft are designed to be able to fly on one engine. Jason Knight, a senior lecturer in fluid mechanics at the University of Portsmouth, said: “The most likely cause of a double engine failure is a bird strike.”Explore more on these topicsBoeingAir India Ahmedabad plane crashAirline industryPlane crashesIndianewsShareReuse this content"

Policymakers meet next week, but are not expected to reduce the cost of borrowing from its 4.25% level until August at the earliest.Vasileios Gkionakis, a senior economist at Aviva Investors, said the consistent depreciation of the dollar since Trump’s inauguration was probably owing to a lack of faith that theUS economyunder Trump would grow at the exceptional pace it had in recent years.He said higher US government debts, which Trump has indicated will escalate once his tax bill passes both houses of Congress, was another deterrent to buying dollars.“All this is agitating markets, who in order to lend to the US would require a combination of higher [interest rates] and a weaker exchange rate,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDollarCurrenciesTrump administrationUS economyUS politicsEconomicsUS interest ratesnewsShareReuse this content"

Curae is a company that charges hospitals a fee to find money from all sorts of sources – including patients.“I believe the next huge bailout is going to be health systems.”Middlemen are nothing new to American healthcare – the Commonwealth Fund found that the administrative complexity of US healthcare accounts for nearlyone-thirdof thesky-highprice of care in the US.What is new is the potential market disruption created byRepublicans. A bill passed by House Republicans before Memorial Day would cut Medicaid by $804bn and Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, by $301bn – changes in Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” that are expected to result in 16 million newly uninsured Americans by 2034. That disruption represents risk for hospitals and patients, but an opportunity for business.“This really underscores the through line between Medicaid cuts today equal medical debt tomorrow,” said April Kuehnhoff, a senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC). “This is really going to harm the most vulnerable patients in the United States.”Hospitals face a real risk of not staying afloat: margins at the nation’s roughly 3,000 non-profit hospitals, about half of all nationally, reached an eight-year low in September 2023, according to a recent report from the consulting firmDeloitte. Operating margins were just 0.8% on average that year.“Providers carry more consumer paper than all of your regional banks combined,” said Stenglein, referring to consumer debt. “In some cases, they got $1.3bn they write off every year.”Stenglein views himself as a good guy in this fight, working in a “dysfunctional” system to help people like his own parents. His mother worked at the grocery store chain Winn Dixie and his father was a truck driver. Started eight years ago, Curae is now asubsidiaryof Atlanticus Holdings Corporation, which owns aportfolioof credit cards for subprime borrowers. The publicly traded corporation is valued at$794m.Firms like Curae offer an appealing pitch to hospitals, finding money from every conceivable source, such as insurers, discount drug programs, philanthropy and patients.But none of these services are free. Like the back end of a credit card, Curae charges hospitals a “processing fee” for every transaction, Stenglein said in an interview. In written questions, Curae later declined to confirm its processing fee rate, stating: “Our program management fees are confidential.”Curae also facilitates financing to patients, specializing in payment plans and interest-bearing loans to patients who are “higher risk/subprime patients, who usually would never get approved for any sort of credit”, a spokesperson told the Guardian. Curae is not a lender, but brands loans through the Bank of Missouri. The spokesperson said Curae-branded loans are available to patients who would struggle to “even be approved for other loans such as for cars”.However, Curae does not refer patients, including the marginalized consumers the company specializes in, to non-profit hospitals’ charity care programs. “No, the hospital administers that program,” the company said in written questions. But it helps “enroll eligible patients in third-party charity programs to help cover patient’s expenses”, which are not part of the hospital’s programsCurae-branded loans are 0% interest for patients up to 24 months. Longer-term loans cost between 9.9% and 36% based on creditworthiness for longer terms, according to a June 2021cardholder agreement. Stenglein said only 3-4% of the “patient population” sign up for interest-bearing loans, which together with payment plans represent about one-fifth of the business.A more recent cardholder agreement provided by Curae showed a long-term APR of 14.99%, although the cardholder agreement represented an approved rate for one individual borrower, and not the full range of possible rates. Curae later shared a cardholder agreement fromOctober 2024that showed a maximum interest rate of 26.99%.Some patients have lodged complaints about this system publicly, including an Arizona teacher who said she was “infuriated” when she was signed up for a credit card without her knowledge.“I got a hit on my credit saying somebody did a hard look at my credit, and of course I was freaking out, like what is going on?” Kerry Morgan told local TV stationAZFamily. “Come to find out, it was Banner [Health]” a non-profit hospital system that partners with Curae, “hit my credit and signed me up for a credit card to put the payments on”.Despite fees hospitals must pay on top of already low margins, and the potential for patient complaints, some providers still find the deal enticing.“Hospitals simply do not have the sophisticated skill to squeeze money out of patients,” said Ge Bai, a professor at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School and a healthcare accounting expert.“We’re going to see more and more businesses like that that help hospitals enhance revenue. You’re already seeing a flourishing, thriving industry,” of financial middle men.A testimonial sent to the Guardian by Curae provides a window into this appeal: a Banner Health employee said Curae helped the hospital “improve collections” at the “point of service” (their healthcare facilities) “by $22m compared to 2023”. More than 90,000 patients applied for financing with Banner in 2024.“I’ve worked in the field of Patient Access [sic] for 22 years,” wrote Jarrod Brown, senior director of patient access at Banner Health. “Curae has been a major win for our patients, by providing a financing option focused on their healthcare needs.”Kuehnhoff said Curae’s specialism in the “subprime patient”, calls into question whether hospitals are pushing patients who might be eligible for free or discounted care – known as “charity care” – into payment plans.“Does this person who needs medical financing actually qualify for charity care through the hospital? And are they being shunted to a medical financial product rather than appropriately given the assistance they qualify for?” Kuehnhoff asked rhetorically.Traditionally, hospitals have provided patients with interest-free payment plans and the majority still do. A recent research letter published inJama Health Forumfound only 8.5% of hospitals promote what the study described as “interest-bearing” payment products.“Hospitals have really tried to step up to offer long-term payment plans for at least some of the patients within some income brackets – to try to work with people,” said Erin Duffy, a scholar at the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Institute and a co-author of the study.But insurers have increasinglypushed costson to consumers, which has forced hospitals to collect directly from patients.By2022, medical debt was the most common form of debt in collections, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and most patients in debt to hospitals were insured, according to awidely cited report. The same year, aboutone-quarterof American adults said they had a past due medical or dental bill, according to a survey by Kaiser Family Foundation.Before Trump entered office, the Biden administration attempted to prevent debt collectors from reporting medical debt to credit agencies as a form of relief – efforts debt collectors fought and thatabruptly endedwith theguttingof the CFPB.“I don’t think we want to make a case that these are evil companies because at the end of the day they did increase access for some patients on the net,” said Bai. Instead, Bai views the system like Stenglein – “dysfunctional”.“We have toxic soil – that’s why we’re seeing all kinds of outlandish plants grown.”This article was amended on 12 June 2025 to correct the processing fee charged by Curae, which was previously mentioned as 6% for every transaction and to clarify that while Curae doesn’t enroll patients in hospitals’ charity care programs, it helps enroll them in third-party programs to cover costs.Explore more on these topicsUS healthcareRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

The vote was 214-212.Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States’ standing in the world and will lead to needless deaths.“Cruelty is the point,” the Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, said of the proposed spending cuts.The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.If Trump cuts funding to NPR and PBS, rural America will pay a devastating priceRead more“This rescissions package sends $9.4bn back to the US treasury,” said Representative Lisa McClain, House Republican conference chair. “That’s $9.4bn of savings that taxpayers won’t see wasted. It’s their money.”The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.The Senate majority leader, John Thune, said the chamber would probably not take the bill up until July, after it has dealt with Trump’s big tax and immigration bill. He also said it was possible the Senate could tweak the bill.The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump’s sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump’s “America first” ideology as well as those who view NPR andPBSas having a liberal bias.In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900m from $10bn that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500m for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400m to address the global HIV epidemic.The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800m, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1bn from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it is slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsHouse of RepresentativesUS SenateUS CongressNPRPBSMaternal healthnewsShareReuse this content"

Tesla just about remained the biggest seller of EVs globally in 2024.Tesla has since been hit by a backlash over Musk’s role in Donald Trump’s administration. Registrations for new Teslas in Europehalved in Aprilcompared with the same month a year earlier. Musk remains the world’s richest man, worth more than $400bn (£295bn), according to Forbes.Electric cars are alreadymuch cheaper to own than their petrol equivalentsfor most people, but the arrival of smaller models with a comparable sticker price to fossil fuel cars is seen as important in persuading lower-income buyers.Analysts suggest that BYD has a lot of room to cut the price of the Dolphin Surf further. The company sells a near-identical model under the Seagull name inChinafor about £6,000, although Chinese safety regulations are significantly less onerous.The company’s European growth has come despite the EU imposing17.4% tariffs on BYDon the grounds of allegedly unfair state aid from China.In contrast, the UK has not added tariffs on Chinese electric cars, and has therefore been the biggest target market for Chinese brands. BYD sells through a network of dealerships across Britain.The UK accounted for 30% of all Chinese electric models sold in Europe in March, according to Matthias Schmidt, an electric vehicle analyst, with brands like Xpeng, Leapmotor and Jaecoo, owned by state-controlled Chery also trying to win market share.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The cheapest electric car on sale in the UK is the Dacia Spring, which costs £14,995, although its official range is only 140 miles. The Citroën ë-C3 starts at £18,305, while Renault’s well-received 5 model starts at £22,995.The Dolphin Surf has an official range of up to 137 miles, but also has some features that are generally found on more expensive models, such as a rotating touchscreen and driver assistance functions like intelligent cruise control and automatic emergency braking.BYD has taken a deliberate decision to offer much of the same technology on lower-end models as are found in its premium vehicles, in an effort to drive down the cost of sensors and software whilemaintaining its lead over rivals.The Surf uses BYD’s Blade battery, which relies on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for its cathode. LFP batteries are made from cheaper materials than lithium batteries that use more expensive nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC) – although the latter offer better performance such as longer range.While carmakers in Europe have until now mostly focused on NMC batteries to help assuagerange anxietyamong early adopters, LFP batteries have proved to be hugely popular among Chinese buyers looking for a cheaper upfront cost. More than 80% of electric cars sold in China in 2024 used LFP batteries, according to data cited by Kallanish Commodities, an industry news provider.BYD’s main Chinese battery rival,Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited(Catl), has also invested heavily in LFP technology in the race to dominate the global electric vehicle industry. Both companies are also competing to offer full recharging in minutes.Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsChinaTeslaAsia PacificMotoringTravel and transportnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not Le Birkin we all know and love, which was a kind of collaboration between her and Hermès,” she said. “The prototype is a one-off. There is no other bag like it in the world.”View image in fullscreenAn undated image of Jane Birkin with the bag at her mother’s house in London.Photograph: Mike Daines/ShutterstockThe creation of Le Birkin is a fashion legend that came about after Birkin’s chance encounter with the head of the French luxury goods company, Jean-Louis Dumas, on a commercial flight fromParisto London in 1984.In a 2018 interview with CBS, Birkin, who died in July 2023, said: “I found myself nextdoor to a very polite gentleman and I had my agenda as usual banged full of bits of paper and everything and the whole thing fell to the ground.“So I picked it up and he said: ‘You should have pockets in that agenda.’ And I said: ‘What can you do? Hermès don’t make it with pockets,’ and he said: ‘I am Hermès.’“I said: ‘Why don’t you make a handbag that’s a bit bigger than the Kelly and not as big as my suitcase, which weighs a tonne … there was the sort of vomit bag and I did a wee sketch and he took it with him, and a month later I got a call from Hermès saying would I come and have a look at this bag.”View image in fullscreenJane Birkin at protest in Paris in 1985.Photograph: Jacques Demarthon/AFP/Getty ImagesBirkin auctioned the prototype handbag in 1994 for the benefit of a French Aids charity. It was auctioned again in 2000 and bought by the current owner, a collector of luxury goods, who has declined to say how much she paid for it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hermès gave her four more, but in a 2012 interview she described it as the“bloody Birkin bag”, complaining they were heavy and “snobbish”. Three years later,she asked Hermèsto rename a crocodile-skin version because of concerns about the treatment of the animals used to produce it.The original bag has been exhibited at MoMa in New York and the V&A Museum in London. The prototype is a different size to later models, has a shoulder strap and brass hardware, later replaced with gold-plate rings, clasps and “feet”.People love Le Birkin “because of its origin and its history,” said Vassy. “It’s like a celebrated work of art, it has an energy and soul of its own. This bag was the very beginning of Le Birkin and we know Jane was proud to have it.”The bag will be sold on 10 July at the beginning of haute couture week in Paris.Explore more on these topicsHermèsJane BirkinFranceParisEuropeHandbagsnewsShareReuse this content"

McIlroy has been in uncharted, strange psychological territory since completion of the career grand slam at Augusta National in April.Oakmont and theUS Openthen jabbed back in the manner only Oakmont and the US Open know. By the time McIlroy walked from the ninth green, his last, he had taken 74 shots including a second half of 41. He took a double-bogey five at the 8th. McIlroy’s demeanour showed he still cares.US Open golf 2025: Spaun leads at Oakmont as McIlroy and Scheffler struggle in first round – as it happenedRead moreThis score was not in itself disastrous. McIlroy missed the cut here in 2016, meaning pre-event expectations may not have been particularly high. Shane Lowry, playing in McIlroy’s company this time, slumped to a 79. Justin Rose could manage no better than 77. Scottie Scheffler 73, Dustin Johnson 75. Johnson, Oakmont’s champion in 2016, clean shanked an iron from the middle of the fairway at one point. It is just difficult to square the sensation that wasMcIlroy donning the Green Jacketwith what has transpired since.His situation is multi-faceted. The mindset adjustment required after winning not only the Masters but the major set and a first of the big four in more than a decade is complicated. It is easy to understand why McIlroy might not be suitably motivated having reached his holy grail. He has enjoyed being only the sixth career slam winner in history, which is to be commended.There are also technical issues. McIlroy was 50th overall for driving accuracy at Augusta and 46th in the field during round four. At the Players Championship,which he also won, he hit 27 of 56 fairways. Glory in 2025 thus far has therefore been on account of spirit and occasionally magical recovery play rather than battering courses into submission with tee shots. The truth is he still looks unconvinced and uncomfortable with his driver in hand. Oakmont, where rough is brutal, exposes that. McIlroy’s putter was unable to save him.Tommy Fleetwood, Hideki Matsuyama and Matt Fitzpatrick matched McIlroy’s score in the morning wave. So too did Phil Mickelson in what may be his final US Open. Cameron Smith managed no birdies at all en route to his 75. The defending champion, Bryson DeChambeau, was under par through seven but later signed for a 73.As big names faltered, JJ Spaun stood tall. His round of 66, which was bogey free, was terrific. Golfers swung and missed at Spaun throughout the day. He ended it with a one-stroke lead over Thriston Lawrence.Spaun won a lot of hearts and minds with his attitude after losing to McIlroy at the Players. Mixing it with the best now seems to come more easily to the 34-year-old. Spaun has matched the lowest US Open first-round score at Oakmont.View image in fullscreenJJ Spaun tees off from the ninth hole.Photograph: Jared Wickerham/EPA“Everyone knows that the more you put yourself there you are going to have better results and the better you’re going to play,” Spaun said. “Eventually you will turn one of those close calls into a win.“The Players gave a spring in my self-belief because it wasn’t like I faked it. You can maybe fake it at the Sony Open or Cognizant Classic or whatever, but to do that at the Players, a course where I’d never done well historically, and to go head to head with Rory on Sunday, and then the playoff was great for my confidence. Unfortunately I didn’t win, but it was great for me to lean back on that experience and know I can perform on the biggest of stages and handle it with the pressure. There’s going to be a lot of pressure this week too.“I used to be kind of scared to want the ball, or I guess you could say have the lead or be the one that everyone is chasing. I always was [more] comfortable kind of being a chaser than the one being chased. I was like: ‘You need to embrace this, stop being scared.’ You don’t want to look back thinking, what if I didn’t embrace this, who knows what I would have done, versus yes, I want to be that guy.”Like Spaun, Robert MacIntyre revelled in the challenge. The Scot dropped a shot on the last but could still be perfectly content with a level-par 70. MacIntyre branded Spaun’s four under “unbelievable”, adding: “It’s just so hard. It’s just every shot, you’re on a knife-edge. Off the tee, this is the most demanding course I have ever played.“My game’s in great shape. The results haven’t been great, but that’s partly to do with how I’m reacting to disappointment at times.”Im Sung-jae reached minus five but shipped three shots over the closing stretch. Brooks Koepka’s 68 and the 69 posted by Jon Rahm as shadows lengthened felt notable. Koepka revealed he was subject to a 45-minute “scolding” from his coach, Pete Cowen, on Monday. Oh to have been a fly on that wall.Explore more on these topicsUS OpenGolfRory McIlroyEuropean TourPGA TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

As ice-breakers go, frowning over the passports and visa stickers of the long-haul crowd on matchday minus four of the FifaClub World Cup, the border guard was at least in tune with the zeitgeist. What is football doing here?What are Lionel Messi, Trent Alexander-Arnold and the massed engines of the football-industrial complex doing hovering like an alien landing party over this fun, sinking sandbank of a city, a strip of land where the ocean seems to be punching a mulchy green hole in the asphalt every few miles, a place that from the air seems to be made entirely from deep-fried crumb, tropical weed and traffic?Is football ready for the Club World Cup? Football Weekly Extra - podcastRead moreAnd yes, theFifaClub World Cup is only partly here at this point, glimpsed on highway billboards that also promote accident-chasing lawyers called things such as Chuck Flip-Burger III, still to emerge from the endless noise of the US’s rolling leisure economy. But it is still an excellent question that deserves a proper answer.Even the strangely literal-minded obsession with the trophy itself seems to admit to the vacant space at the heart of this thing. Never mind the basic sense of apathy. Here is a magnificent sinister golden plate that, at the turn of a key, can be transformed into a magnificent sinister golden sphere. Here is a trophy that seems to lurk, to tick and hum and buzz, that looks as if it almost certainly houses sinister things in its secret drawers – stolen moon rock, the head of a pigeon.The question of what football is doing here is even present in the Club World Cup marketing. Dazn, Fifa’s broadcast partner, is billing its breakthrough global event with the taglineUncontested. It’s a good word, meaning ultimate, the best; but also with a sense of something unmoored, floating out beyond any real sense of accountability.Often the best way to explain something is to pick at a thread. As the clock ticks down to Saturday night’s opener in Miami, as much of the pre-converted football world scratches its head at an event Gianni Infantino described this week as football’s “big bang”, perhaps the most helpful thread is Dazn itself.Need an explainer for the Infantino-shaped universe? Follow the football and you’ll find the usual noses at the trough. Follow the money and who knows where you might end up. And Dazn is the money here.It is no secret that the Club World Cup would not be happening in the way it is now happening without Dazn. In December 2024 Dazn offered Fifa ajaw-dropping $1bn (£787m) for the broadcast rights, all the more startling in a market that was, to that point, also Uncontested.A month later Saudi Arabia concluded its own deal to buy a 10% stake in Dazn in return for – guess what – another $1bn. Two months after thatFifa announcedits vast tournament prize fund, also, by coincidence, $1bn, thereby ensuring full compliance from its invited guests.In the middle of this, around the time the soon-to-be-Saudi-part-owned Dazn was concluding its Fifa TV rights deal, Fifaawarded the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabiavia a show of Uncontested applause from its members, thereby completing what is no doubt an entirely illusory circle of hand-washing.So far, so old school. We have a sense of this world now. It seems essentially untouchable, just the way power works. Strongman shall speak unto strongman. But there is another, more structurally vital way that Dazn tells the story of what is happening here, a process that may have a profound effect on the way football, sport, that thing you love, is made available from here.View image in fullscreenThe Club World Cup Trophy is displayed at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.Photograph: Eva Marie Uzcategui/Fifa/Getty ImagesThis is a case of dramatic foreshadowing. Watch any of the huge number of Star Wars spin-off prequels in circulation and it soon becomes clear the key plot device is the slow reveal, titillating glimpses of the road to full Death Star. The senate is always in a state of uproar. The empire is creating a secret army on the cloud planet Garff. Known evil things – storm troopers, imperial fighters – are glimpsed in chillingly casual pose. An ambassador dressed in robes will stand on a doom-shadowed causeway and talk of plans for a mysterious new weapon. And as ever the mood is one of head-scratching distraction.Perhaps in years to come it may be said that the greatest trick the Club World Cup pulled was convincing those who care about football’s structures that it doesn’t really exist, that this is a business model that can be defeated by not liking it or not following it, that will simply fade back into the swamp.Whereas in reality the empire does have a powerful new weapon, one that is being winched into place in front of our eyes, that is already in play, already digging its fingers into domestic leagues, already unmooring the spectacle.The best way to understand this is to tug again at the Dazn thread. The company was launched in 2015 by thebillionaire Len Blavatnik, who made his fortune in Russian smelting and metal, and now, with ties to Russia cut, is the third-richest person in the UK. Dazn was billed as the Netflix of sports, as all ambitious tech entities must be the Netflix of something, its method to offer a simple, all-in streaming service for sports, shot through with betting, gaming, e-commerce, NFT stuff.For a while it rumbled along in the background. The boxing partnership with Saudi Arabia was a step up into serious-player status. By 2023 Dazn had 20 million subscribers worldwide. The Fifa deal, aided in turn by Dazn’s Saudi deal, is a company making its move.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Why else would anyone pay $1bn for rights to a product it thengives away for free? This is instead a means of taking a place at the table, a stake in the product, all the while happily swallowing vast losses. Dazn reportedly lost $1.4bn in 2023, up from $1.2bn the year before, all the while fearlessly expanding its footprint, happy to disrupt and take ownership.In this sense it is essentially irresistible, all the more so with the backing of the world’s greatest loss-leading sports propaganda project. And it has now found the perfect partner in Fifa, with its own expansionist aims, and also in the current generation of elite club ownership.Everyone in football wants to find the next platform. It is a refrain at any gathering of leaders, owners and rainmakers. The long-term future of this sport is as an enabler, a source of cut-though, piggyback for some future global tech service, and from there access to the real Zuckerberg money.View image in fullscreenInter Miami’s Lionel Messi has been gerrymandered into place by Fifa.Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty ImagesDazn and the Club World Cup is to some extent a trial run for this process, a way of shaking off the shackles of all those baffling legacy interests. Dazn has always denied ever having any interest in the beached European Super League, which was bound up in constructing exactly this kind of global broadcast platform. But now we have this instead, a World Super League, a product no one seems to like, but which Dazn believes will become the most live-streamed event in sports history, all cut through, all positioning, all future-building.There is an overlap of style and ambition even in the way the Club World Cup will be presented. The marketing pitch is about individuals, leveraging the social media following of star players and the power of mass celebrity fawning. Even the shirts have been tinkered with and detribalised just a little on the grounds of creating a better optic for the six-inch screen in the world’s pocket.This is why Messi has been gerrymandered into place by Fifa, why the Dazn home screen is shot through with faces not badges, stars not clubs, why theUncontestedpitch is about goalscorers, top guns, names.Even clicking onthe homepageis a strangely gripping experience, like having your brain syringed through a small lighted screen crowded with endless shouted voices, from clips of Jude Bellingham admitting the Club World Cup is definitely a thing, to Dazn’s Global Football Creator Program, based out of “a creator house” not far from Fifa HQ in Miami, which aims to “mobilize over 100 digital creators, reaching more than 32 million followers across platforms”.Here it is, global reach, global cut-through, the “immersive, multi-platform experience” of Pêche Football, AT Frenchies, Lisa Zimouche, BFordLancer, Alex Ramos, Jessica Vincent, Jen Munoz, Mike WoZ, Shepmates, Fabrizio Romano. This is also why it doesn’t really matter whether legacy fans love the Club World Cup, why talk of unsold tickets or a lack of competitive robustness seems to miss the point, stuck in the old metrics of value.This has been billed by some as a trial run for the 2026 World Cup, as though what everyone here is really interested in is seeing if the stadiums work or the transport is any good. It feels more like a trial run for a version of the future.The Club World Cup may pass in a haze this summer. Dazn may or may not last the course, may itself end up a beta version, planetary destructor ray Mk1. But the question of why football is here is not one that can be quietly ignored; not without that uncomfortable sense of a future that is already out there flexing its claws.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupFifaFootball politicsSaudi Arabia and sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Among the top athletes he signed were Olympic champions Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Gabby Thomas, though two other American track stars, Sha’Carri Richardson and Noah Lyles, did not race in the league.Olympic champion Gabby Thomas followed and heckled by gambler at Grand Slam Track meetRead moreThe first three events, in Kingston, Jamaica, Miami and Philadelphia, raised about $9.45m, with another $3m expected to be paid in LA. Bonuses were expected to go to season-long winners of the categories.The news on Thursday about the abrupt scrubbing of the meeting, scheduled for the last weekend in June at Drake Stadium, follows USA Track and Field’s decision to take an event set for earlier in June – the LA Grand Prix – off the calendar.Max Siegel, USATF chief executive, told the Associated Press that the federation pulled its event because it was not viable to hold two major track meets in LA in the span of three weeks.A person with knowledge of the Grand Slam Track decision told the AP it was because of economic problems with the venue. The person added the new track league is looking towards 2026 and is expected to announce new investors next week. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision had not been publicly announced. A meeting with the athletes was slated to take place later on Thursday.Siegel said leaders at USATF “understand the significance of the [LA] market” and that there are plans for leaders to meet later this summer to coordinate the future of track there and throughout the United States, starting in 2026.“It highlights the complicated way the [sport] works, and how difficult it is to financially sustain track meets,” Siegel said. “The only way to do it in a sustainable way is collaboration and partnerships.”In the short term, USATF is looking to find meetings for a handful of athletes who still need to reach standards or collect points to qualify for world championships later this year and were planning to compete in Los Angeles.The news was far from what Olympic and track leaders were hoping as they head towards the first Summer Games in the United States since 1996 in a city that, 12 years before that, put Carl Lewis, Edwin Moses, Evelyn Ashford and others in the spotlight.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Hamilton described the recent Spanish Grand Prix – where he was ordered by Ferrari to move aside for teammate Charles Leclerc and was then passed by Sauber driver Nico Hülkenberg in the closing laps – as one of the worst races he has ever experienced.Hamilton is 23 points behind Leclerc, and 115 adrift of the championship leader, Oscar Piastri, before this weekend’s Canadian Grand Prix. But speaking on the eve of the race in Montreal, the 40-year-old, who is in the first of a two-season deal withFerrari, said: “I have literally only just started with this team.

Ferrari are already 197 points behind McLaren in the constructors’ standings with reports in Italy claiming Fred Vasseur’s position as team principal is under threat.But Hamilton said: “I don’t think that is on the cards as far as I am aware and I certainly would not be supportive of that. Firstly, I love working with Fred. He is the main reason I am in this team, and I got the opportunity to be here because of Fred which I am forever grateful for.“We are in this together, and things are not perfect. I am here to work with the team but also Fred. I want Fred here and I believe he is the person to take us to the top.“Most people don’t know what is going on in the background. It is not easy, we are having to make changes, there is a lot of work to do, and there is pressure because we want to win, but that [Vasseur leaving] is not a discussion at the moment.

The 51-year-old Dane joins from Brentford on a contract that runs until 2028, and succeeds Ange Postecoglou,who delivered Europa League gloryto end Spurs’ 17-year trophy drought but was sacked because of dismal results in the Premier League.Spurs moved to line up Frank before dismissing Postecoglou last Friday, holding talks via ­intermediaries and plainly keen to avoid a protracted search for the ­person to lead them forward after a season in which they finished 17th with 38 points. Only once in club history have they had a worse league record – in 1914-15.Ange Postecoglou’s triumphant sacking holds the key to modern football | Jonathan LiewRead moreWhen Frank, who has impressed with his work in charge at Brentford during a near seven-year period, gave the green light, Spurs knew he was within their grasp because of a £10m release clause in his contract. They have spent the past few days negotiating the finer details, plus the transfer of some of Frank’s coaches from Brentford.The writing had been on the wall for Postecoglou, with the expectation that he would depart even if he led Spurs past Manchester United in the Europa League final on 21 May. The club said they could not “base our decision on emotions aligned to this triumph” whenthey announced Postecoglou’s departure.The move for Frank has been pushed by Tottenham’s technical director, Johan Lange, a Dane who has a longstanding relationship with his compatriot. Lange gave Frank his first full-time position in the game as a youth coach at B93 in 2004, although they did not spend much time together at the club as Lange soon left.The pair were reunited not long after at Lyngby where Frank came to the attention of the ­Danish ­Football Association, who hired him as the coach of their under-16s, under-17s and later the under-19s. From there Frank got his break in senior ­management at Brøndby in 2013, managing them for almost three ­seasons before going to Brentford, where he worked initially as the assistant to Dean Smith. He succeeded him as the manager in October 2018.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Spurs have been impressed by more than the headline items of Frank’s Brentford tenure – the ­promotion from the Championship via the playoffs in 2021, how he has established them in the Premier League, finishing 13th, ninth, 16th and 10th. Frank consistently over-achieved in relation to his financial means at Brentford; they have one of the smallest budgets in the division. An excellent ­communicator and noted developer of young ­talent, he has also shown himself to be ­tactically flexible. A Spurs statement read: “We are delighted. In Thomas we are ­appointing one of the most ­progressive and ­innovative head coaches in the game. He has a proven track record in player and squad development and we look forward to him leading the team as we prepare for the season ahead.”Justin Cochrane will join Frank at Tottenham as his assistant while he has also brought the head of ­performance, Chris Haslam, and first-team analyst Joe Newton with him from Brentford. Another assistant coach, Andreas Georgson, will arrive from Manchester United.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That said, Brentford could still build through the thirds and they were the joint-fifth highest scorers in the league during this past season. His preference is for a back three and wing-backs, which could suit Spurs’s current full-backs Pedro Porro, Destiny Udogie and Djed Spence.Frank has yet to win silverware or manage in European competition beyond Europa League qualifying stages; Spurs are back in the Champions League after the Europa League triumph. But he is not short of high-profile backers. Pep Guardiola predicted last September that Frank would one day join an elite-level club. “It is just a question of time,” said Manchester City’s manager. “I’m good in a few things, one of which is reading when the manager is good. It is going to happen. Thomas is one of the best. What his team does always makes sense. Every corner is a headache. They are compact. This season they have a high press.”Jürgen Klopp described Frank as “a cool guy” who he respected a lot in November 2023. “He plays against possession teams one way and plays against other teams when all of a sudden they are a possession team themselves,” the then Liverpool manager said. “It’s really interesting.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

While Lee Carsley has played down his youthful squad’s chances of emulating Dave Sexton’s back-to-back triumphs in becoming European champions in 1982 and 1984, a convincing and mature victory over a boisterously backed Czech Republic team hinted that it may not be beyond the realms of possibility.Goals from Harvey Elliott and Charlie Cresswell sandwiched by another from Jonathan Rowe were enough to allow England to take a commanding position in Group B after brief hopes of a comeback from the Czech Republic. Victory over Slovenia, who were beaten 3-0 by Germany in their opening match, on Sunday would assure a place in the quarter-finals.Czech Republic 1-3 England: European Under-21 Championship – live reactionRead moreCarsley had warned that an inexperienced squad that contains just two of those who won in Georgia two years ago could look “a little bit clunky”. But while Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson managed to pick up a booking after just 17 seconds for a misjudged tackle, England made an encouraging start with the captain, James McAtee, employed as a false 9 in the absence of Liam Delap, who is one of several players missing due to Club World Cup commitments.Omari Hutchinson forced Czech Republic goalkeeper Lukas Hornicek into a reaction save at his near post before Vaclav Sejk was inches away from connecting with a cross that fizzed across the face of goal at the other end. The large contingent of red-shirted supporters who had made the short journey across the border and made up 90% of the crowd sensed an opportunity for a country that has failed to get past the group stage of this competition since 2011.View image in fullscreenCharlie Cresswell heads home England’s third goal.Photograph: Radovan Stoklasa/ReutersIt needed a solid save from Brighton’s James Beadle, who spent last season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, to keep out Stepan Chaloupek’s header from a free-kick when the Czech Republic captain found himself totally unmarked before Alex Scott did well to block a goalbound shot from a corner. With Liverpool’s Jarell Quansah and Charlie Cresswell of Toulouse looking shaky at the back, England were riding their luck as Carsley assumed his favoured touchline position on his haunches.Such is the depth of talent in this age group that seven members of Thomas Tuchel’s latest senior squad – including Jude Bellingham, Levi Colwill and Cole Palmer – were still eligible to take part here.Newcastle’s Tino Livramento, who has already won a senior cap during Carsley’s spell as interim manager, was instrumental in the opening goal. His cross was almost deflected in but McAtee kept the ball in play and it was drilled in by Elliott.Beadle then had to be alert to prevent the ball from trickling over his line after it had come off Qunasah’s arm following a goalmouth scramble moments after England had taken the lead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the Czech Republic hit back immediately when Livramento was caught out by a cross from Sejk and Daniel Fila gratefully headed in.“We’ve got to play,” came the message from Carsley as his side attempted to wrest back control. The introduction of Birmingham’s Jay Stansfield and Ethan Nwaneri of Arsenal from the bench for the last 20 minutes was an indication that the job was not done.It didn’t take long for Nwaneri to make an impact, producing a cheeky nutmeg before setting off on a mazy run that saw his shot deflect just wide. Cresswell sealed the victory minutes later when he headed in Scott’s corner to give Carsley the perfect start.Explore more on these topicsEuropean Under-21 ChampionshipEngland Under-21snewsShareReuse this content"

So far, so standard. But then he delivered the next line in Spanish too, then the one after that, and the one after that.He kept going until he got to the end of his speech, when he delivered the one line everyone invariably does on the day they are presented here:“Hala Madrid!”It wasn’t long – one minute and one second, in all – but it was long enough to win them over already.Football Daily | Trent Alexander-Arnold takes Route 12 on his big day at Real MadridRead more“I think it surprised a lot of people,” Alexander-Arnold said when he had made his way over to the press room. “For me it was important to do that, to have a good start.” He wasn’t wrong: there had been a kind of double-take as he went on, an increasing admiration, and this was averygood start: delivered smoothly, with no cue cards, only the tiniest pause at one point and in genuinely good Spanish, accent and all. “Perfect,” one sports daily called it. “Impeccable,” another said. Suspiciously good, some inevitably suggested.“How long have you been learning for?” he was asked. There was a smile, an awareness that this question could be a little loaded. “A few months, a few months,” he replied. “This is very, very exciting for me, a day I’ve been looking forward to for a long time – by ‘waiting a long time’ I mean a couple of weeks, not years.”There were those who wondered whether Alexander-Arnold’s departure fromLiverpoolhadn’t been longer in the making, the quality of his Spanish something to celebrate but also becoming exhibit A. His decision to leave, after all, had not been accepted by everyone, some supporters booing him. But the defender, raised in West Derby and at the club since he was six, said he was happy with the sendoff and the club’s owners told him he would be welcome back. He would be “for ever indebted”. He would only have ever left for Madrid, he said.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

It was an honour, it was always going to be emotional for me. I am happy with the sendoff, the way the club treated me, the way the fans were. That was outstanding, I couldn’t say a bad word.“I was speaking to players, the manager, the owners, and they were all incredible. I had a lot of support, a huge amount of help, and an amazing conversation with the owners that lasted a couple of days. They thanked me for everything I gave, wished me well on my future journey and said they would have me back at the club at any point.“To have those words was amazing. And to be here now facing a new challenge is equally exciting. I’m over the moon, absolutely over the moon, Not many players get to experience this. I am very lucky and very proud. To play forReal Madridis a fantastic honour, an achievement in itself.”View image in fullscreenTrent Alexander said he was relishing playing alongside such talented teammates.Photograph: Antonio Villalba/Real Madrid/Getty ImagesHe added: “Ten or 11 years ago, this is not something you dream of because it is just out of reach: there’s only a select handful that get a chance to be part of this.” The dream had become real. “It was not a question of where to go; it was whether or not to go. I knew that if I was ever to leave Liverpool, it would only be to Real Madrid. And it gets to the point where you have to make a decision whether to go or stay. It wasn’t an easy decision. I had been there so long. But in my mind it is the right one.“I am fortunate to have played for the biggest club in England and now the biggest in Spain, and both have massive histories. I am much happier playing with these players than against them. I am sure we can strike up a good connection and get the chemistry going. Hopefully I can give them many, many assists.”“I feel mature, ready, experienced enough to go and be successful somewhere else.

I do what I am told; I did that with two managers at Liverpool. If people don’t appreciate the way I play, it is what it is. As long as the manager and the players appreciate me, then: whatever.”There will be two familiar faces waiting for him in Madrid: his close friend Jude Bellingham and the former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso,who has just taken over as coach. Alexander‑Arnold, though, denied that agent Bellingham had played a key role in bringing him to the Bernabéu.View image in fullscreenA new door opens for Trent Alexander-ArnoldPhotograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“It wasn’t exactly what people thought it was,” he said. “We spoke. We spoke a lot about Liverpool and Madrid. That’s just the kind of conversations we have as players and friends. In the national team, he was the only one who knew what it was like to be at Real Madrid so everyone was asking questions. A lot of people think he played a huge part in me coming here but the club speaks for itself.”Of Alonso he said: “I grew up a Liverpool fan watching Istanbul [the 2005 Champions League triumph, in which the Spaniard scored] and now he is a manager and doing incredible things. I have spoken to him and it is good to have that communication. I told him he was a big idol growing up so to be able to work with him is a dream. Watching him pass a ball influenced me to train harder at that and set standards – I explained that to him as well. I will be a sponge around him, trying to soak up all the information I can.”On the back of the new shirt is a No 12 and just “Trent”. “That’s easily explained,” Real Madrid’s new signing said. “I always found that in Europe the whole name thing confused a lot of people. Double barrelled. Some called me Alexander, some called me Arnold, some both, some Alex. Some Trent. I thought: ‘Let’s make it simple. Trent’s my name. Trent on the back, let’s make it Trent.

The size and price of the proposal is unclear.Espanyol are owned by the Chinese company Rastar Group, which specialises in toy car production, and have been on the market since they were relegated fromLa Ligatwo years ago, with a valuation of about £110m. They were promoted via the playoffs the following season and stayed in the top flight, finishing 14th.Burnley’s investment would give them preferential access to young European and South American players, and is part of a growing trend of Premier League clubs trying to invest in Spain.The country’s longstanding ties with South America, proximity to north Africa and liberal player registration rules make it a natural entry point for youth talent from outside the EU. Many South American players obtain dual citizenship in Spain, making them easier to sell on to other European clubs.City Football Group was the first Premier League-linked group to buy a Spanish club with its 2017 purchase of Girona, who were subsequently promoted to La Liga and qualified for the Champions League for the first time by finishing third in 2024. Last year Aston Villa’s owner, V Sports, bought a stake in Real Unión, who were relegated from the third tier in May. This year Brentford’s owner, Matthew Benham, bought Mérida AD, who are in the third division.Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group, had talks this season about buying a stake in the second division club Málaga but has not completed the transaction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The move comes with Uefa expected to delay until the end of the month a decision on whether the club will be allowed to compete in next ­season’s Europa League. The offer from Johnson, the ­former US ambassador to the UK, has the backing of Palace’s co-chair Steve Parish and is believed to be under consideration by Textor despite falling significantly short of his valuation of about £240m for his 44.9% stake.That figure is based on his failedattempt to buy outParish and his ­fellow co-owners, Josh Harris and David Blitzer, in April, when a £550m bid was rebuffed. Textor is understood to be prepared to accept up to £50m less than his valuation after Harris and Blitzer turned down an ­opportunity to buy his stake at the ­discounted price. A consortium that includes the NBA star Jimmy Butler and ­Sportsbank, which has held talks with Textor about investing in Palace, is also in the frame.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.All four Palace co-owners were part of the club delegation that attended a meeting at Uefa’s headquarters in Nyon this month and argued that ­Textor, the majority shareholder in the French club Lyon, who have also ­qualified for next ­season’s Europa League, does not have a decisive influence at ­Selhurst Park despite being the largest shareholder.Uefa rejectedattempts by Textor and Blitzer to place their shares in a blind trust because they missed the 1 March deadline. Blitzer’s Danish club, Brøndby, have qualified for the ­Conference League.A decision on Palace had been expected imminently but sources atUefahave indicated its club financial control body (CFCB) would like more time to consider the case, with the end of June regarded as more ­realistic. That could give Textor an opportunity to complete a sale – a move that would also be viewed favourably by Uefa – although he is believed to be ­reluctant to rush through a deal ­having spent about £180m since purchasing his original 40% stake in August 2021.Palace are understood to remain confident they will be cleared to participate in theEuropa League, having been in regular contact with the CFCB since their meeting in Nyon. But if they do get approval, Nottingham Forest could appeal to the court of arbitration for sport after they wrote to Uefa this week raising concerns about a potential breach of multi-club ownership rules by Palace.Forest, whose owner, Evangelos Marinakis, is close to Textor, would stand to be promoted from the Conference League if Palace are banned by Uefa. Brighton would then be in line to take Forest’s Conference League place after finishing eighth in the Premier League.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 32-year-old striker’s list of accolades – World Cup winner, three-time Liga F champion, National Women’s Soccer League champion, Copa de la Reina victor and Concacaf W Champions Cup winner – is matched by few in the sport. But as a young girl growing up in southern Spain, her path was uncertain, rife with obstacles. “As a child, I dreamed of what I wanted to be when I grew up,” she says. “It was a soccer player. But, let’s say, circumstances didn’t allow me to see women’s soccer or anything close to women’s soccer.”As she grew up with three sisters, González’s earliest memories of football were playing with herhermanasin their small village in Andalusia. She dreamed of being a footballer, but there wasn’t a path before her. The shy young talent with a nose for goals would play with the local boys: they needed a goalscorer and she stepped in. As González grew, her father took her on car journeys of more than four hours each way to get to training.Post your questions for Emma HayesRead moreToday González and Spanish women’s football are in a much different place: “The change in mentality that took place in Spain was incredible, because until about five years ago the visibility we had was very low,” she says. “So we really had to work hard and many times we had to work in the shadows. Girls can now grow up knowing that in Spain there are Ballon d’Or players who can become world champions.”Since the inaugural Ballon d’Or Feminin in 2018, four of six trophies have gone to two Spanish players, twice each to Barcelona’s Alexia Putellas and Aitana Bonmatí. On the challenges they all faced, González says: “I feel lucky because I am part of that transition, because I have lived the part from when, let’s say, we had almost no opportunities to live … ”The drive to succeed despite inordinate obstacles is evident in the way González plays, and the unique journey she’s taken. The 5ft 3in forward is skilled in the air despite her height, has a remarkable intuition for time and space, astutely adapts her game to the opposition, and contributes defensively. She left Real Madrid in 2023 as their all-time leading scorer, with 39 goals in 77 games, and co-leads the NWSL golden boot race with seven goals in 11 games.“I’m not just a player, but a player who thinks a lot, who works hard on matches even before they start, because I try to determine who I’m facing and who I’m not.”This summer in Switzerland, González will be one of four Spain players from the NWSL at the Euros. Now at Gotham FC, she says the challenge of something new was behind her move to the US. She was attracted to Gotham’s ambitions and the league’s competitive depth. “When I left Spain to come here, I came to prove that I was also a much more complete player, better than the one who only knows how to touch the ball, than the one who also knows how to adapt.”González signed for Gotham in the summer of 2023 and quickly made an impact, scoring the winning goal in the NWSL Championship. In May in Mexico, she scored Gotham’s winner in a 1-0 victory over Tigres in the Concacaf W Champions Cup, securing her second trophy stateside.View image in fullscreen‘As a team, we believe we can achieve everything,’ says Esther GonzálezPhotograph: Bagu Blanco/Pressinphoto/ShutterstockTwo more goals followed for Spain in the Nations League, but González is not resting on her laurels. “I hope I’m not in my best moment. I hope to have better moments, that the best is yet to come.”Ambitious, focused, invigorated by hard-earned achievements – just like her national team. Afterwinning their first World Cup in 2023and enduring the fallout from theRubiales scandal, Spain’s confidence in major tournaments has improved on 2022, whenLa Rojalost 2-1 to England in the quarter-finals (their goal scored by González). “In order to create things you have to first believe that you can achieve them,” she says. “As a team, we believe we can achieve everything.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pat Cummins claimed six wickets to put his team in the ascendancy but on a whirligig day of constantly oscillating fortunes, the Proteas promptly bowled themselves back into contention, with Australia reaching stumps on 144 for eight, nursing a lead of 218.“It’s an amazing chance, and we’re all excited about the opportunity to win,” said Bedingham. “It could go either way but us as a team are very, very excited and there’s a lot of belief in the dressing room. We’re very confident. When they started batting in their second innings we would definitely have taken this score. So very confident, there’s massive belief in this team.”Australia and South Africa wickets tumble to leave WTC final on a knife-edgeRead moreBut Australia will feel equally optimistic after their second innings was rescued from impending disaster by Alex Carey, who towards the day’s end dominated the scoring in a 61- run partnership with Mitchell Starc after Australia had fallen to 73 for seven. “Kez has been brilliant, he’s dragged us out of that,” Cummins said. “The mood in the changing room was pretty positive towards the end there. It was a great partnership. It was almost like a run chase, with each four getting loud claps. It was a pretty good way to end the day.”A total of 14 wickets fell across the second day, precisely as many asin the first. It started with South Africa losing their last six wickets in adding just 95 runs to their overnight total, 51 of them provided by the partnership between Bedingham – who top-scored with 45 – and Temba Bavuma. “I don’t think Australia gave us any bad balls. That’s why they’re the best in the world,” Bedingham said. “Hopefully going forward we can counteract that and win the title. I don’t think Cummins ever misses. There’s always energy on the ball. He bowled 18-odd overs and the energy from his first over to his 18th was exactly the same. He’s world class.“There are six quality seamers out there, I think that makes batting tough. The bowlers have the ability to take it in with the slope, which means the ball moves more, and they also have the ability to take it away. Just having world-class bowlers on a pitch that can move both ways makes it quite tricky.”Lungi Ngidi, the least successful of South Africa’s bowlers in Australia’s first innings, made amends in their second by taking three key wickets across what became the second-longest spell of his Test career. “I was struggling a bit from one side, but I swapped ends and I felt a lot better,” he said. “Once you get a moment like that you don’t want to let it go because it could change the game. I just kept going until my legs told me, ‘That’s enough.’“Once we started bowling we realised there was still enough in the wicket to make it closer, to bring that margin down. Just finding a bit of rhythm, that’s all I was looking to do. If you’d told me this was the position we’d be in at the end of the day I’d definitely have taken it. I guess that’s what a Test championship final should bring. A lot of guys have put their hands up. It’s been very exciting, very tough cricket out there.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It doesn’t make a difference to me, opinions or whatever it is.”Earlier Cummins had taken five of the last six South African wickets to fall – the other was a run-out – to end the day with 300 Test scalps, becoming the 40th man, and the eighth Australian, to reach the mark. “As a fast bowler, 300 is something I always kind of thought about as a pretty good sign of durability and resilience and longevity, so I feel pretty proud to join that group,” he said. “I still feel like I’ve got lots of miles in the legs. I don’t feel like I’m going to end any time soon.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Test ChampionshipSouth Africa cricket teamAustralia cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

(Ifab), hasamended the text of the offside lawto clarify at which point an offside assessment should be made. The change comes after interventions from Torns IF, a club from the small town of Stångby near Malmö, who wondered whether a player could get around the offside law by keeping the ball balanced in the crook of their foot.Wenger wants to fix VAR offsides but broken handball rule is the real problem | Max RushdenRead moreA video showing Torns trying to put their “scoop pass” trick into practice went viral in 2023 and provoked lengthy correspondence between Torns and Ifab. At first Ifab sought to dismiss the query but Torns’ persistence led the body to acknowledge that it was “amusing” and consent to reviewing the wording of the law.David Elleray, the former Premier League referee who is technical director of Ifab, wrote to Torns and thanked the club “for your part in this clarification” and “for your gentle persistence in this matter”.Torns’ Tim Neilsen, said it felt “absolutely fantastic to have contributed to the rules of the beautiful game”, adding: “Ifab required some convincing, but we got there in the end.”The scoop pass has not been outlawed but a clarification has been made to a footnote of the offside law for 2025-26 and relates to one example of a “delayed” pass: when a goalkeeper throws the ball upfield with a view to releasing a forward behind the opponents’ defence. An offside assessment will be made at the “last point of contact” before the keeper releases the ball. In all other passing instances, a judgment is made related to “the first point of contact”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He believes the lack of clarity would not exist were it not for video assistant referees and the need to establish a precise moment at which to adjudge offside. Perhaps further correspondence will follow yet.Explore more on these topicsLaws of footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Raducanu has not been the highest-ranked player in the country since June 2023 when she was recovering from surgeries to her wrists and ankle. She missed a total of eight months in 2023 and consequently fell out of the top 300.Wimbledon lifts prize pot to £53.5m but tells players more money is no quick fixRead more“It’s nice, but I wouldn’t say it’s the most important thing for me,” said Raducanu. “Having Katie in front, it was nice for me to have something to chase. Now I’m sure she’s going to enjoy that with me. The grass season is still young, and so is the rest of the season. But regardless, we have a healthy competition between us two. I want to see her do well; she wants to see me do well. It was nice to also play doubles with her this week.”As in her first-round win, Raducanu opened the match returning brilliantly, immediately putting Sramkova under consistent pressure by taking returns early and looking to dominate the Slovak’s second serve. She flitted to a 5-0 first-set lead but, as she attempted to close out the set, Raducanu lost all momentum and intensity. She was pulled back to 5-4 before resetting and closing out the set with an authoritative service game.Although Sramkova, the world No 41, is a good player and an excellent athlete, her counterpunching style is better suited to slower surfaces. Raducanu was in total control of most exchanges and, aside from her brief detour in the first set, was dominant from the baseline. She established a 5-1 lead in the second set, and this time did not let it slip.Raducanu is joined this week by both Mark Petchey, who is working with her throughout the grass-court season and her previous coach Nick Cavaday. Raducanu and Cavaday had worked together for about 14 months until the end of the Australian Open in January when he decided to step back due to health reasons. The presence of two trusted voices in her team appears to be another positive step forward for the 22-year-old.View image in fullscreenKatie Boulter went down to the fifth seed Diana Shnaider 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 at Queen’s.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersBefore the tournament, Raducanu revealed that her preparation for Queen’s had been disrupted by her continuedissues with back spasms, which had affected her days before the French Open at the Strasbourg Open. However, she has looked in good shape this week. She started her grass-court campaign with an excellent performance in her dominantwin over the qualifier Cristina Bucsa. She also played two doubles matches with Boulter, only the second doubles appearance in her career, a good indication of her physical shape.Friday will offer a good test of Raducanu’s actual level when she faces Zheng Qinwen, the top seed, who overcame McCartney Kessler in a tough three-setter late on Thursday evening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At 21 years old, Shnaider is the second-youngest player in the top 20 behind her fellow Russian Mirra Andreeva and she is a devastating ball-striker. “I’m very happy for Raducanu to be British No 1,” said Boulter, who will be ranked No 39 at best by Monday. “But at the same time, it’s going to be fun for me to chase her now, and I think she’s been doing that for a while. Now it’s kind of my turn.”After enthusiastically celebrating another solid victory, Raducanu immediately thought of her doubles partner and friendly singles rival, signing the camera: “Long live Boultercanu.” She later explained that it had been difficult to bounce back aftertheir doubles quarter-final defeatby the top seeds Erin Routliffe and Lyudmyla Kichenok on Wednesday.“Honestly, it was actually a real challenge for me today,” said Raducanu. “I’m not used to playing doubles. I lost the match yesterday and I was really upset. I really felt I was out of the tournament. So to get myself fired up for this one was really difficult. I’m really happy to get myself through this one. I really want to play with Katie again in the future.”Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisKatie BoulternewsShareReuse this content"

My hands were slippery from the wet weather, so maybe I slipped off the handlebars or started pedalling too early.” Evenepoel is expected to battle with Jonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogacar for the overall victory in the Alps.View image in fullscreenRiders in a breakaway pass through a landscape of vineyards.Photograph: Dario Belingheri/Getty ImagesJonathan Milan, winner of the second stagein Issoire on Monday, was the favourite in the event of a bunch sprint.

Towards the end of the season he said “my body started talking to me,” and he began to consider the need for rest.Mauricio Pochettino said the US can win the World Cup. Now they can’t even win a gameRead more“What is going to be best for me leading into next year and going into the [2026] World Cup? And was that to play eight more games and then get no rest at all, go straight into preseason and then grind another year and go straight into the World Cup? That’s not what I felt was best for my body,” Pulisic said. “I did want to be a part of at least the two friendlies [against Switzerland and Turkey]. I did speak with the [US] coaches, and I asked, and [said] I wanted to be a part of the team in whatever capacity I could. And they said no. They said they only wanted one roster … I fully respect that. I didn’t understand it, but it is what it is.”As it turned out, Pulisic was just one of a number of USMNT stars who will miss this summer’s schedule, either due to injury, Club World Cup commitments, or personal reasons. But as his nation’s most prominent player and a leader in the locker room, Pulisic’s decision drew criticism,including from former USMNT greats Landon Donovan and Tim Howard.Pulisic addressed this criticism on Thursday, saying that questioning his commitment to the national team was “way out of line” and does not line up with conversations he has had with those same figures in private.“When it comes to [Donovan, Howard, and other ex-national team critics], it is tough because I looked up to those guys growing up. Some of these guys were my idols, and I respect them so much as players,” Pulisic said. “Privately, the way they talk to me and clearly want to show support and be your friend and everything, and then they say something slightly different publicly. … Does it hurt me? Am I surprised by it? I don’t know. Not really. People are always going to have their opinions.”Pulisic’s father, Mark,responded forcefullyto Donovan on social media earlier this week, telling the former US player to “grow a pair” while pointing out that Donovan himself once took an extended sabbatical from national team duty.In the CBS interview, Christian Pulisic was not asked about his father’s comments, but added that “I just don’t understand why so many people are so big on just wanting to give out these takes when they’ve been through tough moments themselves. I don’t understand the idea of wanting to divide this fanbase against the players, against the team, and bring in a negative light over it in any way. But we tend to do that a lot, and it doesn’t make sense to me.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These losses followed a poor Nations League performance that involved Pulisic and most of the team’s top players, in which the team lost to Canada and Panama en route to a fourth-placed finish. Pulisic said criticism of himself and the players’ supposed lack of commitment in these losses was a “lazy take.”“We don’t step out there and not give 100% … it’s not something that we do,” he said. “We we all want it so bad.”Explore more on these topicsChristian PulisicUSAUS sportsMilannewsShareReuse this content"

She added six rebounds and four assists.The No 1 pick in this year’s draft, Bueckers had 22 points in the first half – her previous career high was 21. Her teammates had just 14 points total at the break. She finished 13 of 19 from the field and 5 of 7 from three-point range. Thomas had 11 points and 10 assists in 24 minutes after missing the previous five games with a left calf injury.Despite her scoring feats, Bueckers said she could have played better.“I mean I was coming back from a break and I feel like I could have used my voice more, been more disruptive, crashed the glass more,” she said. “So as I get my wind under me, I’ll be better in those areas. But like I said, just trying to contribute in other areas and whatever that looks like on any given night and will try to put my full effort toward that.”The Mercury led 67-55 on Sabally’s three-pointer with 23 seconds left in the third quarter and gradually pulled away. The Wings were never closer than eight points in the final eight minutes. Sabally played her first five seasons in Dallas before being traded to the Mercury in the offseason, and the teams had words and remained on the floor for several minutes after the game ended.The Wings averaged 85.3 points a game when Bueckers played in the first six and 76.0 points when she was out. Wings leading scorer Arike Ogunbowale missed her first seven field-goal attempts and finished with 10 points on 2-of-10 shooting. She was averaging 16.3 points per game and had 26 points in an 81-65 loss to the Minnesota Lynx on Sunday.The Mercury are 3-2 in Commissioner’s Cup play and the Wings are 0-4.Explore more on these topicsWNBADallas WingsBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

A new deal is urgently neededEditorialDiplomacy can do more to slow Tehran’s alarming progress than threats from IsraelThu 12 Jun 2025 14.12 EDTLast modified on Thu 12 Jun 2025 19.54 EDTShareAyear into his first term, Donald Trumppulled the US outof the hard-won international deal that hadslowed Iran’sadvance towards nuclear weapons, and imposed punishing sanctions. Europe tried to keep the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) on life support. But the strangling of Iran’s economy, and the US assassination of Qassem Suleimani, the powerful head of its Quds force, undermined the country’s moderates and the progress on non-proliferation.The fallout of Mr Trump’s Iran policy is still becoming evident. On Thursday, the UN nuclear watchdog found, for the first time in two decades, that Tehran wasnot in compliancewith the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Iran vowed to “significantly” increase production of enriched uranium in retaliation, following a pattern of escalation in response to International Atomic Energy Agency criticism. US and European officials say that Israelappears readyto strike its adversary’s nuclear facilities. Fear of the consequences reportedly drove the US decisionto withdraw non-essential diplomatic personnelfrom Iraq, Bahrain and Kuwait.There isvery good reason to be scepticalabout an attack. Israel has prepared for strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities before and drawn back. Without US help, suggest many analysts, it could not destroy them and might instead spur Iran into rushing for the bomb, as well as retaliating by other means. Talking up an attack might be intended to draw Mr Trump in, though the US president does not look cooperative. He wrongfooted Benjamin Netanyahu in April when, sitting beside the Israeli prime minister, he announced US talks with Iran. Thepresident’s remarkon Thursday that an Israeli strike “could very well happen soon” sounded mostly like it was intended to push Iran towards concessions in the next round of discussions,due to be held in Omanthis weekend.Yet progress has been limited, and if things go badly this time there is cause to be concerned. Mr Netanyahu is clinging to office with increasing desperation. All eyes are on Israel’s slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza, but the prime minister talks of war “on seven fronts”: strikes in Syria andLebanoncontinue.Last year, Israel decapitated not only Hamas but, critically, Hezbollah and – when Tehranretaliatedwith a missile attack –hit Iranian military targets. It may believe that it can now cause maximum damage to an existential threat at minimal cost to its forces – and that the window will soon close, as Iran reconstructs its air defences and its nuclear programme rapidly advances.But Steve Witkoff, the US Middle East envoy, hasreportedlytold Republican senators that Israeli defences could be overwhelmed by Iranian retaliation. Allies must make clear to Mr Netanyahu their absolute opposition to a reckless move that would further imperil the region.Iran’s alarming progress is part of agrim picture of nuclear proliferationinternationally. The immediate priority must be ensuring that Israel pulls back from the brink again. But the real prize would be a nuclear deal with Iran. Mr Trump claims one is “fairly close”, but has demanded an end to enrichment. Tehran is only likely to agree to limiting nuclear progress – the kind of deal Mr Trump walked away from, but which could perhaps be repackaged for him as a bold new accord by a master negotiator.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Likethis photographthatElon Musktweeted on Sunday: a shirtless protester wielding the Tricolor atop a vandalized robotaxi as flames billow toward the weak sunlight backlighting the flag. His dark curls fall to his bare shoulders. He stares into the camera.Frankly, the image belongs in a museum.I understand my reaction is not the feeling Republicans hope to inspire in Americans broadly this week. Their messaging thus far aboutthe protests against immigration raidsin Latino communities has largely been alarmist – proof,they say, of an “invasion” of “illegal aliens”.“Look at all the foreign flags. Los Angeles is occupied territory,”said Stephen Milleron X. According to Adam Kinzinger, a former congressman and more moderate voice, the Mexican flags carried by protesters are “terrible … and feeding right into Donald Trump’s narrative”.“I just think that it would be much stronger if they were carrying American flags only,” he said on CNN this week.By this logic, Mexican flags are proof-positive that Mexican Americans are notreallyAmerican; that we are somehow collaborating on a planned “invasion”; that we harbor secret loyalties to Mexico; that we’re here to displace white people and undermine the American way of life via somePlan de Aztlan. In short, none of this is true.View image in fullscreenProtesters hold Mexican flags as cars burn during protests sparked by immigration raids in Los Angeles, California on Sunday.Photograph: Caroline Brehman/EPAIn front of Congress Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, cited the presence of “flags from foreign countries” in LA to legitimize supporting Trump’s deployment of the national guard. Thisunilateral invocation of Title 10by the Trump administration, without the consent of the governor, is exceedinglyaggressive. So is the deployment of700 US marinesto be used to crush American protest in an American city.The subtext here is that bymany metrics, Americans’ patience for Ice and its antics is wearing thin, even as Ice’s deportation numbers areanemiccompared with past administrations. The Trump administration realizes something has to change. Fanning outrage about a flag is both a legal pretext to pursue martial law and a diplomatic means of getting consent from the American populace to do unpopular things in the name of security.But what is it about the Mexican flag that triggers so many people?I’d argue that in the American context, the Mexican flag is not a nationalist symbol but something decentered from Mexico as a nation-state. Historically, it was a key banner of the Chicano movement,flownby supporters surrounding Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez during the California grape boycott in the 1960s. It flew alongside the United Farm Workers flag, the American flag and banners of the Virgen de Guadalupe as a means of fomenting cultural unity. It also served as a reminder of a fundamental truth: we are from here; we are also from there. We’re children of the in-between, or what the Tejana writer Gloria Anzaldúa referred to asnepantlain her seminal work Borderlands/La Frontera. Nepantla is simply Nahuatl for the liminal space between cultures, identities and worlds. To this end, we might think of the Mexican flag as a symbol of double-consciousness in the Mexican American psyche specifically. We understand our middleness, yet we also understand how America sees and defines us: Mexicans. We take that prejudice and transform it into power.Amidst these burgeoning protests, the Mexican flag is a bold articulation: we are like you; you are like usIt’s through this lens that I see the Mexican flag as just one banner among many, a remembrance of roots but also a shared experience between Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants alike. Night after night, you can see captivating scenes with Mexican flags flying in the downtowns of Dallas and Houston and Atlanta and New York, as a solidarity grows between those explicitly targeted by Ice and those soon-to-be targeted by Ice. This is not hyperbole. Today, phenotype and politics are grounds enough for detention: in order for Ice to meet the Trump administration’s goal of 3,000 arrests a day, targetshave increasingly includedstudent protesters, tourists and even American citizens. The only rule is to meet the metric at all costs.Amid these burgeoning protests, the Mexican flag is a bold articulation: we are like you; you are like us. We have struggled and persist in this place together. See me and don’t be afraid; I see you and I am not afraid. To wield the flag amid a protest is to paint yourself a target, to take both your body and your future into your own hands. This is precisely why the marines have been called in. To intimidate these bodies. Or to destroy them.What Trump fails to realize is that the bones of Mexican people are the metadata of the land in California and indeed the rest of the country. Our place here is in the food, in the street names, in the name of Los Angeles itself.Already, I can hear some within my own community admonishing my defense of Mexican flags at American protests as treasonous or ungrateful or something along those lines. To them I might ask: why is it that the protesters’ allegiances are held to higher standards than an American president who seeks to turn the US armed forces against American citizens?From Republican leaders, ​you’ll never hear such questioning rhetoric surrounding other foreign flags that fly prominently in America. The Irish flag on St Patrick’s Day instantly comes to mind. As does the Israeli flag at both political and non-political events. And, of course, the Confederate flag, though white supremacists have explicitly stated goals of both overthrowing the US government and taking back US land. Heritage is the most commonly used defense. Though wouldn’t heritage apply to the Mexican flag as well?View image in fullscreenWomen in traditional Mexican dress participate in a protest against federal immigration sweeps, in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday.Photograph: David Swanson/ReutersI’m reminded of James Baldwin when Mexicans Americans and Mexicans call for restraint from using Mexican imagery in US protests: “In Harlem,” Baldwin wrote, “… the Negro policemen are feared more than whites, for they have more to prove and fewer ways to prove it.” We think our respectability will protect us. But we know historically and empirically that has not been true. Respectability did not protect Japanese Americans frombeing interned. Nor did it protect Vietnamese veterans who fought alongside Americans in Vietnam from facing discrimination in the US. Nor did it protect Afghan translators from having theirvisas revoked.Our American bona fides are not the things that will save us now. Not in the era of detention metrics and collateral targeting and now the prospect of authoritarian violence.It should be said: I don’t go looking for these images. For my sins, having clicked on one, the algorithm floods me with them now. Protesters with Mexican flags getting a haircut in front of police. Protesters with Mexican flags forming a human chain. They just keep coming to me. But other images, too. Likeoneof a guy popping a wheelie past a ton of burning Waymo cars. I mean, come the fuck on – it’s cool. The thing that immediately jumps out to me is the frivolity of the image. A body perfectly in balance, perfectly in motion. It moves of its own volition. It is completely in command of its trajectory and space in the landscape.It is beyond the fascist impulse to live so beautifully as this. Luckily, it also is beyond the fascist ability to remove the memory of this body from the land.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsOpinionTrump administrationMexicoUS politicsElon MuskProtestDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

That is discriminatoryBarry Trachtenberg, Victor Silverman, Atalia Omer, Raz Segal, Rebecca T Alpert and Judith ButlerWe are Jewish scholars who filed an amicus brief with the US supreme court on Harvard’s discriminatory assumption that being Jewish means supporting IsraelThu 12 Jun 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 12 Jun 2025 11.21 EDTShareHarvard is suing to stop theTrump administration’s unprecedented interference in the operation of the university, supposedly to protect Jewish students fromantisemitism.Harvardmaintains it has already addressed a crisis of antisemitism on campus. The government is wrong in attacking Harvard, but so is Harvard in its defense.We are part of a group of 27 Jewish scholars of Jewish studies who have filed anamicus briefinHarvard’s lawsuit against the Trump administration. We submitted the brief, drafted by the civil rights attorneyYaman Salahi, because we support the university’s fight against government overreach. Yet in doing so, the institution has committed a different kind of discrimination – one that violates federal civil rights law. We reject Harvard’s troubling assumption that being Jewish necessitates supporting Israel, or that criticism of Israel’s genocide in Gaza constitutes antisemitism.Harvard’s claims about campus antisemitism don’t only misrepresent Jewish diversity – they violateTitle VI of the Civil Rights Actby subjecting Jews to harmful stereotypes about what constitutes “authentic” Jewish identity.Harvard’s owncomplaint and legal filingsperpetuate a pernicious fiction: that protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza stem from prejudice against Jewish students rather than moral opposition to the systematic destruction of Palestinian life. This narrative relies on three false assumptions: that Jewish communities hold monolithic pro-Israel views, that Jewish students cannot tolerate different perspectives on Israel-Palestine, and that exposure to criticism of Israel constitutes a civil rights injury.These assumptions aren’t just empirically wrong – they’re legally dangerous. As the US supreme court established inStudents for Fair Admissions, universities cannot operate on the “belief that minority students always express some characteristic minority viewpoint on any issue”. The court explicitly rejected “impermissible racial stereotypes” that assume all “members of the same racial group think alike”.The same principle applies when universities assume all Jewish people share identical views aboutIsraeland Zionism. When Harvard treats criticisms of Israeli violence as antisemitism or of Israel as a state for Jews above the other people who live there, it reduces Jewish identity to a political litmus test – one that erases the rich diversity of Jewish thought and experience.This erasure has real consequences for Jewish students and faculty who don’t conform to Harvard’s preferred stereotype. Consider Professor Atalia Omer, one of our co-signers and a Jewish Israeli academic who previously taught at Harvard Divinity School. Harvard’s antisemitism taskforce identified her courses on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as contributing to campus hostility – despite the fact that she designed these courses as a Jewish scholar exploring the complexity of the region through multiple perspectives.AsProfessor Omer wrote: Harvard’s report “attempts to redraw the boundaries of Jewish legitimacy”and effectively declared her “the wrong kind of Jew” – a determination that no educational institution should have the power to make.This experience reflects a broader pattern affecting Jewish students and faculty. Harvard recognizes student organizations such asTzedek(Hebrew for justice), which is “a home on campus for a liberatory approach to Judaism” and “anti-Zionist, non-Zionist, and Zionist-questioning Jewish students”. Similarly, theHarvard Forward-Thinking Jewish Unionexists because some Jewish students felt they were not allowed to question Zionism in pre-existing Jewish campus spaces.These students and scholars aren’t marginal voices.Recent pollingshows that nearly one-third of Jewish Americans agree that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and more than half support withholding arms shipments to Israel. A2020 Pew Research surveyfound that only 45% of Jewish Americans consider “caring about Israel” essential to their Jewish identity.Harvard’s approach doesn’t just erase Jewish diversity – it actively harms Jewish students who don’t conform to expected political views. Administratorstried to stop a Passover sederorganized by anti-Zionist Jewish students, treating their religious observance as inherently problematic because of their political views. Jewish students report facing discipline for passive acts of solidarity like placing protest stickers on laptops while studying in university libraries. In this, Harvard is no outlier, as dissidentJewish students and facultyaround the country have been targeted along with their Palestinian and Muslim fellows.This discriminatory treatment stems from Harvard’s misguided adoption of theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which conflates criticism of Israel with prejudice against Jewish people.This isn’t just bad policy – it’s illegal discrimination under Title VI. As the Israeli law professorsItamar Mann and Lihi Yona argue, when Jewish employees or students are told they have “betrayed their own race” or are “not acting Jewish enough” by supporting Palestinian rights, they face discrimination based on their failure to conform to ethnic stereotypes.The supreme courtestablishedthat employers cannot discriminate against workers for failing to conform to stereotypes about their protected characteristics. The same principle must protect Jewish students, staff and faculty from being punished for holding “the wrong” political views about Israel.We support Harvard’s legal challenge to federal overreach, but we reject the university’s characterization of its own censorship as necessary protection for Jewish students. Many of the students facing discipline and marginalization are themselves Jewish. They don’t need protection from their own political views – they need protection from institutions that would force them to choose between their Jewish identity and their political conscience.Universities must stop policing the boundaries of Jewish legitimacy and start respecting Jewish agency. Jews are capable of forming their own views about Israel, Palestine and everything else. We don’t need institutions to tell us what we must believe to be authentically Jewish.As Jewish scholars who have devoted our lives to the study of Jewish issues and ideas that include a commitment to intellectual freedom and human dignity, we call on Harvard and other universities to abandon their efforts to enforce political orthodoxy in Jewish communities. Stop erasing Jewish voices that don’t conform to your preferred narrative. Stop treating criticism of genocide as antisemitism. And start treating Jewish people as complex individuals capable of thinking for themselves.Our Jewish identity is not conditional on support for any government’s policies. Our commitment to justice is not separate from our Jewishness or from Jewish history – it flows directly from it. Universities that claim to protect us while silencing our voices have fundamentally misunderstood both antisemitism and Jewish identity itself.Barry Trachtenberg, Victor Silverman, Atalia Omer, Raz Segaland Rebecca TAlpertThe authors are among 27 Jewish scholars of Jewish studies who filed an amicus brief in Harvard’s federal lawsuitExplore more on these topicsRaceOpinionHarvard UniversityAntisemitismTrump administrationGazaIsraelcommentShareReuse this content"

I left because it left meThu 12 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTShareI’m writing this not as a Democrat or an Independent, but as someone who, for most of her life, was a proudRepublican.I voted for Ronald Reagan and admired his belief that “character counts”. I believed in personal responsibility, faith and country – and the Republican party seemed to reflect those values. I even rooted for George W Bush during the chaotic “hanging chads” recount in 2000, not because I thought he was perfect, but because I believed he would lead with decency and conviction.And for years, I found deep comfort in witnessing moments of unity between former and current presidents – particularly the warm, genuine respect between George W Bush and the Obamas. Different parties. Different ideologies. But a shared belief in democracy. In service. In “we the people”.That spirit is gone now.My allegiance to the Republican party ended when a conman made it into office – and worse, when the party I once revered stood by and let it happen. I watched in disbelief as Republican leaders abandoned principle for power, traded integrity for influence and embraced a man who incites violence, mocks the rule of law and behaves as if he’s above the constitution.Where is the Republican party of Abraham Lincoln? The one that once held the union together and stood for truth, duty and honor?I am the daughter of immigrants who fled Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime – a dictator who rose to power by promising to “make Italy great again”, silencing dissent, spreading propaganda and weaponizing fear. My family knew firsthand how democracies fall – not in an instant, but in small, complicit steps. What I’m witnessing in the US today is hauntingly familiar.I now live in Los Angeles, watching more terror being wielded by a king wannabe – a man who labels disagreement “fake”, who calls critics “un-American”, and who seeks not to govern, but to dominate. And far too many continue to enable him.How far will they go to hold onto control?How many oaths will they break?How many facts will they deny?How many felons will they pardon?Meanwhile, vital programs that support working families, veterans and children are being gutted – all while billionaires pocket tax breaks and corporations secure secret government contracts. These aren’t just policy disputes. They’re part of a coordinated effort to destabilize and divide.And as a Christian, I must name another betrayal: the blasphemous misuse of faith. Cruelty wrapped in scripture. The name of Jesus – who taught compassion, humility and care for the least among us – being used to justify greed, vengeance and lies. That’s not Christianity. That’s not moral. And that’s not the America I believe in.It is not brave to stay silent.It is not patriotic to enable abuse of power.And it is not conservative to abandon the constitution – or our collective conscience – in favor of cult-like loyalty.I didn’t leave the Republican party lightly. I left because it left me. It left behind the values I once believed in. It became unrecognizable – not because of changing platforms, but because of a complete collapse of principle.I’ve waited for moreRepublicansto speak out. To break ranks. To remember who they once were. But the silence has been deafening.This is not just a personal reckoning. It’s a call to conscience – to every citizen who knows, deep down, that something has gone terribly wrong.Because if we truly believe that character counts – if we believe in democracy more than demagogues – then we must speak up. Before we lose the right to speak at all.Even now – especially now – I still believe America can be saved. But not if we keep pretending this is normal.Paolina Milana is a first-generation Sicilian American with journalistic roots and the author of several books, including the memoirs The S Word and Committed, and most recently, The Caregiver ChroniclesExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionRepublicansUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

One might assume that, in the face of Israel’s ongoing starvation and carnage inGaza, states are gathering to mount a decisive, coordinated response to force Israel to cease fire and allow aid into the strip. They are not. Instead, the global community is assembling to revive the tired framework of the two-state solution, with some states perhaps opting for the mostly symbolic gesture of recognizing a Palestinian state.Co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, the convening partiesreaffirmthe idea that the two-state solution is “the only viable path to just, lasting and comprehensive peace”. But France itself hasreportedlybacked away from its plan to recognize a Palestinian state even before the conference has begun. The two-state solution has become little more than a diplomatic theater, an incantation repeated with no intention, even according to its most passionate supporters.As Palestinians are undergoing a genocide inGaza– a characterization now in near consensus among legal and genocide experts – the revival of the two-state language reads like a smokescreen.Last year, amid a crescendo in calls for the two-state solution, Israel approved thelargest land theftin the West Bank in over three decades, further fragmenting the occupied territory and obliterating any meaningful prospect for a sovereign Palestinian state in it. The two-state solution has not only become detached from reality, but for too long steered the discussion away from reality itself.This is not an isolated development. Since the launch of the so-called peace process in the mid-1990s, Israeli settlements, always expanding and always with settler violence, have multiplied at breakneck speed, rather than the opposite. Just last month, Israelapproveda plan for 22 new settlements in the West Bank. These decades of settlement expansion and de facto annexation have effectively gutted any viable basis for the two-state paradigm, even according to its own metrics.Most states cling to the two-state delusion as if it were around the corner, and as if it could finally deliver justice and peace. It won’tThe truth is that the two-state solution has become a delusion – a mantra repeated to mask an entrenched one-state reality. From the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, Israel controls the lives of all Palestinians, without equal rights, without equal representation, and with a system built to preserveJewish supremacy. This system has long constitutedapartheid, nowaffirmedas such by the international court of justice for violating prohibitions on racial segregation and the crime of apartheid.And yet the two-state delusion persists. This mantra continues to prop up the illusion that Israeli occupation is on the brink of ending – if only more states recognize the Palestinian state and if only Palestinians and Israelis would just sit down and talk. But three decades of so-called peace negotiations have yielded nothing but deeper entrenchment of Israeli occupation, systematic land theft and escalating subjugation of Palestinians.Compare the courage of Greta Thunberg’s Gaza aid mission with the inaction and complicity of western governments | Owen JonesRead moreDespite this, most states – including the unelected Palestinian Authority – cling to the two-state delusion as if it were around the corner, and as if it could finally deliver justice and peace. It won’t.It’s time for the international community to confront the simple truth: the two-state solution is not just a fantasy – it has always been a misdiagnosis. If world leaders are serious about resolving the question of Palestine, they must abandon failed frameworks and confront root causes.That begins with the Nakba.Arabic for “catastrophe”, the Nakba refers to the process culminating in 1948, when Zionist militias displaced more than 750,000 Palestinians from their homes and destroyed more than 530 Palestinian villages to establish the state of Israel. But 77 years later, it’s clear the Nakba was not just an event – it was the instantiation of a new structure.Put simply, the Nakba never came to an end.The 1948 Nakba inaugurated a regime that continues to destroy, fragment and reconfigure Palestinian life. It is a process premised on ongoing displacement and dispossession. But that is not all. Today, what may be called the Nakba regime not only sustains the world’s longest refugee crisis since the second world war, but it also stratifies Palestinians into a legal caste system: citizens of Israel, residents of Jerusalem, West Bankers, Gazans and refugees – each subject to a different kind of violence, all designed to obstruct Palestinian self-determination.A reckoning with the Nakba is long overdue. It brings to the surface vital and unresolved legal, moral and historical questions: the status of lands conquered in 1948, the right of return for refugees, the inferior status of Palestinian citizens of Israel and the universal right of Palestinians to self-determination, regardless of where they live or what legal category they fall into.For decades, world governments have dodged these questions in favor of two-state delusions. But progress demands clarity, not just comfortable mantras.In protests, people often chant, “No justice, no peace” – a reminder that these concepts are not synonymous. In Palestine, this slogan speaks to a deeper truth: with or without statehood, the Palestinian cause will endure if its origins are not addressed.Reckoning with the Nakba is a prerequisite for justice, let alone peace. Until states face this basic premise – and act on it – the reality on the ground will continue to defy any high-level diplomatic gathering. The two-state solution will remain what it has always been: a delusion.Rabea Eghbariah is a human rights lawyer and a doctoral candidate at Harvard Law SchoolExplore more on these topicsIsraelOpinionGazaWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

This is a disaster waiting to happenKenneth RothTroops are trained for war, where they can shoot to kill. Asking troops to police is an invitation to brutalityThu 12 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 12 Jun 2025 13.56 EDTShareThis was the moment thatDonald Trumpwas waiting for. A Democratic city, Los Angeles. A Democratic state, California. His most popular issue, immigration. And protests where occasional violence could bespotlightedendlessly on social media. What better time to summon the troops and burnish the president’s tough-guy image.But Trump should be careful what he wishes for. The spectacle of needlesslycalling in4,000 national guard troops and 700 Marines may be red meat for his Maga base, but for most everyone else it is a bright warning sign of Trump’s autocratic tendencies. Rather than quell the protests, he is provoking more, not only in LA but in at leasttwo dozen citiesacross the US. Even if this is not yet the mass mobilization that such repression has sparked inother countries, it is making Trump’s true colors clear.Surrounded by sycophants, living in an echo chamber, Trump seems oblivious to his overreaching. Yes, immigration has been his strong suit, but the issue is more complex than he imagines. Many Americans were disturbed by the large number of immigrants streaming across the southern border, but there is an enormous difference between bolstering border enforcement and raiding immigrant neighborhoods and workplaces.Trump officials want Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents to deport3,000people a day. But with Trump having largelystoppedthe border influx, the easy path to mass deportations – returning people who just arrived – is largely closed. His administration thus haspressuredIce agents to detain undocumented immigrants throughout the country. And because it is time-consuming to target one by one people who have a criminal record or a pending deportation order – the less controversial cases – Ice is turning to random raids on places where undocumented immigrants are assumed to congregate.An estimated14 millionundocumented immigrants live in the US. A 2017 study estimated thattwo-thirdsof such immigrants at the time had been in the US a decade or more. These people typically work jobs, pay taxes and build families, frequently with US-citizen spouses and children. They are Americans in all but legal status. Deporting them rips holes in households and communities.If not for the polarized politics of Washington, these longtime residents would have long ago been given a path to regularize their immigration status. If we decline to prosecute most crimes after five years, in part out of recognition that at some point people should be able to move on with their lives despite what they have done in the past, why not have a similarstatute of limitationsfor deportations?But that is not the world we live in, even if the impulse behind it is broadly shared. Trump’s workplace and community raids are bumping up against public recognition that over time, the equities of immigration shift, that the manner of immigrants’ entry is overcome by the unfairness of disrupting the lives they have built. Even some Republican lawmakers are nowwarningthat Trump has gone too far.It is no wonder that these raids have sparked protests. And Trump has responded in the lawless way that is his wont. There was nothing extraordinary about the initial LA protests that local law enforcement authorities could not havehandledon their own. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, accused Trump of choosing “theatricsover public safety”. The national guard, not to mention the marines, were not needed or wanted. Yet Trump, dying to flex his muscles, mobilized them anyway.Not since 1965 has a US president deployed the national guard without a request from the state’s governor. Then, Lyndon Johnson ordered it toprotectcivil-rights marchers in Alabama from a segregationist governor, George Wallace. Now, in a sad parody of that historic moment, Trump called on it to trample people’s right to protest his cruel immigration policies.As for the marines, US lawprohibitsdeploying them or other troops for policing purposes absent an insurrection. Trump calls the protesters “insurrectionists”, his defense secretary claims a “rebellion”, but those assertions are farcical. Instead, Trump is invoking yet another fake “emergency” to justify handing himself extraordinary powers.The ban on policing by the military is founded on good sense. Troops are trained for war, where they can shoot to kill opposing combatants. But police can use lethal force only as alast resortto meet an imminent lethal threat. Asking troops to police is an invitation to brutality. And Trump goads them on bydehumanizingthe protesters as “animals” and “a foreign enemy”.Having broken the taboo against deploying troops for law enforcement, there is every reason to fear that Trump will continue as protests inevitably spread. The next occasion may be this coming Saturday, when he has scheduled a big military parade in Washington to mark the 250th anniversary of the US army – which also falls on Trump’s 79th birthday. Army officialsworrythat the parade “could make it appear as if the military is celebrating a crackdown on Americans”. That is undoubtedly what Trump wants.To make matters worse, Trump is alreadythreateningpeople who might demonstrate against his military extravaganza: “For those people that want to protest, they’re going to be met with very big force.” Even a peaceful demonstration? What about the first amendment? For Trump in his flout-the-constitution mode, those are irrelevant details.In his first term, the “grown-ups in the room” often were able to restrain Trump’s most dangerous tendencies. This time around, only die-hard loyalists are left. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary,defendedthe military deployment in LA. It is hard to imagine him resisting whatever outrage Trump might next try to commit.Trump’s military posturing is another step in the autocrat’s playbook. Just as he has attacked judges, lawyers, journalists, universities, elected officials and other potential checks on his power, so he is now taking a stab at the public. Protests are an important way to rein in abusive leaders. In many countries, they have proved decisive. Trump’s military threats aim to limit that possibility.Aspirations aside, Trump has not yet managed to build an autocracy. It is important not to exaggerate, because that can demoralize the resistance and obscure how muchdifferenceit is making. But it is essential that we keep in mind not only the wrongfulness of Trump’s conduct in LA but also the broader plan of which it is a part.The danger is not the protesters. The danger is Trump.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch, is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

It wasn’t all good news – JD Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy was also enjoying a surge in popularity and Trump was, of course, still about to be president. But Arendt’s famous 1951 work, The Origins of Totalitarianism,was sellingat 16 times its usual rate, which meant that by the time of the protests centred on the inauguration in January 2017, at least some of those people had read it.Arendt’s view of popular demonstrations was complicated. She wasn’t blind to the way authoritarian rulers use public protest as an excuse for a display of physical power, embodied in the police, which turns the state into an army against its people, altering that relationship. If it’s no longer government by consent, it’s rule by force, and they have the equipment. Yet “how many people here still believe”, she wrote of Germany in the 1930s, quoting the French activist David Rousset, “that a protest has even historic importance? This scepticism is the real masterpiece of the SS. Their great accomplishment. They have corrupted all human solidarity. Here the night has fallen on the future.” It’s an elegantly drawn lose-lose situation: if you lose the will to protest, you have been “morally murdered”, but if you don’t, you play into the tyrant’s hands.But theWomen’s Marches of January 2017didn’t spark police violence. Not a single arrest was made across the 2 million protesters gathered in New York, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle. Commentators wondered whether this was due to the essentially peaceable nature of women and their allies, while academics drew comparisons with the hundreds of arrests made during theFerguson uprisingof 2014 (which, of course, happened under President Obama). “Tanks and rubber bullets versus pussy-hats and high-fives” was how one scholar, Abby Harrington, described the contrast, making the case convincingly that protesters were treated differently on essentially racist grounds. It would be wrong, and actually quite sexist, to say that the women weren’t considered worthy of violent suppression because they didn’t seem serious enough. It would be wrong, too, to say that they made no impact – they were enormous, dispersed across 408 places in the US, rallying bysome estimatesmore than 4 million Americans, and spawning protests in solidarity across seven continents, including one in Antarctica.The demand was very broad and consequently pretty loose, however: protesters wanted “vibrant and diverse communities” recognised as “the strength of our country”. They wanted reproductive rights and tolerance and protection from violence; mutual respect; racial equality; gender equality; workers’ rights – it was a call for decency, to which the leader felt no need to respond, almost by definition, since he is not decent.Trump is waging war against his own citizens in Los Angeles | Judith LevineRead moreThe recentUS protestswere sparked last Friday at about 9am, as border patrol agents massed outside a Home Depot in Paramount, a predominantly Latino area in Los Angeles. An assembly member, José Luis Solache Jr, happened to be driving past, so stopped and posted the scenes, which looked chillingly militaristic even days before the arrival of the national guard. Protesters started to arrive, not in huge numbers but with a vast purpose – to prevent what looked like an immigration raid of people trying to do their jobs. It came on the back of the arrest of a senior union official in the Fashion District, and one fatherarrestedin front of his eight-year-old son. The message, when border guards sweep a workplace or a courtroom where people are doing regular immigration check-ins, is quite plain: this isn’t about deporting hardened criminals.The protestrs’ demand was correlatively plain: don’t arrest our friends, neighbours or colleagues, when they pose no danger to anyone. Since then,700 marines have been deployedto the city, and the number of national guards doubled to 4,000. The situation recalls Arendt’s later work, On Violence, in which she argues that power and violence are actually opposites – the state creates tinderbox situations when it has lost the expectation of public compliance. So if the protests were symbolic, they would be playing into the government’s hands: an abstract resistance creating justification for concrete suppression. But the protests are not symbolic – the alternative to protesting against a raid by border guards is to let the raid go ahead and lose those neighbours.The Russian-American columnist and author M Gessen cites a distinction made in political science between faith, where you believe that justice will simply prevail, and hope, where you observe and participate. Gessen wrote in the New York Times: “You can’t take action without hope, but you also can’t have hope without taking action.” Everyone has a line over which they’d be spurred to action – there’s no one who wouldn’t lie down in front of the government van if their child were kidnapped and put inside it by masked men. So the real art of the autocratic state is not just to weaken protective institutions, but also to foster the conditions of fear and hopelessness ahead of a critical mass finding its hard limit. It’s not clear, yet, whether the repression is a deliberate spectacle in order to create that fear, or whether, conversely, it’s the accidental creation of conditions that demand action.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But instead of clarity, there was more confusionThu 12 Jun 2025 11.04 EDTLast modified on Thu 12 Jun 2025 14.07 EDTShareIt’s almost two months now since the UKsupreme court rulingon what makes a woman in the eyes of the law, which was hailed as a turning point in the battle over transgender rights.Not long enough for wounds to heal, in other words, but long enough surely to hope for a bit more clarity about what this means for everyday life: which toilets trans people can use, what this means for your local women’s running club or gym, how employers can handle sensitive situations at work without outing or humiliating trans staff in front of colleagues and customers. But instead, the waters are getting muddier with every passing week.On Wednesday, Kishwer Falkner, now in the final five months of her term aschair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) watchdog,was grilled bythe women and equalities select committee about the detailed code of practice she is due to submit to ministers next month, translating the ruling into everyday life. Since years of turning this issue into a political football haven’t helped anyone, in an ideal world MPs could now leave it all in the hands of a trusted neutral arbiter, and resist the urge to meddle. Unfortunately, by the end of the hearing it was clear meddling may be urgently required.Within hours of the original supreme court ruling in April that “woman” means “biological woman” for the purpose of the Equality Act, and to the surprise of some lawyers, Lady Falkner had effectively pronounced inclusiveness dead. The EHRC issued interim guidance saying thattrans people should stop using the toilets, changing rooms or NHS wards of their preferred gender – though for trans men who look male enough to be potentially frightening to women in female spaces, that’s not straightforward – and only play on the grassroots sports teams of their birth sex. But is that really what the court intended? The former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption hasalready warnedof the risks of overinterpreting the ruling, arguing that he took it to confirm that single-sex services are entitled to exclude trans people, but not obliged to if they don’t want to. Falkner, however, is sticking to her guns.Suppose you wanted to start a women’s walking group, the Labour MP Rachel Taylorasked her, but you actively wanted to include trans women. Is that allowed? No, was the eventual answer: of course you can let your trans friend join, but then you’d be a mixed not single-sex group, and would have to also accept any man asking to join or risk getting sued. What the biological women in this group actually want – where they’d draw their own boundaries, or what feels right to them – is irrelevant on this reading, a position that may yet end up being tested in the courts.Why is there such a generational divide in views on sex and gender in Britain? | Susanna RustinRead moreHow any of this might be enforced in real life, meanwhile, seems vague at best. Asked how this imaginary walking group should check that every new member was definitely biologically female, Falkner suggested they might make a judgment on sight, but that nobody was going to be walking around with badges on policing it. Similarly on toilets, EHRC chief executive John Kirkpatrick told the committee that employers would need to provide facilities securing women’s privacy and dignity, but that what that meant would vary locally and could be worked out “on the basis of trust and openness and honesty”. With a large dollop of goodwill and forbearance on all sides, you can see how that might wash – except on this issue, there’s vanishingly little of either to be found.The most awkward question, meanwhile, is whether a battle-scarred veteran of the culture wars such as Falkner is now sufficiently trusted to write the peace settlement. Originally appointed by Liz Truss to shake up an organisation seen by the Tories as too close to Stonewall, Falkner survived both attempted mutiny inside her organisation and vicious personal abuse from outside, as she dragged it into line with what would later end up being the supreme court’s settled position: that trans women are not, in law, quite the same as biological women. She wouldn’t be human if she didn’t feel vindicated, and she was visibly emotional when the gender-critical MP Rosie Duffield (who has been through something similar) reminded her about the placards reading “the only good Terf [trans-exclusionary radical feminist] is a dead Terf” or when protesters in 2022dumped 60 bottlesof urine on her office doorstep.But the legacy of those brutal years is that, fairly or unfairly, many trans people no longer trust the EHRC to defend their rights (as it’s mandated to do for all protected groups). Falkner brushed off the committee’s questions about that, saying she didn’t see why people “should become so fearful” when they haven’t lost any rights (technically speaking, the court merely defined what the limits of those rights were). Yet where people do and don’t feel welcome in society is determined by social norms as well as rights, and the former have swung from one extreme to the other in recent years; you don’t have to disagree with the supreme court’s ruling to see how that could be wildly disorienting.Though Falkner suggested it would be “wise for space to be given to the regulator” to handle this – in other words, that parliament should back off – some Labour MPs are rapidly reaching the opposite view.A law that doesn’t work in real-life scenarios is a law that doesn’t work, full stop. On this evidence, parliament should prepare to roll up its sleeves.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We had an ambitious agenda. The distances we had to cover to achieve my red dirt dreams were, to a sane-minded person with two small kids in the back, loopy.And I will admit that, for the majority of this road trip, we were gripped with a palpable, vibrating rage towards each other, about the distance yet to travel and the discomfort of every moment we were in the car.I’d had childhood memories of driving to the outback and I wanted to show wide open spaces to my soft, city-raised kids with their distinct bubble tea orders and sushi train preferences. Time to send them down the (approved for tourists) mines.And we did see everything.

It’s not every town that is dominated by a giant slag heap (non-derogatory) in the middle, and it’s a town as remarkable as I remember as a kid, an astounding distance from Sydney and part of the South Australian time zone. It’s a town of 20,000 people surrounded by hundreds of kilometres of not much but minerals in every direction. It has such a distinctive look – an outback town frozen in time – that the whole place is heritage-listed. It’s beautiful, it’s weird – we had to stop the car in the middle of the road to let emus cross – and should you forget its origins as a mining town, the streets have names such as Oxide and Sulphide.I thought dragging the kids to a mineral museum would be one of the more torturous ways to grapple with what an oxide might be but the kids squealed with joy, thinking they were in real-life Minecraft.One evening we walked through the glowing orange hills at sunset – I’ve never taken so many pictures of rocks. There were hunks of dusty quartz and random rocks (I still need to ask ChatGPT what a mineral is) sparkling as the light hit them, and the hills turned that Albert Namatjira purple at dusk.We saw swollen swamps and the rivers of the far west; we sampled the finest Chinese meals that country Australia has to offer; had the humbling experience of being declined a table at the one restaurant in Lightning Ridge on a Tuesday night; and had our breaths taken away by Aboriginal rock art preserved out the back of Bourke.The trip wasn’t glamorous, nor did I recognise that my bedding setup at home has turned me into the Princess and the Pea, tormented by mattresses that I can’t sink into, or regulation-sized towels. I understand that this is pathetic.I tossed and turned, ready to mentally unravel about bedding, but the next morning, Easter Day, the kids woke up to an admittedly low-energy Easter egg hunt in a $125-a-night side-of-the-highway motel. They experienced what I can only describe as ecstasy, thrilled to ransack our small room looking for the eggs they must have spotted in the boot the day before. What I lacked in bunyip knowledge I was able to make up for with a detailed logistical plan the Easter Bunny had followed to execute this chocolate hunt.I set out to teach the kids about the far reaches of our state, when in fact the kids were the best perspective I could ask for all along.Emily Mulligan is a writer from SydneyExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionChildrenFamilyRural AustraliacommentShareReuse this content"

So going to the football is about more than the football; but we surely knew that anyway? Does the kind of neurophysiological approach take us any further?In the end this study relied on a very small sample – just 17 fans – and a very particular sample at that; the kind of supporter who shows up more than four hours before a game, and is all-in with the choreographed pre-match rituals of flares, fireworks and singing. Even then, the idea that heart rate is the most useful cipher for emotion is too crude a proposition to capture how we experience the game. This research was done at the final of the Minas Gerais state championships, against their eternal local rivals; I wonder what the results would have looked like from one of Bristol Rovers’ tortuous late-season defeats this year? What is the physiological metric for ennui?Viewed from a sociological or anthropological perspective, the idea that football fans would find the arrival of the team bus, marching to the stadium and the kick-off of the to game itself equally intense emotional experiences, and that these should exceed their level of excitement for most of their time actually watching the game, is hardly surprising. Football should be understood as simultaneously a collective ritual, a public theatre of identity and a long-running participatory soap opera, in which the game itself is just one element of the liturgy, the drama and the narrative, and in which the emotional weight of public gathering and collective chanting are equivalent to scoring a goal; and by the looks of the Brazilian research, the gathering and the chanting were more engaging than nearly all of the second half.In any case, there is a lot more than just excitement going on. Watching football, and this is its genius, elicits an enormous diversity of emotions and psychological states; from boredom to despair, from empathy to anger. Heart rates and ECGs are all very well, but until we actually ask football fans what these moments mean, and set their own interpretations in a wider historical and cultural context, we aren’t going to learn very much.Neurophysiology can only take us so far: a similar study of Canadian ice hockey fans found that those with a deeper knowledge of the game found more moments more stressful than the average spectator as they could perceive threat and risk more acutely; but again, the question really is, why should this matter?For more than a century now, watching and following professional football has been a place in which neighbourhood, urban, sub-national and national identities have been expressed and performed. They have been joined by markers of class, gender, ethnicity, religion and language. This has persisted despite the globalisation and commercialisation of the game, changes that have diluted the link between clubs and localities, and seen ever more ingenious ways deployed to control the behaviour of crowds, and to focus them on consumption rather than celebration. Indeed, if the attendance figures at English football, now at a historical high, are anything to go by, these links have intensified.Senegal show England what they are lackingRead moreIn an ever more individualised, atomised and deracinated world, football’s collectivities, and its deeply communitarian cultures, are more valuable then ever with their promise, if not always the reality, of the safe, the secure, the known and the authentic. In an ever more mediated and digital world, and despite our addiction to our phones, it offers the chance to be in the moment, in the presence of others. In a world where the rate and scale of change has multiplied, at precisely the moment that politics has abandoned storytelling for bland technocracy or wild conspiracy theory, football generates comprehensible narratives.And just occasionally, despite everything, it offers up moments of scintillating narrative drama, and of balletic and kinetic energy that are both beautiful and thrilling. Had the research been done at one of this year’s Champions League semi-finals, a match of wildly gyrating fortunes that finished Internazionale 4 Barcelona 3 – and was as good and exciting a game as I have ever seen – we might be drawing very different conclusions.David Goldblatt is the author of The Ball is Round: A Global History of Football and The Game of Our Lives.

He was formerly West Midlands cycling and walking commissioner under mayor Andy StreetThu 12 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 12 Jun 2025 09.07 EDTShareThis week, the UK government announced its plans to fast-track driverless vehicle trials in the UK. One of the key companies involved noted that London presents a significant challenge: “It hasseven timesmore jaywalkers than San Francisco.” There’s more than one problem with that statement – and it encapsulates so much of what’s already going wrong in the adoption of driverless cars.For a start, “jaywalking” isn’t even a thing in the UK. We thankfully have no such concept or offence. Unlike in many US cities, pedestrians here are free to cross the road wherever they see fit. And thank goodness for that.The term “jaywalker” was invented in the 1920s by the US motor industry, and it reveals a lot about its attitude to pedestrians. “Jay” was a derogatory term at the time, meaning bumpkin or idiot. The term “jaywalker” was deliberately crafted to stigmatise people walking in the street and it was part of a wider campaign to shift blame for rising road deaths away from cars and drivers, and on to pedestrians themselves.At the time, streets were shared spaces. Pedestrians, cyclists, children playing, street vendors and public transport all coexisted in the road. The car, when it arrived, disrupted that balance, often violently. Faced with growing public anger at the dangers posed by car drivers, the motor industry fought back. Through lobbying, media manipulation and pressure on lawmakers, it successfully reframed the public street as a space primarily for motor vehicles.The campaign was so successful that jaywalking became a criminal offence in many cities. And in many, it still is today. Jaywalking laws have been shown to disproportionately affect marginalised communities. Data collected under the CaliforniaRacial and Identity Profiling Actrevealed that black people are stopped 4.5 times more often for jaywalking than white people.We’re still living with the consequences of the culture created by a system designed to get pedestrians out of the way. And so, when the CEO of a tech company building self-driving cars uses the word “jaywalker” as an obstacle to be overcome, it’s worthy of attention. It suggests that pedestrians are still a problem to be controlled, predicted or designed out. That human behaviour, rather than dangerous vehicles, is a bug that we need to fix.Unlike human drivers, AVs thrive on strict rules, structured environments and predictable behaviour. The messiness of human movement is challenging and a threat to AV adoption. That’s why “jaywalkers” are flagged as an operational challenge, because autonomous systems can’t easily deal with real people doing ordinary things. The risk is that instead of adapting cars to people, we’ll yet again redesign streets to suit machines.I’m not anti-technology. I’d welcome the chance to use an autonomous vehicle for long trips where public transport isn’t an option. I also find driving, frankly, quite boring and tiring. Done right, self-driving cars could plausibly offer a safer, lower-carbon alternative to private car ownership. But only if they are developed in a way that respects people and cities rather than trying to bend both to meet the limits of the technology.The real danger is that we repeat history. The rollout of driverless vehicles must not be an excuse to further diminish the role of the pedestrian in urban life. The streets of the 20th century were reshaped to suit cars, often at enormous social cost. Entire communities were disrupted. Children lost the ability to roam. People stopped walking. Air pollution soared. A sense of community was lost. Road deaths, particularly among the most vulnerable, became normalised. Today, too many of our streets remain hostile, noisy and dangerous.If we want driverless technology to succeed it must be made to serve society, not the other way round. That means recognising that unpredictability isn’t a bug in the system, but part of what makes cities human. And it means resisting any attempt to reframe basic human behaviour, like crossing the street, as a problem in need of control.While a UK jaywalking law is hopefully far fetched, there’s nothing to prevent the gradual restriction of pedestrian movement through street design. After all, there is a lot of money to be made in prioritising the take-up of autonomous vehicles, so it will be tempting for companies to try to tackle anything that gets in their way.According to the government, autonomous vehicles could create 38,000 jobs and contribute£42bn to the UK economy by 2035. That’s not insignificant. But if they do so by reinforcing a worldview where streets are for machines and people must behave or be punished, we’ve learned nothing.So if the trials ever begin, we have a choice to make. We can allow history to repeat itself, and powerful interests to shape our streets in one way. Or we can take a different path – one where we very clearly remember that cities are places where walking, cycling and public transport should be prioritised. It means ensuring that safety, equity and public space are not traded in the name of innovation.Driverless vehicles may still help us solve some real transport problems. But if they come at the cost of our freedom to walk across the street, then we’re solving the wrong ones.Adam Tranter is the co-host of theStreets Aheadpodcast.

For once, the consensus proved spot-on. The government’s main prioritieswere set out on Wednesdayin a blizzard of Commons announcements from Rachel Reeves, some economically substantive, others more for show. The upshot is that the shape of the British state, as Labour intends it, is now decided until the eve of the next election.There are further crossroads still to come, some of them major, as the years covered by the review unroll. Taxes are likely to rise, probably as soon as the autumn budget, to pay for Reeves’s big ticket boosts on Wednesday for defence, health and housing. Council tax could rise too, with possibly dramatic results. The review’s emphasis on capital spending means current spending could be squeezed again, perhaps heralding pay battles. Nevertheless, Labour has set its course.The administrative purpose of the spending review is to define where money is spent in the British state. But the review is also a defining political and cultural moment. It sets out the choices by which the government will stand or fall, and which aim to locate an electoral sweet spot. That spot, still elusive and distant despite Labour’s Holyroodbyelection winlast week, is one in which, as Reeves put it, a sense of renewal “is felt in people’s everyday lives”. Politically, this speech was a moment of truth for the chancellor herself.Reeves has had a tough first year. Some of the grind she will have expected, some of it not. The year has been dominated by thewinter fuel allowance blunder, which was not hers alone but which she inevitably owns. She has maintained a dogged commitment to her strict fiscal rules – she repeated it in Wednesday’s speech – in spite of new global shocks that might allow her to adapt them. Lacklustre macroeconomic out-turns have not helped; inflation and unemployment have both ticked up. Last summer’sdonations rowand questions about thetruthfulness of her personal CVhave done her no favours either.The bookies were starting to mark down the Cabinet Office minister, Pat McFadden, as a potential successor before Reeves spoke. But Reeves did more than enough in her speech to put the lid on that, at least for now. The muttering against her lacks momentum, since it comes from the usual backbench and union critics. Cabinet support, not least from Starmer himself, is meanwhile described as rock solid. “She is universally popular and respected for being straight,” a minister says. If Starmer removed her he would find himself in trouble too. Even so, when Reeves addressed MPs on Wednesday she had something to prove. If her career was not on the line, her authority was.A well-connected former Whitehall mandarin put it very clearly to me a couple of days ago. “It really is a pivotal time for her,” he said. “It has been a really difficult first year. The inheritance was genuinely bad. But the response has blunted her reputation and her options. The main problem is that the government has still not successfully made clear what kind of Britain it is trying to create. If she is to make that vision clear, then this is the time she absolutely needs to do it.”To understand Reeves, it is important to go back to her record as shadow chancellor. Much of her approach was set out in two speeches. The first, given in Washington DC in May 2023,launched the idea of “securonomics”, which she echoed on Wednesday. The Washington speech was the historically bolder of the two. It amounted to an obituary for the era of borderless economic globalisation. It placed national economic security, both for the country and for the public, at the centre of strategy. The second, Reeves’sMais lecture in March 2024, filled this out more watchfully, because the election was nearing. It emphasised the active role of the state in curbing economic decline and inequality, and emphasising the centrality of growth.The connection between those speeches and the announcements this week is clearly umbilical. The spending review’s main focus – defence, health and levelling up – is rooted in the securonomics approach. Reeves may be one of Labour’s most pragmatic ministers. But this absolutely does not mean that she is merely a technocrat without priorities.Indeed she has described herself, in my hearing, as a social democrat. I am reasonably certain she still would. Her record and her priorities bear it out. So did Wednesday’s speech. Her reform of Treasury policy towards growth outside London is a striking example. Few in the cabinet have such a visceral commitment to social and economic mobility. For her, as she made clear on Wednesday, this is personal.Nevertheless, some of what Reeves said in opposition is simply no longer valid. In particular, the assumption in both speeches that the US shares Britain’s values and is a partner for stability has been comprehensively trashed by Donald Trump. Nor, despite the fact that they were given after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, do Reeves’s speeches from opposition contain any hint of the much higher priority now earmarked for defence spending.True, Reeves is not a chancellor who panders to the parts of the Labour coalition whose priorities are unchanged since the middle of the last century. But, as the railways and energy already show, she is open to different ownership models. She was quick to settle with the unions on pay last summer. And she absolutely does not believe, as Liz Truss did, that the key is for government to get out of the way.Ever since she became chancellor, many have been uncertain about whether Reeves can pitch a vision strongly enough to connect with the wider public. She allowed herself to be dubbed an iron chancellor, but she then got involved in the donations furore. Why does she insist on such a tight policy at the Treasury, some ask? The answer is either that she and Starmer think they have no alternative in the circumstances; or, it’s that they are doing it this way because they actually believe in it.Yesterday’s Commons speech was clearly an attempt to show that it is the former not the latter, and given fewer constraints the outlook might be very different. Reeves said repeatedly that her choices were “Labour choices”. So often was this claim made that it all became a bit insistent, but the purpose was clear. It was to stake out distinct centre-left ideological ground for tackling the hazards of the 2020s. Though some will dispute it, it is the thread that runs through the whole of Reeves’s career. The test now is whether that essentially social democratic approach of growing the economy and then redistributing the proceeds will work in today’s world, especially given the entrenched imbalances of the British economy and the increasing volatility of British politics.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSpending review 2025OpinionRachel ReevesEconomic policycommentShareReuse this content"

No changes to the coalition agreement. The PVV is leaving the coalition,” he posted on X. After 11 months, he waswithdrawing supportfor the Dutch prime minister Dick Schoof’s rightwing cabinet, forcing the Netherlands back to the polls.The decision put an end to Wilders’ far-right Freedom party’s (PVV) first spell in power. Following an unexpected victory in the 2023 elections, the PVV joined a government for the first time in its 18-year history – alongside the conservative-liberal People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), the centrist New Social Contract (NSC), and the agrarian-populist Farmer–Citizen Movement (BBB) –although Wilders’s coalition partners did not let him become prime minister. But the promise to drastically reduce immigration and implement a strict asylum policy proved difficult to deliver due to numerous constitutional and legal restrictions.TheNetherlandsnow faces a familiar question: What is the 61-year-old politician trying to achieve – and how?Looking solely at his political platform, the answer seems relatively clear. With its emphasis on immigration, national identity, sovereignty, more direct democracy and stricter law enforcement, the PVV is a fairly typical radical rightwing populist party. In the European parliament, the PVV belongs to thePatriots for Europe group, alongside Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz and Matteo Salvini’s League.Within that circle, Wilders is one of the most prominent and pioneering ideologues, introducing a highly alarmist caricature of Islam as a totalitarian ideology of conquest. “Walk the streets of westernEuropetoday … and you will often see something resembling a medieval Arab city, full of headscarves and burqas … Mass immigration is rapidly changing our culture and identity. Islam is rising, and I do not want Islam to rise! Islam and freedom are incompatible,” he proclaimed in his keynote speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Budapest in May.In Wilders’ worldview, Israel is the primary defender of western freedom against Islam and therefore deserves unconditional support. “If Jerusalem falls, Athens, Paris, or Amsterdam are next,” he said in the Dutch parliament last week. “Western mothers can sleep peacefully because the mothers of Israeli soldiers lie awake.”Wilders’ anti-Islam crusade soon clashed with the Dutch constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion. To join the coalition, he put his most extreme positions “in the freezer”, as he described it – including a ban on the Qur’an and theclosure of all mosques. Instead, he focused on curbing asylum migration from Muslim countries, repatriating Syrians and supporting Israeli military actions in Gaza and the West Bank (he consistently refers to the latter as Judea and Samaria). Yet, even in these areas, he faced setbacks. Under pressure from parliament and public opinion, the Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, has recently adopted a slightly more critical stance toward the Israeli government – much to Wilders’ displeasure.In justifying the fall of his cabinet, Wilders mainly blamed resistance from his coalition partners, the bureaucracy, the courts and the media. But the truth is, he also has himself to blame. Nearly 20 years after its launch in February 2006, the PVV is still hardly a political party in the conventional sense. Exploiting a loophole in Dutch electoral law, Wilders chose not to allow any formal members into his party. As a result, neither PVV ministers nor parliamentarians are actual members of the party. Ultimately, he has failed to build and lead a professional political organisation that is capable of governing.Wilders adopted his party’s unusual structure partly out of fear of attracting opportunists and troublemakers. But according to many observers, he is also a deeply suspicious and solitary figure by nature, someone who prefers total control and avoids consultation. His permanent security detail, a result of a fatwa, has likely reinforced these traits and made it even harder to establish a party structure. “If I wanted to speak to a candidate, it had to happen in a hidden hotel, on the sixth floor, with six policemen in front of my bedroom door,”he once claimedin an interview.As a result, the PVV remains entirely dependent on Wilders’ personal political instincts. While parties such as National Rally, League and Fidesz have large organisations with tens of thousands of members, local chapters, professional offices and well-funded campaign machines, the PVV is little more than Wilders’ small, tightly controlled entourage.Why Geert Wilders’ plan to become Netherlands PM may well backfireRead moreWhen he wants to change direction, there is no party congress or critical internal faction he has to convince. This is an undeniable advantage in today’s volatile political landscape, but its cost is high. First, the PVV remains poor. In the Netherlands, only parties with more than 1,000 members qualify for state subsidies. The impact of this underfunding is evident in its amateurish election campaigns, low-quality videos, clumsy communication and a lack of skilled personnel. Second, the party operates in near total opacity. Its hierarchy, finances and candidate selection process are a mystery not only to outsiders – politicians, journalists, lobbyists – but even to its own supporters. As a result, many potential candidates and volunteers shy away. Who is willing to risk their reputation for a career in such a controversial and opaque organisation? Who dares to become a minister or junior minister for a party that revolves entirely around the unpredictable whims of one man?When Wilders was required to nominate ministers, he discovered he had no capable candidates with administrative experience, an understanding of the Dutch political system or knowledge of the constitution. He had never invested in training his own people or building a network of future administrators. In desperation, he appointed a few loyal early followers such as Marjolein Faber as minister for asylum and immigration; she subsequently got herself embroiled in a scandal forrefusing to sign offon royal honours for individuals who volunteered to help asylum seekers and falsely stating that Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyywas not democratically elected(she retracted her words). Other PVV ministers also stood out mainly because of their blunders and incompetence. After the cabinet’s collapse, his party’s ministers seemed almost relieved when speaking to the press. They had been cast in roles they couldn’t fulfil and never truly wanted.Wilders claims he wants to become prime minister after the next elections. But does he truly mean it? There is little evidence that he is taking the country’s governance more seriously. After the failed experiment of the past months, future coalition partners will also take this aspect into account –this week the VVD ruled out entering another coalition this with this “unbelievably untrustworthy partner”. It seems that Wilders, the solitary ideologue, is really more interested in opposition, where the burdens of responsibility are far lighter.Koen Vossen is a political historian and the author of The Power of Populism: Geert Wilders and the Party for Freedom in the NetherlandsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The Albanese government is no different: it is now deeply invested inAukus, with no other solution to Australia’s need for an effective submarine. While it may be a bit early to call for the undertaker there is no doubt that the Aukus patient is in serious trouble.Aukus had a less than immaculate conception. It was conceived in secrecy and born in haste, a tribute to political opportunism and a travesty of disciplined planning. The enthusiasm of theatrical announcements notwithstanding, it was in trouble from the beginning. The US Navy had serious doubts about both the ability of US shipbuilders to deliver submarines in any workable timeframe and the ability of the Royal Australian Navy to integrate and operate them. That was not a question of trust but of capacity – on both sides.And, of course, experienced and well-informed Australian defence planners rang the warning bells from the beginning.Australian government downplays ‘natural’ decision by Pentagon to review Aukus defence pactRead moreNow reality has caught up with us. The Pentagon has announced a review of the Aukus agreement to ensure that it meets President Donald Trump’s “America First” policy. The US submarine construction program is in trouble. Australia’sUS$500m contributionto its submarine building industry will have no impact on the production rate, which needs to double if our ambitions are to be met. There’s no money back offer here.But injury is sure to follow insult. The US review will be led by Elbridge Colby, the undersecretary of defense. He is a clever Trump acolyte who signalled his scepticism well before Trump won the presidency. The passage of Trump’s “big beautiful bill” through the Congress, and the looming prospect of a massive debt blowout, can only have reinforced his doubts.These doubts are well grounded. In several reports dealing with Aukus, the Congressional Research Service identified critical bottlenecks in the US production line for both the Virginia-class and the new Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines. And it is just as concerned about Australia’s ability to absorb the new technologies. It should be.The defense secretary Pete Hegseth’s can-rattlingat the Shangri-La conferencein Singapore further diminished Aukus’s chances. Hegseth told the defence minister, Richard Marles, that Australia needed to up its defence spending target to 3.5% of GDP. Of course, there was no suggestion on how the money should be spent. Spending for its own sake fits the bill, which is more or less what Aukus has been about from the beginning.Quite properly, the prime minister’s response was textbook: Australia will decide on its defence spending for itself. And perhaps now is the time for Albanese to institute a parliamentary inquiry into Aukus.So, where does all of this leave the pact? Far from being in the deep oceans, it is further up the proverbial creek. The best that Australia might have hoped for was the homeporting of a few US Virginia-class submarines on rotation at Fremantle in Western Australia, stretching out over the next several decades. Even that does not really meet US needs for forward positioning of attack submarines in the northern Pacific – the entire reason, it would seem, for the former prime minister Scott Morrison’s precipitate and unadvised decision in the first place.From the beginning, the Labor team has been reluctant to call the ambulance or the undertaker. The Albanese government has no other submarine plan – Aukus is it. Or at least, Aukus was it. The Elbridge review is a circuit breaker. It forces the Albanese government to address Australia’s submarine needs and capabilities in a considered and disciplined way for the first time in more than 20 years.Thinking about the last things encourages some of us to think about resurrection and the next life. Just as Australia could marshal the engineering and technological skills to plan and build the Collins-class submarines, so it can do it again. The Americans have effectively made the decision for us. It’s time for plan A – where “A” is Australia, not Aukus. We have to get on with it – now.Allan Behm is a special adviser at the Australia Institute in CanberraExplore more on these topicsAukusOpinionAustralian foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

The federal government hasreleased emission figures for 2024, which were broadly similar.The Albanese governmentclaims it is on trackfor emission reduction of 42.6% by 2030 from 2005 levels – close to the national 43% target. While this is partly the result of the renewables rollout, it’s mostly due to the increase in the projected carbon stored in the land by 2030, such as in soils and vegetation. Without the increase in projected 2030 land sequestration in the past three years, Australia would only record a 34.9% emission reduction.Excluding the land and electricity sectors, emissions from all other economic sectors are projected to be 4.5% above 2005 levels in 2030.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterAustralia’s 43% target is not aligned with the Paris agreement, which aims to keep global warming to no more than 1.5C. It should be at least 59%. The government also has yet to announce its 2035 emissions reduction target, well behind the February deadline. This needs to be at least 72% below 2005 levels.Our renewables target is deficientThe government’s 82% renewable energy target for the power sector by 2030 doesn’t cover off-grid generation, which mostly occurs in mining regions of Western Australia where connecting to the main grid is not feasible.These account for about 10%of Australia’s electricity generation. So the government’s target translates to only a 77% renewable power grid nationwide by 2030. And that’s assuming the target is met; the Climate Change Authorityhas warned that the renewables rollout must be acceleratedto make that happen.Barriers to renewable energy development includeslow planning and environmental approval processes, grid bottlenecks, tighter markets for equipment and labour, a lack of community acceptance and state rollbacks of renewable energy targets or projects. Overcoming these problems is crucial and provide a strong case for the federal government legislating Australia’s renewable energy targets for 2030 and beyond. This would ensure it becomes a national standard and provides certainty for investors.But the 2030 target is just one milestone on the way to 100% renewable electricity system by the late 2030s, andthis will requirenational coordination.The safeguard mechanism is not workingLabor has tightened its flagship policy to curb emissions from industry’s biggest polluters: the safeguard mechanism. Emissions from companies captured by the policyaccount for about 31%of Australia’s total emissionsThe policy sets declining limits for how much facilities can emit with “net” emissions to decline to 100 MtCO2e by 2030, or 28.1% below 2023 levels, allowing companies to buy carbon offsets rather than make real emission reductions.Offsets arenot equivalentto fossil fuel CO2 reductions and often do not represent real and permanent emissions reduction, asEnergy Australiawas forced to admit.Allowing a company to buy carbon offsets means it does not change its on-site operations to be less polluting, delaying the structural change needed across high-emitting sectors to decarbonisewhich is criticalif climate goals are to be met.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This includes Woodside’s North West Shelf gas extension, which Labor has approved to operate until 2070 – decades beyond the point when Australia is meant to have reached net zero emissions.The transport sector is moving too slowlyAustralia’s transport sector is set to become the country’s greatest source of emissions by 2030.The national fuel efficiency standard introduced by Labor last term applies to new light vehicles. The standard should be extended to heavy vehicles to encourage a transition to electrification. Heavy vehicles accounted for 22% of Australia’s transport emissions last year and are expected to increase.Australia’s electric vehicle uptake remains slow compared with other countries. The growth of Australia’s fast-charging network is not keeping pace with electric vehicle sales, which could limit uptake further.It’s clear Australia must lift its domestic game to align with anything close to the Paris agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C.Neither glib lines nor warm thoughts can hide the cynicism of Labor’s North West Shelf decision | Clear AirRead moreThat would still leave the problem of emissions flowing from our fossil fuel exports, which, together with our domestic emissions, are responsible for about 4.5% of the global total.After the first assessment of global action, governments agreed at COP28 in Dubai that the world needs to “transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems to achieve net zero”, a callstrongly supported by Bowen. But our analysis shows Australia’s fossil fuel exports are projected to remain close to recent levels through the next decade in official projections.In the lead-up to the decision on hosting rights for the COP31 talks, Australia has much work to do to lift its climate game and ensure its policies withstand global scrutiny.Bill Hare, a physicist and climate scientist, is the chief executive of Climate AnalyticsExplore more on these topicsEnergyOpinionClimate crisisFossil fuelsGlobal climate talksCop31Greenhouse gas emissionsRenewable energycommentShareReuse this content"

They have this childlike quality. These days we’d probably say he’s on the spectrum – there’s a sort of Asperger’s type innocence. He makes the lyrics and the melody speak. It’s so welcoming and without edge; it’s not part of a cynical adult world.I knew some of the big songs – Good Vibrations and so on – but it wasn’t until a mate put me on to Pet Sounds that the penny really dropped. What he was doing in the studio is mind-boggling given the limited technology that he had at his disposal. His ear was just stellar, so he was basically remixing the songs while he was making them. He gives you so many different textures and could shape chord structures in very sophisticated, scholarly, almost classical ways, yet you never lose the feeling. The effortless way that something like God Only Knows unfolds is remarkable to me: it’s just straight from the heart and still sounds so fresh and joyful.I can’t think of another band that created a place as vividly as the Beach Boys. It’s like they asked for our idea of California – sunshine, convertibles, milkshakes, movies – and brought it to us. But Brian didn’t surf; he wasn’t photogenic. He didn’t have the vibe, the looks … he was very awkward and looked like someone living in another world. And so how he articulated the world around him sounded otherworldly.View image in fullscreen‘His ear was just stellar’ … Brian Wilson circa 1964.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesWhen I saw him at the Royal Festival Hall with the Wondermints as his band, doing Pet Sounds for the first time, he was a presence on stage, like Jesus with his disciples. They sounded so beautiful, like Gershwin or something. It was so unusual to hear oboes and clarinets in pop, but it wasn’t a novelty. They never felt stuck on; they were essential.He would compose whole songs in his head and when he heard something, he didn’t miss. One of my particular favourites from Pet Sounds is Caroline, No, which starts with a bit of percussion that’s not even a wood block: he’d imagine these weird sounds and try everything possible to bring them to reality. And then all the noises at the end: the train, the barking dogs. My dog barks back at it when it plays.You can hear him in everything from Pink Floyd to Radiohead to something like The Look of Love by ABC, which is definitely derived from Brian’s amazing mind. He was famously deaf in one ear, and Bob Dylan said they should put the other ear in the Smithsonian.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Washington Post/Getty ImagesJessica Pratt, singer-songwriterI Just Wasn’t Made for These Times is one of my favourites. There’s a yearning, searching, wandering feeling … like a teenage alien come to earth. There are all these lyrics on Pet Sounds, and in this song, about feeling out of place, going to look for something and not finding it, realising that what you sought was wrong, that no one’s reciprocating, etc. A sort of juvenile, detached disappointment; there’s this mentality of “Well, I guess I’ll go kick rocks.”But it isn’t artifice, and the music simultaneously feels as if it’s imbued with God’s infinite wisdom. When the line “sometimes I feel very sad” comes in, you nearly wince in sympathy, the way you can’t help but mirror the expression of a crying infant. You feel it in your chest. It’s a totally unique and uncanny juxtaposition – naivety meets profundity, his own spiritual blueprint.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Chiaki Nozu/WireImageSimon Neil, Biffy Clyro frontmanWhen we started, I said I wanted our band to sound like Metallica meets the Beach Boys – that was before I realised quite how sophisticated the Beach Boys were. From that point on, they’re one of the few bands that have been a constant with me in my songwriting. If ever I am at a dead end, I’ll go and listen to a Beach Boys song. It’s a book of knowledge, a religious text. Brian is a never-ending well of inspiration because of the evolution and consistency of his songwriting – he never just hit a groove, he was always finding new ways to say things.Our first dance was to God Only Knows and I got the lyrics tattooed on my chestThe beauty of Brian Wilson’s songwriting is the simplicity of the complexity. A song can sound like a nursery rhyme, and when you start to actually play it on a guitar, it becomes a symphony from God. I think Wilson is a conduit for something from a different ether. His real life was in his songs – it felt like that was the world he lived in, and then he came to visit us the rest of the time. He’s not necessarily coming from the blues, he’s coming from jazz, Gershwin, everything – it was a re-education for me.There’s a reason why you don’t walk into bars every Friday night and bands are doing Beach Boys songs, because they are so hard to play! But my wife and I, our first dance was to God Only Knows and I got the lyrics tattooed on my chest – so Biffy Clyro did a cover of it for MTV Unplugged. That was a way of trying to thank Brian Wilson. When I was trying to figure out how to do it on acoustic guitar, it made me feel like a child again, learning what a songwas. I love the simplicity of the sentiments of his song – really personal and basic, hidden behind these complex musical structures, and that shows how Brian’s mind worked: in one way he was the most advanced and mature artist, and in another he had the brain of a child.View image in fullscreenSurf’s up … the Beach Boys in 1962.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesI was lucky enough to meet him in 2012, when the band were in London. I got to sit with the entire Beach Boys and speak to Brian Wilson about Sunflower, about Holland, asking him about records – to pick his brain was one of the most important moments of my life. He was a bit of a poor soul; he wasn’t at his physical and mental best. But to sit and look in the eyes of someone I genuinely feel was touched by God – that then gave me the strength to cover God Only Knows. I felt changed after having met him.When I asked him about Holland and Sunflower he really brightened up, talked about how he had a great time out there [recording those albums]. And then the guy I was with made me show him my God Only Knows tattoo – I think that freaked him out a bit. All the Beach Boys were there, too, and to see that connection and love and protection they had for Brian even in that small hotel suite … I think that’s also why I ended up doing God Only Knows, because those guys were a band from when they were 14 or 15, and it was beautiful to see that connection. Also, Brian was a big guy – that’s something people don’t necessarily know about him, he was a bear, a linebacker. Even in his 70s he could have picked me up and squeezed me like a grape.Ben and James in our band, singing together as brothers and twins – there’s a magic when siblings and twins sing together, and that all came from the Beach Boys. Even that sense of family, of growing together, or being with each other through the toughest of times, it’s at all levels the Beach Boys influence. And also, the story of Smile has inspired thousands of musicians – trying to make this perfect thing, and you’re not sure you’ve got there, and the people around you don’t share your vision, so your scaffolding to get there is removed. But the fact that he got back to finish that with Van Dyke Parks, it was just meant to be. That was a real big moment for all of us.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rune Hellestad/Corbis/Getty ImagesRay Davies, the KinksWe worked with the Beach Boys on several occasions at a time when the British Invasion was in full swing – they flew the flag for American surf music and influenced many of the British bands. Brian’s songs were more like hymns, and his body of work is up there with the greatest American composers. My condolences to his family and all who loved him.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Adam Berry/RedfernsGraham Nash, the Hollies; Crosby, Stills, Nash & YoungWhen I was in the Hollies we played with the Beach Boys in – I think – Birmingham, Alabama in 1966 or early 67. We realised what an incredible band they were and how much fun they were having. In the Hollies we did three-part harmonies. They had at least four, maybe five voices: even Dennis [Wilson] at the back on the drums would sing.The vocal harmonies are just unbelievable on Pet Sounds, particularly a song like Caroline, No. As I listened more, I realised that Brian thought every album should be a journey, an idea that influenced the Beatles with Revolver and certainly with Sgt Pepper’s, because that’s again a complete journey from start to finish. I think the record company put Sloop John B on Pet Sounds because they wanted a pop single. It’s a great song, but to me it doesn’t fit musically with the rest of the journey. That album changed the way many musicians thought about what music could do: it wasn’t a fast pop song, two and a half minutes right before the news. Pet Sounds changed a lot of people’s thinking, and I’ll be for ever grateful to Brian.I think the transcendental beauty in his music was born within him in the same way it was born within Bach or Mozart, just in a different era. When Brian was writing pop music he was incredibly successful, but he was always thinking that music could be pushed further and further into the future, which is why it still sounds as fresh as a daisy.We must remember that for God Only Knows Brian wrote the music, but [Wilson’s friend] Tony Asher wrote the lyrics. It was a brilliant combination of music and words. For me, along with the Beatles’ A Day in the Life, it’s the greatest song ever written.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rick Kern/Getty ImagesJim James, My Morning Jacket frontmanOne of the biggest things about Brian Wilson was his mystery. For me, at least, when you looked at him it was like trying to understand the force behind nature or creation itself. He was so interesting because often when he spoke he never knew very clearly what he was thinking, but when he sang and wrote music, you understood profoundly and it hit you like the wind. I love the fact that he couldn’t offer in words or interviews what it was that we all felt was so magical about him, but his music came through so insanely powerfully.Every artist longs to have their Pet Sounds – a moment that’s so important – and I’ve listened, trying to understand. What did he do? I’ve watched all the documentaries, read all the books and I know everything there is know about him, but I still can’t understand. It’s like staring at the stars at night and wondering how the universe works. Music – the creative ideas and inspiration – would just arrive in his head from wherever and then he had the technical expertise to execute these things.Listen to Right Where I Belong, from the soundtrack to Long Promised Road.When I went to be interviewed for the documentary [2021’sLong Promised Road], the people making the film asked if I would be interested in trying to write a song with Brian. Of course I was. They gave me this cassette demo of him at the piano. There were no lyrics, but the playing and melody were really beautiful. I took that home and I wasn’t coming up with much, because I wanted it to be about him, not me. Then it hit me: I should just set some of the things he’s said in interviews to music. I wrote the choruses for Right Where I Belong and then most of the lyrical information came directly from things he’d said in interviews, occasionally losing a word to work rhythmically, or whatever. Sometimes he’d look over at me and go: “Wait. I remember saying these things!” I sang a guide vocal of what I imagined it might sound like and Brian sang along with that, but then just came at it.We all know the story of what he went through with mental illness and so on, but he conquered his challenges in so many ways and so many times. I’m sure it challenged him to the day he died, but simultaneously he had a beautiful family and a beautiful, peaceful life and a lot of people that loved him. He lived to a nice old age and his story is really one of triumph.It was one of the great honours just being in the room with him. Most of the time we were in the studio, he wasn’t feeling very well or was quite withdrawn. But the moment we hit record and he started singing, his entire being exploded through the room. The joy shot out of his voice and it was like seeing him spring to life through music. I think it was one of the last vocals he ever did, but it had so much power. It was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Peter GannushkinWendy Eisenberg, singer-songwriterSome of my earliest musical memories are of my dad covering In My Room to me as a lullaby. He was a huge Brian Wilson fan and would tell me all these cute bits of trivia about early Beach Boys, like release dates, when I was growing up. So he was just kind of elemental. And then my dad was like: here’s this foundational record, Pet Sounds, and you should listen to it. There was such a crunchy, insane, dense texture that was faithful to the songs in a way that was completely surprising – at that point, so many of the songs I had heard were arranged for maximum listenability on the radio.I love him so much that trying to analyse his music seems almost sacrilegious. But the reason that Brian Wilson is so important to me, and why I was so devastated to hear of his passing, is that he’s touched so many people without compromising the idiosyncrasies of how he hears music, and production specifically. The narrative that I was receiving growing up, and now, was that when you play music that’s complex, it alienates people. It would make me feel that my existence as a creative person was inherently alienating. It sometimes seems like, if you’re writing a song, it has to be geared towards some ideal listener who needs to be moved by it. But the secret to a good hook or anything memorable is that you’resurprised. And Brian Wilson always knew that: no matter how honest the song is, the surprises were the things that you’d remember. And it seems like he got that from living his really hard life.There’s a real temptation, when diagnosing Brian Wilson’s musical complexity, to say that he could have been a great composer in classical music. But the other amazing thing about him – for better and for worse, because of the intensity of his sensitivity – is that it seems like he justwaswhere he was, all the time. So he was in California at this time, trying to live a life in music. His compositional gifts, if he were in 1571, would have sounded entirely different. He documents his world. And his world as a writer is complex, and it has a lot of heart, and it’s been through a lot, and it’s towards a childlike honesty and ethos and sensitivity.‘He wants it to be a moment of eternal purgatory or heaven’ … listen to Surf’s Up.I think about how his compositions just evolved and evolved and evolved, and became his philosophy. Like these infinite loops at the end of Surf’s Up, of vocal melodies – it’s like he wants it to be a moment of eternal purgatory or heaven. Like he doesn’t want the song to end. And he does that through an aural illusion. The lyrics there are “a child is the father of the man”, done in an Escher-type strange loop – I think he’s trying to convey the train of how we learn from each other. What I love about him is that this progression of craft is always in service of this really simple, elemental emotion, and if you get close to it, it is so complex – it contains entire worlds.When I’m writing, I try not to judge the parts of the songs that come out conventional, and I try not to judge the songs that come out extremely complex. It’s not: I want a song todosomething. It’s: I want the song that’s coming out of me to be open and vulnerable and to touch me, and also younger me and also future me. I want to be honest. And I think that’s from hearing him and how faithful he was to how the song comes out, line by line.I keep turning to Surf’s Up, because I can’t believe it’s real – there’s a completeness to the idea that comes out when that song is done. And probably when he’s doing it, he’s having so much fun ripping from chord change to chord change or from section to section. It seems like there’s a place for him; the song is the room that he can be comfortable in and then just leap around and be like: oh my God, I’m here! And when I’m writing a song that I really love, I feel that sense of infinite possibility, and that bonds me to him. It’s like: here you are in this world that’s demanding certain things from you that freak you out or that physically harm you. But then, within this world, is a microcosm of a world that’s far, far freer. Which is what you need inthisworld, but it’s far, far harder to come by here.Explore more on these topicsBrian WilsonPop and rockDavid GrayRay DaviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the force of Céline Sciamma’s lesbian love story about an artist and her unwitting sitter on a remote island in 18th-century Brittany is undeniable. As is the integrity of its central dynamic, stripped of power imbalances, hierarchies – and men.24.Diamantino(2018)A low-budget, high-kitsch, torn-from-the-headlines football fantasy about a Ronaldo-esque football star who hallucinates giant pekingese puppies frolicking on the pitch whenever he scores. Throw in a cross-dressing refugee subplot, lesbian spies and a far-right cloning conspiracy and you have a goofy and irrepressible testament to intersectionality.23.We’re All Going to the World’s Fair(2021)Jane Schoenbrun became an A24 sensation with I Saw the TV Glow in 2024, but it is her previous film, a bare-bones chiller about an online horror game, that remains her most original work. Less instantly legible as a trans allegory than her follow-up, perhaps, but all the more disquieting for that.Watch a trailer for Bruce LaBruce’s The Visitor.22. The Visitor (2024)Veteran Canadian provocateur Bruce LaBruce turns Pasolini’s 1968 Theorem into a radical rage against anti-immigrant rhetoric. A gooey Black alien washes up on the banks of the Thames ready to seduce the five members of a London bourgeois household from patriarch to maid. The sex scenes aren’t simulated. Let’s pray the coprophagy is.21. Stud Life (2012)The marketing campaign pitched director Campbell X’s punchy debut as a love story about a butch stud and her femme sex-worker girlfriend, but it is more complicated and original than that: a rallying cry for queer solidarity, a hymn to the friendship between lesbians and gay men, and a celebration of Black British queerness with walk-ons from David McAlmont, Dean Atta, Jay Bernard and Topher Campbell.20.Appropriate Behaviour(2014)Queer cinema finally got its Annie Hall with co-writer, director and star Desiree Akhavan’s wise and hilarious debut. She plays a bisexual “boner-killer” looking back on a failed lesbian relationship. Akhavan skewers everything from the banter at a Persian wedding and the competitive horror of bumping into your ex when you are both out on the arm of your latest squeeze to the very Brooklyn problem of who gets first dibs on attending a discussion group about anti-LGBTQ+ bias in the legal system.View image in fullscreenBrutally frank … Keep the Lights On.Photograph: Cinematic/Alamy19.Keep the Lights On(2012)Ira Sachs used his own doomed real-life romance with the literary agent Bill Clegg as the basis for this brutally frank portrait of compulsion, addiction and heartbreak. An early sex scene, one of the most unvarnished in cinema history, proves that, sometimes, shit happens.18.Crossing(2024)A buddy movie with three heroes: a young Jack-the-lad, a trans lawyer working for the NGO Pink Life and a retired teacher scouring Istanbul’s queer neighbourhoods searching for her trans niece. Levan Akin’s richly compassionate drama uses long-lens cinematography and neorealist techniques to show both the vitality and loneliness of city life.View image in fullscreenDeadpan sensibility … a scene from Lyle Kash’s Death and Bowling.Photograph: T4T Productions17. Death and Bowling (2021)Lyle Kash’s vivid and original debut cocks a snook at the idea that trans film-makers are duty bound to represent the trans experience. When the captain of a lesbian bowling team takes her own life, the ensuing melodramatic beats – the reading of the will, the discovery of a treasure map, the emergence of a long-lost son – collide with a queer aesthetic (Almodóvar,John Waters), Kash’s deadpan sensibility and one of the largest majority trans and non-binary casts in film history.16.Beauty(2011)Anyone craving “queer joy” should steer clear of Oliver Hermanus’s masterful character study of a self-loathing, closeted white Afrikaner obsessed with a handsome young law student. In its single-minded intensity and mounting horror, it’s nothing short of a gay, South African Taxi Driver.15. So Pretty (2019)Not merely a film that knows it’s a film but an adaptation that knows it’s an adaptation, Jessica Dunn Rovinelli’s cool, confident second feature (after her semi-documentary Empathy) concerns a queer Brooklyn house-share in which the polyamorous inhabitants eat, sleep, protest, have sex, make art – and work on a film of Ronald M Schernikau’s utopian novel So Schön. Which, in turn, is exactly what So Pretty is.View image in fullscreenPsychological thriller … a still from O Fantasma by João Pedro Rodrigues.Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy14. O Fantasma (2000)João Pedro Rodrigues has been the by-appointment purveyor of transgressive cinematic phantasmagorias for more than two decades. For confrontational charge and visual eloquence, his debut – a fetishistic psychological thriller about a horny rubbish collector prowling Lisbon for sex in a Latex bodysuit – takes the cake.13.Castration Movie Part One(2024)An “incel”, a trans sex worker and a Terf … No, not the start of a bad-taste gag but just some of the characters in Louise Weard’s highly charged, handheld epic of Vancouver life in the margins. Part One clocks in at four-and-a-half hours, and there are at least another eight hours still to come. Maybe the finished article will turn out to be the greatest queer work of our time – if such binary categorisations weren’t, like, totally normie.View image in fullscreenGasp-inducing … Sebastián Silva’s Rotting in the Sun.12.Rotting in the Sun(2023)In what resembles a sexually-explicit, ketamine-dazed movie-length episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, writer-director Sebastián Silva plays himself as a prissy grouch harassed during a gay beach getaway by comic and social media star Jordan Firstman – a hyperactive attention-seeker with all the social graces of Donkey from Shrek. The film then takes a macabre and gasp-inducing turn. Abrasive and outrageous.11.Weekend(2011)All of Us Strangers merits a place on this list, too. But it is Andrew Haigh’s breakthrough second film – about a Nottingham one-night-stand morphing into a life-changing two-day romance – which remains his most piercing work. Apparently conventional in structure, it actually takes some bold liberties, not least in the way one of the main characters rails against the ubiquity of heterosexual narratives. It’s as if he is willing Weekend into existence before our very eyes.10. Carol (2015)When unhappily married mother Cate Blanchett misplaces her gloves in the department store in early-1950s New York where shop assistant Rooney Mara works, it doubles as the throwing down of a gauntlet, and a provocation to the audience: do you dare reach for the life you want? Adapted from Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel The Price of Salt,Carolisn’t quite Todd Haynes’s masterpiece (that would be Safe, from 1995) but it’s as near as dammit. Carter Burwell’s score has a snake-charmer’s seductiveness, while Ed Lachman’s 16mm cinematography frames the lovers behind glass, smoke and other obstacles, making the viewing experience as tantalising as hearing a tender ballad on a tin-pot transistor radio.View image in fullscreenAutobiographical … Pariah, directed by Dee Rees.9.Pariah(2011)“You need to pop that damn cherry, yo!” Coming-out movies are 10 a penny but Dee Rees’s autobiographical debut, extended from her own 2007 short, is scorchingly fresh. As the teenager tentatively emerging from the closet and into New York’s lesbian club scene, the stunning Adepero Oduye nails both the breathless excitement and the cringe of being queer and horny in a world that wasn’t built for you. “They didn’t have brown?” she says, aghast at the mismatch between her own skin and the colour of the strap-on acquired for her by a well-meaning friend.8.Femme(2023)“We’re all born naked and the rest is drag,” sang RuPaul. Sam H Freeman and Ng Choon Ping’s challenging thriller, stymied and disowned by the queer joy mafia but adored by John Waters, Bret Easton Ellis and Bruce LaBruce, makes that point brilliantly. Weeks after being the victim of a homophobic attack, drag queen Jules (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) spots his attacker (George MacKay) in a gay sauna, and contrives a revenge plan that plunges them both into the shark-infested waters of one another’s worlds.Watch a trailer for The Duke of Burgundy.7.The Duke of Burgundy(2014)Peter Strickland’s third feature, a rapturous and devilishly funny study of a lesbian sub/dom relationship, asks how transgressive or nonconformist appetites survive in everyday life. Sidse Babbett Knudsen is the seemingly imperious dom who would sometimes rather snuggle up in her PJs than wield the whip hand over her sub partner (Chiara D’Anna). Dripping with sensuality (there is even a “Perfume by …” credit in the opening title sequence), the specifics in Strickland’s portrait of “compromise, consent and coercion” are magically universal, applicable to any relationship.6.The People’s Joker(2022)Cinema is safe – or rather, dazzlingly dangerous – in the hands of Vera Drew. Her re-imagining of Joker as a trans coming-out fable is the boldest queer debut since Superstar, Todd Haynes’s Barbie-doll biopic of Karen Carpenter. Drew shot her film in five days then spent several years collaborating with umpteen animators and effects artists on different continents to create its dense visual texture. She stars as the wannabe Gotham City comic who launches a comedy club with The Penguin, falls for fellow trans standup Mr J (modelled on Jared Leto’s Joker from Suicide Squad) and finally confronts Batman, billionaire groomer of teenage boys.5.End of the Century(2019)What if the stranger you hooked up with on a brief Barcelona jaunt turned out to be a figure from your distant past? With a daring use of flashback and a plangent yet playful mood, Lucio Castro’s tale of two men across two decades in one city combines the coolness of Antonioni with the ache of Before Sunrise. The dance/make-out scene to Space Age Love Song by A Flock of Seagulls is euphoric, the film’s ending breathtakingly profound.View image in fullscreenSpellbinding … Tsai Ming-liang’s Goodbye, Dragon Inn.Photograph: Lin Meng Shan4.Goodbye, Dragon Inn(2003)Any of Tsai Ming-liang’s 21st-century films could have ended up on this rundown. But Goodbye, Dragon Inn is a singularly spellbinding achievement, set on the last day of business at a cavernous Taipei picture palace. The camera is alert to each twitch and fidget of the clientele who move from seat to seat like chess pieces in the sparsely populated auditorium. The cruising vibe is at its most pronounced, and its most wickedly funny, in a long sequence in the gents’ toilets.3. The Royal Road (2015)Jenni Olson proves herself the unassuming heir toChantal Akermanin this perfectly calibrated essay film that interweaves California’s bloody history with Olson’s (semi-fictionalised) romantic imbroglios and the tangled roots of her cinematic obsessions – all expressed in a sanguine narration over atmospheric street-and-landscape shots. In a line that captures the essence of queer cinephilia, Olson says: “Experiencing myself as a fictional character has been a mode of survival for me.”2. By Hook or By Crook (2001)Silas Howard and Harry Dodge co-write, direct and star in a twitchy queer caper that celebrates trans masc identity more passionately than any film before it. Shy (Howard) sets out to help his newfound pal Valentine (Dodge) track down his biological mother; along the way, vending machines get boosted and convenience store stick-ups go awry while butch lesbian, trans masc and non-binary viewers get the empathy and representation of which they had long been starved, plus lashings of sex, wit and wildness. Val’s rhapsodic monologue about Shy – “I met a guy! He was very small! He was a little running-away guy! He was a good-guy guy! He was splendid …” – is an endlessly quotable all-timer.View image in fullscreenMasterpiece … Tropical Malady by Apichatpong Weerasethakul.Photograph: Kick the Machine Films1.Tropical Malady(2004)It’s an age-old story: boy meets boy, boy seemingly turns into ravenous jungle beast and is then hunted through the balmy verdant undergrowth.Apichatpong Weerasethakulwon the Palme d’Or with Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives but it is Tropical Malady (in which Uncle Boonmee himself is namechecked six whole years before getting his own film) that remains his masterpiece. Complete with extended sexy-funny courtship, a talking monkey and a bovine ghost, it is an enigmatic puzzle of a film, bisected by a narrative schism reminiscent of Performance or Mulholland Drive.

Does one necessitate the other?vammypI’ve always thought it’s all the same. You just try to be as honest as you can, and if you’re being honest in absurd circumstances then you’re in a comedy. It’s not like I try to be funny or serious – just honest. If you’re watching someone play a bad guy and there’s nothing about the performance that makes you feel for the person or understand them in a deeper way, that’s a fail to me. Because the truth of life is that at a funeral someone always cracks a joke. There’s something so rich about being able to laugh at a funeral. That is what life is to me: all those grey areas, these contradictory things.I’m impressedand baffled by this left turn with Mister Romantic [Reilly’s vaudevillian crooner alter ego]. How did you come up with the character? Why did you pick out the songs that you did?steve__bayleyI made the musical Chicago years ago and played this character Mister Cellophane, and it reawakened my love of musical theatre. In particular, my love of the vaudeville performance style: very presentational, trying to connect with the audience and not aloof in any way. I love performing like that. I wanted to sing all those songs, but I was also looking at the world and I thought: man, things are getting pretty unkind and divisive out there. So I created Mister Romantic. He has no memory of the past and so that puts the show live, in the moment. The whole mission is to create empathy and connection and to explore ideas of love.Watch the video for What’ll I Do?.Who were your main inspirations for this album?EddieHaskellRespect must be paid to the real musical inspirations, such as Harry Nilsson, Irving Berlin,Tom Waitsand Nat King Cole. I’m not saying I’m as good as them by any means, but what those people did was they fell in love with a song and said: this is a beautiful thing, I’m going to share it with the world. I feel part of that lineage. If you really love a song, it can’t be set in amber by one performer; it has to be given life. It’s a little nervy of me, I admit, to try to reinterpret these songs after they’ve been done so beautifully by other people. But life is for living and we have to keep renewing these things if they have meaning for us.Big fan here. Also a big fan of Tom Waits. Do you think Mister Romanticcould be persuaded to record analbum of Waits covers, à laScarlett Johansson?TheManWithoutFearI love thatScarlett Johansson did that. I guess Mister Romantic could do an entire album of Tom Waits songs, but I think it’s more likely that I would. I literally refer to Tom as Saint Tom. He’s a big influence in my life. Not only musically, but also as a performer – his ethos, the way he treats performance and the way he carries himself. I came upon him when I was 18 and he changed my life. I love the way he interprets characters.I’ve had the luck to meet him a couple of times. Once, he was getting ready to do a movie and he said: “Can you hook me up with an acting teacher?” I was like: Tom, with all due respect, you’re one of the greatest living storytellers, what could anyone tell you about acting? But I set him up with Patrick Murphy, my first acting teacher and closest friend, and they met in Sacramento and went to the zoo and talked about character and looked at animals.I thought you really captured the frailty and humanity of Oliver Hardy perfectly inStan& Ollie. What kind of research did you do to prepare for the role? Which Hardy performance is yourfavourite and why?brucevayne1000View image in fullscreenLifelong inspiration … playing Oliver Hardy alongside Steve Coogan’s Stan Laurel in 2018’s Stan & Ollie.Photograph: BBC Films/AllstarI have trouble picking favourites, but I love Brats. It really inspired my absurd sense of comedy. In a weird way, I’d been preparing to play that role my whole life since watching the films on repeat as a child. Oliver Hardy has been a lifelong inspiration and is one of the greatest clowns who ever lived. But one of the great tragedies about him is that he was a beautiful singer, a really incredible tenor, and yet when you look for recordings of him singing there’s only about three or four and they’re all tied to movies. That’s a real shame and I don’t want that to happen to me. If people like my singing, I want them to be able to hear me express myself.Whatcomplimentstill makes you smile?ashtyndsSomeone told me I had a nice butt. I was wearing chaps at the time, which have a way of framing the buttocks in a beautiful way. I have a hard time receiving compliments, actually. I don’t live in a place of narcissistic wonder. I live in a place of wishing I was better most of the time or seeing my shortcomings. It’s good for an artist to keep their ego in check as much as they can.View image in fullscreenOne of TV’s most extraordinary characters … as Dr Steve Brule.Photograph: Cartoon Network/Everett/ShutterstockWhat is it like to be in a film that just doesn’t work or doesn’t find an audience?covskyEvery film is like a prayer and it’s a miracle when they work. Even if you make the perfect piece of art, it can still trip over itself at the box office if it’s not the moment in the zeitgeist when people want that story. I try not to get too caught up in the immediate success or failure of things. If you’ve made something you’re proud of, that is success. I’ve not always felt that way – there were box office disappointments that were devastating – but I’ve learned things can be unexpectedly successful or unsuccessful. In the end, what you carry with you is your personal experience. Yesterday’s reviews are recycling.I’m convinced that Dr Steve Brule [the parodic public TV host played by Reilly between 2007 and 2016] is one of the mostextraordinary characters ever. Nobodycould bring that character to life like you. My question – did you really drink the water from the marina?Was that your idea?papalzalewdSteve definitely drank water from the marina. I was executive producer on that show, so I can’t speak to Steve’s experience. You’d have to check with him, but I’m not sure I would take his advice on everything as a doctor. I’m not even sure what kind of doctor he is. Someone told me once that his mother actually named him “Dr Steve Brule” – that his middle name is Steve and he is not a medical doctor. I’m so proud to be involved with that show and I’m delighted that people love it. I love it as much as they do.Did Magnolia [Paul Thomas Anderson’s 1999 ensemble drama]simply belong to a special time? Can a film in a similar stylehappen again? Why are most films so formulaic, without any of that movie’s surprisesor spontaneity?julian6View image in fullscreen‘Push on no matter what’… with Melora Walters in 1999’s Magnolia.Photograph: Getty ImagesI don’t agree with the underlying sentiment. You could have said the same thing about Badlands: no one makes movies like that any more. But that’s the job of the artist – to push on no matter what it seems like you’re allowed to make. That’s certainly what Paul Thomas Anderson did with Magnolia. I won’t go into it, because he’s a private person, but almost everything in that movie has some personal connection to him. Things come in waves: capitalism and the marketplace get the upper hand, but then humanity has this need for stories and honesty in art and it comes back around. Don’t let yourself get too depressed about the way things are.There have definitely been moments in the last few years, especially with the current state of the movie business, when I’ve felt just like this reader. I went to Cannes film festival a couple years ago, really feeling dejected, like: that’s it, the streamers have taken over, the movie business is dead. But then you watch these movies from all over the world, Mongolia or Sudan, and you realise: oh no, it’s alive and well. This art form is never going to die, because it still works. You just have to seek it out. If you’re worried that there aren’t more things you like out there, then you have to make sure you show up for the things you do. Because that’s what’s gonna keep them alive.What’s Not to Love? by Mister Romantic is released on 13 June on Reilly’s label Eternal Magic RecordingsExplore more on these topicsMusicFilm & Music reader interviewJohn C ReillyTom WaitsPaul Thomas AndersonScarlett JohanssonComedy filmsDrama filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As Payne appears in Building the Band, we delve into the unnerving world of posthumous televisionStuart HeritageThu 12 Jun 2025 07.41 EDTLast modified on Thu 12 Jun 2025 08.47 EDTShareAt first glance, Netflix’s new series Building the Band comes off as a weird amalgam of every singing competition show you loved a decade and a half ago. There’s the core DNA of X Factor. The singers perform out of sight of everyone else, so it cribs fromThe Voice. Clearly, there’s heavy borrowing from Making the Band. Plus, this is Netflix, so everything looks a bit like Squid Game.But this odd mishmash of a format isn’t what will keep you away from Building the Band. No, what will keep you away from Building the Band is the posthumous appearance ofLiam Payne.Last year, Payne was named as a member of the Building the Band judging panel. He filmed his parts for the series in August 2024. However, two months later, he died aged 31 in circumstances that the tabloids feasted upon for months.Yesterday the first clip of Building the Band was released, and producers confirmed that the One Direction star will still appear as a member of the onscreen judging team. “Liam Payne’s family reviewed the series and is supportive of his inclusion,” Netflix said in a statement. And suddenly what looked at first like the most inoffensive piece of background fluff has become uncomfortably charged.Unfortunately, this is not a unique problem. Several productions have had to contend with the unexpected death of their talent. How this is handled relies entirely upon the nature of the star, the death and the production.The most drastic but perhaps the most appropriate thing to do in this situation is to shut down production entirely. This, after all, is what happened on the 1962 film Something’s Got to Give after the death of Marilyn Monroe. Admittedly it was a troubled production from the start, with Monroe being fired and rehired due to her lateness and inability to remember lines, but the film was impossible to complete without her and now exists as a handful of scraps of footage.View image in fullscreenFacing it head-on … Glee returned with an episode devoted to Cory Monteith after he died.Photograph: Startraks Photo/Rex FeaturesAnother option is to acknowledge what happened upfront. When Cory Monteith died between seasons of Glee, the show chose to return with an episode devoted to the death of his character and the impact it had on those around him. Similarly, John Ritter’s death was treated by his show 8 Simple Rules as a way for the cast, crew and audience to grieve for him together, blurring the lines between character and actor in a way that remains incredibly touching.Less successful are the productions that attempt to keep the dead alive. Perhaps the only misstep in the entire run of The Sopranos was its effort to complete the storyline of Livia Soprano after the death of Nancy Marchand. Her final scene was cobbled together with unused footage and ham-fisted CGI in such a way that it was impossible to suspend disbelief. Yes, it was a horrible decision, but in retrospect the haphazard execution wasn’t particularly fair on the character or the performer. Plus, let’s not blame this creepiness on emergent technology, since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker did the same thing with Carrie Fisher and the end result was just as eerie.View image in fullscreenA digitally enhanced image of Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.Photograph: Lucasfilm LtdSo what will Building the Band do? Well, the team have evidently not shut down production, and we can assume they haven’t built a CGI re-creation of Liam Payne. From all the available information, it doesn’t seem as though Payne was a central part of the show – the Hollywood Reporter describes his role as “guest judge”, which might mean his participation was limited to a single episode. If that’s the case, the show will be able to package his appearance as a tribute to his life and career, which seems like the most respectful outcome.But if Payne was present for more episodes, the show will be faced with an uncomfortable transition. One moment he will be there, and the next minute not. This sort of porous judging panel used to happen on a fairly regular basis on X Factor, but the circumstances are far more serious this time. The show doesn’t have to brush off a backstage tantrum or scheduling conflict. It has to reckon with the tragic death of a young man. It isn’t an edit that can be easily smoothed over.Ultimately, you suspect that Building the Band as a whole is destined to be overshadowed by the fate of Liam Payne. His appearances, however short, are going to be scrutinised, either for signs of promise that were sadly snuffed out or for glimpses of the pain that was evident in his final days. When there’s something that heavy going on, a bunch of hopefuls crooning on a stage simply don’t stand a chance.Building the Band is onNetflixfrom 9 JulyExplore more on these topicsTelevisionLiam PayneReality TVNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The result is a powerful indictment of our justice systemAmelia GentlemanThu 12 Jun 2025 00.00 EDTShareThe directors of Holloway use a simple but powerful visual device to demonstrate how badly the British prison system is failing the women it incarcerates. Towards the end of their eponynmous documentary, six former inmates are invited to play a version of Grandmother’s Footsteps in the chapel of the deserted ex-prison, where they have been filming for five days.They begin lined up against the wall and a voice tells them: “Step forward if you grew up in a chaotic household.” All six women step forward, before being instructed: “Step forward if you experienced domestic violence growing up.” Again, they move ahead in unison. “Step forward if somebody in your household has experienced drug use. Step forward if you grew up in a household where there wasn’t very much money. Step forward if a member of your family has been to prison …”When I got to my cell, I felt my 18-year-old self cry outBy the time the exercise is over, almost all the women have silently made their way from one side of the room to the other, starkly highlighting the film’s fundamental theme: the UK’s prisons are full of vulnerable women being punished – at great expense – and not helped.Shortly before Holloway prison began to be demolished in 2022, directors Sophie Compton and Daisy-May Hudson secured permission to film inside the abandoned site in London, watching as six women returned to the cells where they were once held, to explore how they all ended up imprisoned as young women. Directors of a more conventional documentary might have plonked the participants on the bare iron frames of their old prison beds and instructed them to pour out their life stories, poking and prodding them for all the shocking details. Compton and Hudson take a subtler approach, arranging the women in a circle, supervised by a trained therapist, and waiting to see what emerges.View image in fullscreen‘I’m angry that some kids are born into certain circumstances’ ... Aliyah Ali, left, and Mandy Ogunmokun.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianIt is a risky strategy. The flow of the conversation is faltering, interrupted by nervousness about how their words will be used, suspicion about the directors’ intentions – and a sudden, uncomfortable request for the most difficult conversations to continue without the cameras rolling. The film includes all this uncertainty: they debate whether they should proceed before realising their desire to talk about the justice system’s failures mostly outweighs their concerns about sharing chapters from their complicated pasts.Compton (Emmy nominated for her documentary on deepfake pornography,Another Body) and Hudson (who won a Bafta Breakthrough award for her filmHalf Way, documenting her own family’sexperience of homelessness) have the confidence to make their subjects collaborators on the project, inviting them into the editing process, to ensure everyone feels happy with how their experiences have been handled. “They could say what they did and didn’t like,” Hudson says. “They wanted more laughter included. Our wish was that they felt proud of the film.”Once western Europe’s largest women’s prison, Holloway has a significant place in British history. More than 300 suffragettes were held in a wing of the original building during the early 20th century. Ruth Ellis was hanged there in 1955, the last woman to be executed in the UK. Greenham Common protesters spent time here. Sarah Reed, who had previously been a victim of police brutality in 2012,died in her cell in 2016.This is not the story the film sets out to tell. “It’s not a film about Holloway; other films can tell a historical story or show the realities of being in prison,” says Compton, who I meet along with Hudson and two of the film’s participants, Aliyah Ali and Mandy Ogunmokun. “This is about a group of women returning to Holloway, and finding they are not the same people they were when they were in prison.”The women each respond differently when they walk through the corridors of the site, which closed in 2016. Some take delight in defying forgotten rules, skipping along walkways that were previously out of bounds. One begins by cheerfully telling the cameras how she viewed her time at Holloway as a holiday camp experience – it takes days for her to admit the extent to which her attitude is just a protective front. Another observes approvingly the way that brambles and ferns have started to reclaim the space, springing from beneath the plug sockets and creeping through the windows. “It feels kind of healing to see that Holloway prison is falling apart,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘They wanted more laughter included’ … directors Sophie Compton, left, and Daisy-May Hudson.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianSome remember with horror the noise of night-time screaming, but several are surprised by the unexpected feelings of affection the building triggers. “It was probably the first time that I was in an environment which was controlled and felt safe,” Ali, 31, tells me. “It’s sad that for a lot of us, the first time we felt that connection of belonging and sisterhood, we found it in prison. What does that say about society?”She was sent to Holloway at 18. “Growing up how I grew up, you’re conditioned to just brush things off and get on with things, and wear masks and stay strong. When I went back to my first cell, I felt my 18-year-old self cry out.”Ali is initially the most reluctant of the six participants. The founder of a non-profit organisation,The Daddyless Daughters Project, she has rebuilt her life, radiates strength and seems visibly irritated by the entire setup. “I was worried they could edit our voices and create a narrative that we weren’t hoping for,” she says. “I was thinking, ‘We’re trusting them with a level of vulnerability that we’re not comfortable with. What are these people going to do with it?’”Gradually she was reassured and slowly began to reveal some of the childhood events that catapulted her into prison – family breakdown, domestic violence, a move to a women’s refuge, then later into a residential children’s home at the age of 12. Her problems escalated when she got caught up in county lines dealing, as a child exploited by criminal gangs to move and supply drugs. “I was introduced to selling drugs, which I was very good at, and it was the first time that I started to feel a sense of worth,” she finally reveals on camera.She is dismayed to remember how little support she received as a child. “The system saw me as a bad girl … as somebody who asked for all of this,” she says in the film. “It was always, ‘What’s wrong with you? Why can’t you just behave? Why can’t you just stop doing this?’ Nothing was asked about what actually happened to me,” she says.View image in fullscreenUnexpected feelings … one of the women who returned to Holloway takes a photograph in a cell.Her fury is echoed by Ogunmokun. “It’s so frustrating to see how similar the stories of people going in and out of prison are. Change is so slow,” she says. The daughter of a woman who struggled with addiction, she also spent some of her childhood in care, went to Holloway first aged 20, and was in and out repeatedly for two decades until she shook off her own drug addiction aged 40. “I’m angry that some kids are born into certain circumstances, and what chance do they have?”Ogunmokun, 66, has dedicated the 25 years since leaving Holloway to helping former addictsbreak the cycle of addiction and offending. “Every time I reoffended the judge would say: ‘You haven’t learned anything.’” She didn’t get the support she needed to change while she was in prison, through no real fault of the prison staff. “The officers see horrific things, but they’re not trained counsellors – they’re not mental health trained, they’re not sex-trafficking trained, they’re not domestic violence trained. They’ve got a regime they have to run by.” She hopes the film might persuade viewers that there needs to be a revolution in the way that female offenders are treated.I was an addict, a prisoner, a sex worker.

Hudson and Compton struggled for several years to raise funding to finish their film. Now they feel happy that it is being released at a time when there is some emerging optimism about the possibility of change. “The simple truth is that we are sending too many women to prison,” the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said earlier this year. “We need to do things differently.” The film will be screened at an event with the prisons minister, James Timpson, in parliament later this month.Hudson’s first fiction film,Lollipop, which comes out this month too, also features a woman who has recently left prison. She says both projects examine the way vulnerable women are shamed and blamed, as well as trying to showcase “the power of women that society tries to put on the outskirts”.Ali is satisfied with how the film has turned out, and wants it to be shown to young people in prisons, to offer hope that lives can alter course. Despite her early reservations, she is impressed by the directors’ creation. “It’s been emotionally turbulent,” she says, “but they’ve done an amazing job.”Holloway is in UK cinemas from 20 June.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsWomenPrisons and probationUK criminal justicefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yet themost recent ceremonyexperienced a surprise surge in popularity, with broadcast viewershipup 44%compared to the 2024 installment. It was the largest audience since the last pre-pandemic edition in 2019. That seems to sync up withthe record-setting seasonthat the awards were celebrating, where Broadway productions featured a number of movie stars drawing huge crowds (and ticket prices).Tony awards 2025: Maybe Happy Ending and Nicole Scherzinger win big while George Clooney misses outRead moreYet apart from George Clooney and a few other familiar faces, it wasn’t a particularly starry Tonys; Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal and Kieran Culkin weren’t nominated, and there wasn’t a single crossover mass-culture powerhouse like Hamilton or The Producers (whose winning telecasts are still the highest-rated of the 21st century). Moreover, Broadway isn’t alone; theOscarsexperienced ratings growth (part of a four-year upward trend), and the left-for-dead Golden Globes have stabilized. This trend goes back nearly a year, to last fall, when MTV’s more specialized Video Music Awards saw an uptick and Emmy viewership jumped up 50% to a three-year high. Awards shows, so often derided as bloated, self-congratulatory ratings ploys, have somehow survived the streaming apocalypse to become broadcast TV’s last stand. (Apart from real sports, of course.)In some ways, it makes sense. Very few scripted shows still command watch-it-live urgency, not least because it’s not always clear when or if they air live in the first place. Awards shows, however, only really need the date; most of them run for the full prime-time block, and in some cases on multiple channels. (The VMAs are basically shown on the entire Paramount family of channels, as if to scoop up as many errant unconverted cable-watchers as possible.) It seems related to how Saturday Night Live has become one of the highest-rated shows on network TV simply by not bleeding quite as many viewers as its primetime brethren: everyone knows when and where it’s on and what its deal is – yet it also doesn’t require full and sustained attention to enjoy. Similarly, awards shows sprawl out like a lazy couch stretch, while also breaking into easy-to-follow segments.And despite the ubiquity of shareable online highlights – you probably could have watched three-quarters of the Tonys in 47-second clips on social media – those bits and bobs are really more fun if you’re actually watching along in real time, rather than piecing together the timeline like an awards detective. Remember various apps trying to sync up Watch Parties for isolating friends during the height of Covid? Awards shows do that for you: it’s live, on TV, ready for your second-screen experience.View image in fullscreenConan O’Brien hosting the Oscars.Photograph: Rob Latour/Rex/ShutterstockThat’s been true for decades at this point, since well before Elon Musk bought Twitter. (If anything, the social media landscape seems more fragmented now than it did five or six years ago.) What’s emerged from the great streaming shift is that awards shows function as particularly organic second-screen entertainment, something streamers have quietly and insidiously backwards-engineered with some of their shows and movies.Scripted (shudder) “content”, material that’s clearly designed to be passively consumed while fiddling with your phone or folding laundry, tends toward clunky exposition, repeated plot points, and an overall glossy indifference to tight, engaging narrative. Viewers may not immediately clock the difference, especially if they’re performing the designated distractions while watching, but the empty-calorie nature of so many streaming movies and shows may eventually (fail to) add up, especially when compared with so much great work of the past.But awards shows are already like that by design! Hosts, presenters, announcers and on-screen graphics all tell you what’s happening, repeatedly. Clips, speeches and live performances even offer catch-up context for whatever plays, songs or movies you aren’t personally caught up with. Rare moments of chaos or genuine spontaneity get the instant-replay treatment on social media – as do micro-expressions from just about anyone caught on camera, subject to ridiculous levels of analysis exploiting the fact that sometimes people, even famous ones, affect neutral expressions in public. Network TV has approximated a particularly celeb-saturated Instagram feed without even trying.There’s probably a grim irony in the fact that many millions of people would prefer to second-screen the experience of Anora winning a bunch of Oscars than to actually sit down and pay attention to Anora – just one of many movies that is, in terms of merging art and entertainment, a lot more potent and intellectually rewarding than a veg-out in front of the Oscars, even if someone as funny as Conan O’Brien is hosting. It’s possible that our modern pop-cultural feeds have been awards-ified without even realizing it, turning too many other experiences into a kind of destructively participatory sporting event.Then again, it’s hard to hold that against the Tonys, which offers an annual big-budget sampler of Broadway material to a lot of viewers who don’t have regular access to the highest-profile stages in the country. (Hell, some of us media types who live in New York City still had no idea what Floyd Collins was before the ceremony.) If it takes an old-fashioned self-congratulatory awards show to cheerfully force-feed us some genuine culture in the virtual company of others, hey, it sure beats scrolling alone.Explore more on these topicsAwards and prizesTony awardsUS televisionTelevisionOscarsnewsShareReuse this content"

Added to this, Beckinsale alleges that the workout equipment and physical trainers she had requested to “stay in top shape for the physical demands of the role” were not provided, and she subsequently suffered “a complex meniscus tear in her left knee” as a result of a scene in which she was thrown into a wall, which was aggravated when she was “coerced” into performing “unsafe action sequences” after she returned to work.The document adds that Beckinsale’s stunt performer broke her ankle and “rather than replace her with a competent and qualified stunt [performer]”, the producers “hired an unqualified stunt woman who was simply the girlfriend of the stunt coordinator”.The legal complaint also includes communications between Beckinale’s agent Shani Rosenzweig and the film’s producers, with Rosenzweig criticising the lack of preparation and training for the film’s action sequences. Rosenzweig wrote: “No one is actually taking real action to put a plan in place to fix this situation …” Before demanding to know: “How you are … making sure your lead actress works 12 hour days and has time to prep for work on her own when she leaves the set while getting the rest her body so desperately needs. If you’re trying to kill a person, you’re doing a great job.” A message in response from John Zois, one of the film’s producers, reads: “I don’t know what else to say other than you’re right … The days are too packed for the pace we are moving and it’s CLEARLY not sustainable.”The Guardian has contacted Zois and the film’s sales representatives Anton for comment.Explore more on these topicsFilmKate BeckinsalenewsShareReuse this content"

There was also a prison hospital.Battles were being fought in Europe, the Caribbean, north Africa and the Indian Ocean. An estimated 200,000 soldiers and sailors were captured and brought to the UK, the majority French, but also Dutch and other nationalities. Their welfare was the responsibility of the Transport Board of the Admiralty, and they were held in a network of prisons, prison ships, parole depots and land prisons. Norman Cross was the first of three purpose built inland “depots”, with the others at Dartmoor and Perth.Prisoners were allowed to make products – including artefacts such as toys, model ships and dominos sets carved from wood or animal bone – to sell at a regular market. Many such items were excavated during a visit by the Time Team TV show in July 2009.The last prisoners left in 1814 and the camp was dismantled two years later. A memorial to the 1,770 prisoners who died there, mainly due to disease including Typhus, was erected in 1914.There is no public access to the site, but there are plans to enable visitors to explore the area, while ensuring that the land is farmed sympathetically to preserve the archaeological remains beneath.Paul Chamberlain, an author and historian, said: “This acquisition will enable more of the story to be told for future generations and provide us with a better understanding of a lost town that had a significant impact on the region over 200 years ago.”The heritage minister, Baroness Twycross, said: “The remarkable stories of those held in what was the first purpose-built prisoner of war camp should be remembered now and in the future.”Explore more on these topicsHeritageEnglandCambridgeshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The slick, twanging pop-rock was correctly identified at the time by Portishead’s Geoff Barrow as echoing the oeuvre of Shania Twain (though this wasn’t the sick burn he thought it was), over which the LA trio copped to commitment phobia, communication issues and having their heads turned, before skipping into the California sunset with their hearts intact. Well, to commandeer the title of Haim’s debut album: those days are very much gone.View image in fullscreenHaim: I Quit.Photograph: Paul Thomas AndersonI Quit, the sisters’ fourth album, still has plenty of breakup songs, but these are no cheerful odes to dumping dudes in your 20s. Instead, the record fixates on the bitter end of a deeply flawed long-term relationship; at least some of these songs are informed by the love lost between lead vocalist Danielle Haim and Ariel Rechtshaid, the garlanded producer who worked on all three of the band’s previous albums (I Quit is instead helmed by Danielle, Rostam Batmanglij and Buddy Ross). The mood is not desolate – the narrator instigated the split – but it is searching and pained. The ex is portrayed as careless and manipulative, and punches are not pulled (“I swear you wouldn’t care if I was covered in blood lying dead on the street”). There are many references to setting oneself free, reflected in the – perhaps too on-the-nose – sample of George Michael’s Freedom! ‘90, which is woven through the opening track, Gone.The idea of Haim sampling George Michael is more fun in theory than in practice: Gone is initially characterised by a low, flat vocal melody and sludgy instrumentation that manages to strip all euphoria from its co-opted “freedom!” refrain. But then a guitar solo that recalls the White Stripes in their pomp arrives, before this newfound garage-bluesiness is merged with Freedom! ‘90’s bedrock rhythm. It’s a Frankenstein’s monster of a song, but a belatedly brilliant one.On Haim’s last album, 2020’s Women in Music Pt III, the sisters expanded on the perky and sometimes airless rock of their first two records to great acclaim. Gone hints at even more experimentation this time round, so it is disappointing to encounter the wan, plodding country-pop of All Over Me. But hold tight for track three, the absurdly delightful Relationships, which incorporates 80s bombast, the hyper-melodic, pitch-climbing toplines of 90s R&B and a valley-girl-ish take on old-school rap. It is the best pop song they’ve ever made.I Quit peaks, spectacularly, here. The rest of the album’s 15 tracks range from fiercely good and instantly replayable to somewhat bland and instantly forgettable.Haim: ‘We can go toe-to-toe with any male rock band and blow them out of water’Read moreHaim have long been likened to Fleetwood Mac – a comparison Stevie Nicks recently endorsed, telling GQ that collaborating with the trio was “like coming home”. Yet in lieu of that band’s intangible magic and mystery, Haim are undoubtedly best when they add something new to the 70s soft-rock mix, which comes in fits and starts. Slipping intosprechgesang,as on the droll nostalgia-fest Take Me Back, always feels like a wise move, a chance to lean into the sisters’ GSOH, so obvious in interviews but less so in their actual songs. See also Million Years, which employs a manic breakbeat and gloopy synths to wicked, bubbly effect; and the near-nu metal of Now It’s Time’s punchy, synthetic beat, buzzing guitars and whooshing production.I Quit is sonically scattershot, but gratifyingly consistent in one regard. Over its considerable runtime, Haim rake repeatedly over the same heartbreak to construct a candid, complex portrait of a woman working hard to psychologically liberate herself from a relationship, laying out obvious toxicity (“an innocent mistake turns into 17 days”, of conflict, presumably) and harm (“you really fucked with my confidence”), while entertaining the notion that maybe all relationships are like this: “Is it just the shit our parents did? And had to live with it.” As a process, it’s messy, a bit like this album. But ultimately worthwhile, also a bit like this album.This week Rachel listened toMark William Lewis – Tomorrow Is PerfectThe zeitgeist-lassoing film and TV studio A24 is sidestepping into music and Londoner Lewis is their first signing.

It has an unhurried, thoughtful and very human quality;Helen Mirrenwon the best actress award at Cannes for her performance here and in fact it is very well acted across the board by a blue-chip cast.Mirren plays Marcella, a woman from a Catholic background, married across the sectarian divide to a reserve police officer murdered at his parents’ farmhouse by an IRA man who had bullied a bewildered local guy into being his getaway driver; this is Cal, played by the gauntly intense John Lynch. Cal lives with his widowed father; a gentle performance by Donal McCann, who was Gabriel Conroy in John Huston’s The Dead. But as the only Catholics in a Protestant neighbourhood, they are burned out of their home by loyalist gangs. Having quit his job at the gruesome abattoir, Cal gets a job labouring at Marcella’s farm and is allowed to live in an outbuilding; Marcella’s fiercely Protestant brother-in-law and mother-in-law (excellent performances from Ray McAnally and Catherine Gibson) take pity and almost a shine to the poor, put-upon Cal. And Cal, despite or because of being secretly complicit in the murder of Marcella’s husband, and intensely aware of her loneliness and ambiguous nameless yearning, falls deeply in love with her.There can’t be many movies about love in which the principals don’t so much as kiss until an hour and a quarter into the running time. What leads up to the main event is an observant, bleak, sometimes mordantly funny and compassionate account of everyone’s melancholy existence; it then becomes an almost Hardyesque romance of the countryside as Cal initially gets a job potato-picking and is ferried out to the fields with all the other hired hands in the back of a van.Having nothing to do most of the time, Cal is always being chivvied into doing “jobs” for his overbearing mate Crilly (Stevan Rimkus), who is in awe of the local republican hard man, Skeffington (John Kavanagh). There is one black-comic scene in which Cal has to be the driver when, to boost IRA coffers, Crilly robs a cinema showing Superman III. There is much ambient detail to notice, including Sinn Féin posters showing the face of Martin McGuinness. (Could anyone have guessed that 28 years later he would be shaking hands with the queen?) Lovers of classic 80s British cinema will appreciate that a tough RUC man is played by Daragh O’Malley, who would go on to play the dodgy guy shouting “perfumed ponce” in a Camden pub in Withnail and I. Most of all, Mirren and Lynch’s love scene is a model for how to show sex in a grownup, candid, non-exploitative way; this was a career highlight for Mirren and an outstanding debut for the young Lynch.Cal is in UK and Irish cinemas from 13 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsRomance filmsFilm adaptationsNorthern IrelandHelen MirrenPeriod and historical filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But while his studio work was extensive, it was the huge volume of recordings made officially and unofficially at his recitals across more than 40 years that really bulked out his discography, with multiple versions available of many of the core works in his repertory. For those reasons the rediscovery of “Lost Tapes” might not initially seem so remarkable. The performances, of fourBeethovenpiano sonatas, Opp 31 no 3, 90, 101 and 110, are taken from recitals that Richter gave in 1965. Op 110 comes from a performance at the piano festival he had founded the previous year at La Grange de Meslay near Tours, the others are taken from a concert in Lucerne three months later.View image in fullscreenSviatoslav Richter: The Lost TapesThere are recordings of Richter’s performances of all four sonatas already in the catalogue, but the immediacy of these versions is startling. He was never content to keep on replicating the interpretation of a particular work; temperamentally, I suspect, he could not contemplate such lazy routine. Instead, each work was approached afresh each time he played it, always finding something new, whether it’s the joy that courses through the third of the Op 31 set, the myriad colours and subtleties he brings to Op 101, or the serene, almost liturgical seriousness with which he presents the fugues in the finale of Op 110.The original recordings were made by Deutsche Grammophon engineers, who were following Richter around Europe that year, and the sound has been refined for this release. What has proved more intractable has obviously been the piano tone itself, which, in the Lucerne performances especially, seems very bright and rather shallow, sometimes sounding almost like a mid 19th-century instrument. It does take a bit of the gloss off the performances, but the playing is still glorious.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

But unlike the earlier book, it’s also set partly in south London – the writer’s own home turf – and has a mother, rather than a father, at its heart.Dawn, our “white, young, rich” narrator, is the youngest child of a well-known Trinidadian fruit juice dynasty. At 16, after a brief encounter with a tourist at carnival in Trinidad, she finds herself pregnant. Petrified of the stigma, her otherwise caring parents make a “pact” never to speak of it again, dispatching her, under cover of darkness, on a terrifying and chillingly evoked boat trip to Venezuela. Here she spends four months with nuns who deliver her baby – a girl she never sees again – then is returned to Trinidad to resume her schooling as if nothing has happened.But somethinghashappened. And 40 years later, now an ex-GP living in London, divorced with two grown-up sons, Dawn is still bereft, still searching. Not just for her daughter but, because her memories of her time in Venezuela are so cloaked in shame and secrecy, for what feels like a missing part of herself.Her family kept to their pact and the episode has never again been mentioned, but for Dawn the questions have only grown more pressing with time. What part of Venezuela was she sent to? Who exactly were the nuns? Most of all, who was that traumatised teenage girl who gave up her baby so easily? After years of emotionally exhausting research – letter writing, internet forums, DNA tests – she’s still no closer to the truth. And then one night a young woman in Italy gets in touch. So many of her details seem to fit. Could this be Dawn’s long-lost baby?Adam is great on the unsaid, the half-said, and the way feelings will unravel and morph over the yearsIt’s a situation rich with logistical and emotional possibilities, all of which Adam mines with subtlety and finesse. What could all too easily have been a straightforward case of will-she-won’t-she find her long-lost child is somehow both more mundane and more unsettling.Would Dawn have had a better life if she’d kept her baby? In many ways, probably not: she was able to go to medical school and make a career for herself. Yet still the terrible, unspoken loss has left its mark on every member of the family: not just her parents, but her older brothers, her somewhat disengaged ex-husband and her sons, whose understandable priority is to protect her from further hurt.It’s her parents who, believing they were acting in her best interests, are most infuriated by Dawn’s apparent inability to hold on to the good life she’s made for herself. “The man had enough!” her mother explodes in frustration when, after years of putting the search before everything else, her daughter’s marriage breaks down. All they ever wanted was for her to have done well despite her “trouble” – her mother’s elation at noting, on a visit to the marital home in leafy Wandsworth, that she has a cooker with eight rings, is a lovely touch.Still, Dawn’s abiding sense of loss, the instinctive feeling of her daughter’s absence, which “always arrived somewhere in my abdomen, the sudden shock, like remembering laundry left out in the rain or children not picked up from school”, is something whose power cannot be overestimated. Adam is great on the unsaid, the half-said, and the way feelings will unravel and morph over the years. “Mothers will fight off lions,” Dawn tells her father in a rare, late moment of reckoning. “Actually it was you I should have been fighting … you were the lion. I didn’t realise it back then.” It’s credit to this novel’s ability to wrongfoot you that at this moment you find yourself feeling a flicker of sympathy for her father.And this sense of uncertainty and unease continues to the end. The final pages, which unfold at the family’s beach house on Tobago, are as gripping as any thriller, and the ending, when it comes, feels as right as it is devastating.Love Forms by Claire Adam is published by Faber (£16.99).

It contains an outstanding account of one Britten’s greatest orchestral achievements, the Sinfonia da Requiem, and a fine one of a suite (Gardner’s own selection) from Britten’s only full-length ballet, The Prince of the Pagodas, together with the first recording of a fascinating orchestration by Robin Holloway of Britten’s Thomas Hardy song cycle Winter Words.View image in fullscreenBritten: Sinfonia da Requiem, Winter WordsIn a note on his orchestrations, Holloway declares that Winter Words is his favourite among Britten’s song cycles and that Britten and Hardy “seem made for each other”. But in its general tone and subject matter – nature, the changing seasons, and man’s place among them – and Britten’s treatment of them there’s an introspection and intimacy, which doesn’t automatically suggest the large scale “public” exposure of an orchestral song cycle. But Holloway’s interventions are wonderfully discreet and subtly imaginative, especially in his use of the marimba and xylophone, and tenor Nicky Spence’s careful performance certainly respects that.(Not available on Apple music and Spotify)Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBenjamin BrittenLondon Philharmonic OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s entertaining, though I think some of the cast understand comedy better and more instinctively than others. It’s set in London (though Trevorrow might originally have imagined it set in LA or New York) and the credit is shared with his longtime writing partner Derek Connolly, and also with Ben Ashenden and Alexander Owen, the funny British double act known as the Pin, who also amusingly appear as two squabbling coppers with a Mitchell and Webb energy. The director is the talented Tom Kingsley, who has a substantial TV career and with Will Sharpe got a Bafta nomination in 2012 for thedark comedy Black Pond.Bryce Dallas Howard plays Kat, an American actor whose career is tanking and who now runs an improv workshop in London. Orlando Bloom is Marlon (as in Brando), a smoulderingly hunky method performer and wannabe star reduced to doing TV commercials, and Nick Mohammed is Hugh, a sweet, shy beta-male IT guy who gets bullied in the office and turns to Kat’s improv classes as a way of boosting his self-esteem. The lives of all three are turned upside down when hard-faced Met cop Detective Billings, played by Sean Bean, offers these cash-strapped losers £200 each to infiltrate a criminal organisation run by a narcotics kingpin played by Paddy Considine, on the grounds that career officers are too easily recognisable.It’s a nice idea (and I wrongly guessed a final twist). Howard gamely gives it her all, though her air of bafflement sometimes didn’t look entirely intentional; Bloom as the absurd badass Marlon comes closer to it. But Mohammed, Ashenden and Owen are the ones capable of relaxing more naturally into the comedy mode and delivering funny lines. There are some laughs and it’s always likable.Deep Cover is on Prime Video from 12 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsCrime filmsBryce Dallas HowardSean BeanComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Discover its restaurants and bars before the prices catch upLeah Pennisi-GlaserThu 12 Jun 2025 06.05 EDTShareIn 1787, Goethe wrote: “To have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is not to have seen Italy at all, for Sicily is the clue to everything.” I’d go one step further and claim it’s impossible to really understand what makes the island tick without visiting Catania.Located on the east coast of the island, Catania is Sicily’s second-largest city and has been dubbed the Black City because of how prominently basalt features in its baroque architecture. Until recently this Unesco world heritage city, whose beauty can more than compete with its flashier neighbours, Palermo and Taormina, was blighted by organised crime and bad governance. But this is now changing, and fast. A decades-long crackdown on the Cosa Nostra has borne fruit, and previously no-go areas are now welcoming tourists and new businesses. My father’s family hails from San Cristoforo, the city’s poorest neighbourhood, and our conversations often centre on how the good times are finally arriving in Catania. But price points haven’t yet caught up with the city’s new-found buzz, especially in its many restaurants.Nuova Trattoria del ForestieroView image in fullscreenPasta alla norma, the signature dish of Catania.Photograph: Albert Gonzalez/AlamyAffectionately known as Rosanna’s by locals, Trattoria del Forestiero has been serving home-style dishes since 1965. My British-born mum was a waitress at the restaurant in the 1990s and one afternoon, after a night of heavy drinking, my dad, to whom she was teaching English at a language school in the city, popped in to cook her something to help with the hangover. He stuffedcotoletta, the breaded veal cutlet loved in Italy, with mozzarella, tomatoes and lots of garlic, andCotoletta alla Ciccowas born (Cicco being the diminutive of my late dad’s name, Francesco). It’s a must-eat dish, as is pasta alla norma, named after the Bellini opera, which is Catania’s signature dish. Rosanna’s version is particularly delicious because of its fresh hand-cut pasta, which is made daily.Mains about €10; onInstagramLa PescheriamarketView image in fullscreenLa Pescheria, Catania’s famous fish market.Photograph: Konstantin Kalishko/AlamyMembers of my family have been working on the stalls of this centuries-old fish market for ever. Growing up, I was taught to judge a fish market by its smell, or lack thereof, and so it’s a source of great familial pride that La Pescheriasmells of the sea. If you’re staying in an apartment (there are now many Airbnbs in the city), buytelline, tiny triangle-shaped, colourful clams, and cook them as you wouldvongole,served with spaghetti. The market is also home to Antica Trattoria La Paglia, which has been feeding visitors and vendors for more than 200 years. The fish restaurant has a longstanding rivalry with Rosanna’s – a ringing endorsement in locals’ books. Its no-frills interior isn’t much to write home about, but the black-and-white photos lining the walls offer nostalgic glimpses of the establishment’s storied past.Mains areabout €12;trattorialapaglia.itGiammonaandCostachioschiView image in fullscreenChiosco Giammona has been serving fresh drinks since 1912.Photograph: Giorgio Morara/AlamyThese soft drink stands have been serving the Catanese for decades, and everyone – and their nonna – has an opinion about which is the best. For me, Giammona,founded in 1912, has the upper hand. Run by Francesco Giammona, who took over from his father in the 1980s, the art nouveau kiosk has retained its original marble-clad bar and stained glass windows. Although Giammona’smenu has expanded in recent years to accommodate tourists’ tastes, Sicilians go-to thirst quencher isseltz al limone: sparkling water, lemon juice and a generous pinch of salt. Please note that although Italians are big on food categories they don’t, for some mysterious reason, differentiate between lemons and limes – so say if you wantlimoni gialli(lemons) orlimoni verdi(limes).Drinks start from €1.50 at both kiosks.

However, I challenge anyone to find a restaurant in a more scenic setting or one cooking tastier grilledbistecca di cavallo(horse steak). Situated in Piazza Federico di Svevia, its regular diners know to request an outdoor table, where they can look out on to Castello Ursino, a staggeringly imposing Norman castle a few feet away from the restaurant.

The neighbourhood bar was set up by a cultural association along with other initiatives to “help the people of the [San Cristoforo] ghetto”, and regularly hosts music events and book clubs. Earnest politics aside, my family are regulars because the drinks are cheap and strong. There is a menu, but it’s perfunctory – most customers will describe what they’re in the mood for, and a bartender will make a drink for them. Cocktails are served in pint glasses.gammazita.itBangla Spicy FoodView image in fullscreenBangla backs on to A Fera O’Luni market.Photograph: KroXi/Getty ImagesSicilians aren’t keen on change, especially the gastronomical kind: my uncle once flatly refused to try stroganoff because “cream only belongs in desserts”. Unfortunately, this means many are missing out on the island’s blossoming Asian food scene. Catania’s Bangladeshi population makes up nearly 7% of the city’s 13,000 foreign-born residents, and community restaurants are popping up across the city. The unassuming-looking Bangla Spicy Food, which backs on to the historic A Fera O’Luni market on Piazza Carlo Alberto(where my great-nonna once sold fruit and vegetables) is good and cheap: you can order several dishes and get change from a fiver. Don’t leave without trying the aromatic dal bhuna and flaky, buttery parathas. Waiters will supply cutlery if asked, but most customers here eat with their hands.Mains start from €1; onFacebookBar AlecciView image in fullscreenPistachio granita served with brioche – enjoy your breakfast.Photograph: Giuseppe Lombardo/AlamyCatanese have been trekking to Alecci, in the suburb of Gravina, since 1978. The original owner is still working behind the bar, wearing the cafe’s trademark maroon uniform and serving some of the city’s best coffee and snacks. At breakfast, they serve granita with brioche. Legend has it that in the ninth century, when Sicily was under Moorish occupation, Arabs mixed the snow of Mount Etna (Europe’s most continually belching volcano) with fruit juices, and granita was born. Whatever its history, Sicilians are inordinately proud of granita and have strict rules when it comes to its flavour combinations. Broadly speaking, chocolate, coffee and nut granitas can be eaten together, as can all fruits.Coffees around €2; granitas start from €5.

During the warm conversation, Romito, who is one of Italy’s most visionary chefs and whoseRistorante Realein Abruzzo has three Michelin stars, spoke about the first time he ate at Tassa’sNu’ Trattoria Italiana dal 1960in Acuto, which is in the province of Frosinone about an hour south of Rome. Romito recalled the homely atmosphere and Tassa as an old-school host: welcoming, communicative and the conduit (which didn’t sound pretentious when he said it) between local traditions, producers and those who came to eat. But Romito also described a dish of onions, simply braised, but of such goodness that he couldn’t stop thinking about and imagining them. In fact, Romito credits those onions as being the starting point for one of his own most well-known dishes: “absolute” onion broth with parmesan-filled pasta and toasted saffron. Tassa returned the affection and respect, before both chefs reminded those of us listening that everything begins and ends with the ingredients.On the bus on the way home, I kept thinking about Romito thinking about those braised onions, which led me to think about the times I have left a table in a trattoria, restaurant, cafe, pub, chip shop or friend’s housereallythinking about something. And how those thoughts are quite rare and completely different from simply remembering a dish or liking something; they are vivid and intrusive thoughts. The deep-fried mashed potato and mozzarella ball from the canteen just under our flat last week; the gravy around the liver and onions at a local trattoria; hazelnuts on the salad at the same trattoria; a plate of green beans that tasted like butter; the honey dressing on a salad that has been nagging me since January.This week’s column is an attempt to deal with some of that nagging by combining elements of two salads that have stayed with me like an anxious memory. The first is the bitter greens and toasted hazelnut salad at a trattoria calledPiatto Romanohere in Testaccio, while the second is the radicchio, almond, gorgonzola and honey salad fromBocca di Lupoin Soho, London. I did feel a bit like Romito, taking the inspiration into my kitchen, although I can’t claim to have invented anything. I can confirm, though, that there is no better way to dress a salad than with hands (very clean or covered with those very thin rubber gloves), because it means every single leaf gets the benefit of the dressing. You can use any leaves, but a mixture of something crisp such as romaine, little gem or beluga chicory alongside the softer leaves of round radicchio all work well. And look out for creamiergorgonzola dolce(sweet) rather than the firmergorgonzolapiccante(sharp).Alongside bread, and with the option of more cheese, this salad is a light meal for two; it also goes well with roast chicken, baked potatoes or alongside a couple of other salads. I would suggest putting it with deep-fried potato balls, but I have not worked through that thought yet.Salad with hazelnuts, gorgonzola and honey dressingServes2-41 romaine lettuce, or two little gems1 small headradicchio6 tbspextra-virgin olive oil1 tbsp honey1 tbspred-wine vinegar1 tspdijon mustardSalt100g toasted hazelnuts150ggorgonzola dolce,broken into small piecesBreak all the lettuce into leaves, wash them in cold water, dry thoroughly, then rip into bite-sized pieces.Working in a large bowl, use a balloon whisk to mix the olive oil, honey, red-wine vinegar, dijon mustard, a teaspoon of warm water and a pinch of salt into an emulsified dressing, adjusting to taste.Add the leaves to the bowl and toss really well so every leaf is coated – your hands are easily the best tool for this. Add half the nuts and half the cheese, then gently toss again.Tip the dressed salad on to a large plate, scatter over the remaining cheese and nuts, and serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsSaladA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkCheeseNuts and seedsMain courseSide dishesrecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Today there are some 80 wineries in operation in the Bekaa, most of them with a decided focus on French grapes – cabernet sauvignon, cinsault, merlot, sauvignon blanc and chardonnay all get a lot of love – but native grapes such asobaideh,merwah, jandali and hamdali also feature in the production of wine and arak, a distilled anise spirit.The best of these wineries are defined by their altitude. Whereas the areas by the coast are flat and hot, and perhaps too much so to produce complex wines, the more mountainous regions of Mount Lebanon, Jezzine, Batroun and the Bekaa valley are able to yield wines of good quality. The higher altitude allows for a distinct diurnal temperature range – that is, the difference between day and night temperatures in the vineyard – and a large range can allow grapes to develop properly (heat in the day to ripen the grapes and coolness at night to train acidity).The outlier for these modern, prestige wines is, by far, the renownedChâteau Musar, which may well be the first and only Lebanese wine many of us have tried. Inspired by his travels to Bordeaux, Gaston Hochar first planted vines on what became the Musar estate back in 1930, and during the Lebanese civil war, his eldest son Serge switched the winery’s focus to exports, especially to the UK, a move credited for its prominence in the west today. That’s why you can now find Musar at many prestige importers, as well as a couple of supermarkets.Musar’s is a story defined by a Lebanon at war, which continues to this day – last year, the eastern Bekaa valley was one of the areas most severely affected by Israeli air strikes – but this is not something that will define Lebanese wine, insistsHenna Bakshi, an award-winning wine journalist who has reported extensively on war-zone wines: “No region will ever want to be known for war,” she says. “We must understand that – this is historical context. The quality of wine coming from the region, despite the impossible, is still absolutely incredible. I’d suggest blind tasting top Lebanese producers to understand the quality of their winewithoutthe context.”Local winemakers are finding new ways to overcome adversity, too: “During airstrikes last year, Eddie Chami ofMersel Winelost all power and electricity,” Bakshi says, “and he was making wine with a headlamp; he [even]documented it on video, and on one of his Instagram stories you could hear the drones in the background.” For more on how Lebanese winemakers are being affected by war, I’d very much recommendBakshi’s account for Wine Enthusiast,which details how, amid all the unpredictability, life goes on.Four Lebanese wines to exploreChâteau Oumsiyat Mijana£9.75 Waitrose, 13%.
