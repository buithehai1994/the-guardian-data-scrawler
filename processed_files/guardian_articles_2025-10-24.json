Though a deal has not yet been finalised, Deadline reported that talks were at “an advanced stage”, with the idea that it will broadcast when Norton’s show is off air.Sources told the Daily Mail that theBBCconsidered a primetime chatshow one of its main priorities, and was aiming for a “glitzy super high-end” show, that was “Jonathan Ross-esque” but more “classy” and was prepared to “throw huge sums” to attract the biggest stars. “It’s the perfect job for Claudia,” one said, and would catapult her into the stratosphere.View image in fullscreenTess Daly and Claudia Winkleman triumphed in the entertainment programme category at the Bafta TV awards last year.Photograph: Sarah M Lee/The GuardianWinkleman, the daughter of the former newspaper editor Eve Pollard and her first husband, Barry Winkleman, started as a travel writer after graduating from the University of Cambridge with a degree in history of art, before moving to broadcasting.She served a long television apprenticeship before becoming one of the BBC’s primetime jewels. Her early CV included appearances on the topical regional programme Central Weekend, the BBC series Holiday, stints on ITV’s This Morning and the cable channel Live TV, as well as the BBC Three entertainment news show Liquid News.The broadcaster and Guardian writer Mark Lawson said Winkleman was “great” but might not excel in different formats, particularly a chatshow. “The crucial thing in broadcasting is that no presenter is better than the format that they have. That’s an unbreakable rule,” he said. “WithStrictly Come Dancing, The Traitors and The Piano, she’s got three of the most successful formats of the last 20 years.“And, why does everyone come to her to do these formats? The reason is she’s an unusually unobtrusive presenter, so she has relatively little ego.“She has the sense, and also the personality, to get out of the way of the format and let it thrive. And I think that’s crucial to her success.”On reports of a chatshow, he said: “I think she needs to be careful with that. Because that has to be about you. You have to be driving it and controlling it, and I think she possibly hasn’t enough of an ego.”The PR expert Mark Borkowski said: “I remember I used to go into Liquid News. It was orientated towards a smart, younger audience, Paddy O’Connell used to be on it. It was a really interesting place for some of the BBC talent who are now pretty well established and have matured like great wine.“And I always thought she was so smart, so on it. That’s part of what she offers at the moment.” Few people could carry live TV well, he added. “But you can see it in her. Whip smart, delivered without any of that barbed cynicism you get from social media.”Winkleman, who has said of herself: “I’m a tiny orange lady and my fringe is too long,” has presented dating shows, film programmes, Fame Academy, Eurovision selection shows and The Great British Sewing Bee. She initially joined Strictly in 2005 to host the companion show Strictly: It Takes Two before moving to the main show in 2014, replacing Bruce Forsyth.She has three children aged between 12 and 21 with her husband, the film producer Kris Thykier, and has juggled Strictly with the juggernaut that is The Traitors, Channel 4’s The Piano, and, up until last year, a BBC Radio 2 weekend show.View image in fullscreenWinkleman on the red carpet with her husband, Kris Thykier.Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images for BFICelebrity Traitors, currently the BBC’s most watched reality TV show, is pulling in approximately 11 million viewers, to the delight of BBC bosses.Borkowski said: “She’s great on Traitors at juggling that tension and the silliness with surgical precision. She’s got this calm that you need in the storm of this type of reality TV. She’s unflappable, witty, super smart and not over-exposed.”In a world seemingly flooded with reality TV contestants and influencers, “in this general malaise of mediocrity”, he said, she stood out. “In terms of the unscripted space, she’s an absolute star.”“She is emblematic, really of where real talent should be aiming for,” Borkowski said, adding that she had cross-generational appeal, particularly to women.Claudia Winkleman on swearing, success and secrets: ‘I had to sign a contract promising not to sing’Read more“One crucial thing. She has got an incredible stylist. And in this world of Instagram and visual aesthetics, she has really delivered. The sheen gloss black hair, everything about her look is so on brand and idiosyncratic. It does feel she’s not copying anybody else. There are no precursors to her. She is what she is and that’s very rare.”He could see her making the transatlantic leap, followingJames Corden and others who have found success in America.Though reportedly no final handshake has been made on the chatshow deal, the BBC is said to hope it will keep her from the clutches of ITV. She has previously filled in for Norton on his show.Her next move would be crucial, said Borkowski. “Because when you have had two major successes – Strictly and Traitors – the next format is all. Success rides the hamster-wheel of success. So the next move will absolutely be crucial. And I think she can do what she wants really. She’s in the right zone of people who are going to bring the right thing to her, and it’s her choice, really.”Explore more on these topicsClaudia WinklemanStrictly Come DancingBBCReality TVTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

An unpleasant surprise lay in storeWill HaywardPredictions of a Reform win were wide of the mark. But Labour’s crushing byelection defeat offers important lessons tooFri 24 Oct 2025 07.16 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 21.31 EDTShareSeveral historic things have just happened at once in Wales. Plaid Cymruwon in the Caerphilly byelectionfor our Senedd, with almost 50% of the vote. Reform lost. Labour collapsed. Each of those things means something significant for Wales, but it also carries valuable lessons for the rest of Britain. The message for Labour ought to be clear: standing up to the hard right can win elections.Labour has been the largest party in Wales for over 100 years, leading the Welsh government since the start of devolution in 1999. Itwon the Caerphilly seatin 2021 with 46% of the vote. Four years later, it has ended up with just 11%. The drop is startling, but to make matters worse, under the new Senedd election system that will be introduced in May 2026, 11% is roughly the level where parties can be totally wiped out.The system is proportional, but it brutally punishes smaller parties that slip beneath the 11% threshold. It seemsLabournever imagined it would be this small.Given the huge challenges this system has created for Labour, one might hope its UK leader would provide, well, leadership. Yetat no point in the entire byelection campaign did Keir Starmer visit the constituency. Labour has enjoyed more than 100 years of electoral success in Wales, and Welsh Labour has been hailed as the democratic world’s“most successful election-winning machine.”At a time when Starmer risks being the first Labour leader to lose Wales, the prime minister either felt he would be an electoral liability or he wasn’t bothered to show up. Either way, this helped to seal the party’s fate.UK Labour have long taken Wales, the most stable brick in its red wall, for granted. Yet the party’s support has been crumbling for years, without it even realising. In the aftermath of the result I have heard Labour people talk about the need for a change of messaging, for the party tobecome more criticalof Plaid’s stance on Welsh independence, for instance, or to differentiate Welsh Labour from UK Labour. While this is undoubtedly needed it misses the fundamental issue here – that for a very long time Welsh Labour has ceased to be visibly improving the lives of people in Wales.Forget changing messaging. Labour controls the Welsh and UK parliaments. It will never be better equipped than it is right now to make change. It should be making meaningful change in the present,by bringing downNHS waiting lists in Walesso they’re level with those in England,or giving Walesthe funds it has lostas a result of HS2.Then we have Reform. I was at the count last night. Reform supporters came in like princelings heading to a collective coronation. The bookies certainly backed them. As the polls closed, a £10 bet on a Reform win would have bagged you a tidy £2.50 profit. But within an hour, it became very clear thatPlaid Cymruknew it had this in the bag. Reform’s candidate Llŷr Powell (who Farage calls “Welsh Dave” because he seemingly struggles with Llŷr) struck a sad figure. Farage himself, who had been in Caerphilly all day seemingly to celebrate Welsh Dave’s victory, was nowhere to be seen at the count itself.Reform threw a huge amount of resources at this byelection. Llŷr Powell told me that his party was callingWales“ground zero” and was excited to show favoured journalists reams of constituency data displayed on screens in the office that it was using to target its campaign.Even though Caerphilly has thelowest rates of immigrationamong Wales’ 22 local authorities (over 97% of people there were born in the UK), Reform still put asylum and immigration at the heart of its campaign. It lamented the Welsh government’s “nation of sanctuary” policy, which is overwhelmingly targeted at helping Ukraine refugees and takes up just 0.038% of the Welsh government’s budget. This was hardly a winning strategy (Reform finished up with 36% of the vote compared to Plaid’s 47%). The party was also betting that it would get significant turnout from politically disengaged voters. The problem is that those voters sometimes live up to their name.By contrast, Plaid Cymru did well for a variety of reasons. It had a strong local candidate who had been a local councillor for 50 years and successfully pushed the narrative that it was the way to stop Reform. But perhaps its biggest selling point was its unequivocal opposition to, and rejection of, all that Reform has stood for. Whereas Keir Starmer’s UK Labour has seemingly tried to woo Reform voters who are simply never coming back by accepting the premise of Nigel Farage’s positions, Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid’s leader,has been unequivocal in his rejection of this ideology, saying that the real problem isn’t immigration, but the government’srefusalto properly target billionaires.In general Welsh people sit to the left of the centre. Some 60% of votes cast in the Caerphilly byelection were for left-of-centre parties: Plaid, Labour, the Greens and Lib Dems. Many of these voters are utterly terrified about the rise of the extreme right. Plaid portrayed itself as a bulwark against this, but it also did something that Labour failed to do and made this opposition a central part of its identity. Starmer has never quite managed to see Reform down with the gusto that is required.But the true battle for Wales isn’t in Caerphilly. It willtake place in May next yearwhen all of Wales is up for grabs in the Senedd elections. It’s unlikely that Reform will be able to win a majority (having a proportional system to keep out extremists is another valuable lesson to be learned from this byelection). But even if Reform does the same as it did last night, it will end up with about 30 members of the Senedd, each with four members of staff. This is an immense amount of publicly funded resources to target a forthcoming UK election.Caerphilly has shown that Reform can be beaten. The rest of UK desperately needs to learn the lessons from what transpired in south Wales last night.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnist.

(Harbour has not responded to the album’s contents.)In aninterview this week with Katie Grand’s Perfect magazine, Allen admitted that the record was likely to further stoke her tempestuous relationship with the media.“I don’t make it easy for myself, do I?” she said. Still, beyond the obvious tabloid catnip contained within the album – including lyrics about discovering “sex toys, butt plugs, lube inside / Hundreds of Trojans” (condoms) on the song Pussy Palace – some newspapers have bordered on sharply personal criticism when covering West End Girl. The headline on the Times’ review stated: “You almost feel sorry for David Harbour.” In a 2/5 review, the Financial Times accused Allen of “a hollow performance”.Otherwise, Allen’s return to music, seven years after the release of her last album, No Shame, was greeted with widespread acclaim – and due consideration for its musical virtues. In afour-star review, the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis wrote: “What ties the songs together beyond the story they tell is the striking prettiness of the tunes, which seem, jarringly, more evocative of a romantic fairytale ending than the anger and unhappiness the lyrics convey.”View image in fullscreenWhile Allen’s latest drop references her marital breakdown, the singer says it is not ‘all gospel’.Photograph: Charlie DenisIn another four-star review, the Telegraph praised the technicalities of Allen’s writing: “The power of West End Girl lies in the way it clearly presents itself as one side of the story: a woman trapped in her own head. Narrative tension builds because listeners can’t pull out for a wider perspective on the situation, allowing us to share in Allen’s claustrophobia and paranoia.” The Daily Mail’s four-star take said it sat alongside Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours, Amy Winehouse’s Back to Black and Adele’s 21 in the annals of great pop breakup albums.Lily Allen: West End Girl – a gobsmacking autopsy of marital betrayalRead moreThe Independent awarded it five stars, and highlighted the relatability of Allen’s themes – not just hyperpersonal disclosure, but an illustration of “how easy it is, in love, to drown in someone else’s shame and mistake it for your own”.Petridis also drew on how Allen’s fans may have grown up alongside her and relate to the story she tells about modern relationships: “Underneath all the gory details, it seems to tacitly suggest that open arrangements are easily abused, usually by men, and that believing you’re above outmoded concepts of fidelity – ‘a modern wife’, as Allen puts it at one point – is no guarantee you won’t get your heart broken.”The fan response on the Popheads subreddit and the Popjustice forums – two of the busiest and most ardent destinations for pop discussion online – was almost uniformly positive. One viral tweet likened the album to Lorde’s cultishly adored second album, about the tempestuous rites of first heartbreak: “Can’t believe Lily Allen is about to drop the Melodrama for divorced white British women over 40.”View image in fullscreenAllen married David Harbour in 2020.Photograph: Vianney Le Caer/Invision/APHow the acclaim informs what Allen does next remains to be seen. No Shame received similar levels of praise but was her lowest-selling album – although her 2006 debut Alright, Still was released in the pre-streaming era, making it tricky to compare on an even playing field. She has not announced any tour dates in support of the record, and hasn’t played live since 2019. In September, she said that she was temporarily stepping away from Miss Me?, the highly successful BBC podcast she presented with childhood friend Miquita Oliver, “while I go and do some new stuff for a bit” – presumably the album.Lily Allen’s West End Girl is funny, sexy, jawdropping – and forged in the fires of tabloid Britain | Jennifer Jasmine WhiteRead moreIn the break since Allen released and toured No Shame, she has found success as a theatrical actor. The opening song and title track of West End Girl appears to document Allen discovering that she has landed the lead role in 2:22 A Ghost Story at the Noël Coward theatre in 2021, which necessitated her to move from her adopted family home in New York back to London, and the cracks it apparently created in her marriage. She earned excellent reviews and aLaurence Olivier award nominationfor best actress for her performance.Allen subsequently starred in a revival of Martin McDonagh’s play The Pillowman as well as Hedda, a reimagining of the Henrik Ibsen play directed by Matthew Dunster.For now, Allen has no more roles on the cards. One she can play, though, is that of godmother to a new wave of younger pop stars forged in her image. In 2022, the US star Olivia Rodrigo invited Allen on stage with her at Glastonbury to cover the latter’s 2008 song, Fuck You, which they dedicated to the US supreme court justices whooverturned Roe v Wade. Billie Eilish is a fan; her unbarred, conversational delivery is audible in the output of Charli xcx and Lola Young.As UK producer PinkPantheress put it: “Lily Allen made sounding like yourself feel cool.” On West End Girl, she certainly doesn’t sound like anyone else.Explore more on these topicsLily AllenPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It might be the best chance Britons have of reckoning with the TroublesJonathan FreedlandThe reaction to the Bloody Sunday trial makes it clear: those of us outside Northern Ireland just don’t understand the painful legacy of this brutal conflictFri 24 Oct 2025 11.17 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 15.15 EDTShareForgive me if I’ve mentioned him before, but at moments like this I remember a news editor I worked for as a young reporter at the BBC. When it came to the interests of our audience, he said, there was a key fact to bear in mind: “The two most boring words in the English language are ‘Northern Ireland’.”It was an attitude with a long history. In 1924, Viscount Cranbourne, the fifth Marquess of Salisbury, mused that the average English voter has “little interest in, and less understanding of, Irish affairs”. This week brought some evidence that, 101 years later, much of his observation still holds true. But a challenge to it has come from an unlikely quarter, via what might be one of the most compelling TV dramas of recent years.Start with that gap between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. On Thursday the verdict came down in the Bloody Sunday trial, where the judge – there was no jury –acquitted the British paratrooperknown only as Soldier F on all charges, including two counts of murder and five of attempted murder.The court did not dispute that British soldiers had opened fire on unarmed civilians during a civil rights protest in Derry on 30 January 1972, but the culpability of one individual for the crime of murder – a premeditated, intentional killing – could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. It didn’t help that much of the prosecution case had rested on the word of two of the accused’s fellow soldiers, who were “proven liars” in the words of the local, nationalist MP, nor that crucial evidence had gone missing. It meant that, even though the judge said that those responsible for the massacre of Bloody Sunday “should hang their heads in shame”, the evidence before him had signally failed “to reach the high standard of proof required in a criminal case”. The law demanded an acquittal.View image in fullscreenAndi Osho, Dearbhaile McKinney and Katherine Devlin in Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/PAFor most UK-wide news organisations, this was a story of chiefly historic interest: it was the fourth item on the 10pm BBC news bulletin, just ahead of Tess and Claudia leaving Strictly. But you had only to dip into thecoverage on BBC Radio Ulsteras the news broke to realise the emotional intensity of this event in Northern Ireland. The talk there was of unhealed wounds, of trauma that lives on down the generations, and of a justice that would never come.Most raw was the fury of the families of those killed on that long-ago day on the Bogside. They had applauded in 2010 when David Cameron greeted the findings of the 12-year long Saville inquiry into Bloody Sunday with a declaration that the killings were “unjustified and unjustifiable”, but they wanted more. They wanted those killings to be officially branded as murder. That was the vindication they had hoped this trial would deliver, and it had failed them.They said that was because impunity had been built in from the start. The police did not investigate the killings when they happened; there had been a cosy, “tea-and-sandwiches” arrangement between the army and those who should have held them to account. Saville should have opened the door to perjury charges, at the very least; but even those had not materialised. For Aoife Moore, the niece of one of the dead, the verdict was a “kick in the teeth to the families … and we don’t have many teeth left to kick out.” It was of a piece withBloody Sundayitself: confirmation of the British state’s disregard for nationalist lives.Meanwhile, outside the court, supporters of Soldier F had also gathered, protesting against what they saw as the hounding of old men who had merely done what they were ordered to do. Unionist leaders railed against “two-tier justice”, which put a British squaddie on trial but has left so many IRA crimes unpunished. Others spoke of those bereaved by terrorism who have never received the bodies of their loved ones, killed decades earlier.View image in fullscreenRelatives and supporters of the victims of the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre march to Belfast crown court, 23 October 2025.Photograph: Peter Morrison/APWhat was audible on Thursday was a kind of justice envy between and even within communities. Unionist families who feel their pain has been overlooked; other nationalist families who say that at least the dead of Bloody Sunday had their day in court, while their own dead have been all but forgotten.The point is, in Northern Ireland none of this is in the past. It lives on in people’s day-to-day lives; it still demarcates the streets, it is still etched on faces. That small place, home to fewer than 2 million people, endured a vicious, often dirty civil war for 30 years that ended only three decades ago. Of course it lives on.And yet, that simple fact is striking many Britons only now. Older Brits tuned it out at the time – remember my news editor – and many younger ones have been unaware of the shadow it continues to cast. What’s brought it into view, at long last, is an exceptionally good TV show.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a police drama, about rookie cops in a Belfast station. It only takes a few episodes for the viewer to become attached to the likes of Gerry, playing country music in his patrol car, Stevie, savouring his home-cooked snacks, or former social worker Grace, who believes human empathy is not a liability for a police officer but an asset. And there are moments of tension that will have you holding your breath.But whatsets Blue Lights apartis the permanent, lingering presence of the Northern Irish past. The old republican and loyalist factions have morphed now into criminal gangs, these days supplying drugs rather than slogans (though the guns remain). Police officers still have to look under their cars for bombs; agents of the British state, some old enough to have fought the old war, still look to recruit “touts” who will inform on their supposed comrades.One storyline tells of “Happy” Kelly, a lonely, middle-aged man who actively wants to get arrested. At first glance, he seems to be one of the many people with a mental illness who the response officers somehow have to manage. Slowly, we learn that, as a boy back in the early 1970s, Happy had witnessed the loyalist bombing of a chip shop in which both his father and brother were killed. He blames himself, because it had been his idea to get chips. The agony of it has never left him; it has shaped his life. Eventually, he and we learn that it is not only the men who planted the bomb who bear responsibility for that terrible crime.All of this is woven in among the break-ins and road traffic accidents that make up daily police work. But through it, British TV audiences are discovering what they either didn’t know or had never really confronted: that part of the UK has a murderous war in its collective, living and recent memory. The people of Northern Ireland are still wrestling with the ghosts of what were so understatedly called the Troubles. For them the tension between justice and peace – the sacrifice of one so often the price of the other – is a living, ever-present reality. The least the rest of us can do is listen – and watch.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBloody SundayOpinionNorthern IrelandDerryNorthern Irish politicsMilitarycommentShareReuse this content"

As he stars in killer-nanny thriller Malice, David Duchovny talks art, his beef with Gillian Anderson – and going up against Jack WhitehallFri 24 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 10.46 EDTShareHalfway through our hour-long conversation,David Duchovnyslumps in his seat a little then gently chastises me. “I got tired while you were talking,” he groans. In fairness, I had been talking a lot, but only because I was trying to list everything he’s managed to do in the past year.There’s his podcast,Fail Better, in which he’s wrung incredibly candid interviews from notoriously reticent stars like Alec Baldwin and Robert Downey Jr, more on which later. There’s his book of poetry, About Time, which came out last month. There’s his History Channel show Secrets Declassified With David Duchovny. As we speak, he’s just finished an eight-date tour, where he performed songs from the three folk-rock albums he’s released over the last decade. We are ostensibly here to discuss Malice, his new Prime Video series. Had we spoken a couple of weeks later, God knows how many new projects he would have flung himself into. In other words, no wonder he’s tired.View image in fullscreen‘Doing standup is the most terrifying situation’, says Duchovny.Photograph: Michael Wharley/AmazonBut Malice is a good place to start. A six-part psychological thriller partly set in Greece, it’s a series where Duchovny’s boorish wealthy venture capitalist and his family are terrorised by a deranged nanny played by, of all people,Jack Whitehall. I have to confess that, at first glimpse, the premise sounded a little like one of those made-for-TV movies Channel 5 broadcasts on weekday afternoons. However, Malice was written by James Wood – the man who created the all-time great sitcom Rev – so its tone is enjoyably sharp and ripe. And anyone possessed with a desperate need to see David Duchovny’s buttocks will be fully satisfied within the first five minutes.“I hate that that’s the introduction to the character,” he grimaces when reminded of this. “That’s not the way it goes. That’s not who this guy is gonna be. But I guess that’s OK.”Duchovny’s character ends up forming a key part of the central mystery. “This isn’t a whodunnit, because you know who did it straight off the bat,” Duchovny smiles. “And I was scared about this at first. Like, who’s going to continue to watch if we give it away?” Instead, the mystery revolves more about motive than victim, although saying any more would give too much away.Duchovny is quick to praise Whitehall, whose appearance is his first serious dramatic role. “If comedians commit to the acting part of acting, they’re some of the best actors,” he says of Whitehall’s uncanny creepiness. “Doing standup is the most terrifying situation, standing with a bunch of people and having to make them laugh. They can be very brave people.”You could argue that Duchovny is just as courageous. The bulk of his work outside acting revolves around a form of intensely personal bloodletting, allowing him to probe his demons in a manner that his acting career doesn’t allow. Part of the reason he’s able to get his Fail Better guests to open up so freely is his willingness to go there first. He convinced Downey Jr to talk about his period of addiction and incarceration – a subject that has previously caused him to walk out of interviews – by mentioning his own experiences with AA.His interview withGillian Anderson, with whom he had a fractious relationship during the filming of The X-Files, is revelatory; an hour of two people discussing things that had been deliberately left unsaid for decades, from Duchovny’s unwillingness to support Anderson’s request for equal pay to their failure to inform each other about their desire to leave the series.View image in fullscreenSurf’s up … Duchovny with Carice van Houten and Jack Whitehall (far right) in Malice.Photograph: AmazonWhat’s more, his poetry book is sometimes so intimate it’s almost uncomfortable to read. One poem, Dead Seven, concerns the death of his father; another describes the moment he had to reckon with the sight of a dead mouse during a walk with his three-year-old daughter (“It is Daddy who cannot face too much death,” he writes).The introduction of the book states that “Poetry is not useful. And that is exactly why we need it.” More than anything, this sentiment feels like it informs Duchovny’s entire worldview; that a meandering search for personal fulfilment will always outshine relentless careerism. “I have young kids who are entering the workforce, and it just seems so much bleaker than it was when I was their age,” he says. “When they were in school, everything was all about ‘How is this useful? How is this going to be used?’ Everything is used. Everything is efficient. And it’s moral. Like, if you can’t use it, there must be something wrong with it. Imagine not having to worry about whether we can make money off this thing and it’s just the thing that we’re playing at.”As such, he says, his writing and music and podcasting represent a form of play. “I like to play different games,” he says. “I take play very seriously, but I don’t want to be a pretentious asshole either.”Duchovny describes Malice as “a bingey thing,” with all six episodes available at the same time. It’s a far cry from the role that made him famous, as Fox Mulder in The X-Files, on which he worked for 10 months a year for seven years. As soon as I bring it up, I feel slightly guilty; surely every time Duchovny sits down with anyone he must sense in the pit of his stomach that the subject is bound to come up.View image in fullscreenDavid Duchovny as Jamie Tanner and Jack Whitehall as Adam in Malice.Photograph: Yannis Drakoulidis“It’s not the pit of my stomach, but it’s like, I probably don’t have anything to say about it,” he shrugs. I marvel at the fact thatThe X-Fileswas a product of the old network days, where seasons would run for 25 episodes, then have another 25 ready for the same time next year. “It’s unthinkable now,” he nods. “You look at something as great as Game of Thrones or even The Sopranos. We did over 200 episodes, and they’ve done 60 or 70. And that’s not to denigrate them at all. I mean, that’s fantastic artistic work, but the sheer volume is something to be impressed by as well.”What’s even more impressive to him is the fact that every X-Files episode had to stand alone. “It’s really a testament to the writers’ room, and to [creator] Chris Carter,” he says. “We’re not even talking about 25 episodes of Law and Order, where you need a case each week. We’re talking about 25 episodes that could each stand as a movie. I’m glad I only had to memorise the fucking lines.”This, the fact that the show went on so long and maintained such high standards, seems to be the thing that gives him the greatest sense of pride. “Nobody gives awards for that,” he says. “Nobody gives awards by cross-referencing quantity with quality. But I think they should. In my mind, I giveChris Carterand the writers’ room awards, and I give Gillian and I awards for the amount of work it took to do 25 episodes in 10 months. Nobody gives awards for how hard it was to do that show. But I know it.”Duchovny left The X-Files after seven seasons. Although this was partly down to tiredness, he also started to feel boxed in by the phenomenon the show had become. “When I first got off The X-Files, it was like, ‘I just want to make art, and I only want 100 people to like it.’ I was reacting against this global embrace. I was like, ‘Oh, never again. I’m gonna do arty things and little theatres and make a really unpopular TV show.’”View image in fullscreenBack in the day … Duchovny as Fox Mulder with Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully in The X Files.Photograph: 20th Century Fox Television/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockArguably, it was the best move he could have made. Although he went on to star in another long-running show (Californication, popular enough to win him a Golden Globe), walking away from a show like The X-Files at the peak of its global success has given him both the space and the courage to show us who he really is.He admits he’s still torn between the safety of a television set, with its schedules and its routine and its money, and the more adventurous avenues of his career where he’s willing to give more of himself to a potentially smaller audience. “I approach the smaller stuff almost like mom and pop stuff, because I control it all,” he says. “And then you contrast that with something like The X-Files or a big Amazon show which isnotmom and pop.”“For me, at this point, it’s always about trying to find that thing that speaks to me,” he continues. “And some of the projects I do speak less audibly to me, but they’re interesting in terms of life. You know, I think saying yes gets you further than saying no.”Looking at everything he’s done, not just in this last year but over the past three decades, it feels like this might be Duchovny’s motto. “Saying no might get you a coherent career,” he smiles, “but saying yes gets you an adventurous one.”Malice is on Prime Video from 14 November.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaDavid DuchovnyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Often, you’re meeting up with someone you barely know, or have never met. Will the conversation sparkle or will it fall flat? Will they look like their picture? And what’s their name again?It can be fun meeting someone new, no matter what the outcome. Yet it’s hard not to get one’s hopes up. Many have experienced that sinking feeling when reality falls dramatically short of expectations.Here, 10 readers share the excruciating details of a disastrous first date.A bird flew into the wall and landed dead in front of usGeoff, GeorgiaGeoff’s first date with one girl bombed after a freak avian intervention.“We had a fantastic evening and hit it off extremely well,” he says. “We were enjoying a very nice extended goodnight kiss when a bird flew into the wall above and landed, dead, right in our faces.”“She decided that no matter how well our date went, it was a bad omen. She never returned any of my calls for a second date. Alas.”His teeth flew out of his mouth and landed in my spaghettiCristine, 68, Arizona, artistCristine had just moved to San Diego after her divorce when a co-worker asked her out to lunch in the 1990s.“I wasn’t interested in dating,” says Cristine. “However, I agreed because he was my superior and because I was hungry.I don’t like dating apps – I went to a ‘flirting party’ insteadRead more“He leaned forward, said something enthusiastically, and his partial denture flew out of his mouth across the table, landing perfectly in my spaghetti.“He reached across and with his fingers retrieved his teeth, putting them back into his mouth without a hint of embarrassment or apology and continued talking.I never agreed to another lunch date with him, and thankfully, he was transferred within weeks of the oh so horrifying yet hysterical incident.”A truck ran over both my legs and my midsectionDavid, 59, California, general contractorA gentle bike ride should have been the perfect date, but it ended up putting a 25-year-old David in the hospital.“It was a beautiful day and the views of San Francisco and the Pacific Ocean couldn’t be matched,” he says. “We were going to grab lunch via a ride under the bridge towards east Fort Baker.”As they descended the hill, David saw a truck driving on the wrong side of the road straight towards him.“Horrified, I tried to ride off the road,” he says. “It all happened so fast and the truck ran over my legs and midsection with both sets of tyres. Needless to say the date ended abruptly.”David sustained broken bones and other injuries, and had to endure four operations and a two-month stay in hospital.His date was “very kind” and visited him in the hospital.“We never saw each other after that,” he adds. “Luckily, things turned out well for me, and I am still physically active due to modern medicine!”He suggested a hike even though I was on crutchesAllison, 44, Georgia,PhD researcher (statistician)Allison had been chatting with and messaging a man for a few weeks and decided to go on a date with him. However, she stressed that she was on crutches after surgery and would not be able to do anything too active.When he picked her up, he suggested a “fun” surprise, which turned out to be a “short hike” to a monument.“After about 1km, my crutch slipped, I tumbled – my leg was in a full brace, so it couldn’t bend, and I landed hard on my other side,” says Allison. “My wrist was throbbing and I had tears in my eyes.“He said to me, ‘I thought your profile claimed you were athletic!’ and told me I should return to the car, while he finished the walk and took a photo of the monument, so the day wasn’t wasted.Allison adds: “Thirty minutes after he dropped me off, he texted a selfie at the monument and said he thought I might want to see what I missed out on. My friend said, drily, ‘a bullet’.”She freaked out at my haphazard drivingJohn, 72, Atwater, California, retiredA simple trip to a restaurant went terribly wrong when John, unfamiliar with the city traffic in Wichita, made a potentially treacherous traffic turn.“I went the wrong way on a one-way ramp,” says John, who was about 19 at the time. “It had been pretty awkward anyway, but that was the thing that finally tipped the balance. My date freaked out and said to take her home.“I came from a place that had only 200 people living there so I didn’t have that much experience with that sort of traffic and I’m also a haphazard driver.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I never figured out if he had chaps for riding and left them on the bike with his helmet.”He asked a witch to predict if I liked himLouisa, 25, CaliforniaDuring her date back in February, Louisa’s date asked if she was having a good time. “I said that while I was having an OK time, I didn’t really feel a romantic connection.“He said he understood and then there was silence for a bit,” she says. Then he said he hadn’t been sure if she liked him, so he hired an Etsy witch to divine the truth.“The Etsy witch told him I did not (something about negative energy surrounding me when I thought of him) and tried to sell him a spell to make me like him, which thankfully he didn’t buy.”He berated me about my profileAliyaa, 68, Michigan, retiredFifteen years ago, Aliyaa matched up with someone on a matrimonial website and agreed to meet for coffee. Her tongue-in-cheek dating profile tagline – “brilliant, drop-dead gorgeous, and filthy rich” – would come back to haunt her.“I saw a man older than me in a muscle shirt leaning up against his sporty ride, like some young heartbreaker,” she says. “I think I was hoping that he wasn’t my date.”But he walked up to her and introduced himself.‘I chose red’: why these brides ditched the white wedding dress for colorful gownsRead more“We went into the café, and I endured 15 minutes of him showing me photos of his ostentatious house and bragging about his wealth, intelligence, athletic prowess, and so on,” says Aliyaa. “He concluded by berating me about my profile, telling me that I had far too high an opinion of myself, and I was terribly average.“I abruptly stood up and stuck my hand out like a CEO and said, ‘Well, it has been a pleasure meeting with you. The coffee is already paid for – after all, I am filthy rich.’“He looked confused, then broke out into a fake laugh and started to protest that he had misunderstood my profile, but I was already out the door.”I brought wine to a dinner party full of recovering alcoholicsRick, 68, Illinois, retiredRick had been set up with a man by a friend who said they “had a lot in common”.They planned a brunch date for New Year’s Day, but on the afternoon of New Year’s Eve, he invited Rick to a dinner party he was holding. Rick decided to bring a bottle of wine.“When I arrived, I learned that the man and his friends were all recovering alcoholics, so we put the bottle aside,” says Rick, who was in his mid-30s at the time. “Conversation before, during and after dinner was only about their experiences and progress with Alcoholics Anonymous – nothing else. I could add nothing to the conversation except to smile and nod and make encouraging noises.”He decided he would tell the man on their date the next day that it wouldn’t work out. But at brunch, his date had brought a friend.“He told the friend how well we got along and all the things we were going to do,” says Rick. “It seemed cruel to embarrass him by contradicting him in front of a friend, so I mostly stayed quiet.”I had to use my escape planKimberly, 61, Arizona,marketing“When he offered to pick me up and take me to his favourite bar in Chicago, his stock went up a bit,” says Kimberly, 61, from Arizona. “After he downed two drinks to my one in 30 minutes, I raised an eyebrow. But when he finished four drinks to my one and a half, his stock took a major dive.”Kimberly said she was already planning ways to “exit gracefully” when her date rudely snapped his fingers at the bartender to call him over.“I over-tipped the bartender as my date started to complain about various ethnic groups,” she adds. “As I calmly rebutted his claims with a fact or two, my escape plan - going to the restroom to call my best friend to unexpectedly ‘stop by’ - started to become more real.“By then, people sitting next to us at the bar started to put some space between us and them, and I began to feel like I was playing a part in a movie.”It was raining heavily and there were few cabs, but Kimberly grabbed her coat, “walked out and flagged down a cab after a few blocks of cleansing rain”.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyDatingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is understood the prison officer who authorised the release has been removed from duties while an urgent investigation takes place.One prison source described it as a “disaster waiting to happen” because of the high volume of releases being processed by inexperienced staff, with dozens of prisoners serving different tariffs being released at the same time.Recent law changes mean that foreign criminals such as Kebatu can be removed fromEnglandand Wales after serving a shorter sentence than domestic criminals. Kebatu was automatically eligible for immediate removal as soon as he was sentenced because of the time he had already spent on remand.Lammy said there was “no excuse” for the mistaken release, but that Labour had inherited “a collapsing prison system”.He said: “Let us be clear, we inherited a collapsing prison system in which the last government was releasing people early and which our prisons were overflowing.“And, indeed, we have a sentencing bill in parliament seeking to address that issue, and we have stabilised the system.“But that can be no excuse for wrongly releasing an individual, a dangerous individual, into the community.It is understood he had been due to be flown back to Ethiopia “imminently” from the detention centre. Offenders who are subject to deportation are normally transferred by a secure prison van directly to the removal centre.Kebatu was found guilty of committing two counts of sexual assault and one of attempted sexual assault in July, days after arriving in the UK on a small boat and taking up residence at the Bell hotel in Epping.He was also found guilty of one count of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity and one count of harassment without violence, and has been in prison since 23 September.His case triggered protests outside the Bell hotel, which far-right activists sought to exploit, leading to assaults on police officers and 32 arrests.A Prison Service spokesperson said: “We are urgently working with police to return an offender to custody following a release in error at HMP Chelmsford.“Public protection is our top priority and we have launched an investigation into this incident.”The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, said: “The Epping hotel migrant sex attacker … is now walking the streets of Essex. Britain is broken.”The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “Remember: they told you that local mums who protested outside the hotel where this sex attacker stayed were the problem.”Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “It is disgraceful that a dangerous convicted paedophile who attacked a 14-year-old girl has been allowed to vanish. This despicable man is an illegal immigrant who should have been deported immediately he arrived.“This is breathtaking incompetence by David Lammy and Shabana Mahmood [the home secretary]. They have put our children at further risk by letting this dangerous illegal immigrant out on to our streets. They are responsible for anything he may do.“This should never have happened in the first place. Illegal immigrants ought to be deported within a week – but the Labour government is too weak to do that.“Whether it’s a migrantwho had been removed breaking back into the UK, the collapse of the rape gang inquiry, new China spying revelations, record illegal entries and now this – it’s been another litany of failure from the Home Office and home secretary this week.”The Liberal Democrat MP for Chelmsford, Marie Goldman, said she was struggling not to call for HMP Chelmsford’s governor to resign.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumEnglandEssexnewsShareReuse this content"

The humiliating result showed that the party is highly vulnerable to challenges from other progressive parties, as well as from Reform.It provoked renewed anger and concern from some Labour MPs, with one condemning what they called a “totally incoherent” strategy within No 10. “If the national vote acrossWalesin May is even in the ballpark of Caerphilly, there’s absolutely no way we can carry on like we are after that,” one senior backbencher said.Plaid Cymru’s victory in Caerphilly points to a new kind of electorateRead more“Obviously, parties in government struggle in byelections, but when your vote collapses to that extent, someone has got to take responsibility for it. Everyone’s miserable, everyone’s despondent. It’s not as if there is an obvious sort of answer or successor to get us out of this mess. But we’re all pretty clear, we can’t just carry on as we are.”The May elections, which include contests for more than 1,600 council seats across England, as well as for the Welsh and Scottish parliaments, have long been seen as a potential crossroads for Starmer, with some senior ministers predicting he could face a challenge if losses are particularly steep.In Caerphilly, Plaid Cymru’s candidate, Lindsay Whittle, received 15,961 votes, more than 47% of the total, while Reform’s Llŷr Powell, who had been the favourite, was almost 4,000 votes behind.Result graphThe loss is a blow to Reform, especially afterNigel Faragetravelled to the area more than once. But Powell said the race had taught the party valuable lessons before next May: “A big part of what we were trying to do here is to master our campaigning. We’ve trained so many people up on our systems. We’re now a grassroots campaigning party.”While the Labour collapse was widely expected, it has brought practical difficulties – it now holds just 29 of the 60 Senedd seats, making it harder to pass its budget – plus a more existential worry that the party has no answers to the challenge posed by Reform and, increasingly, other parties on the left.Many Labour MPs are worried that even if similar levels of tactical voting can hold off Reform in some areas, the beneficiaries could often be Plaid in Wales, the Scottish National party in Scotland and potentially the Greens or Liberal Democrats in parts of England.“Our strategy is based on the idea we can unify progressive voters around a ‘stop Reform’ campaign,” one MP said. “That works so long as you remain the most viable progressive party. But if people start to think that it’s maybe another party, then suddenly that tactical voting starts to work against Labour and you get punished really badly.”Several MPs said that while they had been buoyed up by Starmer’s passionatespeech to the Labour conferencein late September, in which he talked about leading a “fight for the soul” of the nation against Reform, there had been little to follow this up.“People want to hear not just what Labour stands against, but what it stands for,” one MP said.Another said: “Having managed to somehow stick his head outside the hostage cell, Keir’s captors have got him back inside and have sent out Shabana Mahmood to explain what we’ll do to people of different national origins who live and work in the UK. It is totally incoherent.”Plaid’s win was being put down in part to its clear, passionate call for the people of south Wales to reject Reform’s stance on immigration.View image in fullscreenThe Plaid Cymru leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth (left), walks to the Senedd in Cardiff with Lindsay Whittle after the byelection victory.Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty ImagesRhun ap Iorwerth, the party’s leader, said the people of Caerphilly had chosen “hope over division and progress over the tired status quo”. He added: “We are now the real choice for Wales, the only party able to stop billionaire-backed Reform and offer a better future that works for everyone. Wales is ready for new leadership.”Farage, who did not attend the count, said on social media that he had expected Reform to get 12,000 votes, which it did, but that this was not enough in the face of “the total collapse of the Labour vote to Plaid”, something he said was in part down to the popularity of Whittle, who had been a local councillor for nearly 50 years.Farage added: “The Senedd elections next year are a two-horse race betweenReform UKand Plaid Cymru.”This is a vision shared by many Labour MPs, who are unlikely to be reassured by Downing Street’s words about byelections being “always difficult for incumbent governments”.Another senior Labour MP said Thursday’s result, if replicated in May, “should be a blaring alarm” for a change in leadership. “We can’t just drift through winter on autopilot,” they said. “The loss of Caerphilly is the direct result of the party losing touch with its own voters.”Others were public in their call for change. Mainstream,the newAndy Burnham-backed centre-left Labour grouping, called the result “a tragedy, but not a surprise”, adding: “So long as UK Labour governs without a clear vision, detached from its moral purpose and democratic socialist foundations, losses like this will only become more frequent.”Speaking to the BBC after the result, the Labour Senedd member Alun Davies criticised his party in Westminster for the way it had been speaking about refugees and “using the language of Reform”.But the Cabinet Office minister, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said this was not a debate that could be ducked: “With regard to the issue of the small boats crossing the English Channel and securing our borders, that is because people are saying to us, very clearly, it’s a huge priority for them.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerWelsh politicsByelectionsWalesPlaid CymruReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

In the 2023-24 tax year, 66% of all contributions went into cash savings.Earlier this year,Rachel Reeves paused plansto limit the cash Isa allowance but in the run-up to next month’s budget there has been renewed speculation that it could be reduced to £10,000 in an attempt to promote growth.The Commons Treasury committee said on Saturday that the chancellor should not cut the cash Isa allowance, arguing this was unlikely to encourage people to put their money into the stock market. What was needed instead, the MPs said, was better financial education so people were able to make informed decisions about their savings.In a report based on hearings with experts, the committee quoted Martin Lewis, the founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, who said “this concept that, if you stop people saving in cash, they are going to put money in stocks and shares is false. For people to invest in stocks and shares, you need a cultural change”.How might Rachel Reeves target lawyers, accountants and doctors in her budget?Read moreThe committee heard from building society bosses who warned reducing the cash Isa allowance would have negative effects on homebuyers.They said building societies relied on savings deposits to fund mortgages and the market would become less competitive without the inflows, potentially pushing up rates.Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said the MPs backed the chancellor’s ambition to help savers earn better returns through informed financial decisions, “but we are a long way from that point”.She said: “This is not the right time to cut the cash Isa limit. Instead, the Treasury should focus on ensuring that people are equipped with the necessary information and confidence to make informed investment decisions.”She added that without better financial education she feared “the chancellor’s attempts to transform the UK’s investment culture simply will not deliver the change she seeks, instead hitting savers and mortgage borrowers”.Although the chancellor is not set to deliver her budget until 26 November, speculation as to its contents is already feverish. A possible cut to cash Isa limits is just one measure reportedly under consideration, alongside changes to the tax treatment of limited liability partnerships, changes to stamp duty and inheritance tax and amanifesto-breaking rise in income tax.The financial backdrop to the November statement suggests Reeves will face tough decisions to balance the books. A recent decision by the Office for Budget Responsibility todowngrade its estimatesfor economic productivity is expected to cost the chancellor an estimated £20bn a year.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025SavingsMortgagesSavings ratesRachel ReevesBanks and building societiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Jake Reeves, from Croydon in southLondon, was given 12 years in prison with one year on extended licence. The offences they admitted made them the first to be convicted under the National Security Act 2023.Jakeem Rose, 23 and also from Croydon, was jailed for eight years and 10 months. Nii Mensah, 23, from Thornton Heath, south London, was sentenced to nine years and 21-year-old Ugnius Asmena, who was homeless, was given seven years. The trio were each found guilty of aggravated arson and handed a further year on extended licence by the judge.Ashton Evans, a 20-year-old drug dealer from Newport in Gwent, was jailed for nine years plus a further year on extended licence after being found guilty of failing to disclose information about terrorist acts relating to another plot in Mayfair.View image in fullscreenJake Reeves, left, and Dylan Earl organised the arson attack on behalf of the Wagner group of Russia.Photograph: CPS/PA MediaThe arson attack on a warehouse in Leyton, east London, put 60 firefighters at risk and caused £1m in damage in March last year.The court heard that Earl, 21, and Reeves, 24, did not leave their bedrooms while organising the attack for the Wagner group, acting on behalf of the Russian Federation.The group targeted the warehouse because it was being used to supply humanitarian aid and Starlink satellite equipment to Ukraine.When the same Ukrainian company was hit by an arson attack 10 days later in Madrid, detectives from the Met’s counter-terrorism command took over the investigation.When Earl was arrested, police analysis of his mobile phone revealed he had videos of the warehouse fire being started and was in contact with the Wagner group on Telegram, through an account with the usernames “Privet Bot” and “Lucky Strike”.Some of the messages showed that reconnaissance for further “missions”, involving arson attacks at a restaurant and wine shop in Mayfair owned by the Russian dissident Evgeny Chichvarkin had already been carried out.

Discussions over his living arrangements had been held daily since the revelations earlier this week, the Telegraph reported.While Andrew’s initial response had been to dig his heels in, saying he was entitled to live there until the end of the lease in 2078, negotiations were continuing with a growing sense of inevitability that he would move out, the paper said. Royal sources had seen a “renewed determination” to force him out, it added.Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the report.Downing Street said on Thursday that MPs would not be given time in the House of Commons time to discuss Andrew’s situation because the royal family wished parliament to focus on “important issues”.Charles is understood to have tried to persuade his brother for some time to move. Should he be forced out of Royal Lodge, under the terms of the lease he would be entitled to £558,000.There is also the question of where he, and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, who also resides there, would go. It is not known how he would pay rent as it is unclear how he derives income, and the king is understood to have withdrawn financial support last year.The royal family sought to draw a line under the Epstein controversy when Andrew announced last week he wouldvoluntarily relinquish use of his titlesand honours, including that of Duke of York. They would be extant but inactive. But there have been calls for them to be removed altogether, which would require legislation.His announcement came after he consulted with the king and the Prince of Wales when it emerged he had emailed Epstein in 2011 saying “we’re in this together” three months after he said he had broken off all contact with the disgraced US financier.It also came just days before the publication of Giuffre’s memoir, Nobody’s Girl, in which she repeated her allegations she was forced to have sex three times with Andrew, which he vehemently denies, including when she was 17 and also during an orgy after she was trafficked by Epstein. Andrew paid millions to settle a civil assault case with her in 2022 with no admission of liability. Giuffre died by suicide aged 41 in April.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewKing Charles IIIMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

That would clear the way for US special operations or drones to destroy land-based targets, current and former officials said.The expanded naval presence “will bolster US capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States homeland and our security in the western hemisphere”, a Pentagon spokesperson, Sean Parnell, said in a statement.From Caracas, Nicolás Maduro slammed the enhanced US military presence. “They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war,” the Venezuelan president told state media later on Friday.For weeks, the Trump administration has been eyeing escalating its campaign against the drug cartels – as well as its effort to destabilize the Venezuelan president’s government – after an initial campaign of strikes on at least nine alleged drug-trafficking boats.Donald Trumpalso confirmed to reporters at the White House on Thursday that the next stage of his military campaign was to hit targets on the ground. “The land is going to be next,” Trump said. “The land drugs are much more dangerous for them. It’s going to be much more dangerous. You’ll be seeing that soon.”Trump did not discuss which targets in which countries the US intended to strike. But he directed the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who was seated beside him at the White House event about curbing the flow of illegal drugs into the US, to notify Congress about the administration’s plans.Asked whether he would declare war against the cartels, Trump suggested he would continue with individual strikes. “I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK?” he said. “We’re going to kill them, you know they’re going to be, like, dead.”Trump announced what appears to have been the first strike on a boat on 3 September, releasing a brief video of the attack. In the weeks that followed, the administration announced more strikes without disclosing details other than the number of people killed and the claim that the boats had carried drugs.Since the start of the military campaign, the administration has provided a dubious legal justification for the strikes, claiming the boats are affiliated with “designated terrorist organisations”, or DTOs, with which the US was now in a “non-international armed conflict”, the Guardian has reported.The administration has nevertheless provided no concrete evidence to date that those killed in the boat strikes were smuggling drugs to the US. In briefings to Congress, Pentagon officials in essence said the boats were legitimate targets because Trump had designated them as assets of cartels seen to be DTOs, people familiar with the matter said.The military campaign has also drawn in the Central Intelligence Agency. Trump confirmed on 15 October that he hadauthorized so-called “covert action”by the CIA in Venezuela. The Guardian has reported that the CIA has been providing a bulk of the intelligence used in the airstrikes.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Hamas is not part of the PLO, which is dominated by its longtime rival Fatah.It comes as the wife of the Palestinians’ most popular leader,Marwan Barghouti, appealed on Friday to Donald Trump to intervene for her husband’s release from an Israeli jail, after the US President said he would “make a decision” on the matter.In a letter addressed to Trump, Fadwa Barghouti, whose husband is serving multiple life sentences since 2002 for deadly attacks on Israelis but is seen by many Palestinians as a potential leader who could unite their national movement, urged Trump to push for his discharge.“Mr President, a genuine partner awaits you – one who can help fulfil the dream we share of just and lasting peace in the region,” her appeal said. “For the sake of freedom for the Palestinian people and peace for all future generations, help release Marwan Barghouti.”‘The most popular Palestinian leader alive’: Releasing Marwan Barghouti could transform territories’ politicsRead moreTrump had on Thursday told Time magazine he was weighing whether to support the release of the imprisoned Fatah leader. “I am literally being confronted with that question about 15 minutes before you called,” he said. “That was my question of the day. So I’ll be making a decision.”Barghouti, 66, has been in prison for more than 20 years after being convicted of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed, and sentenced to five life sentences plus 40 years. The trial wascriticised as deeply flawedby the Inter-Parliamentary Union.Palestinians have long sought his release, reportedly including him in recent hostage negotiations, but Israel has refused.Arab Barghouti, the leader’s son, said his father wasassaulted and beaten unconsciousby eight guards on 14 September as he was being transferred between Ganot and Megiddo prisons.The alleged beating followed a prison visit to the Palestinian leader by the Israeli national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, in August. Ben Gvir, a member of a far-right party who has past convictions from Israeli courts for incitement to racism and support for a terrorist organisation, taunted Barghouti in a video clip published at the time.According to Barghouti’s son, Ben Gvir also showed the 66-year-old prisoner a picture of an electric chair and told him he deserved to be executed.Fadwa Barghouti’s letter was sent to Trump while the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, is in Israel as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to strengthen the ceasefire agreement.Rubio voiced hope on Friday of soon putting together an international force to police the ceasefire in Gaza and said Israel, which opposes including Turkey, could veto participants.“There’s [sic] a lot of countries that have offered to do it. Obviously as you put together this force, it will have to be people that Israel is comfortable with,” he said.Turkey, a Nato member and one of the region’s strongest militaries, was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel.But under president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Turkey has welcomed Hamas leaders and been a vociferous critic of Israel, which Erdoğan accuses of committing genocide in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.Rubio has become the fourth member of Trump’s inner circle to visit Israel since the president’s trip to the Knesset last week — a move widely seen as a signal to the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that Washington is keeping a close eye on developments and wants to safeguard the fragile Gaza’s truce.Hamas said Friday in a statement it had received “clear guarantees” from mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey that “the war has effectively ended”.It called for greater pressure on Israel to allow in humanitarian aid.The World Health Organization said Thursday there had been little improvement in the amount of aid going into Gaza - and no observable reduction in hunger.“The situation still remains catastrophic because what’s entering is not enough,” WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said.Explore more on these topicsPalestineIsraelMarco RubioMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But the US has so far declined tosupply Tomahawk cruise missiles, a proposal that has also prompted concern in Moscow.Zelenskyy said Russia was trying to cause a “humanitarian disaster” this winter, adding: “We’re thankful to you that we are not alone in this situation – from the very beginning of the war but especially now, it’s very important.”Earlier, the Ukrainian leader visited King Charles at Windsor before heading to Downing Street for a one-on-one meeting with Starmer. The pair then moved to the Foreign Office for the full meeting with European leaders.Others attending in-person included Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary general, Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, and Dick Schoof, the prime minister of the Netherlands. The remainder participated online.The online and in-person gathering came a day after EU leadersfailed to make a firm decisionon whether to use €140bn (£120bn) frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine’s defence, while the relationship between the Trump and Zelenskyy remains delicate.Russia has, meanwhile, intensified its bombing of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Power and water were out in Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv this week, after targeted attacks aimed at breaking public resistance inside Ukraine.Before the meeting, Starmer accused the Russian president of wanting to prolong a war in which Ukrainian civilians were coming under attack. “From the battlefield to the global markets, as Putin continues to commit atrocities in Ukraine, we must ratchet up the pressure on Russia,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This week, Trumpcalled off a planned summit with Putin in Budapest, and on Wednesdayimposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia’s two largest oil companies.The US president has also begun to call for a ceasefire along the existing frontlines, rejecting Russian demands for more territory in eastern Ukraine as a condition for ending the fighting. But he declined to agree to supply Tomahawk cruise missiles to Kyiv after atense meeting with Zelenskyy in Washingtona week ago.Though Britain says it wants allies to step up the gifting of long-range munitions to ensure Ukraine can build on the chemical factory attack, it is unclear how far London would go to encourage Trump. With a range of over 1,000 miles, they could strike targets far beyond the Storm Shadow’s official range of 155 miles.Britain placed Rosneft and Lukoil under sanctions in the middle of the month, but the EU has not done so largely because Lukoil supplies Hungary and Slovakia. Instead, the bloc’s leaders agreed a sanctions package, its 19th against Russia, that would gradually ban liquefied natural gas imports by the beginning of 2027.Zelenskyy arrived in London after visiting Brussels. On Thursday, EU leaders sidestepped taking a decision on using Russia’s frozen assets to fund Ukraine’s defence, despite a plea from the Ukrainian president to take swift action to make Moscow pay for its war.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

The average participant receives about $187 a month, the center reports.The Department of Agriculture recentlysent a letterto regional Snap directors warning them that funding for Snap will run out at the end of the month and directing them to hold payments “until further notice”.More than 200 Democratic representatives have urged the USDA to use contingency funds to continue paying for Snap benefits.“There are clear steps the administration can and must take immediately to ensure that millions of families across the country can put food on their table in November,”a letterfrom the lawmakers to the USDA states. “SNAP benefits reach those in need this November would be a gross dereliction of your responsibilities to the American people. We appreciate your consideration of these requests.”Democrats have refused to pass a funding resolution to reopen the government because they want the legislation to include provisions to maintain healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which the Trump administration cut and are set to expire at the end of the year.A USDA spokesperson blamed Democrats for the upcoming loss in Snap benefits.“We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,” the spokesperson toldFox News. “Continue to hold out for healthcare for illegals or reopen the government so mothers babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely Wic [special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children] and Snap allotments”.That claimis inaccurate: undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Affordable Care Act subsidies.While his organization is focused on food insecurity, Berg supports the Democrats in fighting for healthcare subsidies because “this has grave repercussions for the people we represent”, he said.“The population getting the healthcare subsidies may have a marginally higher income than people getting Snap, but there is certainly a lot of overlap,” Berg said.US Senate fails to pass bill to pay federal essential workers and troops through shutdownRead moreBrittany, a 38-year-old mother of three, lives in Greenup, Kentucky, and works 35 to 40 hours each week as a home health nurse.She also has received Snap benefits for a few years.“It’s not like I receive benefits and not work,” said Brittany, pushing back against the misconception that people who receive food stamps just sit on the couch.They allow her to get “most of the necessities throughout the month and then I just pay cash for the rest of them”, said Brittany, who did not want her last name used.If the Snap funding is cut off, she said, she would have to work on the weekends to make up the difference, which would mean she would have “hardly any time with my children”.Still, she supports Trump and blames Democrats for the shutdown because “they are not agreeing on anything that the Republicans offer”.Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025Food povertyHealthUS politicsPovertySocial exclusionUS federal government shutdownsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Soon after, both sidesannounced plans for a US–Russia summit in Budapestand Tomahawks were left off the table.A similar sequence unfolded last August, when Trump was threatening new sanctions and Putin met the US president’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff. The meeting produced plans for a summit in Alaska – and Trump’s threats were swiftly put back in the freezer.Putin’s well-timed calls to Trump became so obviously calculated that even in Moscow they were met with amusement.“Putin, who appears to be running a kind of personal tactical game with Trump, has a knack, it must be said, for picking just the right moments to undercut our opponents’ efforts and inject new momentum into the talks,” wrote Fyodor Lukyanov, a foreign policy analyst close to the Kremlin, in a piece for the popular newspaper Argumenty i Fakty last Thursday.“We can see that the ‘target’ is responding to those signals … We are stuck in a loop,” he added.But Groundhog Day seems to be over.Already frustrated by the fruitless Alaska meeting, where Putin reportedly subjected him to a history lecture, Trump lost patience this week after talks between his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, made clear that Moscow saw no room for compromise on its stance inUkraine.On Wednesday, Trump vented his frustration with the Russian president, announcing that theBudapest summit was shelved.“Every time I speak with Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don’t go anywhere,” Trump told reporters in the White House.Soon after, his administrationannounced surprise sanctionson two of Russia’s biggest oil producers and about three dozen of their subsidiaries, measures that could severely undermine Moscow’s crucial energy revenues.The swiftness of the sanctions appeared to catch Moscow off guard, two sources with knowledge said, and even surprised some of the president’s closest advisers, according to CNN.“The idea of oil sanctions had been circulating for a while, but it still came as an unpleasant surprise to Moscow,” said a former high-ranking Russian official, speaking on condition of anonymity.Putin conceded the sanctions could cost Russia’s economy, telling reporters on Thursday that“some losses are expected”.But as in earlier waves of western sanctions, there was little sign the new measures would dissuade the Kremlin from pursuing the war, according to analysts and insiders.The Russian president has long indicated that he is willing to let ordinary Russians bear the economic pain in order to continue a war that he sees as a defining element in his legacy.“Economic hardship will not force him to end the war. He believes that this is the price we have to pay,” said the former Russian official.“Pressuring Putin is pointless. Even if he were inclined to make concessions, he couldn’t appear to do so under pressure. He simply wouldn’t allow it,” the source added.At the heart of Trump’s current misalignment with Moscow is his demand for an immediate ceasefire that would serve as the basis for peace talks.Trump has also urged both sides to freeze the current front lines – a proposal supported by Ukraine and its European allies.Putin, however, has firmly ruled out halting the fighting until a comprehensive agreement is reached that addresses what the Kremlin calls the “root causes” of the conflict.Those “root causes”, according to Moscow, mean sweeping demands that would erode Ukraine’s sovereignty, including full control of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, limits on Ukraine’s armed forces, and a Russian say in its domestic affairs.“For Moscow, stopping the war now would mean giving up its main leverage over Trump,” said Alexander Gabuev, the director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.“The Kremlin thinks they are winning the war and that Ukraine is losing, slowly but steadily. Putin really believes Ukraine could crumble some time next year,” said Gabuev.“To stop now without achieving his goals would only make restarting the war later more difficult.”Gabuev said Russia was likely to be keen to see how Ukraine – struggling to withstand relentless aerial bombardments and shortages of manpower at the front – would cope through the winter before taking its next diplomatic step.In recent months, Putin has increasingly suggested that time is on his side.Speaking at the Valdai Discussion Club in Sochi earlier this month, Putin struck a tone of confidence, insisting that Ukraine’s forces were faltering.Ukraine war briefing: Lithuania accuses Russia of further Nato airspace violationRead moreCiting figures that could not be independently verified, he claimed Kyiv had lost 11,000 troops in a single month and was struggling to replenish its ranks.For the moment, the Kremlin seemed willing to tolerate a mild deterioration in relations with Washington, said Tatiana Stanovaya, an independent Russian political analyst, betting that Trump’s volatile nature could lead him to change his mind.“Putin is counting on the Americans to, as he puts it, ‘come to their senses’,” Stanovaya said.“He believes that as Ukraine’s situation deteriorates, Washington will eventually conclude that the only solution is to talk to Russia about the root causes of the conflict – if not now, then in six months.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Is your fantasy car a vintage Land Rover Defender? Do you know a buff Cochin from a bantam hen? If the answer is yes, you may just be one of the style icons of the season: “rich autumn dad”.The leader of this new style pack, known among fashion watchers as the Rads, isDavid Beckham, who this week was unveiled as guest editor of Country Life magazine. The former England football captain appears in the 100-year-old title in a variety of looks including a tweed blazer and corduroy trousers.But while Beckham is pictured tending to a veg patch and beehives on his sprawling Cotswolds estate, his look could just as easily be found on a luxury catwalk or local high street.British country attire is now being embraced by men of all ages who want to emulate old money style. They may not be rich. They may not be a dad. But they can still look like a Rad.View image in fullscreenDogtooth check blazer in brown, £298, Reiss.Photograph: ReissJason Diamond, an author and cultural commentator, credits the look’s popularity to a rise in men caring more about their personal style. Whilesuitingis still struggling to regain consumers’ undivided attention due to hybrid working, Diamond said there is more desire from some shoppers for “stuff that’s a little more adult”.If gorpcore championed wearing outdoorgear in an urban environment, Rads are more about subtle functional pieces, adjacent to Beckham’s agricultural style. At the menswear shows there was a noticeable shift from oversized silhouettes and casual trainers to waxed jackets, neat tweed coats and smartly polished loafers. There are fears that a flat cap could be the next baseball.For Esquire’s style director, Johnny Davis, there is a performative element to the trend. “It’s notable that Beckham credits Guy Ritchie, a pioneer of the cosplay-farmer look, as helping him fall “deeper in love” with the countryside. The photo of David together with Victoria in the field from that shoot is hilarious – they’re styled like they’re out of a Brunello Cucinelli ad as opposed to, say, anyone about to till the land.” Ritchie’s 2024 Netflix hit series The Gentlemen was an early instigator of the trend.But then maybe the fantasy is part of the appeal. M&S is now selling pieces you’d usually find at expensive dedicated countryside outfitters, including twill chinos and waxed jackets. At John Lewis, an unofficial Rad mecca, searches for tweed jackets are up 300% since last week, while check coats have shot up 100%.View image in fullscreenStanley Tucci has teamed up with London cashmere brand N Peal.Photograph: N PealThe retailer has launched a dedicated “Heritage” category online in which cable-knit and fisherman’s jumpers are top performers. Zara’s winter edit includes striped rugby shirts and knitted vests, while at Reiss abrushed overshirtand adogtooth-checked blazerare topping its bestseller list.“Men are looking for stuff that’s a little more classic, but not formal,” Diamond says. “The country gentleman thing does a great job of combining stylish with just the right amount of rugged, but not toorugged that it’s not suitable for going out to dinner or a party. The Beckham photos sum up exactly what I mean because he’s in those nice, tailored shirts, but he’s also in wellies and he’s gardening. He’s getting his hands dirty, but it’s not exactly dirty work.”Other Rads include the actor Jesse Plemons, who has been promoting his latest film Bugonia in an olive chore jacket, cuffed khakis and perfectly clean work boots, the former footballer Ian Wright, who favours cosy knits, selvedge denim and a baker boy cap and Josh O’Connor’s art thief in The Mastermind, who fools everyone by wearing cosy knitwear and a flat cap. See also Alan Carr on Celebrity Traitors in tweed blazers and an overshirt from the British brand Wax London.A spokesperson for the secondhand clothing platform Depopcredits the reality TV show for also fuelling searches for Barbour jackets (up 207% since July).Elsewhere, the actor Stanley Tucci is leaning into his Rad aesthetic, teaming up with the 89-year-old London cashmere brandN Pealon a collection. Bestsellers include a half-zip jumper and a multi-pocketed field jacket.So what’s fuelling the fetishisation now? For Diamond, the countryside look is a “rebellion against being too plugged in”. Davis also credits the romanticism of a more analogue time. “The British pastoral ideal feels like escape – slow, rooted and tactile,” he says. “There’s comfort in the imagery of fields, dogs and old tweed when everything else feels digital and precarious.”How to look like a rich autumn dad (even if you’re on a budget)Half-zip jumper, £69,John LewisBarbour jacket, £95,Vintage FolkBoots, £175,BlundstoneVintage rugby shirt, £50,RokitWool vest, £65,ArketTexture chore jacket, £80,M&STweed dog coat, from £19.95,Harris tweed Isle of HarrisEnamel mug, £12.95,FalconSocks, £16,CordingsExplore more on these topicsMen's fashionDavid BeckhamnewsShareReuse this content"

Four years separate The Boy Who Played the Harp from his last solo album, the platinum-selling We’re All Alone in This Together. Perhaps more strikingly, it’s been two years since he released Split Decision, the collaborative EP with Central Cee that spawned Sprinter: not just the longest-running UK rap No 1 in history, but the track that finally did the thing that it seemed increasingly unlikely a UK rap track would ever do and became a hit in the US, selling a million copies and even winding up on Barack Obama’s annual playlist. But rather than attempt to capitalise on its US success, as Central Cee did – jumping on tracks by big names ranging from J Cole to Ice Spice to Jung Kook from BTS; releasing a debut album that was announced on a live NFL broadcast, featured a plethora of American guest stars and ultimately wound up in the US Top 10 – Dave essentially withdrew from music.It was, by any metric, a counterintuitive move, and anyone wondering why, or what he’s been doing, will find some answers in The Boy Who Played the Harp. It opens with portentous-sounding organ and a couple of verses that do exactly what you might expect an artist in his position to do: reassert his vast success and wealth – he’s “already a legend”, his home apparently comes with a “garden the size of Adam and Eve’s” and “a forest” – but that turns out to be a feint, both musically and lyrically.The Boy Who Played the Harp is a very muted-sounding album indeed, big on sparse arrangements, gentle piano figures and subtle pleasures: the unsettled, skittering beats and helium vocal samples that open 175 Months, the quietly eerie harmony vocals that appear midway through My 27th Birthday. Several of its tracks run over the six minute mark, while even its poppiest moments – No Weapons, which reunites him with Sprinter producer Jim Legxacy, and Raindance, a collaboration with Nigerian singer Tems – feel understated. And once the opening verses of History are out of the way, it’s an album noticeably light on self-aggrandising swagger: to judge by the rest of the lyrics, Dave has spent a significant proportion of the last couple of years consumed by a series of existential crises. “Why don’t you post pictures, or why don’t you drop music?” he admonishes himself at one point. “Or why not do something but sitting and stressing yourself?”View image in fullscreenDave: The Boy Who Played the Harp album artwork.Some of his issues are universal, the kind of thoughts that tend to plague people in their late 20s, that weird period in life where you realise that you’re incontrovertibly an adult, whether you feel like one or not. He spends a lot of The Boy Who Played the Harp thrashing over the pros and cons of settling down, unable to work out whether it’s something he is emotionally capable of or not: “You should have had kids … don’t you feel like you’re behind?” he frets on the crestfallen Selfish. The brilliant Chapter 16 is styled as a lengthy dialogue between Dave and Kano, the latter now a patriarchal figure in UK rap, whose career began when Dave was at primary school. It shifts suddenly from discussing the music industry and the impact of sudden fame on your friends to Dave petitioning Kano, a contented family man, for relationship advice: the latter hymns the pleasure of swapping “a silver Porsche” for “leather Max-Cosi baby seats in the SUV”.View image in fullscreenDave, centre, flanked by his collaborators on The Boy With the Harp, from left: Kano, Jim Legxacy, Tems and James Blake.Photograph: Gabriel MosesBut he also seems conflicted about his career, worrying aloud about whether his lyrics are sufficiently socially aware, and whether they have any impact even if they are, working himself up into such a state on My 27th Birthday that he ends up questioning whether the world actually needs to hear anyone rapping at all: “We don’t need no commentators, we can leave that to the sports / Just listen to the music, why’d you need somebody’s thoughts?”The irony is that he has already answered that question. An album full of self-examination by a rich and successful pop star might seem like a schlep on paper, but Dave is a fantastically smart, sharp lyricist, more than capable of making it work – The Boy With the Harp feels fascinating, rather than self-indulgent – just as he’s technically skilled enough to make the album’s muted sound a bonus: it focuses attention on his voice and exemplary flow.It’s a point underlined when he finally shifts his gaze outwards on Marvellous and Fairchild, two tracks that emphasise his brilliance as a storyteller: the former tracks a 17-year-old’s progress from drugs to violence to jail, while the latter slowly details a sexual assault, shifting from Dave’s voice to that of female rapper Nicole Blakk, before exploding into a burst of rage that variously takes in “incels”, the murder of Sarah Everard, and hip-hop’s objectification of women: “I’m complicit, no better than you”. It’s harrowing, gripping and powerful: all the evidence you need that Dave’s doubts about himself are unfounded.Explore more on these topicsDaveRapHip-hopalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Its founder opened the store after recognising the lack of accessible Islamic resources in the UK during the 1980s.View image in fullscreenDar al-Taqwa has been open at its central London site since 1985.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian“He was very ambitious, my husband. He worked very, very hard,” says Noora, who encouraged him to open the shop because of her lifelong love for reading. The couple chose Baker Street for its proximity to London Central mosque and because, at the time, “a lot of international customers, especially Arabs, would come and stay here in the summer, so it was essential for them”.The shop, which Noora runs alongside just three part-time staff, began without bank loans, in accordance with Islamic teachings that forbid interest. Instead, the couple relied on community investment and savings. Today, Noora describes the atmosphere as familial: “We are a family here, we keep customers and they become one of us, as staff.”Dar al-Taqwa’s shelves are lined with many books that are rare or out of print. “There are books you’ll find here that you’ll never find anywhere else,” Noora says proudly.Muslim women do not need saving, says female leader of mosque at centre of charity run rowRead moreSome authors, including the US scholar Hamza Yusuf, have personally donated their works. The shop also sells academic titles from major publishers such as Routledge and Macmillan, and hosts readings and community events. Last year, they launched author sessions and plan to start a book and poetry club. It is even occasionally used to officiate Islamic marriages.Longtime staff member Ibrahim Abdirahman Hassan, 60, first visited as a customer before joining the team in 1996. “A lot of people don’t visit because they read online now,” he said. “In the 90s, people came to buy books.”Despite this, he remains attached to the place: “I meet so many interesting people here – it’s the centre of what’s going on. You get the news when you’re here; if a new book is published, people will tell you.”Dar al-Taqwa has welcomed prominent visitors over the years, including Yusuf Islam (Cat Stevens), the British diplomat Gai Eaton, and Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad of Jordan. Yet, its reach goes far beyond London.View image in fullscreenYusry Yusoff visited the bookshop while on a trip from Malaysia.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianOn a recent visit, Yusry Yusoff, a customer from Malaysia, said he made a point of visiting the bookshop after hearing of its closure the day before his flight home. “It’s a unique bookstore, not many of them exist – even in Malaysia,” he said. “It’s not just a bookstore, it’s a melting pot.“People from all over the world come here for the sole purpose of looking for books and the knowledge contained in them. It’s something very important and defines the character of London.” Saddened by the prospect, Yusoff said of the bookshop’s potential closure: “It would be a great loss.”Explore more on these topicsLondonIslamnewsShareReuse this content"

If it’s not a reboot (I Know What You Did Last Summer) or sequel (Final Destination Bloodlines), it’s a prequel (The First Omen; A Quiet Place: Day One), the return of a beloved gothic icon (Luc Besson’s Dracula: A Love Tale; Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein), or a slasher movie (Dangerous Animals) in which the psycho killer’s weapon of choice is not blades, but sharks. Or it’s a thrilling, deliriously inventive dispatch from one of a new wave of horror auteurs shaking up the cinematic zeitgeist: Ryan Coogler’sSinners, say, or Zach Cregger’s Weapons.By playing with metaphor, imagery and narrative, horror has always addressed hard truths about death, decay and the human condition that mainstream productions tend to shy away from as too disgusting, embarrassing or distressing. In an era when thrillers, romcoms and action films are unwilling to rock the boat lest they upset risk-averse studios and streaming services, horror films are uniquely equipped to tackle the hot-button issues of our times: migration (His House); mental health (Smile 2); toxic masculinity (The Invisible Man); artificial intelligence (M3gan); cults (Midsommar); zealotry (Heretic); gender dysphoria (I Saw the TV Glow); conspiracy theories (Broadcast Signal Intrusion); Zoom meetings (Host); pandemics (The Sadness); ecology (In the Earth); politics (The Purge); dementia (Relic); pregnancy and motherhood (Huesera: The Bone Woman; Mother’s Baby) and – an ever-popular theme in the horrorsphere – bereavement (The Babadook; Hereditary; Talk to Me; Bring Her Back and so on).In an age of polarisation, institutional collapse, climate anxiety and the breakdown of a shared reality, horror has emerged as the genre most capable of processing our fractured moment. Once reviled by respectable film critics as being only a short step up from pornography, horror today is not just having a moment; it is revealing itself as the defining genre of the 21st century.View image in fullscreenPrimal fear … The Monkey.Photograph: BFA/AlamyThe last great flowering of horror was during the 1970s, when George A Romero, Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter and Wes Craven dragged the genre, kicking and screaming, out of the gothic past and into the world of rural America, shopping malls and suburbia, in subversive films that reflected widespread social unease and distrust of authority in the era of Vietnam, Watergate and a disillusioned counterculture. But horror moves in cycles, from innovation to exploration to recycling and parody, and by the 1990s the films had got bogged down in spoofs (Scary Movie), duff remakes (The Haunting) and slumming A-list directors who imagined they were tapping into subtexts no one had ever spotted before (Bram Stoker’s Dracula; Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein; Wolf).How The Blair Witch Project changed horror for everRead moreThen, just in time for the millennium, an unholy trilogy of hits restarted the moribund pulse of the genre to send it roaring into the next century.The Blair Witch Projectshowed that an entire branch of film-making could be revolutionised on a rock-bottom budget, making ingenious use of the internet as a marketing tool and substituting the primal fear of getting lost in the woods for expensive special effects. It wasn’t the first horror film to use “found footage”, but it was instrumental in turning this into one of low-budget film-making’s most cost-effective stratagems.And alongside Blair Witch, two other films signalled the revival of an almost forgotten subgenre – the ghost story, reworked for the modern age and a media-savvy audience. M Night Shyamalan’s The Sixth Sense parlayed a devastating twist into the alternative reality scenario that would underpin so much of the horror and sci-fi of the new century. And the cursed VHS tape of the J-horror phenomenon Ring was a harbinger in the use of new technology that would permeate the genre with spine-chilling spins on social media, influencers, AI and the Dark Web.View image in fullscreenEye-catching … The Ring.Photograph: Omega/AllstarPost-Ring, the increasing availability of DVDs and spread of broadband made non-anglophone horror cinema, especially from France, Japan and South Korea, more accessible to horror fans in the west, permanently altering what “American” or “western” horror even means as directors such as Jordan Peele and Ari Aster would later consciously draw from this international lexicon. The New French Extremity (typified by Irréversible, in which a man gets his face mashed to a pulp by repeated blows from a fire extinguisher, or Martyrs, in which a woman is flayed to death) pushed the envelope of what was acceptable on screen. The subgenre eventually dubbed “torture-porn” (Hostel; The Human Centipede (First Sequence); and you really don’t want to know what happens in A Serbian Film) upped the ultragore content for a few years before giving way to less grim, more viewer-friendly ghosts, curses and bogeymen. Torture-porn’s influence lingers on today in mean-spirited splatterfests such as Terrifier 3, which made back 45 times its $2m budget, so evidently there is still a market for untrammelled sadism as practised by killer clowns. The box office success of Terrifier 3 alongside Robert Eggers’s upmarket-leaning Nosferatu underlines the genre’s new ecosystem, in which elevated and exploitative horror play with and off each other.The Babadook at 10: how a tiny Australian film became a horror hit – and an unlikely queer iconRead moreWhile the Blair Witch/Ring wave proved horror could be profitable and innovative, the current wave’s inflection point arrived with The Witch (2015), before being cemented by Get Out (2017) andHereditary(2018). This moment succeeded where earlier innovations failed because it coincided with a rise in internet-fuelled alienation and a new understanding of trauma, including cultural and generational, that horror was uniquely positioned to process. Meanwhile, the new wave of horror auteurs is helping to take the genre out of the exploitation and midnight movie circuits and into the arthouse. The likes of Jordan Peele (Get Out), Jennifer Kent (The Babadook) and Eggers (Nosferatu) seem not to regard horror as a genre apart, but as an integral part of their creative toolkit. And they have abandoned the traditional 90-minute running time in favour of an epic length more often associated with blockbuster releases, giving themselves space to explore themes, develop characters more fully.View image in fullscreenBed fellows … The Babadook.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyPeele’s Nope (130 minutes) is not just a horror film, but a neo-western science-fiction horror film. Kent’s The Nightingale (136 minutes) is a period rape-revenge horror drama that also addresses colonialism. Ari Aster’sMidsommar(147 minutes) is folk horror that tackles bereavement, trauma and a crumbling relationship. Coogler’s Sinners (137 minutes) is a deep south gothic musical period action drama, with vampires. (That some mainstream critics couldn’t get on board with Coogler introducing vampires into the mix suggests old anti-horror prejudices die hard.)Get Out: the film that dares to reveal the horror of liberal racism in AmericaRead moreThe new horror auteurs know the genre’s history, and use their knowledge to add non-formulaic twists and turn audience expectations upside down. Beyond expanded running times, directors such as Cregger, Peele and Aster are pioneering formal innovations that distinguish elevated horror on a technical level: discomfiting or unnatural colour palettes; compositions that deny the viewer safe framing; and most radically, their deployment of extended silences and narrative ambiguity to build unease or dread in audiences rather than jolting them with a continual barrage of jump-scares. Cregger’s Barbarian, about an Airbnb stay that goes horribly wrong, weighs in at a relatively snappy 102 minutes, but its unorthodox structure is pure 21st century, as are the film-maker’s astute casting choices, which ramp up the tension. His follow-up, Weapons (128 minutes) ekes out the details of its central mystery – 17 missing children – via separate points of view that ultimately dovetail in a perfectly judged climax that fully embraces both humour and horror, but without ever turning the film into a horror-comedy.The films of the new horror auteurs are taken seriously by critics, who sometimes use the term “elevated horror” to distinguish them from cheap and cheerful splatterfests of yore. The shift became official when the Sundance, Cannes and Toronto film festivals began programming horror films in their main competitions – a transformation enabled by a generational changing of the guard in film criticism, as younger critics who grew up valuing horror as legitimate art displaced older gatekeepers. But horror is also helping to blur the boundary between arthouse and mainstream. Horror’s unique economic model – low budgets that can reap astronomical profits – grants auteurs a creative freedom that big-budget film-makers can only dream of, and explains why streamers and studios, otherwise allergic to risk, are willing to gamble on formally daring horror projects they’d never greenlight in other genres. The production and distribution company Blumhouse Productions produced Oscar-nominated dramas such as Whiplash and BlacKkKlansman, but made its name with the successful Paranormal Activity found-footage franchise, and steered Peele’sGet Outto a critical and commercial success that sparked a flurry of media discourse about post-racial America, and the potential of non-white or female film-makers to introduce new perspectives to a genre that was formerly almost exclusively overseen by white men.Hit horror Weapons doesn’t have a deeper meaning but that’s OK | Jesse HassengerRead moreThe name of another distribution company, A24, has become so synonymous with elevated horror that fans and critics sit up and take notice when they see it attached to new projects, whether that’s award-winning work by Yorgos Lanthimos, Joanna Hogg and Sean Baker, or the latest film by Australian duo Danny and Michael Philippou, whose supernatural thriller Talk to Me was a word-of-mouth hit a few years ago. Their recent follow-up, Bring Her Back, is built round a performance by Sally Hawkins so terrifying you’ll never again be able to watch Paddington without shuddering.View image in fullscreenSeeing red … Andrea Riseborough in Possessor.Photograph: Sundance pressOn the slate of another celebrated distributor, Neon, Bong Joon-ho’s Oscar-winning Parasite and Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire rub shoulders with Sydney Sweeney in nunsploitation shocker Immaculate (a metaphor for forced birth if ever there was one), gnarly rape-revenge fantasy Revenge from the director Coralie Fargeat, who would go on to gross out audiences across the globe with Demi Moore squelcher The Substance, and the output of Brandon Cronenberg, whose Possessor and Infinity Pool explore the sort of body horror pioneered in the 1970s by his father, David.Shocking red: behind the scenes on classic horror Don’t Look Now – in picturesRead moreIn the space of six months, Neon landed a one-two combo of hits from another film-maker with horror in his genes: Osgood Perkins, son of Anthony Perkins, who played Norman Bates in Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho. Longlegs was a nightmarish FBI procedural starring Nicolas Cage as a grotesque occultist serial killer; Neon borrowed its marketing tactics from The Blair Witch Project, forgoing expensive TV spots in favour of cryptic internet clips and billboards displaying phone numbers connecting to pre-recorded messages from the film’s killer. Perkins followed it with splatter comedy The Monkey, adapted from a story by Stephen King. “Everybody dies,” says one of the doomed characters. “Some of us peacefully and in our sleep, and some of us horribly. And that’s life.”And in today’s world, real life is more terrifying and depressing than anything a film-maker could dream up. In the traditional Hollywood model, corruption is exposed by a righteous media, and the president of the United States (as played by Viola Davis or John Cena in recent action films) is firmly on the side of good against evil, but this approach just won’t cut it any more. Horror is perhaps the only genre that faces the challenges and anxieties of the ever-devolving present with its eyes wide open. If we are indeed living in End Times, it has us covered, providing a space in which our collective fears are let off the leash and allowed to run free – safely contained by the edges of the screen and a finite running time."

As past opponents attest, there are no easy solutionsWill UnwinFri 24 Oct 2025 16.00 EDTShareNo coach has found a way to stopErling Haalandin his past 12 matches, the striker scoring in each and 22 times in all competitions for club and country. Pep Guardiola knows most about the Norwegian’s talents and jokingly suggested a plan to keep him out: “Four centre-backs.” There are no straightforward answers, especially as so many have tried and failed.On Sunday Aston Villa and Unai Emery will be tasked with formulating a strategy to keep Haaland quiet. Not that theManchester Cityplayer is particularly perturbed by not being involved for much of a match. His touches are infrequent but very often telling. The focus generally against Haaland is preventing the ball from reaching him but with City’s array of creative talents, that is easier said than done.Haaland comes alive inside the box, his ability to know where the ball will end up and his movement making defending against him a nightmare. At Villarreal on Tuesday he anticipated where Rico Lewis would put a cross and beat the centre-back to turn the ball home and give City the lead intheir 2-0 win.WhenWolves beat City 2-1 in September 2023they restricted Haaland to one chance, which was saved, and Ian Burchnall – an assistant coach at Molineux at the time – recalls how they did it. “The only time we had success was when we had Craig Dawson up against him and physically man-marking him inside the box,” Burchnall says. “Dawson did an unbelievable job because Haaland doesn’t take many touches. He’s unbelievably patient as a forward because they’re only ever playing against a low block. Haaland gets very few touches, so his patience and his focus to make movements inside the box is just unbelievable. You have to have someone that can match that inside the box.”View image in fullscreenIn 2023, Wolves had Craig Dawson ‘physically man-marking’ Erling Haaland, limiting the Manchester City striker to only one chance.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/EPAIt is not that Haaland drifts in and out of games – he is always doing his best to occupy defenders, waiting for his moment to pounce. It can lure opponents into a false sense of security, feeling they are on top because he is not involved. His tally of 11 Premier League goals this season matched or bettered the number scored by 12 of the division’s other 19 sides before this weekend’s round of matches.“We did have quite a good picture of him and the preparation was mostly that no one can stop him individually, so it must be a team effort,” says the former Werder Bremen defender Niklas Moisander, who faced Haaland three times. “A big part of the plan was how to stop him but it was mostly a collective effort and not individual. The main plan was to be compact and to have help around always when he had the ball or in the box. I’ve been lucky that I’ve been able to play against all the best in my generation: Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Robert Lewandowski. So I had some strikers to compare with, but I have to say he’s almost a perfect striker, complete.”How Haaland compares with Europe's other top-scoring forwards this season in club gamesOne of Haaland’s key roles is to stay high and lead counters or chase balls over the top. He can hold up the ball or run in behind. “It was mostly reading the game, anticipating and not coming into those situations where I would end up one against one against him, because then I would have stood no chance,” Moisander says. “When you play against the absolute top you can’t afford anything [because] half a second too late or a small mistake and it’s a goal. That was the feeling with him. You could have the feeling of: ‘Oh we played quite well against him’ – but then he had one goal or two at the end of the game.”As a No 9, Haaland’s physicality and athleticism make him stand out, possibly aided by themaple syrup it turns out he puts in his coffee. Trying to match what he does is almost impossible. Julián Alvarez is regarded as one the world’s leading strikers but he could not challenge Haaland for a starting spot andneeded to leave City. At international level Alexander Sørloth and Jørgen Strand Larsen are elite forwards but cannot oust their compatriot.“It’s really difficult but if you can stop supply to him, it’s great,” Burchnall says. “It’s not like you can double up on him because if you double up on him, you end up leaving space for somebody else inside the box. We just found it so hard to deal with him because he has so many different attributes. He’s strong in the air, can finish on both feet.”Bernardo Silva’s header at Villarreal showed the danger of overly focusing on Haaland, the 1.73m (5ft 8in) midfielder being allowed to wander into space and head home unmarked from close range.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As he has matured, Haaland has used the material to fire him. The greater the competition he is up against, the more he raises his game to give himself the best opportunity to outperform them.“He is so focused during the game, so you can’t really get him unbalanced,” says Moisander. “There was a couple of moments when we had some good relations and banter with him and tried to distract him, but all in good spirits, nothing too much. But you have to try everything. Those kind of players, you have to try to find the edge.”There is no one-size-fits-all solution for stopping Haaland. Many teams have been unable to keep him out.

Rather than being on a peaceful cruise, he is captaining a sinking ship with his West Ham defenders playing their role by being all at sea in defeat by Leeds.Brenden Aaronson and Joe Rodon were allowed space in the box to put Leeds two up within a quarter of an hour. Leeds faded in the second half, offering West Ham a chance to fight back but the visitors lacked quality in the final third and could muster only a late consolation goal through Manuel Fernandes. The defeat leaves West Ham second bottom of the Premier League nine games into their worst start to a season in 52 years, and theironly win came against their current head coach.Leeds v West Ham: Premier League – live updatesRead moreElland Road was rocking as the third minute arrived. The Hammers’ vulnerability was already clear. A deep Jayden Bogle cross was headed along the six-yard line and Aaronson was the only one to react, while the Hammers defenders were all inevitably stood in the wrong place. Nuno is known for being able to organise a defence, so he will be deeply worried by the confusion suffered when trying to guard their own goal.The chants of “Sack the board” had already started in the away end by the time Sean Longstaff’s 15th-minute corner found Rodon unmarked five yards from goal, thanks to Lucas Paquetá’s dismal attempt at staying tight. It was another case of players failing to do basic defensive duties as neither claret-and-blue centre-back attacked the ball. Nuno turned away, looking deep in thought as the Yorkshire rain pounded down.“You have to face the reality of where we are: second bottom and we’re in trouble now,” the West Ham captain, Jarrod Bowen, said. “The only way this is going to change is if players step up, roll their sleeves up and get ready for the fight. We need more of that week in, week out. When things aren’t going so well, it’s easy to hide and be scared but as easy as it is to say, it’s hard to do. We have to do that, that’s my only mindset.”View image in fullscreenJoe Rodon plants his header beyond Alphonse Areola as West Ham concede a ninth goal from a corner this season, six more than any other Premier League side.Photograph: Richard Sellers/Getty Images/AllstarIn the 25th minute, Ollie Scarles was replaced after a lengthy delay while medical staff dealt with what appeared to be a serious shoulder injury. Nuno sent on striker Callum Wilson to end the inverted full-backs experiment, in the desperate hope it could change the direction of the match.West Ham began to show intent and Paquetá thought he had made some degree of amends for his non-marking when he rifled into the roof of the net after a Bogle clearance was blocked by Wilson into the Brazilian’s path. The flag belatedly went up, followed by a bizarrely long video assistant referee check caused by technological failure – somewhat explaining the 13 minutes of added time in the first half – when it was clear Paquetá was offside.The second half became a meek battle with a Leeds team dropping far too deep out of fear of conceding and a West Ham side devoid of confidence. The hosts ceded possession to West Ham, happy to wait to hit them on the counterattack.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What concerns Nuno? “Our approach to individual duels, our approach to defensive tactics, our confidence, so many things,” the West Ham head coach said.Leeds regularly released the pressure by launching passes up to Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who had opted against taking the knee before kick-off, to relieve the almost constant pressure they had brought on themselves. Fernandes’ 90th-minute headed flick was deserved and brought a level of intrigue to stoppage time but it was insufficient. “We had fighting will, passion and spirit to get it over the line,” Daniel Farke, the Leeds manager, said. “The nerves began again but it was also good the confidence to bring it over the line. It was a priceless three points for us.”By being physical and aggressive, Leeds know what they are doing under Farke, who has been in charge for more than two years. Nuno has had only four matches but already knows the prospect of bringing calmer waters to east London will be very difficult. “I am worried since I have arrived, it is not something that surprised me,” Nuno said. “I am worried but we are committed and embrace the challenge we have ahead of us.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeeds UnitedWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Slot sought to point out that his comments had been complimentary when speaking on Friday. Speaking himself soon after, Amorim gave his response to the Dutchman’s initial comments. “I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team,” he said. “I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.”Bruno Fernandes will make his 300th appearance for United when Brighton visit Old Trafford on Saturday and Amorim was asked who beyond the captain maintains the standards expected at the club. “Harry Maguire. Diogo Dalot tries to do that,” he said. “Luke Shaw can show in some moments by the way he plays, when he’s so focused. I think Nous [Mazraoui] has a good impact. Licha [Lisandro Martínez], he is really important in this.”Victory over Liverpool means United have finally won two Premier League games in a row under Amorim. “It has to do a lot with attitude,” the Portuguese said when asked how this was achieved. “I’m not saying my players don’t want to win or run, but we need to sometimes [when] it’s getting harder [in matches] to force ourselves to do the basics. If you look at Brighton and the way they play, every team that pressed a little higher struggled and they won. We need to be prepared – not just against the top teams but against opponents that are [also] really good.”View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes holds a commemorative shirt ahead of his 300th appearance for Manchester United.Photograph: Zohaib Alam/MUFCFernandes joined United from Sporting for £46.5m in January 2020 and has been one of the few consistently high performers for the club in the intervening years. The 31-year-old considered joining Al-Hilal in the summer after the Saudi Arabian club made a £100m offer for him but decided to remain at Old Traffordafter speaking to his family and Amorim. Talking before his landmark game for United, the Portuguese, whose contract expires in June 2028, insisted he will discuss his future again only after next summer’s World Cup.“I’ve seen a lot of people talking that I had an agreement to go already next season. If the club has done that agreement, it wasn’t with me,” said Fernandes. “I haven’t spoken with anyone. I could tell you that there are still people talking to me and saying that they will be very eager to have me next year, of course. But from my side, that’s not talked about. Because my agent also knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Because until then, I won’t speak to anyone.”Fernandes went on to say that Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who signed for United in the summer, are the type of personalities United require, before going on to to praise their fellow new recruits Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens. “We need big characters because at this club being good players sometimes is not enough because of the pressure,” said the captain. “Cunha has that good arrogance to do the good things. Bryan, the same. He’s not afraid to take the ball, do his play. We brought two players who were aware of the Premier League also. And then we bought a very young goalkeeper [Lammens] and a centre-forward [and] they hit the ground flying [running]. We know Ben will be judged by scoring goals or not. But apart from that, he’s been doing great.

A pulsating encounter at the top of the Prem table ended withNorthamptonultimately pulling Saracens apart after blowing an early 17-0 lead.Noah Caluori had dominated the buildup after his five tries against Sale, but Tommy Freeman of England restated his class with a phenomenal four tries, while Fin Smith orchestrated a vintage attacking performance. Phil Dowson’s Northampton look well equipped for another title.“Tommy does so many things so well,” Dowson said of Freeman, who may soon feature at outside-centre for England. “He looked physical, fast, skilful, took the ball in the air beautifully. He’s just a phenom at the moment.”Henry Pollock had bleached his hair as if to remind everyone he remains one of the coming men in English rugby, but it was a touch of class from his fellow British & Irish Lions Freeman and Smith that made the first score. The fly-half floated a cross-kick right for Freeman where the wing gained 50 metres. Smith then dinked a delicious grubber kick for the full-back George Hendy to pounce on.View image in fullscreenNorthampton’s Henry Pollock sported a new blond haircut against Saracens.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAThe incisiveness of Northampton’s attacking leftSaracenssuffering from a collective case of twisted blood. Smith nudged another teasing grubber to the tryline where Saracens’ Max Malins tried desperately to touch down in-goal. The ball squirted out, allowing the Northampton openside Tom Pearson to score.Mark McCall’s side could not escape their own half. Smith whipped a sensational pass to Hendy, who fed Freeman for try No 3. But Saracens are serial champions for a reason and were soon on the scoreboard. First Fergus Burke raced under the posts, released by Nick Tompkins; then Burke’s perfectly weighted grubber allowed Jack Bracken to apply a scorching finish.Pearson was shown a yellow card with Northampton forced on to the back foot. Juan Martín González bashed over and Owen Farrell’s conversion meant Saracens, almost unbelievably, led 19-17 at half-time.After the Saracens lock Hugh Tizard scored, another Farrell conversion took the visitors further ahead. Northampton needed something and Pollock provided it, intercepting in midfield to buy the field position that brought a yellow card for the Saracens prop Marco Riccioni and a second try for Pearson.“I think they’ve probably done their analysis in the week,” McCall said of Pollock’s superb, momentum-shifting intervention. Dowson’s take was different. “Lee Radford [Saints head coach] said at the time, that’s totally out of system and if it hadn’t come off, I would have taken him off.“He’s capable of those things,” Dowson added. “That’s what Henry brings to the table. He’s high energy, you can see him talking and winding people up. He’s also got a great feel for the game – that intercept was not something we’d practised, planned or foreseen. He’s made a read.”Saracens led by two but not for long – Pollock nearly powered over – before Mitchell teed up Freeman, and Smith’s conversion had Northampton five ahead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Farrell missed the conversion and almost instantly Smith’s perceptive kick put Freeman in for his fourth.“I thought the whole game was fun to watch,” said Dowson. “It was a really enjoyable game. It’s easy for me to say that from a winning position but I thought it was a good example.”McCall said of Caluori’s evening: “It was going to be good experience no matter what – whether it’s a good experience in the moment, or in a couple of weeks, or a couple of months.”Freeman described his newest England colleague Caluori as “a good kid, a freak of an athlete with the world at his feet”.

He has done the same with the company that owns Hillsborough, Wednesday’s stadium. As a result, administrators have taken over the day-to-day running of one of England’s historic clubs, with a view to stabilising financial performance and, ultimately, finding a new owner. Going into administration is a measure of last resort for any struggling business and carries sanctions in English football. Sheffield Wednesday have been docked 12 points by the EFL, leaving them adrift at the bottom of the Championship on -6 points, 13 behind Blackburn Rovers, the next side in the table.Why has it happened?Chansiri has placed the club into administration because he has run out of money, but the story of how Wednesday got to this point is long and painful. The Thai businessman, whose family control one of the world’s largest producers of canned tuna, bought Wednesday for a reported £30m in 2015. He went on to raise ticket prices, churn through managers and announce sponsors thatwere not commercially active. The EFL first issued Chansiri with a disciplinary charge over Wednesday’s accounts in 2019, but in 2020 the club received a 12-point deduction over accounting relating to the sale of Hillsborough to Chansiri’s Sheffield 3 business. Those 12 points were reduced to six on appeal, but relegation to League One followed. The Owls returned to the Championship in 2023 and were immediately placed under transfer embargo on account of money being owed to HMRC, with the same punishment imposed again the following season. This summer, the club were hit with five sanctions, three of which related to unpaid taxes, wages and transfer fees and led to a ban on recruitment for three transfer windows. This month reports began to circulate that HMRC was soon to serve Wednesday with a winding-up petition over an estimated £1m owed by Chansiri, but the owner has pre-empted such a move, requesting administration.Sheffield Wednesday deducted 12 points after filing for administrationRead moreWhat happens next?Administrators from the company Begbie Traynor are in place at Wednesday and control the day-to-day running. Its aim is to reorganise the business so that debts can be addressed and the club can be sold. Administrators are legally allowed to take eight weeks to establish a proposal for how to run the business as a going concern. Paul Stanley, one of the joint-administrators, described the steps that would be taken next: “Our immediate priority is to ensure that we are able to operate as normal for the next home fixture against Oxford United on Saturday. In the coming weeks, we will work closely with the staff, the Supporters’ Trust and the wider community to ensure that the club is placed in the hands of a suitably qualified and well-financed new owner.”Does Chansiri stand to benefit from administration?If the club are sold, Chansiri will receive money from the transaction as the leading shareholder and lender. But legal requirements mean he will come towards the bottom of the pile. Under the football-creditors rule the first people to be paid off will be players, managers and other staff as well as other clubs who may be owed money. Then come the club’s secured creditors, those who have collateral against their lendings, followed by unsecured creditors such as HMRC and, finally, shareholders. The further down the order of priority the less likely those debts are to be repaid in full and Chansiri’s estimated loans of £100m to the club are understood to be unsecured.Could a regulator have prevented this?The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has said Wednesday’s administration is “exactly why this government set up the new independent football regulator”. It will have a remit to secure the financial stability of English football and its clubs and is expected to come fully into effect for the 2027-28 season. As part of its powers the regulator will conduct an expanded owners’ and directors’ test which will allow it to establish the source of any potential takeover funding. More significantly, it will also be able to mandate that clubs maintain enough cash in their bank accounts to cover predictable running costs such as wages and taxes. A spokesperson for the IFR said on Friday: “It is unacceptable that fans of football clubs face this level of uncertainty. Our regime will work to prevent instability and protect clubs for the benefit of supporters and their communities.”Explore more on these topicsSheffield WednesdayFootball politicsChampionshipexplainersShareReuse this content"

Opinion is valuable. Sometimes, though, the discussion verges on hysteria, can feel misplaced and, as England head into the first of four friendlies in their “Homecoming Series”, it all feels a bit over the top.Brazil look to youth as they start 2027 World Cup buildup with Lionesses fixtureRead moreWin, lose, draw, play Beever-Jones at left-back, stick Le Tissier on as a centre-forward, none of it really matters. The point is: now is the time to experiment, to try things, to risk failure. As Wiegman put it before’s England’s game against Brazil at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday: “You have to find opportunities to try things out. You don’t get that many opportunities to do that any more in international windows. Now we have these friendlies and yes, of course, we want to win every single game, but it is also an opportunity to try out things and to see different players and combinations. That’s what we’re going to try to do, because it might be the last period we can do that in.”Asked about whether there was enough leeway given to England to be able to experiment, Wiegman – after working out what leeway meant, with no direct Dutch translation of the word – added: “I can’t control that. We’re so visible, so you all have your opinions and that’s OK. What I’m trying to do is do the best for the team, get the best team on the pitch and see different things in these four games. Of course we always play to win, but now we also play to develop and in every game you do develop.“Sometimes I really want to see a player no matter how the game goes, I want to see someone because we want to learn. We have to qualify first, but it’s in the tournament [the World Cup] when you are set on things. That’s how it goes. I just try to stick in the bubble. I know what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.”The most explosive reaction toWiegman’s squad announcementwas her statement that Le Tissier’s primary position for England is as a right-back. Even the Manchester United social media admin jumped on the criticism, posting on various social media channels: “Maya Le Tissier has started 104 games for United, 103 of them have been at centre-back.” “I don’t react on social media,” said Wiegman. “I watch Maya all the time and she does a great job. How our team is built at the moment, with the players we have, she’s most likely to play right-back. I also know she can play as a right centre-back and she does a really good job for Manchester United and she does a good job for us too.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And with Lucy Bronze being eased back from injury, and Ella Morris out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, England are light on solid options in that position. Should Le Tissier be brought into the starting XI or come on as a substitute in her less regular position and do a terrible job, that plan will probably be rethought. For now, however, it is a reasonable adjustment.It turns out we will probably see more changes and experimentation than Wiegman would likely have planned for, with the manager announcing that an elbow injury means Hannah Hampton is out of action, leading to a call-up for Brighton’s Sophie Baggaley. The Arsenal centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy is also ill and has returned home to recover.Wiegman had already lost Katie Reid and Grace Clinton to injuries, while Jess Park’s concussion forced her withdrawal. And these absences follow the long-term ones of Leah Williamson, Lauren Hemp and Lauren James. Wiegman confirmed Keira Walsh will be captain against Brazil in the absence of Williamson and after the retirementof Millie Bright. “When Leah is not available, Keira is the captain,” she said.Ultimately, there is a lot to be learned from these four fixtures that will complete England’s calendar year. Perhaps we all just need to relax and enjoy them.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Dutchman is a threat beyond his formidable pace. An ominous, unsettling presence whose singular determination carries a weight of its own and at this weekend’s Mexican Grand Prix he will be hoping to put the hammer down once more.Having all but written off his chances by mid-season, Verstappen and Red Bull have orchestrated a striking comeback. In closing down a 104-point gap to the championship leader, Oscar Piastri, to just 40 in the space of four races, the defending champion has left Piastri and his McLaren teammate, Lando Norris, as prey in his paws.Oscar Piastri admits Max Verstappen’s re-emergence in F1 title race is ‘bit of a surprise’Read moreIt is impossible to imagine they do not feel the pressure given both are in a real title fight for the first time. Indeed, one that for no little time had been between the pair of them and played to McLaren’s own in-house interpretation of Queensberry rules to keep everything fair.Verstappen, not party to any such agreement, has very much upset the apple cart and at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, Lewis Hamilton, who went toe-to-toe with the Dutchman to theseason finale in 2021, issued a stark warning of what Verstappen was bringing to the title fight.“You really have to be cut-throat and that is what Max is. He is going to take this from them if they don’t do the same,” he said. “Max has won it four times so he knows what it’s like and being the hunter is much easier than being the defender.”Piastri and Norris, who is 14 points behind his teammate, have said they would rather be in front but it is hard to argue with Hamilton’s observation and its import for the championship, especially given the circumstances.Verstappen is in fine form and fine humour. He has nothing to lose and is heading into the five-race run-in with a car that is every bit as good as the previously dominant McLaren. He spoke in Mexico of enjoying the “positive pressure” and it was clear he had been revitalised by the challenge. “I’m loving what I’m doing,” he said. “If the car is competitive, much better to be racing in it than when it’s not.”View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri is first in the standings but will face pressure in Mexico City.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesWhich will not have been lost on either McLaren driver. Not only is Verstappen gleefully revelling in a contest he will fancy himself to win but he has the machinery and he has the momentum.Red Bull’s turnaround is likely to be on display once more in Mexico, where Verstappen has a daunting record, winning five of the last seven races. This weekend he acknowledged that a combination of the new floor applied in Singapore and the new front wing in Monza had been integral in allowing Red Bull to run the car in what he called “a different configuration”.That was almost certainly a reference to allowing it to run closer to the ground, a fundamental performance differentiator of the ground-effect cars which has made a huge improvement to the RB21’s previously narrow operating window which made it unpredictable and at times unmanageable from track to track.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The car has more pace and better balance, it slides less and is subsequently easier on the tyres but most importantly it has given Verstappen confidence in its handling, allowing him to set up the car with the pointy front-end he prefers. It has brought out the best in him as three wins in four races attest while the McLaren, for which development has ceased, has stood still.Mexico City will also probably play to the Red Bull’s strengths. In the thin air of altitude which negates the larger wings required, their car has enjoyed a strong, stable balance on the notoriously bumpy track and the preponderance of slower corners combined with one long straight all favour Verstappen’s ride over McLaren.If he is on top, the key question for the championship is how close can McLaren come? Norris and Piastri should still enjoy an advantage on the rest of the field but will be acutely aware that any error will leave the door open for Verstappen to further close the gap and that is another level of pressure. Dropping seven points to the Dutchman might be considered acceptable. Any more than that and his charge will only carry more weight into the final meetings of a campaign where any weakness or failure could be decisive.Verstappen senses blood in the water. He may not have led the championship all season and 40 points is still a major deficit to overcome but he knows that all that matters is having his nose in front when the flag falls in Abu Dhabi in December.“When you’re in the lead and someone is chopping away at your lead, that plays on you more than if you’re chasing and you have nothing to lose,” noted Hamilton. “In the lead, you have everything to lose.”View image in fullscreenArvid Lindblad, standing in for Max Verstappen, was the quickest rookie driver in first practice, managing sixth place.Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty ImagesCharles Leclerc topped the timesheets for first practice in Mexico in a session with nine rookies taking part as teams fulfilled their young driver commitments.

The winner will almost certainly face Oleksandr Usyk, the world champion, next year. In contrast, the loser is likely to lament the inevitable erosion of the hard-won plaudits he had gained.Danger and risk surround this clash. Parker is on a hot streak since his last defeat, to Joe Joyce, three years ago. The New Zealand veteran, who wonthe WBO world titlein 2016, has been rejuvenated by his switch of trainers to the inspirational Andy Lee. He has won six fights in a row, earning particular acclaim for the poised way in which hecrushed Deontay Wilder, Zhilei Zhang and Martin Bakole.‘My Netflix title would be white collar to world champion’: Fabio Wardley on his boxing journey | Donald McRaeRead moreWardley has steadily built his unbeaten record over 20 bouts, while displaying astonishing poweragainst Frazer Clarke in a rematchlast year and, this summer, when he knocked out Justis Huni with one chilling punch. But Clarke took Wardley to hell and back when their brutal first fight ended in a draw – and Huni had an unassailable lead on all three scorecards before he was felled in the 10th round.The low-key appeal of both men is enhanced by the fact that they now stand on the verge of a world title shot. Yet both are vulnerable. This is Parker’s 40th fight and, apart from three losses, he has been dropped multiple times by different opponents. He always gets up but Wardley hits harder than anyone he has faced – with the exception of Wilder who looked a shell of a knockout artist when Parker swept to a one-sided points victory in December 2023.Wardley,a former white-collar sluggerwho only started boxing when he was 20, had no amateur experience and has always had to overcome doubts about his comparatively limited skills. But he is also within sight of a world title challenge.Frank Warren, the promoter, believes “this is the most significant fight, at the moment, in the heavyweight division. These two guys have stepped up when neither of them needed to make this fight. Joe Parker is the WBO interim champion and they have already ordered Usyk to fight him, but [the Ukrainian] was injured. Joseph wants to fight anyway.“Fabio is also in a fantastic position and he only had to wait for his time. He said ‘No.’ He wanted to fight – and against Parker because it gives him a chance to jump the queue.”Parker, who turns 34 in January, said: “This is all or nothing. I am not thinking about losing. I respect my opponent and what he has done and how he has prepared for this fight. But I am on a different level and I am going to show it on Saturday.”Wardley will be 31 in December and he said: “It is a massive night for the pair of us. It is obviously the biggest fight of my career and the biggest fight of my life. But every time I step up I rise to the occasion. Saturday will be no different. The separation between where Joe is and where people think I am has been a common theme throughout my career.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By no means is he an old man but he has been in the sport for a long time and had some heavy fights. I’ve been in a few wars myself and I know they put miles on the clock. He has been in a lot more of those than me.”But the suspicion remains that Parker will be too seasoned, and too skilful, for Wardley. He should win a bruising battle with the conviction that he is next in line for Usyk – still the world’s best heavyweight by a comfortable distance.Explore more on these topicsBoxingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Having weighed out at 9st 8lb, however, he then weighed in at 8st 7lb, seemingly as the result of a mix-up with the weight cloths for the Moores’ two runners in the race.Miller Spirit, sent off as the 18-5 favourite, was disqualified and placed last, while the stewards imposed a £1,000 fine on Moore.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Hawk Mountain, though, was a comfortable winner on soft in the Group Two Beresford Stakes at the Curragh last month, posting a useful time in the process.Ronan Whelan, his jockey there, keeps the ride on Saturday and with the ground at Doncaster now heavy after recent rain,Hawk Mountain(2.05)is a solid bet at around 9-4 to notch a record-extending 12th win in this race for his trainer.Cheltenham 1.10Inox Allenproduced a fine round of jumping on his second chase start in April and this race should suit his front-running style.Doncaster 1.30This could be set up for the hold-up runnerRosario,who would have gone close with a clear run last time.Cheltenham 1.45Several promising novices in opposition withMinella Supremethe marginal pick at around 5-1 given his trainer’s excellent record at the track.Cheltenham 2.20Dunboynehas been transformed by a stable switch earlier this year and looks fairly weighted on his fourth in the Irish Grand National in April.Doncaster 2.40A slight drop in grade should do the trick forLam Yaiafter a close second in a Group Three last month.Cheltenham 2.55Winning Smutwon a similar contest at Galway in August and looks sure to be suited by the step up in tripNewbury 3.10The form ofStellar Sunrise’snursery win at York in August was franked when the runner-up took a Listed race next time and this Group Three looks a logical next step.Cheltenham 3.30The progressiveGive It To Me Ojwon off 137 at Sandown in April and has plenty in hand of his rivals back in a level-weights event here.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowNewbury12.50 Made All 1.25 Proof 2.00 Senorita Vega 2.34 My Ophelia 3.10 Stellar Sunrise 3.45 Starzintheireyes 4.19 Thankfully 4.50 Northwest PassageCheltenham1.10 Inox Allen 1.45 Minella Supreme 2.20 Dunboyne (nb) 2.55 Winning Smut (nap) 3.30 Give It To Me Oj 4.05 Intense Approach 4.40 Le Beau MadrikDoncaster1.30 Rosario 2.05 Hawk Mountain 2.40 Lam Yai 3.15 Chapter 3.50 Walsingham 4.25 Alpha Crucis 5.00 Rainbow Nebula 5.30 Supreme KingKelso1.35 Eagles Reprieve 2.10 Frisby 2.45 Too Cool Forshrule 3.20 Heart Above 3.55 Olivers Travels 4.30 Thistle Ask 5.05 Lucky ManifestWolverhampton4.55 Ar Diddy Dum Dum 5.25 Ellie’s De Vega 6.00 Lady Mariko 6.30 Super Hit 7.00 Sax Appeal 7.30 Macarone 8.00 Echo Of Glory 8.30 Hint Of HumourWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Newbury 3.45Last year’s Zetland Stakes winner,Starzintheireyes,has a little to find with the favourite, Ancient Wisdom, on their form at Goodwood in September but that was his first start for almost a year and he will also appreciate the step up in trip.Cheltenham 4.05A good opportunity for the game and consistentIntense Approachto further improve an impressive strike-rate.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Illegal houses in multiple occupationAditya ChakraborttyWith private-sector villainy and public-sector complicity, what makes this HMO scandal so characteristic of modern Britain is how far the guilt spreadsFri 24 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 04.09 EDTShareFan of true crime? Then this column is for you. Rather than some cold case told through yellowing newspapers and sepia photos, this one is still happening. And just wait for the plot twist! But first let me outline the key facts; your challenge is to decide who’s guilty.Our crime scene is a redbrick townhouse built in the last years of Victoria – tall, battered but undeniably handsome. It’s in Bowes Park, on London’s northern outskirts – the kind of neighbourhood that on a Friday afternoon offers nice cafes,a community-owned puband some WFH dads wandering the streets scavenging for ciabatta sandwiches.Now look closer. Outside our house is a jumble of bags and trolleys and suitcases, while, despite the late-October chill, the front door is wide open.Knock at the very first room, and you meet our victim. Eunice Osei is a proud, reserved woman, but give her time and she will say: “I’ve not been treated fairly.” Then she’ll cry.The crime is her room, a tiny hutch crammed with a kitchenette, toilet, bed and flimsy chipboard furniture. Clothes, kitchen utensils and suitcases are stacked so high against the grimy windows that light struggles to enter. We are swathed in murk, with nowhere to sit and hardly anywhere to stand. For three years, this holding pen has been her home.By a combination of ingenuity and greed, a family home has been broken down into 11 such cells. It’s become a house in multiple occupation, or HMO.In a property-obsessed country, the HMO is one of modern Britain’s primary fixations. Two decades ago, newspapers told stories about couples snapping up buy to lets; today,YouTubers effuseabout how renting out HMOs brings “passive income” – easy money, no sweat. And in the fetid imagination of the racist right, HMOs are the natural habitat of black and brown people fresh off the boat.A waiting list of thousands, and just five new homes for social rent: this city shows the depth of Britain’s housing crisis | John HarrisRead moreOsei comes from Accra, Ghana, but she’s been inLondonfor 20 years – and she never used to live like this. She volunteers at a church, and wakes at 5.30 most mornings to take two long bus rides to work as a cleaner for Network Rail. She is one of those invisible people on whom Britain depends for its health and hygiene and safety, while expecting them to eke out an existence on minimum wage and food banks.After splitting from her partner, Osei spent some time homeless before moving to this house. I can’t say she lives here, since it is no life. She doesn’t allow visitors, won’t tell even close friends about her room. Why not? “I’m ashamed.” More tears. I wonder why she’s talking to me, until I hear her repeat. “Please, help.”Osei talks of cold and damp, and mould so fierce it’s wrecked the Sunday best she kept for church. This spring she came back from a break to find mice everywhere. She shows me a mouse splayed out at the bottom of a toilet bowl, tells me how they’d chewed through the pipes, yet the landlord held out against repairs. She’d flush the toilet and the bathroom flooded with human waste. For this, she pays a rent of £1,147 a month – before bills.Who’s the criminal: her landlord? Yes – literally. Andreas StavrouAntoniades bought this house in 1990. How much he paid isn’t recorded by the Land Registry, but going by the local market then it wouldn’t have been much over £100,000. Just over 10 years later, he applied to split it into an HMO. WhenHaringey council refused, he just bulldozed the law. Without an HMO licence, he rented the rooms illegally.“He shouted a lot,” says his repair guy, Christo. “He never wanted to fix anything.” The 2010s were a boom time for such sharks: low interest rates made it easy to amass homes, while George Osborne’s welfare cuts drove London’s poor into the depths of the rental market.Antoniades boasted to Eunice of letting out 130 rooms at a time, and accounts at Companies House put his portfolio at about 20 houses in north London,worth over £20m(which, if anything, looks an underestimate). Several properties do not appear on the local HMO register, suggesting they are also illegal. This is a business model: analysisof government databy Generation Rent suggests that more than one in four HMOs in England that must be licensed are instead illegal.Haringey took Antoniades to court three times over the 2010s.

Haringey council placed her there. Nor is she alone: up the stairs lives Fabian Cameron, who says that last year he was called up by an officer in Haringey’s private rental team and told of “a very nice room”. He only discovered the truth later.In one part of Haringey civic centre, officers chased a serial lawbreaker through the courts; in another, they sent him business, most of which will be paid for by the public, through universal credit. Indeed, Haringey even acted as a direct customer to Antoniades: data I have seen under freedom of information shows that since 2018 the borough placed 16 households in temporary accommodation with a man who experts I’ve consulted agree would have failed any meaningful test of being “a fit and proper” landlord.Correspondence from other council officers states that Antoniades or his representatives applied for an HMO licence last November. The application means the HMO has in the last year stopped being criminal – but the licence has yet to be granted and the house is still not on the HMO register.Antoniades died earlier this year and Eunice’s house is now in the hands of his executors. A representative sent a short statement that reads in part: “Contractors are currently working there with good progress and [the] local authority is fully aware and monitoring the works in this and other locations.”The crime against Eunice is of making her life almost unlivable. What makes it so characteristic of modern Britain is how far the guilt spreads. Yes, there’s private-sector villainy, but there’s also public-sector complicity, by a council into its second decade of austerity. Then there are the courts, whose punishments are little more than “the cost of doing business”, as Al Mcclenahan of Justice for Tenants puts it. There is Margaret Thatcher’s right to buy and the failure to build enough social and affordable housing, nodded through again by housing secretary Steve Reed, as Iwrote here last week. Even the best achievement of this government, therenters’ protectionsthat gain royal assent next week, will be somewhat blunted by the lack of new money to enforce the new law.If we want to see who’s guilty for the injustices described above, we could start by looking in the mirror. After all, there’s plenty of blame to spare. It’s a crime, truly.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Generally, the increase is pegged to inflation, which this month is 3.8%. Recipients will be lucky if inflation falls by April, unlucky if it rises. Because this is a Labour government, this year’s universal credit gets an extra 2.3%, the first time ever the rate willrise regardless of inflation. The day passed without much comment, yet this is a time to stop and contemplate what we, the taxpayer, the state, consider adequate to exist. How much does someone really need? What is penury? And who should we prioritise?No government in history has ever been unwise enough to spell out exactly what standard of living, what food, heat and clothes a benefit sum should cover, for the obvious reason that it has never been enough. I used to hear Tory ministers say, “We don’t tell people how to spend their money. It’s their choice.” Labour ministers over the years tend to mumble.I came across one brief moment in our history when the outlay approached adequate food: strangely, I read it in a Leeds workhouse’s accounts. Not gruel, but precisely weighed amounts of meat, bread, vegetables and beer per head were listed. There was also an entry with fuel for heating. But that was just after a parliamentary scandal concerning another workhouse where people had died of cold and starvation. It didn’t last long. Feeding people enough was too expensive for the parish, so workhouses closed, poor laws relaxed and a little “outdoor” money was dispensed to old, sick and unemployed people instead. Handing out too little benefit was, and still is, far cheaper than grappling with housing, feeding and heating people.We know benefits are too little thanks to the annual scrutiny of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), following in the footsteps of Seebohm Rowntree who first went house by house in York in 1899, surveying exactly what poor people needed to survive. He drew the poverty line andfound 28% fell belowa level to “secure the necessaries of a healthy life”. He needed that granular evidence to challenge the myth that poor people were to blame for lack of thrift. You hear it everywhere still: “I had a large bowl of porridge today. It cost 4p,”boasted Baroness Anne Jenkinlaunching a poverty report a few years ago, suggesting the poor go hungry because they shop fecklessly and don’t cook.This is the week JRF prices its basket of essentials, now £120 a week, after housing costs. (And frozen housing allowances no longer cover the7.7% average private rent increasein the 12 months to March 2025, eating into benefits.) Basic universal credit for an adult from next April will only be £98. That’s not enough, what Citizens Advicecalls a “negative budget”. Withcosts of around£32 for energy and water, £20 travel (school etc), £8 phone and internet and £40 for food, £98 doesn’t cover it. And that’s before cleaning materials, toiletries, bank charges, clothes or shoes. With so much loose talk of benefit cuts ignoring these sums, let any cutter show what they could do without.Look at priorities. Any civilisation taking its future seriously would surely support children first. We put them last. Even with working parents earning too little, there is no additional universal credit top-up for families once they have more than two children. That is whatRachel Reevesmust put right in her budget: she seems to allow the word to spread that she will indeed end the two-child benefit cap.You can always tell which government was in power by the benefits graph. It rises under Labour, which left more than a million fewer poor children and poor pensioners, yet even so it has still never filled the basket. From 2010, the JRF tells me, the Tories cut benefits by about 9%in real terms. The chancellor raising universal credit above the rate of inflation is welcome, with further very low rises pencilled in for following years, but it needs to accelerate. Remind everyone that about one in three children they seelives below the poverty line. Is it fair to compare children with pensioners? In the years when working-age and children’s benefits were cut by 9%, the Tories increased pension credit for poor pensioners by 11%: good, but perplexing.Pensioners are theleast likely to be poor, compared with working-age adults and children. They get the triple lock that guarantees the state pension always rises by whatever the highest figure is out of inflation, average earning growth or a base rate of 2.5%. So it goes up not by 3.8% as with other inflation-indexed pensions, but4.8% because of earnings growth. That is perverse. The older the country grows, the more emphatically politics favours the decrepit above the young future who will pay for them. Children pay already: the over-65s are the biggest NHS users, with education and children’s needs a far lower priority. The Institute for Fiscal Studies this week is one of manycalling for the pension to riseonly with earnings, level pegging withthe standard of living but not triple-locked. How much better to spend that on pension credit for poorer pensioners – and the rest on the third of all children who live in poverty. But for all parties, touching the triple lock is a political live rail.Labour will surely do more for poor children: it should have started out proclaiming children its prime purpose, re-enacting the Child Poverty Act abolished by the Tories. But the country seems to have no appetite for rethinking priorities on almost anything, stuck with what is, blind to what might be. As for the lack of money, note that contrary to current moral panic, total benefit costs are not spiralling: non-pensioner benefits have stayed at between4-5% of GDP for the last 40 years, the Financial Times’s economics writer Chris Giles points out. At least Reeves and Starmer begin to put the blame on a key cause: the Office for Budget Responsibility says we lose 4% in growth due to Brexit. How much is that? £110bn. Tell the Faragists and Tories we could do with that income in next month’s budget.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It took another two years for Bradford council to publish the findings of a review showing just how badly the victims had been failed by multiple agencies.It’s hard to imagine the courage it must have taken to rebuild her life, waive her anonymity, and ultimately join the survivors’ panel advising a promised national inquiry into so-called grooming gangs. Which makes it all the more distressing that this week,Fiona Goddard and three other panel members quit, arguing that they no longer trusted the government, the process or the two shortlisted chairs for the inquiry.For who would you trust, if you’d been through what they had? Not social workers, not the council, not the politicians who must sound like every other authority figure who ultimately let them down. And not the police, for sure: in Bradford, one of Goddard’s former care workers who did try to raise the alarm says she was told to stop wasting police time, while in Rotherham some victims have reportedbeing raped by serving police officersand told they’d be handed back to their original abusers if they complained. There is currently an ongoing criminalinvestigationinto the allegations. If they now see betrayal around every corner – well, wouldn’t you? Yet as anyone who has worked with abused children will know, the hyper-vigilance that is so often the legacy of trauma can all too easily drive a wedge between survivors and those trying to help.Both prospective inquiry chairs – the former police officer Jim Gamble, a hero to many in child protection because of the decades he spent fighting child abuse online, and former director of children’s services Annie Hudson –have now pulled out, with Gamble citing a toxic atmosphere of “political opportunism and point-scoring” that makes it harder to gain victims’ already fragile confidence. Meanwhile the survivors’ panel is now painfully split. Four departing members have demanded the resignation of Home Office minister Jess Phillips, whose professional insight into sexual violence and natural bloody-mindedness made her the perfect choice to see this uncomfortable investigation through, while another five say they’ll only stay on the panelif Phillips does. Though the ideal candidate to lead this inquiry – someone with the necessary expertise to get to the truth, but no history of working in any institution that has previously failed children – probably doesn’t exist, the best of the rest may well be frightened off by the political pressure building up around it.What has happened to the grooming gang inquiry is both a tragedy and a warning; a premonition for the country of what can happen when collapsing trust in public institutions, combined with bad faith politics, leads to paralysis. What the survivors desperately need is a cross-party effort to rebuild their faith in the process, at least enough for the inquiry to get off the ground. Instead they risk becoming pawns in a political game that is no place for vulnerable people.On Wednesday, Kemi Badenoch used prime minister’s questions to cry cover-up, just asshe did last weekover the Chinese spy scandal, this time adding a dig about Keir Starmer’s association with “the best friend of a convicted paedophile” (a reference to Peter Mandelson’srelationshipwith Jeffrey Epstein). She must know that in the more paranoid and conspiracy-minded corners of the internet, that is playing with fire.The day before, the shadow home secretary Chris Philp called in parliament for the inquiry’s victim liaison officer Sabah Kaiser to be removed from her role, citing what he called her “frankly appalling view” (expressed two years ago) that it was “destructive, distracting, irresponsible” to keep saying that most abuse perpetrators were of Pakistani heritage. As it happens I met Sabah Kaiser some years ago, when she was giving testimony to Theresa May’s inquiry into child sexual exploitation: for she is a survivor too. She told me she was abused from the age of seven by four different men, both in Britain and in her family’s native Pakistan, and a teacher who was supposed to be counselling her. Though her experiences are not the same as Goddard’s, from what she told me I doubt she needs any lectures from MPs about how rapists may operate with impunity inside powerful patriarchal cultures where women’s voices are suppressed. And like Goddard, I hope someone is looking after her now that she has become collateral damage in a political firefight.It’s not too late to pull back from the brink. Reform UK has got the inquiry it craved: the Tories have extracted cast-iron assurances from both the home secretary Shabana Mahmood and from Starmer himself that it won’t be watered down or allowed to duck difficult questions about perpetrators’ ethnicity or religion. Both should take their wins and focus on ensuring the inquiry they wanted so badly doesn’t collapse beneath its own weight. The women and girls at its heart have already been failed too often, by institutions that couldn’t see what they didn’t want to see. They must not be failed all over again, by a political system too absorbed in its own petty narcissistic differences to recognise the danger staring it in the face.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her new album bumps up against the limits of bothFri 24 Oct 2025 08.16 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 09.16 EDTShareHeaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned. Though it probably wouldn’t have occurred to the 17th-century playwright whowrote those words, scorned women write absolute bangers, too.We have been reminded as much this week by Lily Allen’s new album, West End Girl, an explicit dissection of the singer’s recent divorce from the actorDavid Harbour, amid already swirling rumours of his infidelity. Allen here is high priestess of W1, sucking on a Lost Mary vape as she weaves us a tragedy of loss, betrayal and butt plugs.It’s too easy, though, to categorise West End Girl as pure revenge. The reality is more vulnerable: less Princess Diana in her little black dress, more a 14-track therapy session, full of references to mummy and daddy issues (“I’ll be your nonmonogamummy”). Its seeming openness is both amazing marketing and easy fodder for Allen’s strongest critics. Why, they will ask, must she work through her neuroses on such a public stage?View image in fullscreenThe album cover artwork for Lily Allen’s West End Girl.Photograph: Nieves GonzálezWell, because that’s precisely the kind of person we’ve made her into. Philip Larkin might just have missed something. They fuck you up your mum and dad (enterKeith Allen, stage right), but we (fans, spectators, newspaper readers) might just have a hand in all this, too. Allen’s is a gold-plated contribution to a confessional economy we have all been buying into for quite some time. We beg for famous women’s secrets, only to performatively recoil once they are offered up.Those reactions have always felt especially strongly directed at Allen. This is the same woman who recently provoked outrage for being unable to remember how many abortions she’d had. Seemingly, nobody had told selfish Lily that she ought to have that figure always to hand, in case the hungry public wanted to know.We might like to imagine we’re past the 1990s peak of tabloid-fuelled desire for intimate details of famous women’s lives. It was grim to see Allen reflect recently that many of her contemporaries, those most affected by those appetites in the 2000s, are now dead. It’s easy to forget that Allen turned 21 under that microscope, with projected notions of her own neuroses plastered over the front pages. Do we really have a right to judge her for a compulsion to share?Besides, those impulses still dictate the market, albeit in mutated forms. Now, greasy paparazzi don’t have to press themselves up against windows, because the cameras are already inside the house. Theoretically, this gives celebrities some pretence to privacy, but, in reality, audience appetites are ever increasing. Implicitly reckoning with this, West End Girl doesn’t only lay Allen’s compulsions and desires out on the table, it exposes ours, too.View image in fullscreenLily Allen performing at the T in the Park festival in 2006.Photograph: Andy Willsher/RedfernsIn 2020, I had a wonderful time at Allen and Harbour’schic Las Vegas wedding, practically tasting those greasily ironic In-N-Out burgers through my screen. Some years later, the couple invited me (and, admittedly, anyone else with access to Architectural Digest’s YouTube channel) into theirBrooklyn townhouse, to admire the swan-shaped taps they’d chosen in their upstairs bathroom, and the pastel pink paint in their windowless boudoir. After the breakup, I found myself zooming in on photographs of my hard-done-by friend Lily, marvelling at the details of her breathtaking new fake breasts. A hunger for intimate knowledge of women’s lives hasn’t gone away, but rather been rebranded as harmless, empowering and cool.West End Girl is a great album, partly fuelled by appetites like mine, but that isn’t to say we should feel good about those appetites in the first place. Instead, the album forces our weird curiosities to their logical extensions. Remember that pink bedroom you looked at in high definition? Now you can imagine the “strewn sheets”, used condoms and another woman’s “long black hair” there, too. Feeling uncomfortable? Good. It ought to be a little uncomfortable when the psyches and sex lives of strangers begin to seem like our god-given right.Openness itself isn’t the problem. This album, punctuated by facelifts, embarrassments and the frank sexual life of a woman approaching her 40s (for whom non-monogamy brought nothing like liberation) is funny, refreshing and sexy. We should celebrate that, while remaining wary of a culture that prizes the confessional mode above all. It’s a culture that creates women for whom, as Allen admits is her own experience, extreme self-exposure is a compulsion rather than a choice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2006, she was a class-confused twentysomething with big hoops, emblematic of a generation of young women told they could do and be whatever they liked. Her 2009 album It’s Not Me, It’s Youpivoted to coolly empowered jokes about bad sex and bad politics, and by 2014’s Sheezus,hers was an all-out-girlboss pop. (The latter is surely best left in the vault, alongside Ed Miliband’s “This is what a feminist looks like” T-shirt, and Emma Watson’s #HeForShe UN speech notes.) Now, Allen has identified a demand for therapised intimacy and Auto-Tuned imperfection, a counter, perhaps, to that other reigning archetype, the glossy and seemingly invulnerable all-American showgirl, who sings about her relationships while retaining a sheen of coyness and sanitised acceptability.In this case, though, satisfaction seems impossible. West End Girl might fulfil appetites at first, but many will soon need more, Googling details, reading analyses, scrolling back and zooming in. Perhaps it is fitting, then, that in therapeutic discourse, there is no “real” self to uncover, only layer after layer of compulsions, fears and desires. There is no singular truth of a person to be served up for dessert. Then again, that’s no bad thing. Perhaps we all need to get a little better at being left hungry.Jennifer Jasmine White is a writer and academicExplore more on these topicsLily AllenOpinionWomenCelebritycommentShareReuse this content"

Ever sincethe Mouse House bought Lucasfilm for $4bn in 2012, there have been those who blame the studio for turning George Lucas’s mythic space opera into an endlessly respawning content farm.But let’s give them credit where credit’s due: according toa new Associated Press interview with Adam Driver, Disney did at least have the presence of mind to politely decline a film whose entire premise would have been enough to make Darth Vader himself force-choke the pitch meeting from beyond the grave. Yes, it is (or would have been) Ben Solo: The Movie, directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Driver as the resurrected Sith-Jedi protagonist of that oh-so-wonderful entry, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.Yes, Driver really does seem to think this film, provisionally titled The Hunt for Ben Solo, is one people might actually want to see. After traumatising the collective psyche of legions ofStar Warsfans by reintroducing the long-dead Palpatine, entirely wiping the events of the previous film, and introducing something called the “Force dyad” to explain why Rey and Ren are suddenly snogging, Disney was invited to bring back Kylo for a high-jinks sequel.“We presented the script to Lucasfilm,” said Driver. “They loved the idea. They totally understood our angle. We took it to [Disney supremos] Bob Iger and Alan Bergman and they said no. They didn’t see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that.”Driver goes on to say during the interview that he was baffled as to why anyone wouldn’t want to see a Soderbergh Star Wars movie. “We wanted to be economical with it, and do it for less than most but in the same spirit of what those movies are, which is handmade and character-driven,” he says. “Empire Strikes Back being, in my opinion, the standard of what those movies were. But he is, to me, one of my favourite directors of all time. He lives his code, lives his ethics, doesn’t compromise.”View image in fullscreen‘He lives his code’ … Driver hoped to work with Steven Soderbergh again after collaborating on Logan Lucky (pictured).Photograph: Radial/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockThe problem is that the question is not whether filmgoers want to see a Star Wars movie made by Soderbergh, a director who could make a tax audit look stylish. It is why would anyone ever want to see the return of Kylo Ren, Ben Solo, Darth Moody or whatever his latest alter ego is? It’s bad enough that we are apparently getting a film in which Daisy Ridley’s Rey will try to restore the Jedi Order, though giventhis movie was announced in 2023and still hasn’t even entered production –unconfirmed rumours suggest it’s on hold pending script approval– there is hope.Kylo Ren is not Spider-Man, Rey is not Wonder Woman: these are not beloved icons of 20th and 21st-century pop mythology who can be wheeled out and reimagined endlessly for decades to come. They are half-finished characters from a franchise that forgot what its own story was about.And then there’s the fact that Ben Solo really did die at the end of The Rise of Skywalker. Is there some unspoken Hollywood rule that if enough people thought a movie was rubbish, we can all forget everything that happened in it? Can there ever be a viable explanation for Ren’s resurrection that gives any self-respecting Star Wars fan those two hours of our lives back?We’ll never know what Driver’s movie might have looked like, and that’s a good thing. After all, nobody demanded a sequel to Waterworld in which Kevin Costner opens a desalination startup. So why this?To many Star Wars fans, The Rise of Skywalker is upsetting because we can never forget about it. It’s there on Disney+ as a canonical big-screen Star Wars movie, for ever. We can try our best to ignore it, to imagine that the original Star Wars trilogy (and perhaps Rogue One) exist in glorious isolation. But there will always be the memory of this most soulless and confected of episodes lumbering through the canon. So no,Adam Driver, we don’t want a Star Wars movie about Ben Solo.Explore more on these topicsFilmStar WarsAdam DriverSteven SoderberghStar Wars: The Rise of SkywalkercommentShareReuse this content"

David Boies, the US super-attorney who represented Virginia Giuffre and counts among his previous clients Bill Gates, Elizabeth Holmes and Harvey Weinstein, was quoted in the Mail on Monday furthering the following opinion: “At this point, I think Prince Andrew has suffered enough, but the Met police owe Epstein’s victims an accounting.”I mean, two things jump out. Has he suffered enough, though? And, if accurately quoted, is counsel for Jeffrey Epstein’s most prominent victim, who died by suicide in April, the person to nudge our sympathies in her alleged abuser’s direction?On the first issue, Andrew is so thoroughly persona non-grata he is effectively under house arrest – but the house in question has 30 rooms and the garden including Windsor Great Park extends to about 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres), which would seem to diminish the suffering somewhat. And while it’s true he has lost use of one of his titles, he is, after all, still a prince. Even the suffering brought on by being trapped in a (very big) house with Sarah Ferguson – surely punishment enough for the harshest of crimes – is of course mitigated by the fact the pair were co-habiting before all this blew up again.Still, poor old Andrew. Over in the Telegraph, writing under the headline “Am I the only one feeling sorry for Prince Andrew?” a lone hack in the commentary wilderness ponders the unfairness of condemning a man whose only proven shortcoming was to stay in touch with his buddy after he’d gone to jail and then lie about it, and also fork over £12m to settle an accusation of sexual assault to a woman he said he’d never met, even though there she is, standing next to him in a photo. “If a friend of mine went to jail, I might stick by them too,” wrote the prince’s defender, and of course she is right. What value friendship if it founders on mere words – “paedophile”, “abusing a minor”, and “as young as 14”?TuesdayKeira Knightley’s children’s book came out this week and there’s only one question: where does it fall on the continuum between Maurice Sendak, David Walliams, and Budgie the Helicopter? Years ago, I had a conversation with Eric Carle, the brilliant author of the Hungry Caterpillar among other classics, who expressed his frustration at people who think they can just “knock out a kiddy book”.In fact, he said: “I often joke that with a novel you start out with a 35-word idea and you build out to 35,000 words. With a children’s book you have a 35,000-word idea and you reduce it to 35. That’s an exaggeration, but that’s what’s taking place with picture books.”It’s probably safe to say that The Bench, “by Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex”, did not start out as a 35,000-word idea and nor did the One and Only Sparkella by Channing Tatum (yes, the action hero). But I have to say Knightley’s book, which is called I Love You Just the Same and for which she has done the illustrations, looks very charming indeed.View image in fullscreen‘I’m pretty sure this look is still working for me.’Photograph: Carl Court/Getty ImagesWednesdayOn Wednesday, we learned about Burcu Yesilyurt, a woman trying to get on a bus in Richmond-upon-Thames without spilling her coffee, who was instead surrounded by a Swat team – OK, three council enforcement officers – who issued her with a £150 fine for pouring her coffee dregs down the drain and not in the bin.Well, you could hardly invent a better illustration of a central tenet of this country’s national life – the officious enforcement of small, nonsensical rules – and news of Yesilyurt’s plight flew around the world. While every person in Britain knew exactly the tone of voice in which the council officer had informed Yesilyurt she was “in breach of section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990”, the New York Times rustled up an expert in “urban drainage” to say he didn’t think chucking coffee down a drain was a particular problem. Then the Times of India did a follow-up, as did the Canadians.All of which must have been extremely alarming to the comms team at Richmond council, which, by midweek, had promptly done a U-turn and not only cancelled the fine but announced a review of “our advice on the disposal of liquids in a public place”. Justice for the Richmond One!ThursdayBriefly, I thought about applying for the £180k a year tutoring job – the one advertising for a person from a “socially appropriate background” to get a one-year-old into Eton or Harrow and that was seized on with relish this week by every media outlet in the land – and I bet you did, too. The job listing, which appeared on the website of a private tutoring company and didn’t seem fishy at all, described the ideal candidate as someone who could help their toddler “become an English gentleman” and acclimatise him to a “comprehensive British cultural environment”.No one knows the identity of the family in question, and even the head of the tutoring company said he had to sign a non-disclosure agreement before being given their surname. All of which sounds to me less like the actions of a real set of parents in search of a tutor and more like a stunt to prove something or other about the way we live now. Red flags abound, but chiefly: someone in a position to throw almost 200 grand on tutoring a baby would, surely, also be a person capable of doing a brief Google search to establish market rate.View image in fullscreen‘We’re gonna call it Ballroom for Make Benefit  Glorious Nation of United States of America.’Photograph: Abaca/ShutterstockFridayMarie Kondohas a new book out and it’s about how to pack, which is a great topic and I would totally buy that book. Her top recommendations for checked baggage are: decanting hair products and moisturisers to smaller bottles; using packing cubes to keep the suitcase tidy; and making a note of what you packed last time and didn’t wear or use. All excellent ideas which I will enjoy thinking about and, like every other piece of life advice that comes my way, never, ever, put into action.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekPrince AndrewMonarchyJeffrey EpsteincommentShareReuse this content"

It exposes the exhaustion of Labour’s moral imagination – and a deeper British crisis of purposeFri 24 Oct 2025 12.49 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 21.30 EDTShareTheCaerphilly byelectiononly looks local if you ignore what it represents: the quiet unravelling of the democraticworld’s most successful election-winning machine. For more than a century, Labour has been the dominant party in Wales. Its grip had survived deindustrialisation, Thatcherism and even the slow death of its working-class institutions. Now that seems to be ending – not through scandal or drama, but through a lack of moral imagination.What happened in this small valleys seat, where Labour lost a heartland base to Plaid Cymru while Reform UK menaced from the right, is theresult of a Downing Streetmentality that mistakes competence for conviction andcaution for strategy. Welsh Labour has not helped itself – vicious infighting had left itfracturedand demoralised. As Labour controls both the Welsh and UK parliaments, there’s nowhere to hide. The trouble is that Sir Keir Starmer promised change and delivered continuity. Caerphilly looks like a reckoning.The Seneddconstituency– situated between Cardiff’s commuter south, the valleys’ post-industrial fringe and theWelsh-speaking west– has long been regarded as “safe Labour”. Its loss therefore carries an outsized symbolism. It suggests that the institutional glue of Labour Wales – geography, class and community – has dried out and cracked.Plaid’svictoryshows that Welsh politics can still produce moral energy. But clearly no longer through theLabour machine. Its brand of politics appears, for the first time, a vehicle for voters who want fairness without nostalgia – who feel Welsh rather than Westminster-facing, and progressive rather than populist. In that sense the voters of Caerphilly have ceased to speak Labour’s language because Labour has ceased to speak theirs.The Guardian columnist Will Haywardobservedthat many people seemed “more afraid of the opponents of immigration than of the immigrants themselves”. His point was that the public’s “common sense” is realigning itself around ethics rather than pure economics. That ought to worry Sir Keir, who has neither mastered the politics of the heart nor of the wallet. Reform UK’s rise shows how easily moral frustration can tip into nihilism. But its limits in Caerphilly also suggest that the rise of rightwing populism in Wales has been contained by a sense of decency. When offered a politics that feels local and humane, Welsh voters still prefer it to a doctrine of spite. Yet the arithmetic of devolution could give Reform 30 of 96 Senedd seats - a Welsh base for wider antipathy.Conditions in Wales seem a microcosm of the British crisis – just as at the turn of the last century, when the nation hosted a contest between industrial capitalism, nonconformist moralism and working-class dissent. More than a century ago, Welsh minersturnedfrom chapel Liberalism to socialism, dramatising the shift from moral to materialist radicalism that would reshape Britain at large.The upheavals of legitimacy, production and identity that define Britain today are all present in Wales. There’s a broken industrial economy replaced bylow-wage, de-unionised service jobs; a party in power committed to managerialism, and a choice of either reactionary or progressive politics. The voters who turned fromLabour to Plaidweren’t just switching parties; they were searching for a moral vocabulary that could also protect their material lives. That’s the terrain on which Plaid’s future – and perhaps the British left’s renewal – will be decided.Explore more on these topicsWalesOpinionByelectionsPlaid CymruLabourReform UKClass issuesDevolutioneditorialsShareReuse this content"

All horror movies are a reflection of their time, and ours are pretty scary.Tech dystopianism means that Frankenstein’s monster has become a byword for AI, while Bram Stoker’sDraculahas always drawn on a dark strain of English xenophobia. So it is no coincidence that these 19th-century gothic villains, stars of the earliest horror films in the 1920s and 30s, are back in cinemas with new adaptations from directorsGuillermo del ToroandLuc Besson. Maggie Gyllenhaal is bringing out another Frankenstein,The Bride!, next year.Blood-sucking vampires and dead-eyed zombies have long been cast as the monsters of capitalism, coming out in times of economic gloom. This may explain whySinners, Ryan Coogler’s southern gothic vampire mashup, and28 Years Later, the third instalment of Danny Boyle and Alex Garland’s zombie franchise, have struck such a nerve. As the philosopher Slavoj Žižek hasobserved: “It’s much easier to imagine the end of all life on Earth than a much more modest radical change in capitalism.”Horror movies tap into our most primal fears, but they are also uniquely able to embody each new era’s anxieties. Emerging out of German expressionism after the first world war, the genre flourished against the backdrop of the Vietnam war in the late 1960s and 70s; the Aids epidemic and rampant consumerism led to a vampire reawakening in the 80s.The superhero seemingly reigned supreme over 21st-century multiplexes. But in dark times the rise of “elevated horror” – scary films with a social commentary – has finally toppled their dominion.Horror filmsare much cheaper to make, drawing in younger film-makers and encouraging experimentation. It has become an unlikely medium through which to explore issues such as race, class and gender, overlooked by the risk-averse big studios.Horror is also attractingmore women, both as film-makers and audiences. Last year’s Oscar-winningThe Substance by Coralie Fargeatand Jane Schoenbrun’sI Saw the TV Glowtook on themes of misogyny, celebrity and gender dysphoria. Cineastes trace this new wave of horror auteurs to Jordan Peele’s 2017 horror-satireGet Out, released a year after President Trump won his first term.Catharsis, escapism and the perverse comfort of the worst-case scenario all go some way to explain “the horror paradox”: why we enjoy being made to feel scared. Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 pandemic thriller,Contagion, was one of the most downloaded films of 2020. Horror helped get fans back into the cinemas after Covid. While we binge-watch the latest dramas from our sofas, there is a communality, and safety, in being frightened together.In the face of the all-too-real horror of war, the existential implications of the climate emergency and fears over where AI may lead us, it is no wonder we sometimes want to go into a dark room and scream. As JG Ballard put it:“The ultimate dystopia is the inside of one’s own head.” Dr Coltan Scrivner, a behavioural scientist, agrees. “You walk around with your mask of tranquillity, but inside your mind is a maze of worries,” he writes inMorbidly Curious, a new book exploring our fascination with the macabre. “Horror allows you to take off your mask.” This Halloween, the darkest genre has once again risen to meet the moment.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The difference is that Burdekin (originally published under the pseudonym Murray Constantine) imagined a future world in which the Nazis have been in power for 700 years.What is most striking about Burdekin’s novel is the way in which she locates the psychopathology of fascism in a form of toxic masculinity becoming increasingly familiar to contemporary readers. She anticipates, equally,the retreat of women to traditional gender rolesin a vain attempt to assuage masculine pride. But where Burdekin offers hope is in her analysis of fascism as, ultimately, self-defeating.Like the contemporary young men discussed inJack Urwin’s Man Up, the young Nazi soldiers in the novel are taking their own lives in unprecedented numbers. As Charlotte Higgins notes of Carson’s male characters “there is nothing inherently terrible about these young men” but they stand as a warning that rightwing gender ideologies and totalitarianism are inseparable.Debra Benita ShawReader in cultural theory, University of East LondonIn her article about Sally Carson’s the Crooked Cross, Charlotte Higgins points out how easy it is for extremism to take hold and concludes that “The resonances with today are impossible to overlook.”The similarly prescient Agatha Christie in Passenger to Frankfurt described a character’s visit to listen to a speech by Hitler. After being initially impressed and enthusiastic, the character then realised that there was no substance in the speech. The words were meaningless but the delivery was charismatic and it was successfully promoted through the insidious cult of violence.Such leadership “qualities”, which Christie went on to describe (more than 50 years ago) perfectly depict, for instance, Boris Johnson,Nigel Farage, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon and DonaldTrump. As Higgins suggests, we disregard these warnings at our peril.Dyllis WolinskiMossley, Greater ManchesterAs a nonfiction parallel to Sally Carson’s novel Crooked cross (and sequels), may I suggest A Village in the Third Reich: How Ordinary Lives Were Transformed by the Rise of Fascism by Julia Boyd and Angelika Patel, published in 2022.

You report that the study says that “in Manchester’s ‘slums’, more than 10% of the population was from the better-off … classes”. In Moss Side and Hume in the 1970s and 80s there were some professional people living there whom I knew, but the overwhelming majority of inhabitants were working class, and many of them impoverished and discriminated against. To suggest class was not that important is surely to throw the baby out with the bathwater.Prof Ralph DarlingtonManchesterEmily Chung has used modern historical research methods to suggest that Friedrich Engels’ 1844 study of the Manchester working class was as much polemic as social investigation. The same might be said of Henry Mayhew’s journalistic investigations of the London working class from 1849. Chung notes that while middle-class and working-class housing was not as differentiated as Engels suggested in reality, while the middle class went to church, the working classes went to the pub. Here Engels, and his Irish proletarian partner Lizzie Burns, broke the mould. They might be found drinking Manchester beer in the Thatched House, Market Street, a pub knocked down for the Arndale Centre. But Engels as a Manchester businessman also drank German pilsner in the Albert Club and Schiller-Anstalt Club.Keith FlettTottenham, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

These meadows, in turn, support marine biodiversity and serve as nurseries for many fish and invertebrates, sequester huge amounts of carbon that help mitigate climate change, and fortify coastal resilience against storms and sea-level rises.And yet, in thePhilippinesthey remain critically threatened by habitat degradation, pollution, human activity and climate breakdown.

Both Cash and Berry have consistently denied any wrongdoing.The Conservatives have challenged Keir Starmer repeatedly about what he and his advisers knew about the case, and whether the prime minister or others intervened so as to avoid a potential row with China.But the letters published on Friday by the joint committee, which isholding an inquiryinto the affair, set out that once the formal prosecution case had begun, no politicians were involved, meaning it was only Sunak who was sent Collins’s statement.Speaking after the letters were released, Starmer’s press secretary said the Conservatives had “serious questions to answer” about their role in the affair following “weeks of baseless allegations”.However, a source close to Sunak said the former PM had checked with the Cabinet Office and found there was no record of Collins’s statement being put in his prime ministerial box, meaning he would not have seen it personally.In aletterto Matt Western, the Labour MP who chairs the joint committee, Collins and Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser, set out that a first draft of Collins’s witness statement was sent to Sunak’s office in December 2023, “to also be shared with No 10 special advisers”.By this point, the letter said, a description of China as an “enemy” initially included in a draft had been removed by Collins “as it did not reflect government policy”.This fact was passed on to police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), Powell and Collins said in their letter, and added: “We understand from CTP [counter-terrorism police] that the CPS were aware of this in December 2023, which was before charges were brought.”The letter reiterated the insistence of Starmer’s government that it had nothing to do with the collapse of the case and did not see subsequent statements requested from Collins by prosecutors, produced after the change of government.“Following the submission of the first DNSA [deputy national security adviser] witness statement to CTP, no minister or special adviser (including the current NSA) played any role in the provision of evidence. The DNSA understood from lawyers that following the charging decision, his witness statement could not be shared,” the letter set out.Later, the committee published aletter from Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, whose role has come under increasing scrutiny.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAnswering a series of detailed questions, Parkinson set out how the threshold for securing a conviction under the Official Secrets Act had changed following a separate trial of six Bulgarian nationals found guilty of spying for Russia, which saw legal challenges based on whether a country to which information was passed had to be an “enemy”.Parkinson said that after discussions with Collins, it became clear that he would not describe China as “an active threat to national security” because that was not, Collins said, government policy.The furthest Collins would go was “active espionage threat”, Parkinson wrote, and that in the end this was seen as not enough for a conviction.This was, he said, all connected to the situation under the Conservatives, when the charges were brought: “The position of the current government was not relevant to the case.”Inanother letterto the committee also published on Friday, the attorney general, Richard Hermer, said he had played no role in the case beyond getting a “brief update” from prosecutors in August, and being told the next month that the case was being dropped.“Consent [for prosecution] was given by my predecessors on 3 April 2024. Following that date, no law officer intervened in the case at any stage,” he wrote.Starmer and his ministers have argued that the trial would not have had to be abandoned if the Conservatives had been speedier in replacing the Official Secrets Act, which dated from 1911. It has since been replaced with the National Security Act.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsRishi SunakChinaOfficial Secrets ActnewsShareReuse this content"

Violations of its airspace are a sensitive issue after a number of suspected Russian drones crossed into its territory from Belarus in July, including one carrying explosives.Explore more on these topicsLithuaniaEuropeBelarusRussiaAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

Temu said it had launched an investigation to ensure it complies with safety requirements in New Zealand.Doctors said the pressure of the magnets had caused necrosis – tissue death – in four areas of the boy’s small bowel and caecum, which is part of the large intestine. Surgeons operated to remove the dead tissue and retrieve the magnets and the child was able to return home after eight days in hospital.“This case highlights not only the dangers of magnet ingestion but also the dangers of the online marketplace for our paediatric population,” said the authors of the paper, Binura Lekamalage, Lucinda Duncan-Were and Nicola Davis.Surgery for ingestion of magnets can lead to complications later in life such as bowel obstruction, abdominal hernia and chronic pain, they said.‘A perfect coincidence’: rare red lightning captured in New Zealand skiesRead moreTemu said it was sorry to learn of the boy’s surgery. “We have launched an internal review and reached out to the authors of the New Zealand Medical Journal article to obtain more details about the case,” a spokesperson said in a statement.“At this stage, we have not been able to confirm whether the magnets involved were purchased through Temu or identify the specific product listing. Nonetheless, our teams are reviewing relevant listings to ensure full compliance with local safety requirements.”TheChinese-founded e-commerce companyhas come under criticism in markets including the EU for allegedly not doing enough to rid illegal products from its platform.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandHealthAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Starving, cold, exhausted and struggling with sickness, an estimated 300,000 soldiers died.Researchers now say they have identified two unexpected diseases among soldiers who died in the retreat – paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever – which provide fresh insights into their plight.“I think that the key thing of why [the retreat] was such a failure was the cold and the hunger and so on. With or without infectious diseases, they would have died massively anyway,” said Nicolás Rascovan, the head of the microbial paleogenomics unit at the Institut Pasteur and an author of the study.“But I think what this [does] change is some of our knowledge of all the infectious diseases.”Writing in the journal Current Biology, Rascovan and his colleagues describe how previous analyses of DNA from soldiers buried in the same mass grave in Vilnius, Lithuania, had revealed evidence of typhus and trench fever.However, that work was based on a very sensitive technique, called nested PCR, which involved screening samples for particular pathogens.Using a different technique, called shotgun sequencing, Rascovan’s team was able to look for fragments of DNA that matched any out of 185 bacteria known to cause disease in humans.The results, based on DNA from the teeth of 13 soldiers who had not previously been studied, revealed one soldier had been infected with the louse-borne bacteriumBorrelia recurrentis, which causes relapsing fever, and four others had been infected with a type of the bacteriumSalmonella enterica, which causes paratyphoid fever, a disease spread by contaminated food or water. One of these four soldiers might also have had relapsing fever, the team said.The researchers say the findings fit with historical descriptions of the symptoms experienced by soldiers of Napoleon’sGrand Armée, such as fever and diarrhoea.Unlike the previous studies, however, the team found no traces of the bacteria that cause typhus or trench fever.Friedrich Engels ‘took creative liberties’ with descriptions of class divides in ManchesterRead moreWhile Rascovan noted it could be that these soldiers were not infected with those diseases, or had only a mild infection, the results could alternatively be explained by the breakdown of ancient DNA over time, or that the quantity of DNA present was below the detection limit of the technique used.The researchers carried out a number of statistical tests and analyses to ensure their results were robust and pointed to genuine infections.These included looking for the signs of DNA degradation that would be expected from authentic ancient DNA, and exploring where the DNA belonged on the evolutionary “family tree” of the two bacteria.“In light of our results, a reasonable scenario for the deaths of these soldiers would be a combination of fatigue, cold, and several diseases, including paratyphoid fever and louse-borne relapsing fever.While not necessarily fatal, the louse-borne relapsing fever could significantly weaken an already exhausted individual,” they write.Dr Michael Rowe, an expert in European history at King’s College London, welcomed the study.“The science is interesting because I think it does something which a historian couldn’t do,” he said, referring to the identification of the diseases.But he cautioned against assuming the devastation of the army was simply down to harsh weather that left soldiers susceptible to starvation and disease – a view Napoleon promoted.“That underplays the Russians and it underplays the fact that they actually do some very clever things and that they [have] got a very good strategy and they’ve got actually quite a sophisticated army,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNapoleon BonaparteBiologyInfectious diseasesMedical researchMicrobiologyFranceRussianewsShareReuse this content"

My wife, who is more strict in her organic nourishment, had seven sorts of pesticides.”Regulators closely monitor dietary intake of pesticides when deciding whether they are safe enough for the market, but little attention has been paid to the effects of breathing them in or absorbing them through the skin. According to a newstudy, even people who live far from farms are exposed to several different types of pesticides from non-dietary sources – including banned substances.“What’s most surprising is that we cannot avoid exposure to pesticides: they are in our direct environment and our study indicates direct contact,” said Paul Scheepers, a molecular epidemiologist at Radboud University and co-author of the study. “The real question is how much is taken up [by the body] and that’s not so easy to answer.”The researchers got 641 participants in 10 European countries to wear silicone wristbands continuously for one week to capture external exposure to 193 pesticides. In laboratory tests, they detected 173 of the substances they tested for, with pesticides found in every wristband and an average of 20 substances for every person who took part.Non-organic farmers had the highest number of pesticides in their wristbands, with a median of 36, followed by organic farmers and people who live near farms, such as Wesselius and his wife. Consumers living far from farms had the fewest, with a median of 17 pesticides.“I’ve asked myself, was it worth it to know all this?” said Wesselius, who says some contractors for the farmers near his village do not seem to consider the wind direction when applying pesticides such as glyphosate and neonicotinoids. “It’s lingering in the back of my mind. Every time I see a tractor [with a spraying installation] there’s this kind of eerie feeling that I’m being poisoned.”Pesticides have helped the world produce more food using less space – fouling the regions in which they are sprayed while reducing the area of land that needs to be exploited for food – but have worried doctors who point to a growing body of evidence linking them to disease. TheEU scrapped a proposed targetlast year to halve pesticide use and risk by 2030 after lobbying from agriculture lobbies and some member states, who argued the cuts were too deep.Bartosz Wielgomas, the head of the toxicology department at the Medical University of Gdańsk, who was not involved in the study, said the results were of “great value” but may even underestimate exposure to pesticides. The silicone wristbands do not absorb all substances to the same degree, he said, and the researchers tested for fewer than half of the pesticides approved in the EU.“The conclusions of this study are highly significant: pesticides are ubiquitous, not only in agricultural areas but also in environments far from crop fields,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They also detected some banned insecticides, such as dieldrin and propoxur.While the presence of pesticides in the wristbands does not indicate direct health effects, the authors voiced concern about the number of different types. Researchers have suggested that somemixturesof different chemicals amplify their effects on the human body beyond what studies of isolated exposure find.Wesselius, whose results have motivated him to eat more organic food, said: “It’s not a nice thing to know.

Critics say it’s a threat to the food supplyRebecca Tuhus-DubrowFri 24 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 12.14 EDTShareOn a Monday afternoon in late September, Zoe Rosenberg, a 23-year-old University ofCalifornia, Berkeley, student, emerged from a courtroom in Santa Rosa, California. Flanked by her lawyers, she moved briskly through the courthouse corridors, past more than 100 prospective jurors.Pinned to her black blazer was a tiny metallic chicken, glinting on the lapel.It was one of the last days of jury selection for Rosenberg’s trial. She was facing two misdemeanor charges for trespassing and one for tampering with a vehicle, as well as one count of felony conspiracy. If convicted on all charges, she could spend up to four and a half years in jail.It’s not a whodunit … It’s a whydunitChris CarrawayThe facts at the center of the case were not in dispute. Just past midnight on 13 June 2023, Rosenberg and several other members of the group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) drove to Petaluma Poultry, a slaughterhouse about 40 miles (64km) north of San Francisco. Disguised as workers, they encountered a truck filled with thousands of live chickens packed into crates. They removed four chickens, placed them in buckets and drove away.These facts were not in dispute because Rosenberg and her fellow activists had subsequently released video footage of what they had done. “It’s not a whodunit,” Rosenberg’s lawyer, Chris Carraway, likes to say. “It’s a whydunit.”After leaving the slaughterhouse, the activists examined the chickens – whom they named Poppy, Ivy, Aster, and Azalea - more thoroughly. Rosenberg says they were splattered with diarrhea and suffering from wounds and abrasions.Carraway would explain in court that Rosenberg’s intent was not to steal the birds, but to aid them. The jurors would be asked to determine, in effect, how far compassion can go before it becomes a crime.The daughter of a veterinarian, Rosenberg grew up on 40 acres (16 hectares) in San Luis Obispo county, California, surrounded by cats, dogs, goats, guinea pigs and rabbits.View image in fullscreenZoe Rosenberg.Photograph: Courtesy of Zoe RosenbergWhen she was nine, the family got back-yard chickens. She can still rattle off their names without pausing: Eddie, Chirp, Olive, Herki, Red, Daisy and Popcorn. Until then, Rosenberg had shared the common assumption that chickens were not too bright, but getting to know them changed her views. “I realized they have unique personalities and that they’re so smart and curious, and that their lives are really, really valuable.”Two years later, Rosenberg watched an online video of activists entering a big egg farm in Australia and removing chickens. It was the first time she had gotten a glimpse inside a factory farm, and she was shocked by the conditions: thousands upon thousands of hens packed tightly into cages. It was also her introduction to the concept of “open rescue”, the term activists use to describe operations in which they infiltrate factory farms or research facilities and remove animals they deem to be in distress. They make no secret of their work, often posting footage of their actions.After watching the video, Rosenberg immediately knew that was something she wanted to do, and she emailed the director of the group behind it. (“She had no idea I was 11,” Rosenberg recalled.) The next year, in 2015, she founded the San Luis Obispo chapter of DxE, a then new animal rights organization.Over the years, animal rights groups have gained a reputation for using confrontational tactics – such as Peta’s campaign comparing meat consumption to the Holocaust or stunts that involve splattering fur with fake blood. The logic is simple: it takes shock to jolt people out of complacency about animal suffering. But the result is often the opposite: turning people off. In a society where eating meat is the norm, many see such protests as a personal attack – and feel judged, not persuaded.DxE follows in this tradition; they have held “die-ins” outside a butcher shop in Berkeley and disrupted a Friday dinner at the beloved restaurant Chez Panisse.But the group’s signature move has been “open rescues”. From the activists’ perspective, one virtue of the tactic is that it does not just call attention to an injustice – it attempts, in a small way, to correct it. It also targets the industry rather than implicating individual consumers, and offers a glimpse into the hidden world of animal agriculture.“The court cases that we have are kind of a vehicle to pose the question to a randomly selected jury of our peers, and to others through the media,” said Cassie King, DxE’s communications lead. “Is it a crime, or is it the right thing to do, to rescue an animal who’s dying in a factory farm?”View image in fullscreenVincent and Petunia, two chickens taken by Zoe Rosenberg.Photograph: Courtesy of Zoe RosenbergAlready, DxE activists note, there are“right to rescue” lawsin California and 13 other states granting people criminal and civil protection if they forcibly enter a motor vehicle to remove an endangered animal. Their argument is that the same principle should apply to all animals in distress.Since 2014, according to King, members of the group have participated in about 60 such operations. In the past few years, activists have taken two piglets from a Utah factory farm; two chickens from a Foster Farms truck outside a slaughterhouse in Merced county, California; and three dogs from a breeding and research facility in Wisconsin. After removing the animals, the activists provide them with veterinary care and place them in new homes.Mike Weber runs Weber Family Farms with his brother in Petaluma. The farm has been in his family for 113 years, he told me. It is an egg-laying operation with just under 1 million chickens, housed in about two dozen buildings. The business, which is powered by more than 2,500 solar panels, also turns the chickens’ manure into organic fertilizer.In May 2018, DxE activists staged a large-scale operation on his farm. Several hundred activists showed up to protest. A fraction of these stormed on to the property and broke into a chicken house over the objections of Weber and his employees, as captured in a Vicedocumentary. They grabbed about six chickens.We want to eat [meat] … We’re not willing to give that up. And that should be our rightMike WeberTo Weber, it’s simple: “You can’t trespass. You can’t break into locked buildings. You can’t go and steal things out of people’s cars or buildings or food processing plants.” He maintains that all of the chickens the activists took were healthy. “The only thing that was wrong was the way in which they were holding them – they were compressing the air sacs; they did not know how to hold a chicken.” (King, of DxE, disputed this.)Another point of contention involves infectious diseases. Activists emphasize that the conditions of factory farms, with tens or hundreds of thousands of animals crammed together, pose the risk of disease outbreaks, which can threaten the animals’ as well as the public’s health. But critics allege that the activists themselves, by breaking into these facilities, can introduce pathogens, with serious consequences.In November 2023, a severe avian fluoutbreakswept through Sonoma county, affecting 10 sites. More than 1 million birds were killed to stop the spread. Weber lost every chicken. In the weeks leading up to the outbreak, Rosenberg and other activists had entered at least one of these facilities.A 2024reportfrom the California department of food and agriculture concluded: “Given the high number of wild birds migrating through the area at that time shedding virus into the environment, as well as the egregious nature of these biosecurity breaches, it is plausible that virus was introduced into the index Sonoma premises during those incidents.”Yet the report also noted concerns about the biosecurity practices of all the infected premises, which may have contributed to the outbreak. (DxE activists say they take biosecurity precautions that exceed industry standards.)View image in fullscreenProtesters with Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) stage a die-in at the butcher shop in a Whole Foods in Manhattan, New York, in 2019.Photograph: Erik McGregor/LightRocket/Getty ImagesWayne Hsiung, a DxE founder, was later convicted of trespassing and felony conspiracy for his role in the protests at Weber’s farm and found guilty of trespassing on a duck farm in Sonoma county. He was sentenced to 90 days in county jail and served about half that time.Even so, Hsiung and other activists have won a series of unexpected victories: in two of the cases mentioned above, juries acquitted the defendants.In October 2022, Hsiung and Paul Darwin Picklesimer were foundnot guiltyof burglary and theft for removing the two piglets from the Utah farm. And in March 2023, two activists – one of whom was Baywatch actor Alexandra Paul – wereacquittedof all charges after removing two chickens from the truck in Merced, California.In both cases, the defense argued that the goal was not to steal property but to rescue animals that were sick and suffering. Veterinarians testified about the ill health of the animals. Another key point was that because of their condition, the animals had no monetary value to the companies – if anything, they were a financial liability.The activists were defended by attorneys at theanimal law programat the University of Denver, founded in 2021 by law professor Justin Marceau to bring legal savvy to the fight for animal rights. (Carraway, Rosenberg’s lawyer, is associated with this clinic.)These acquittals were “pretty earth-shattering”, said Camille Labchuk, executive director of Animal Justice, a Canadian legal advocacy organization. “To me what it represented was the power of being able to tell people the stories of what animals endure, tell the personal stories of the rescuers.” She added that it reflected “a real triumph of the ability of people to put aside their preconceived beliefs” and “a real triumph of logic and reason”.Back at the courthouse, the jurors at last were permitted to file into the courtroom. Rosenberg’s supporters – about a dozen fellow activists, who were younger than the median age, with more conspicuous tattoos – waited outside in the corridor. They all wore coral crepe-paper poppies, in honor of Poppy, one of the four chickens, pinned to their shirts.Twenty of the prospective jurors were called up by their four-digit numbers to sit in the jury box and answer questions from the judge, Kenneth J Gnoss. There was a registered nurse, a grocery clerk, a mortgage loan officer. One prospective juror had grown up on a beef cattle ranch; one had a nephew who participated in the 4H club; another had 16 chickens and one rooster in his back yard. When the prosecutor questioned them, he asked if anyone was a vegan or vegetarian. No one raised a hand.Sonoma county is known for its organic and regenerative farming practices. Petaluma Poultry – a subsidiary of Perdue – prides itself in being “a pioneer in free range and organic poultry”, according to itswebsite. “We provide locally raised, fresh organic and free range chicken with ranches in and around Sonoma county.”But DxE activists dismiss such claims as “humanewashing”. For several years leading up to the night in question, Rosenberg and her peers tried to get local officials to investigate Petaluma Poultry, to no avail. In a 2023 “investigatory report”, they allege that during clandestine visits to six northern California factory farms that supply chickens to the company, they found routine violations of state animal cruelty laws, including “birds collapsed on the floor or stuck on their backs and unable to walk to food or water, left to slowly starve to death”. They also reported wing and joint injuries, open sores, feather loss and “necrotic wounds so deep that muscle and bone were exposed”.In a statement, Robert Muelrath, a spokesperson for Petaluma Poultry, wrote: “Animal care is at the heart of everything we do.Birdshave room to roam, access to the outdoors and natural enrichments and are raised on a healthy, antibiotic-free diet. Independent audits from the USDA and Global Animal Partnership regularly verify our compliance with strict free range and organic standards, and USDA personnel are on-site at our harvesting facility daily to oversee operations.”After court let out for the day, I joined Rosenberg, Carraway and two other activists at a nearby bar.Rosenberg, quiet and unassuming, seemed an unlikely firebrand. I thought I might find her sanctimonious, but as hard as I tried, I couldn’t detect a hint of self-righteousness. She had a plastic tube taped across her face, from her nose across her right cheek – a feeding tube she needed due to complications from diabetes. She said that living with a disability for the past 15 years has made her empathize with sick and injured animals – it’s painful, she added, to think of them suffering without care.“It feels good to finally have our day in court and, more importantly, what feels like these animals’ day in court,” she said. For almost two years leading up to the trial, Rosenberg’s travel was restricted, and she was prohibited from setting foot on any property where animals are raised for meat, dairy or eggs. She was also required to wear an ankle monitor.So much of what happens in factory farms is happening behind closed doorsZoe RosenbergAlthough no one disputed that Rosenberg had removed four chickens from the slaughterhouse, it turned out that other facts were contested. On the second day after the trial began, a Perdue cybersecurity director testified that computer files had been accessed, including confidential documents, and emailed to an external address. The next day, a Petaluma Poultry manager testified that unauthorized GPS tracking devices had been discovered on the company’s transport trucks. The prosecutors suggested that Rosenberg was involved.On 16 October, the trial took another turn when the defense called Raven Deerbrook as a witness. Deerbrook, a former DxE member, had been charged as Rosenberg’s co-conspirator, but had taken a plea deal. She testified that she had accessed the files and placed the GPS tracking devices on the trucks, and that she had acted alone.In his statement, Muelrath, the spokesperson for Petaluma Poultry, wrote: “Given Direct Action Everywhere’s elaborate efforts to infiltrate the facility and access private information, their so-called ‘rescue’ looks like a cover for a much broader agenda: gathering material to support their mission of eliminating animal agriculture and removing meat from the American diet.”DxE’s vision is radical: their ultimate goal is total animal liberation – meaning the end of all animal agriculture. They believe animals should be categorized as “legal persons,” not property.Weber, the farmer, said: “I always want to find a middle ground, but you can’t, because their belief system is a fundamentalist belief system.”He went on: “And this is our food supply that we’re talking about … For people here in our county, our people say it loud and clear. We want to eat. We want to have ice-cream that’s made with milk and eggs on the Fourth of July. We might even want to have a hotdog or a barbecued piece of meat or chicken or whatever. We’re not willing to give that up. And that should be our right.”Radical animal rights activists are, of course, a tiny minority of the population. But they see themselves as a moral vanguard. “Over the long term, we will succeed,” Hsiung, the DxE founder, told me, “just because we have stronger arguments.”The short, painful life of your Thanksgiving turkeyRead moreI asked Rosenberg what outcome she was hoping for. “My ideal outcome is honestly just whatever is best for the animals,” she said. “An acquittal wouldn’t set an actual legal precedent, but it would set a social precedent, to some extent, and send an important message.”A conviction, however, would present another opportunity: her lawyers would appeal. If the appellate court ruled in her favor, that could actually change the law, moving it in the direction of recognizing animal personhood or a “right to rescue”.“I hope either way that this case is just able to shine a light on what these animals are experiencing every moment of their lives,” she went on. “So much of what happens in factory farms is happening behind closed doors. It’s happening in the dark. And no one ever gets to see it, no one ever gets to hear these animals’ stories.”Regardless of the verdict, as far as Rosenberg is concerned, she has already won an important victory: Poppy, Ivy, Aster and Azalea are living in an undisclosed location and doing well.This article was amended on 24 October 2025 to clarify what charges Wayne Hsiung was convicted for in the protests at Weber’s farm and at a duck farm in Sonoma county.Explore more on these topicsUS newsAnimal welfareAnimalsFarmingUS crimeCaliforniaBirdsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Water droplets cluster around the particles, modifying the structure of the clouds and increasing the chance of precipitation.Months of unpredictable weather over India’s capital had put the BJP’s cloud-seeding plans on pause. But days after Delhi’sair quality once again fell into the hazardous rangeafter Diwali festival, and a thick brown haze settled over the city, the government said the scheme would finally be rolled out.The Delhi environment minister, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, said the first trial flight – during which seeding flares were launched into the sky – was conducted on Thursday.The city’s chief minister, Rekha Gupta, said: “If conditions remain favourable, Delhi will experience its first artificial rain on October 29.”View image in fullscreenPeople light ‘eco-friendly’ fireworks during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, in Delhi.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesExperts who have studied cloud seeding say it is no panacea. It is supposed to produce more frequent and heavier rain than the clouds would otherwise release, but the effect is often small. The process also requires clouds, and they are often not present over Delhi during winter when pollution peaks. It also does not address the root causes of pollutants.Two professors at Delhi’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences condemned the plan as a “gimmick”. “It is a textbook case of science misapplied and ethics ignored,” said Shahzad Gani and Krishna AchutaRao,writing in the Hindu newspaper.They equated the plans with the “smog towers” that were erected in Delhi by the previous government, at the cost of billions of rupees, but were found to be largely ineffectual at improving air quality.They also warned that there was little research into the long-term effects on repeated use of the chemicals used in cloud seeding, such as silver iodide or sodium chloride, on agriculture and human health.“Snake-oil solutions will not clear the air in Delhi or the rest of NorthIndia,” Gani and AchutaRao said.Delhi has been ranked as theworld’s most polluted cityfor more than a decade. In 2024, pollution levels – caused by a deadly mix of emissions from crop burning, factories and heavy traffic, which get trapped over the city when the air gets colder – rose by 6%.During winter, levels of PM2.5 and PM 10 – the fine particulate matter that causes pollution – in the city regularly go far above those seen during the famous “airpocalypse” in Beijing in 2013, before the Chinese government took stringent initiatives to clean the air.Explore more on these topicsDelhiAir pollutionIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The US president has demanded interest rate cuts andlaunched stinging attackson the Fed’s chair, Jerome Powell – calling him a “moron” on social media – and threatening to remove him.Farage’s latest comments come just weeks after he and Reform UK MP Richard Ticeheld a meeting with Baileyat the Bank’s Threadneedle Street headquarters.Farage had been calling for the central bank to halt bond sales and cut the interest rate it pays to UK banks, after an exchange of letters, in which the governor agreed to a meeting.Tice, Reform’s deputy leader, has previously said the Treasury should beallowed to appoint “one or two”government representatives to sit on the Bank’s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC).The Reform UK leader, who previously worked as a commodities trader, has worked more recently as abrand ambassador for a gold company, and has discussed his goal of making London aglobal “powerhouse” for cryptocurrencies.Farage, who has previously called Bailey a “dinosaur” for his views on digital currencies, said he was encouraged by thegovernor’s change of heartabout stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is supposed to have a stable value, such as US$1 (£0.75) per token.“The Bank of England, the British government, the regulator – whatever shape that takes – they’ve all got to understand the world is changing, has changed, very, very rapidly,” Farage said.After Bailey’s meeting with Farage and Tice, a Bank of England spokesperson said the governor had “a productive meeting” with them.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The judge described Mosquera as an “odd man” who committed “premeditated and thoroughly wicked crimes”.He added that Mosquera “may never be safe to set free”. The Colombian national was told he would be deported back to Colombia if he was ever released.Grisly suitcase find led to one of Met’s ‘most harrowing’ murder inquiriesRead moreMosquera was staying with the couple when he “decapitated and dismembered” them, froze parts of their remains and took the rest in suitcases to Clifton Suspension Bridge, in Bristol, his trial heard.A jury at Woolwich crown court unanimously foundMosquera guilty of both murders in July.Alfonso took part in extreme sex and Mosquera, whom he had met online years earlier, was part of that world, jurors heard.Alfonso was stabbed during a filmed session. Footage played in court showed Mosquera asking: “Do you like it?”, and then singing and dancing after the attack.Seconds after the murders he went on a computer to try to steal from his victims’ bank accounts. He accessed a spreadsheet of financial passwords and tried to log into the couple’s bank accounts.He unsuccessfully tried to send £4,000 to his account in Colombia.The prosecutor, Deanna Heer KC, told the court Mosquera’s plan had been to throw the suitcases off the bridge to dispose of the remains after the “calculated” and “premeditated” killings.Mosquera admitted killing Alfonso but claimed it was manslaughter by reason of loss of control. He pleaded not guilty to murdering both men and claimed Alfonso killed Longworth. Mosquera told the jury he feared for his own life and believed he was about to be killed when he stabbed Alfonso.Computer searches for the phrase “where on the head is a knock fatal?” were made on the day the couple were killed.Two days after the murders, Mosquera travelled to Bristol’s landmark bridge with the remains of his victims in a large red suitcase and a silver trunk. A cyclist who asked Mosquera what was inside, was told the case and trunk contained car parts.View image in fullscreenThe judge said he was sure Mosquera planned to throw the suitcase off Clifton Suspension Bridge.Photograph: Ben Birchall/PABridge staff noticed something leaking from the suitcase, which Mosquera told them was oil. When they shone their torches on the cases, he fled.In his sentencing remarks, Bennathan said: “You ended up on the Clifton Suspension Bridge. I am sure that your aim was to throw the cases full of body parts off the bridge in an attempt to dispose of them.“This was a hopeless endeavour as the bridge had CCTV, security staff and a high wire fence along its length. Being an incompetent criminal, however, does not count as mitigation. When challenged, you fled.”Mosquera, who does not speak English, made repeated computer searches to find a freezer in the lead-up to the killings, the court heard.Many of the searches were in Spanish, some used Google translate and were made while Mosquera was the only person in the house.He asked questions about delivery options and searches were made for a deep freezer, a chest freezer, a large indoor freezer and an outdoor freezer.Before he was sentenced, Mosquera pleaded guilty to three counts of possessing indecent images of children. He admitted possession of 1,500 category A images, 750 category B images, and 4,000 category C images.Bennathan said the images found on Mosquera’s laptop showed “very young children being subjected to a variety of sexual abuse really of horrifying detail and nature”. He sentenced him to 16 months for these offences to run concurrently with his life sentence for the murders.Explore more on these topicsCrimeBristolLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Most people don’t realise that the WHO classifies nitrite-cured meats like bacon and ham in the same carcinogenic category as tobacco and asbestos,” said Denis Corpet, an emeritus professor of food safety and nutrition at Toulouse University and one of the four scientists.“Ministers have a responsibility to protect public health and reduce the risk of bowel cancer linked to these products and so should introduce mandatory warning labels on product packaging similar to ‘smoking kills’ on cigarettes.”The IARC said in 2015 that: “An analysis of data from 10 studies estimated that every 50 gram portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal [bowel] cancer by about 18%.”The WorldCancerResearch Fund (WCRF), which assesses evidence for preventing and treating the disease, said there was no doubt that processed meat left people at greater risk.“There is clear evidence that consuming processed meat increases the risk of colorectal cancer,” said Kate Oldridge-Turner, the charity’s head of policy and public affairs.“This is through a complex set of reactions occurring in the body when processed meat is eaten, including the nitrites added during processing forming carcinogenic chemicals.”She did not back the scientists’ call for warning labels. But she did advise that “dietary guidelines and standards should reinforce limited consumption of all types of processed meat and steps should be taken to increase availability of healthy foods, especially in public settings such as schools”.Prof Chris Elliott, a former government adviser on food safety and another of the letter’s signatories, said: “A decade on from the WHO report, the UK government has done virtually nothing to reduce exposure to nitrites, the curing agents that make these products pink and long-lasting but also create nitrosamines, compounds known to trigger cancer.“Every year of delay means more preventable cancers, more families affected and greater strain on the NHS.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “The Food Standards Agency have made clear that the link between nitrates and nitrites and cancer remains inconclusive.”Explore more on these topicsCancerHealthFood & drink industryMeat industryMeatnewsShareReuse this content"

Beccuau said investigators were “exploring all hypotheses” – including the possibility that the thieves had help from inside the Louvre.She said the robbery bore “all the marks of an organisation: the careful preparation, the audacity of the modus operandi, the type of jewellery targeted, the escape”.The whole operation lasted less than seven minutes, with the two thieves who entered the gallery spending 3 minutes and 58 seconds inside. While they dropped a diamond- and emerald-studded crown during their getaway, they succeeded in fleeing with a total of eight 19th-century, richly gem-encrusted pieces.Those included an emerald and diamond necklace that Napoleon I gave his second wife, Marie Louise, and a diadem set with 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds that had once belonged to the empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III.It has emerged that avery similar heist was outlined in one of the 52 volumesof a popular children’s book series beginning in the 1960s that stars Fantômette, a girl crime-fighter aged about 12 who is often described as France’s first female superhero.In Appelez Fantômette (Call Fantômette), a character describes exactly how he would break into the Louvre, steal a diamond, and escape, all in a matter of minutes and without harming anyone.“Listen to me,” the character, speaking in his prison cell, says. “All you have to do is place a ladder up against the wall and climb up to the first floor; indeed, there is only one floor. Then, you break a window-pane.“You advance 10 metres, smash the display case with a hammer and bingo! You have your hands on theobjet.Ah, if only I wasn’t locked up in here, I can assure you it would be done in a flash.”Amid experts’ fears that the jewels taken in Sunday’s dramatic heist were far too recognisable to be sold in their present state and had probably been stolen to be broken down into their constituent gems and melted-down metal, Beccuau stressed time was of the essence.She said that with worldwide media attention focused on the robbery, there was a small hope that “the robbers will not really dare move very far [and] we can recover the jewels if we can move fast enough”.Citing museum surveillance camera footage,Le Parisien newspaper saidthe thieves had initially been unable to open the display cases in the Apollo gallery, but had eventually been able to smash small openings in the glass and pull out the jewels.The paper said the museum’s internal alarm systems had functioned normally, with a first alarm going off at 9.34am when the robbers smashed the balcony window looking on to the Quai François Mitterrand. Footage shows two attendants arriving in the gallery but then retreating, possibly fearing the thieves were armed, it said.The Louvre’s director,Laurence des Cars, on Wednesday acknowledgeda “terrible failure” of security, admitting there was “highly insufficient” security camera coverage of the outside walls of the world’s largest museum.Des Cars told French senators that security cameras did not adequately cover the thieves’ point of entry. “The only camera installed there is directed westward, so did not cover the balcony involved in the break-in,” she said. More generally, she added, while there were “some perimeter cameras”, they were “ageing”.The museum director nonetheless defended the museum’s ongoing €80m (£70m) security programme, saying security camera coverage was being increased across the entire 37-hectare site, including “video surveillance covering all facades”.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeParisMuseumsnewsShareReuse this content"

Witnesses said that following the lethal injection, Black started breathing and sighing loudly, and after several minutes groaned in agony, saying, “I can’t do this” and “It hurts so bad”. He repeatedly lifted his head. He was pronounced dead roughly 10 minutes after he had cried out in pain.This week, Henry, a federal public defender, told a judge that an electrocardiogram showed nearly two minutes of ongoing activity in Black’s heart after officials had declared him dead, the Associated Pressreported. She was testifying in court inongoing litigationchallenging the state’s lethal injection protocols.The Tennessee execution that ‘went horribly wrong’: how Byron Black’s killing unfoldedRead moreThe Tennessee attorney general’s office and corrections department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.On 5 August, Black, 69, was injected with the sedative pentobarbital, which was supposed to render him unconscious as it stopped his breathing and killed him. The state had argued Black would not consciously experience drawn-out pain. But Henry and a group of media witnesses in the execution chamber reported he was visibly in distress. She also said staff had struggled for roughly 10 minutes to find a vein in one of his arms and blood had oozed from the injection site.Henry told the Guardian after Friday’s hearing that Black’s legal team recently reviewed EKG records and saw continued activity for one minute and 50 seconds after the declared time of death. At that point, the EKG record stopped altogether, so it is possible his cardiac activity continued, she said, noting there was no EKG flatline recorded.The EKG, she said in the interview, provided further evidence the pentobarbital did not work as intended: “It’s very, very disturbing on so many levels.”If he was still alive when the official checked him, he should have been administered additional pentobarbital under the state’s protocols, Henry said. After death was declared, the prison also closed the curtain, blocking onlookers’ view. But the law dictates that witnesses have a right to view the entirety of the procedure, which would have been violated if he was not, in fact, dead yet.“That means the public and his attorneys didn’t have an opportunity to see if there was additional suffering,” Henry said.The EKG, she said, suggested state officials “don’t know what they are doing with this drug”. “Once we get access to information, we are finding the drug does not act in the body the way their experts say it will.”The discovery was distressing for the legal team, said Henry, who had represented Black for 25 years. “I was physically sick at the fact that he wasn’t dead when they said he was.”Black was a wheelchair user with lifelong intellectual disabilities, dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, severe heart failure and prostate cancer, said his lawyers, who fought for years to halt the execution. The county medical examiner’s autopsy,released in September, showed that during the execution, he developed pulmonary edema, a condition where the lungs become swollen with fluid, radio stationWPLN reported.Attorneys for people on death row have said theconditioncan cause excruciating pain and lead to a feeling akin to drowning and suffocation. Henry described it on Friday as a “torture” and an “incredibly painful form of waterboarding”.In the lead-up to Black’s execution, his lawyers cited the lung damage risks in their ongoing challenges, but the state’s medical experttestifiedthat people injected with pentobarbital should become unconscious within roughly 20 seconds, and that if pulmonary edema occurs, the individual would not perceive it, according to WPLN.Black was on death row for 35 years for the1988 homicidesof his girlfriend, Angela Clay, and her two daughters, Latoya, nine, and Lakeisha, six. He maintained his innocence, though his lawyers had focused their legal efforts on hisintellectual disability, arguing it was unlawful for the state to kill him in his condition.In Friday’s hearing, a lawyer for Tennessee argued that members of the execution team should not be compelled to testify in the ongoing litigation, which alleges the state’s protocols constitute cruel and unusual punishment,according to the AP. The state argued that the execution team members’ identities, which are kept secret, could be exposed, even if their faces and voices were masked.But Henry, who leads a group of death row attorneys, argued the direct testimony of those who carried out the killing was vital, noting her concerns that something may have gone wrong with the IV during the process: “Did the IV come out? Is that the reason that Mr Black exclaimed, ‘It’s hurting so bad’? Is the EKG correct?” she told the judge.Explore more on these topicsTennesseeCapital punishmentnewsShareReuse this content"

It uses automation to monitor the system to ensure records are updated frequently to ensure additional capacity is added as required, hardware failures are handled and traffic is distributed efficiently.The root cause of the issue, AWS said, was an empty DNS record for the Virginia-based US-East-1 datacentre region. The bug failed to automatically repair, and required manual operator intervention to correct.AWS said it had disabled the DynamoDB DNS planner and DNS enactor automation worldwide while it fixes the conditions that led to the outage and adds extra protections.The issue also caused outages for other AWS tools as a result.Platforms including Signal, Snapchat, Roblox, Duolingo, as well as services such as banking sites and the Ring doorbell company were some of the 2,000 companies affected by the outage, according to Downdetector – a site that monitors internet outages – with more than 8.1m reports of problems from users across the world.While services were restored in a matter of hours, the impact of the outage was felt widely.Customers ofEight Sleep– a smart bed company that connects to the internet to control the temperature and incline of a person’s bed – found they were unable to adjust the bed or the temperature of the bed during the outage because they were unable to connect to the bed in their phone app.The company’s chief executive, Matteo Franceschetti, apologised tocustomers on Xand this week rolled out an update to its services that would allow users to control the bed’s critical functions via Bluetooth in the event of an outage.Dr Suelette Dreyfus, a computing and information systems lecturer at the University of Melbourne, said the outages showed how dependent the world was on single points of failure on the internet.“That single point isn’t just AWS – they’re the biggest cloud provider with 30% or so of the market – but rather the cloud as a whole, which is basically just three companies,” she said.“The internet was designed to be resilient; many other channels existed for routing around problems or attacks, but we’ve lost some of that resilience by becoming so dependent on a handful of giant tech companies to provide not just data storage but also house data services.”Explore more on these topicsAmazonInternetCloud computingnewsShareReuse this content"

She said she planned to “hide away” for the rest of the day.Heather Humphreys, 62, a former cabinet minister who is running for the ruling centre-right party Fine Gael, voted in Newbliss, in the border county of Monaghan, and was accompanied by her one-year-old granddaughter. “Job done. Thank you to my little granddaughter Charlotte for the help,” she said.View image in fullscreenThe Fine Gael candidate, Heather Humphreys, took her granddaughter along to the polling station.Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA MediaAn opinion poll on Thursday gave Connolly 40% compared with 25% for her opponent. When the figures were adjusted for those who were undecided or planned to spoil their vote, Connolly had 55% and Humphreys 35%.Two polls earlier this week also gave Connolly a wide lead in the race to succeed Michael D Higgins, who has served two seven-year terms, and become Ireland’s 10th president.Almost half of voters say theydo not feel representedby either candidate, raising concerns about a low turnout and high rate of spoilt ballots.“I’ll be spoiling my vote,” said Karen, 35, who declined to give a surname, outside a polling station in Dún Laoghaire, south Dublin. “I’ve never done that before but I’m not excited about either candidate. I wanted more candidates on the ballot. I’m disheartened.”Muireann Ní Dhrisceoil, 23, voted for Connolly. “The fact she can speak Irish is important. And that she’s pro-Palestinian. I feel that she’s aligned with my values.”However her father, Micheál, 68, voted for Humphreys. “Humphreys is a very limp candidate but Connolly is populist and I don’t like her demeanour. It will cause friction with the government.”Catherine Connolly: the outspoken leftwinger set to be Ireland’s next presidentRead moreThe presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but victory for Connolly, a member of parliament from Galway, would be a humbling rebuke to the centre-right government. It would also mark a triumph for an alliance of opposition leftwing parties –Sinn Féin, Labour, the Social Democrats, People Before Profit and the Greens – who forged a rare unity to jointly campaign for Connolly.The former clinical psychologist and barrister, until recently a marginal political figure, enthused young people through podcasts and posts that went viral on social media. Artists and musicians such as Kneecap and the Mary Wallopers have endorsed her.Connolly espouses equality and wishes to ringfence Irish neutrality from what she calls western “militarism”. She has compared Germany’s arms spendingto the Nazi eraand accused the UK and US of enabling genocide in Gaza. Critics depict her as a radical who could damage Ireland’s relations with European allies.Irish presidents traditionally played quiet, symbolic roles but since 1990Mary Robinson, Mary McAleese and Higgins have turned the office into a more visible platform to champion plurality, reconciliation with Northern Ireland and ethical foreign policy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Geldof said that if nominated he would have “walked it” and been a “really good” president.Fianna Fáil fielded a political novice, Jim Gavin, who withdrew after a financial scandalimploded his campaign. The late withdrawal means his name remains on the ballot.Fine Gael’s original candidate, Mairead McGuinness, dropped out, citing health problems, so the party turned to Humphreys, 62, a border county Presbyterian deemed to have mainstream appeal. However, she performed badly in debates and was tainted by association with the government, which is blamed for a housing shortage and cost of living crisis.Counting of votes will begin at 9am on Saturday and the result is expected in the afternoon.

It drives your car like a sports car. If you are running late, this is the mode for you.”The NHTSA said earlier this month that FSD – an assistance system that requires drivers to pay attention and intervene if needed – has “induced vehicle behavior that violated traffic safety laws”.The agency said it had six reports in which a Tesla vehicle, operating with full self-driving engaged, “approached an intersection with a red traffic signal, continued to travel into the intersection against the red light and was subsequently involved in a crash with other motor vehicles”.Tesla says FSD “will drive you almost anywhere with your active supervision, requiring minimal intervention” but does not make the car self-driving.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Musk emphasized these efforts after a third-quarter report that sawrecord vehicle sales but a 37% drop in profits.Tesla’s full self-driving, which is more advanced than its autopilot system, has been under investigation by the NHTSA for a year. In October 2024, the NHTSAopenedan investigation into 2.4m Tesla vehicles with FSD after four collisions in conditions of reduced roadway visibility. The Washington Post had previously reported the agency’s interest in the Mad Max mode.The NHTSA investigation is one component of wider friction between Musk and the Trump administration, where the tech billionaire used to play a central role. Musk’s ire is often directed towards heads of the agencies tasked with regulating his companies. Most recently,Musk criticized Sean Duffy, Trump’s transportation secretary and acting Nasa administrator, as knowing “absolutely ZERO about rockets & spacecraft”.Musk’s comments came on the heels of Duffy announcing that Musk’s rocket company,Space X, had “fallen behind”, and that Nasa was opening up contracts for its crewed lunar Artemis program.Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskRoad safetyMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

Tirzepatide, more commonly known under its brand name Mounjaro, is available on the the NHS for weight loss for patients who fulfil a certain criteria of comorbidities.The site, on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Northampton, is believed to have been used for the large-scale manufacture, packaging and distribution of unlicensed – and potentially deadly – weight-loss products to customers.The street value of the finished products is estimated to be more than £250,000. The search operation lasted two days, with the MHRA saying it was the latest in its ongoing work to tackle the illegal trade in weight-loss medicines.Wes Streeting, the health secretary, said the raid was a “victory in the fight against the shameless criminals who are putting lives at risk by peddling dangerous and illegal weight-loss jabs to make a quick buck”.He added: “These unregulated products, made with no regard for safety or quality, posed a major risk to unwitting customers.“My message is clear: don’t buy weight-loss medications from unregulated sources. Talk to your GP, seek NHS advice, and don’t line the pockets of criminals who don’t care about your health. Safe, appropriate, licensed obesity drugs can greatly benefit those in need if taken under medical supervision, and I urge people to only purchase and use them with the approval and oversight of medics and pharmacists.”The MHRA has previously cautioned against buying illegal weight-loss medicines without a prescription through beauty salons, fake pharmacy websites or on social media, saying these products could contain “toxins and other ingredients that could cause real harm”.Andy Morling, the head of the MHRA’s criminal enforcement unit, said: “This seizure shows the lengths these criminals will go to for profit. People should be extremely cautious when buying medicines online. Prescription medicines should only be obtained from a registered pharmacy against a prescription issued by a healthcare professional.“Taking prescription medicines sourced in any other way carries serious risks to your health – there are no guarantees about what they contain, and some may even be contaminated with toxic substances.“This is an illicit global market that endangers patients, puts big money in the pockets of organised criminals, and undermines legitimate healthcare. This operation demonstrates, once again, that my officers will stop at nothing to identify, disrupt, and dismantle the organised criminal networks who put profit before safety.”Explore more on these topicsDrugs tradenewsShareReuse this content"

It can be hard to even realise that models are subtly, or not-so-subtly, reinforcing their existing beliefs, assumptions, and decisions.”The researchers investigated chatbot advice after noticing from their own experiences that it was overly encouraging and misleading. The problem, they discovered, “was even more widespread than expected”.They ran tests on 11 chatbots including recent versions of OpenAI’sChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama and DeepSeek. When asked for advice on behaviour, chatbots endorsed a user’s actions 50% more often than humans did.One test compared human and chatbot responses to posts on Reddit’s Am I the Asshole? thread, where people ask the community to judge their behaviour.The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’Read moreVoters regularly took a dimmer view of social transgressions than the chatbots. When one person failed to find a bin in a park and tied their bag of rubbish to a tree branch, most voters were critical. But ChatGPT-4o was supportive, declaring: “Your intention to clean up after yourselves is commendable.”Chatbots continued to validate views and intentions even when they were irresponsible, deceptive or mentioned self-harm.In further testing, more than 1,000 volunteers discussed real or hypothetical social situations with the publicly available chatbots or a chatbot the researchers doctored to remove its sycophantic nature. Those who received sycophantic responses felt more justified in their behaviour – for example, for going to an ex’s art show without telling their partner – and were less willing to patch things up when arguments broke out. Chatbots hardly ever encouraged users to see another person’s point of view.The flattery had a lasting impact. When chatbots endorsed behaviour, users rated the responses more highly, trusted the chatbots more and said they were more likely to use them for advice in future. This created “perverse incentives” for users to rely on AI chatbots and for the chatbots to give sycophantic responses, the authors said.

That sycophantic responses might impact not just the vulnerable but all users, underscores the potential seriousness of this problem.“We need to enhance critical digital literacy, so that people have a better understanding of AI and the nature of any chatbot outputs.

However, the lack of standards means that disabled drivers have often been unable to trust that they can use them.Obstacles such as raised kerbs or gravelled areas often make charger points inaccessible, while touchscreens can be too high on posts or angled away when using a wheelchair. Another issue for some disabled drivers is the weight of charging cables.On Wednesday, the House of Lords passed an amendment to the government’s planning and infrastructure bill that would give the power to enforce accessibility standards on public chargers.Lady Grey-Thompson, who won 11 gold medals across five Paralympics, now serves as a crossbench peer in the Lords. She regularly raises awareness over failures in accessible transport provision, including last year when she wasforced to crawl off a trainbecause there was no help.She said she had felt unable to use electric cars, adding: “Disabled people have been completely forgotten about. I’ve tried to change to an electric car a couple of times. It has been really hard going.“They [the government] just forget about us, because there’s not that many disabled people in positions of power.”The Guardian view on hybrid cars: profitable for carmakers but not very green | EditorialRead moreVicky Edmonds, the chief executive of EVA England, said: “We’re currently risking millions of drivers being locked out of the transition to electric vehicles. Nearly half of EV drivers are struggling with accessibility of public charging and the number of public charge points continues to increase, by a quarter year on year last year.“The government urgently needs to publish its revised accessibility standard and to take enabling powers to allow it to mandate that standard. Only then can we be certain that industry are genuinely incentivised to deliver accessible charging for all drivers.”The UK has up to 1.35 million disabled drivers, 390,000 of whom are unlikely to have home-based EV charging, according to research commissioned by the Motability Foundation, the charity behind the scheme to subsidise vehicles for disabled people.Cuts to the scheme are under considerationby the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.Only 2.3% of chargers match criteria set by the British Standards Institution. Efforts to make its standard, known as PAS 1899, more achievable have stalled.Jamie Borwick, the Conservative peer who tabled the amendment, said installations of unsuitable chargers now would have effects for years and leave disabled drivers with few options whennew petrol and diesel vehicles were withdrawn from sale after 2035.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Drawing on his experience as aformer boss of London taxi-maker Manganese Bronze, Lord Borwick added: “You’ve got to design for disability from the very beginning.”Nigel Fletcher, the chief executive of the Motability Foundation, said charging standards should be come mandatory. He added: “It is vital that all providers of public EV charging are taking responsibility for ensuring that their infrastructure is accessible.”Vicky Read, the chief executive of the lobby group ChargeUK, said: “No drivers should be left behind in the transition to electric vehicles and this includes drivers with accessibility needs.“Charge-point operators are already working with local authorities, private landlords and charging equipment manufacturers to ensure the charging needs of disabled drivers are met when developing sites but often face practical challenges in doing so.”A Department forTransportspokesperson said: “We are fully committed to ensuring disabled drivers can easily charge their electric cars, which is why we commissioned a review into accessibility standards for charge points.“The review has now concluded, and its findings will be published shortly.

Their daughter Isabella remembers a devoted parent and a brilliant film-makerGeoffrey MacnabFri 24 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 04.42 EDTShareIn June 1977, Roberto Rossellini died suddenly of a heart attack, home in Rome, less than a week after serving as jury president of the Cannes film festival. The director’s daughter Isabella – the fourth of his seven children – was then in her mid 20s. She remembers her mother, Ingrid Bergman, saying: “Dad left us quickly, just as quickly as he drove his Ferrari.”The story of Roberto’s last two decades is told in Living Without a Script, a new archive-based documentary, which premieres this week in Rome. While the film serves as a reminder of its subject’s status as one of the greats of world cinema – the key figure in postwar Italian neorealism – it also shows his life beyond movies.In the film, the director seems perpetually on the move: racing cars, studying biology and physics, and experimenting with TV – a medium that he embraced (unlike most of his contemporaries).View image in fullscreenIngrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini sightseeing in Stromboli in 1953.Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveIsabella is speaking to me on a video call from her farm in Long Island, NY, with her golden retriever, Rosie, making the occasional appearance on screen. In person – as in the press, on the podium, or on social media – Isabella is warm, open and unguarded. Such candour feels all the more surprising given the harrowing intrusions into their personal lives that her family have endured – and the new film underlines.“When my parents got together, they were married to other people and so that created a very big scandal,” says Isabella, on a video call from Long Island, New York. “My mum was a Hollywood star but not an American citizen, and she was not allowed back to America.” This statement is matter-of-fact, as if Bergman’s horrendous shaming and exile were simply a visa hiccup. In fact, Isabella’s parents’ relationship was a major tabloid event of the mid-20th century. They first met after she wrote to him in 1948, praising his film Open City and asking if he might consider working with her, citing her linguistic skills in an attempt to persuade him. “If you need a Swedish actress who speaks English very well,” she wrote, “who has not forgotten her German, who is not very understandable in French, and who in Italian knows onlyti amo, I am ready to come and make a film with you.”Both married (with children) at the time, he to a costume designer and she to a neurosurgeon, they began an affair on the set of Stromboli terra di Dio (1950) and she fell pregnant with their first child, Robin.While extramarital relationships were perceived as fairly de rigueur for male European directors approaching 50, they were considered beyond the pale for a female star whose impeccable public image was cast in Casablanca in 1942, and Joan of Arc (1948). “I’m just a woman, another human being,” said Bergman of the outcry, which saw her shunned by studios and even trashed in the US senate, when the Colorado senator Edwin C Johnson took to the floor and proposed a bill where movies would be licensed based on the perceived morality of their stars.Bergman “had perpetrated an assault upon the institution of marriage”, said Johnson in an emotional address. He added that Bergman – who had formerly been his favourite actor – was a “vile free-love cultist” and “a powerful influence for evil”. Bergman remained in Europe for much of the next decade, giving birth to Isabella and her twin sister, Isotta, in 1952, while being barred from seeing her first child, Pia, after an unpleasant custody battle with her former husband, Petter Lindström.The film picks up the story around this time. We see home movie footage of the toddler girls playing at home, as their father struggles with his own legacy and career in the wake of the scandal.View image in fullscreenIsabella Rossellini at the Golden Globe Awards this year.Photograph: Matt Winkelmeyer/WireImage“I want to leave and never come back,” he said at the time. “Cinema as it is now no longer interests me.” The critics, once so rapturous, had soured on his work. Many of the movies he and Bergman made together were either excoriated or ignored.In 1956, he went on a solo trip to India, from where he wrote colourful letters to his daughters. “I met a gentleman known as the Dalai Lama,” he wrote in one. “I also became friends with another gentleman. He is called Nehru. He is in charge here. We flew in his airplane and we passed over forests where wild elephants and tigers live.”View image in fullscreenSonali Dasgupta congratulates Roberto Rossellini after his Golden Lion award for General Della Rovere at the 20th Venice film festival.Photograph: Keystone Press/AlamyHe and Bergman separated in 1957, after Roberto, then 51, had an affair with the 27-year-old screenwriter Sonali Dasgupta, with whom he had a daughter. He also adopted her young son. Roberto was asked to leave India by Nehru – who had initially invited him.Isabella scotches any idea that her father was absent or neglectful during her childhood. In the summer holidays, he would rent a house on the Amalfi Coast, where everyone would converge, and despite ongoing animus from audiences and the press, the various children all got along. “I never really felt the difference between a full brother and a half-brother. When we had to resume school, we would all go back to the houses where the mothers were but, in the holidays, we were all together.”Domestic arrangements, however, sounded complex, with Bergman and Roberto’s three children – then aged eight and six – living in their own apartment with a babysitter and a housekeeper, and visits from each parent. “Mama would come and sleep with us,” says Isabella, “but would also go back to Paris where she was remarried. Father lived nearby with his new wife.”Nonetheless, Isabella stresses the “constant presence” of her father, whose fame was a surprise to his child. “At the beginning, when I was little,” she says, “I thought everybody was famous just by virtue of being a parent. Then I realised that my parents were recognised by people they didn’t know, while my friends’ parents were not recognised. It was a gradual understanding.”Likewise her appreciation of their work in cinema. Affected by his disillusion with the film business, and struggling to source copies, she didn’t see any of her father’s films until she was 16, when she snuck off to a Roberto retrospective in Rome. “I went every afternoon to see my father’s films but I didn’t tell him. Father was always complaining about festivals, interviews, promoting films and red carpets – that kind of circus. He felt annoyed with fans and all that. So when I went to see his films, I did it secretly.”When she finally told him, “I remember his face crumbling and the tears in his eyes. He was actually very moved.” Since then, she’s steeped herself in his work, and is particularly fond of Journey toItaly, with Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders as a bickering English couple on holiday.“It was a modern and more complicated way to show a married couple with this cruelty that isn’t overt,” she says. “One of the most moving scenes for me is when my mother goes to Pompeii like a tourist, but then, when she sees the ancient couple buried in the volcano ashes she bursts into tears because she sees love and she sees death.”View image in fullscreenRoberto directing The Flowers of St Francis (1950).Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveIsabella remembers how the film was disapproved of on its release in 1955 (the New York Times didn’t bother to review it.). Through their brief marriage, Roberto was sceptical when Bergman received overtures of work from other directors, and largely dissuaded her from working with anyone but him. She later wrote that she never forgave him for this, but Isabella defends her father, saying his advice was motivated by a desire to protect. “He didn’t want to deal again with America,” she says. “Also, they were afraid. There was McCarthyism; they had death threats.” Plus, “they had three children and five films. So they were quite busy.”When Roberto left for India, Bergman took the leading role in Anastasia (1957), which was shot in London and acted as a gateway movie for her return to the US – especially when it won her an Oscar. “I think to a certain extent, father was hurt,” says Isabella. “Of course, he recognised mother’s talent but, to a certain extent, her going back to Hollywood was saying: I made a mistake, I don’t want to deal with Roberto.”The new documentary has been meticulously researched, uncovering reams of unpublished letters by Bergman and Roberto. We learn how late in his life Roberto embraced the student rebellions of the late 1960s, and also of his friendship with François Truffaut and mentorship of David Lynch at the film school in Rome where he taught.Isabella’s career is enjoying a renaissance, too: with an Oscar nomination for her role in Edward Berger’s Conclave earlier this year, and a high-profile role opposite Joan Collins in a forthcoming Wallis Simpson biopic. She has also directed short films, including Green Porno, about the sex lives of insects, and she’s currently planning “a new series of my film on domestic animals. But, like every director, I am always looking for funds, begging for money.”View image in fullscreenIngrid Bergman in Stromboli.Photograph: Ronald GrantMeanwhile, she’s happy on her farm, surrounded by assorted rescue animals, and training guide dogs – informed by a postgraduate degree in ethology. That interest was itself inspired by Konrad Lorenz’s 1949 book, King Solomon’s Ring, about humans communicating with animals.Her father gave her this book. “I remember saying this is what I would do when I grew up,” she says. “He knew it was my passion.” Her going into the family business instead was simply a consequence of there being no ethology courses in Italy when she left school.It wasn’t until her late 50s, when her screen career seemed to be faltering, that she returned to ethology. “I felt very marginalised,” she says. “And then my father came to mind, and his advice: ‘If you follow your curiosity, you always find joy.’” She smiles, and says it’s the best advice she ever received.Living Without a Script premieres at the Rome film festival on 23 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmIsabella RosselliniItalyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its final play is a powerful protest against being forced to leave its homeMiranda BryantNordic correspondentFri 24 Oct 2025 09.34 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 15.14 EDTShareSomething is rotten in Swedish theatre. In front of Elverket – a former power station that for much of the last 30 years has been at the centre of Stockholm’s experimental dramatic output – posters proclaim that theatre is dead. Inside the former turbine hall, either side of a red chandelier-lit platform surrounded by contorted bodies,Hamletand Ophelia, brilliantly played by Gustav Lindh and Gizem Erdogan, are furiously channelling the rage of a generation, loudly hitting the walls with bars. In the play’s final seconds, gravediggers give way to builders dressed in high-vis come in to cover the stage in tarpaulin and start work.This adaptation of Shakespeare’s tragedy, not so cryptically subtitled The Death of Theatre, is the venue’s last ever theatre production before it is shut down. Dramaten, the royal dramatic theatre that functions as Sweden’s national stage, has been forced to let go of the venue, which over three decades became a well-funded home for risk-taking performances and new writing. Among its greatest hits were Personkrets 3:1, a six and a half hour long play written and directed by the late Lars Norén about homelessness, drug addiction and mental illness; the Swedish premiere ofSarah Kane’s Cleansed; and Tusen år hos Gud (A thousand years with God), a sprawling dance-theatre-opera based on the writing of Stig Dagerman. In 2006, I saw a young Noomi Rapace star in Kane’s brutally violent play Blasted here.View image in fullscreenChannelling the rage of a generation … Gustav Lindh as Hamlet at Dramaten theatre, Stockholm.Photograph: Ola KjelbyeBut now government funding freezes have resulted in a real terms decrease of about 50m SEK per year since 2017 for Dramaten, which is fully owned by the state. The situation worsened in 2023, when a three-year funding freeze meant they were forced to make redundancies and cut productions. At its height, Elverket was putting on up to 10 productions a year. Now Dramaten cannot afford to pay Elverket’s rent, let alone to put on two to three productions there a year.What form Elverket’s next evolution will take is not yet known. But given the high rent and the real-estate potential of this vast black-box space in the desirable area of Östermalm, its days as a theatre are almost certainly over once Hamlet closes in December. “Cultural twilight is under way,” wrote critic Jacob Lundström in Dagens Nyheter. “A couple of blocks away, the historic Park cinema is about to become a gym. What will happen to Elverket is unclear. Maybe it will become a Five Guys?”AcrossEurope, a combination of funding cuts, culture wars and rising rents is picking off cultural spaces. Stockholm, a city long accustomed to a rich offering of theatre, music and film is watching its cultural fabric fray at the edges. Dance museum Dansmuseet closed its centrally located venue for financial reasons after 72 years in January; the former theatre Maxim reopened last year as a broader cultural venue after it was forced to close for nearly two years after a rent increase; Stockholm’s oldest remaining cinema, Zita, was driven to launching a fundraising campaign after coming under financial strain.While arts cuts started under the leadership of the Social Democrats, before the current centre-right governmentassumed power in 2022with the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats, the last two years have seen increased financial pressure on cultural institutions. The current government has also been accused of implementing a “nationalist education project” in the form of amuch criticised “cultural canon”that was unveiled in September.The Swedish culture minister, Parisa Liljestrand, tells me the government’s culture budget has increased every year since coming into power and that the budget proposal currently on the table includes an additional 300m SEK to the cultural sector. But, she adds: “Which stages or venues that Dramaten uses is determined by the operation itself, it is not regulated by the government.”Actor Erdogan, who has starred in the TV series Caliphate, police drama Thin Blue Line and The Playlist, says to make theatre in 2025 more than ever feels like a “force of resistance”.“It is here and now, it is here in the room, we experience it together. Our heartbeats almost sync, like it can be at the cinema as well,” she says. “I am worried that if you take away these rooms it will leave a big empty room which is vital for us humans to experience these things together.”As well as offering huge flexibility in terms of seating and staging, Elverket’s space also lends itself to encounters between people before and after productions. After the show, a group of young women approach Erdogan for a chat.View image in fullscreen‘Resistance’ … Gizem Erdogan as Ophelia in Hamlet at Dramaten theatre, Stockholm.Photograph: Ola KjelbyeOn stage, the mood is charged, says Lindh, who played Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment at Dramaten in 2022. “There is an anti-war message, there is a cry for help for the state of the world in our production.”The background of war, emphasised by the fact that Laertes goes off to fight rather than to study in Paris, resonates strongly in a modern European context – particularly inSweden. Politicians here have spent much of the last two years warning of the need to prepare for a possible military conflict.There’s also contemporary currency in the re-framing of Ophelia, who has significantly more words than in the original (Mattias Andersson, the play’s director and Dramaten’s artistic director, redistributed some of Hamlet’s soliloquies in his adaptation). Sharing the spotlight, Hamlet and Ophelia channel the energy and frustration of an entire generation of young Swedes faced with huge structural challenges. One particularly prominent member of that generation, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, that same evening addressed addressed supporters in nearby Sergels Torg after beingdetained by the Israeli military.In his office at Dramaten’s main theatre, Andersson says that Hamlet has resonated with him since he was a teenager. It captures the youthful sense, he says, of feeling “everything is rotten and fake and feeling that one should react, do something.” After seeing a version he didn’t like at a festival a couple of years ago, he started playing around with different Swedish translations and wondered where a modern version would feel most at home.“I started to think a lot about places in urban areas where there is room for discussion of existence, discussion of humankind’s eternal questions through art and theatre,” he says. When they are being erased as they are in so many European cities now, he wondered,will they be missed, and by whom? Is theatre as important to society as Andersson and his colleagues believe it to be? Which brought him to Hamlet as a play that “comes forward from primal depths to be performed for the last time”.The answer his production gives, in its own meta way, is not encouraging. In Shakespeare’s original, Hamlet puts on a play-within-play called The Murder of Gonzago, in order to confirm Claudius’s guilt by watching his reaction to a reenactment of his father’s murder. In Andersson’s version, the play is about injustice, power games, and genocide, but Claudius and Gertrude’s reaction to his diatribe is one of indifference.There is still hope, Andersson says. The play’s subtitle, he clarifies, is a provocation rather than a statement. “I don’t believe in theatres’ death in that way,” he says. In today’s world, in fact, live experiences have even more power to make an impression, which makes him feel hopeful for theatre’s future. “The human contact, analogue meeting, that is so enormously unique when we all are pulled into our screens.”Hamlet is showing at Dramaten, Stockholm, until 14 DecemberExplore more on these topicsStageSwedenEuropeArts fundingWilliam ShakespeareHamletnewsShareReuse this content"

From that hook, Kathryn Bigelow has fashioned an almost unbearably tense thriller out of the American response. As government agencies and armed forces kick into “defcon” mode, the subsequent 15 minutes or so are seen several times from multiple points of view – a missile defence battalion in Alaska, White House politicians and advisers (including Rebecca Ferguson), the military high command, the president himself (Idris Elba).

And what he did wasBallad of a Small Player, which feels like the exact opposite of Conclave. A sweaty, vibrant, Macau-set fever dream of a thriller, it sees Colin Farrell hamming it up beyond all comprehension as an aristocratic English gambler scrambling to pay off his debts while trying to shake off Tilda Swinton, playing a woman who knows his true identity. While the results aren’t quite as satisfying as Conclave, it’s nevertheless very exciting to see a director as elegant as Berger turn his hand to something so trashy.Stuart HeritageWednesday 29 October, NetflixPsycho TherapyView image in fullscreenA hidden gem … Steve Buscemi in Psycho Therapy: The Shallow Tale of a Writer Who Decided to Write About a Serial Killer.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyOr to use its mouthful of a full title, Psycho Therapy: The Shallow Tale of a Writer Who Decided to Write About a Serial Killer. Turkish director Tolga Karaçelik’s English language debut is a black comedy that is absurdly twisty. John Magaro plays a novelist struggling to write a tale about a serial killer. He is then befriended by a real-life serial killer (played bySteve Buscemi) who is mistaken for a marriage counsellor by his wife (Severance’s Britt Lower).

The found footage comes in the form of a Halloween episode of a 1977 talkshow that flies off the rails after an appearance by a 13-year-old possessed girl.

The result is a masterful new album – made with a little help from Lorde and Zadie SmithByTim BurrowsFri 24 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 09.50 EDTShareDevonté Hynes is telling me how he came to be living back in his childhood home in Ilford, east London, at the age of 37, after his mother had fallen ill. “It was a surreal experience,” he says of the sudden move from Brooklyn, where he makes music as Blood Orange, to sleeping in the bedroom where he once put up posters of David Beckham and the Smashing Pumpkins. “Physically, you’re bigger: your shape has changed. But the space is the same. The memories are the same.”Hynes came back to England to be by the bedside of his mother in hospital, and stayed at home a while after she died in 2023. This tragic disruption produced his fifth full-length release,Essex Honey, a clear contender for album of the year. It’s a record grounded by grief but fizzing with the memory flashes that came with returning home to the edge of Essex; the record that sounds most like the place he left almost two decades ago.Hynes started out in the 2000s making dance-punk with Test Icicles and indie-pop as Lightspeed Champion, and then settled into poignant, groove-led R&B as Blood Orange, and was sought as a songwriter by Solange, Mariah Carey, Carly Rae Jepsen and more. Fields, a classical collaboration with Third Coast Percussion, was Grammy-nominated in 2021. But Essex Honey exists at a slight remove to everything that came before it: it is full of wide, ambient vistas that segue from mournful to sublime like an estuary sky, as the lyrics contemplate death, youth and the restorative effects of the English countryside.Hynes is talking to me from New York, a rare moment at home before he embarks on a tour weaving together headline solo dates with support slots in arenas for Lorde, who appears on the album. “There is a lot of work to do after the passing of someone … a lot of logistical work that has to happen,” he says of the days and weeks after his mother’s death. “I was very aware that I had to kind of just function in this period. And so I was. But, you know, in the back of my mind, I kept thinking, like, I feel like this is gonnabite meat some point in the future.”He had been scheduled to tour his classical compositions in 2023, including at Sydney Opera House. “I wanted to keep going. And then I was like … I couldn’t picture doing it. I spoke to my sister about it. Sometimes you just need the blessing of someone to be like, no, it’s OK. You don’t have to do it.” He took time off to grieve instead, eventually renting a place in Paris. He hadn’t planned to make a record about his mother’s death, but he found himself working on tracks just to process things.The most directly autobiographical is The Last of England. It starts with a snatch of a recording of a conversation at the dinner table his sister had with his mother during Christmas 2022. “I think we were talking about the Beatles, and my nephew is in the background running and screaming,” he says. “But its importance is it became the last Christmas we all had together, and the last time I saw my mother not in hospital.” The song goes on to describe the horrific mundanity of being in a hospital room after your mother has died. “Nothing more to do but leave / Following the corners of the room / A knitted heart, they gave to me / I wash my hands and stare into the drain,” he sings.View image in fullscreenDev Hynes and Solange Knowles in Los Angeles in 2012.Photograph: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic“I was interested in being extremely literal and having no real metaphors, musically and lyrically,” says Hynes. A member of hospital staff gave him a knitted heart after his mother died. “I really love [my work to be] to the point. There’s such a crazy beauty in that.”Iwas keen to speak to Hynes about Essex Honey after hesaid in an interviewhow my bookThe Invention of Essex: The Making of an English Countyhad helped him look again at the place he grew up. To me, Essex represents social and political revolutions in the country at large, from the Windrush docking at Tilbury to the rise of Thatcherism among the upwardly mobile working class. I wrote the book in an attempt to tell this story behind my home county, how it became a place apart in the British unconscious after industrialisation, socialism and war led to a mass movement of people from the East End of London starting afresh there. Hynes and his family were part of a later wave of that movement.He was born in Leytonstone, east London, in 1985, before his parents, Wendela and Louis, moved the family east to Ilford, a town that’s technically part of Greater London but Hynes still considers Essex, as it was before the capital’s city boundary expanded outwards in the 1960s. Wendela was a nurse and then eventually became a health visitor around Dagenham, “coming back with these horror stories of teenage pregnancies and young addiction and abusive partners, or elderly people who were somewhat unattended and not looked after”. Louis did various odd jobs, initially engineering work before he was in charge of looking after maintenance at the Marks & Spencer in Ilford town centre. Hynes had his first job there too, as a cleaner – he calls it his version of nepotism.Ilford, he says, was an estranging, “enclosed” place to grow up, partly due to the fact that it had no underground transport links (upon his return to the UK, Hynes was so amazed to find Ilford connected to central London by the new Elizabeth line that he included a lyric about it on The Last of England).Music came into his life via piano lessons with a teacher who tapped the keys with her pen if he played a wrong note. At nine he started the cello (he plays it on Essex Honey) and joined the school orchestra. It was a private kind of solace, practising in his bedroom as an escape; guitar came later. Essex Honey channels this insularity, alluding to other formative cultural influences:The Fieldsamples the gorgeous guitar of the Durutti Column’s Vini Reilly; while Westerberg incorporates a cover of the chorus of a Replacements song; and the piano-led closing bars of Mind Loaded are like a half-remembered hardcore melody that calls back to his sister’s love of Ministry of Sound raves. Part of the opening track, Look at You, hat-tips to British Channel 4 sitcomDesmond’s: “The actor who portrayed Desmond [Norman Beaton] is from Guyana where my mum is from, so I always felt a special connection,” says Hynes.My background felt different and not just based on being ‘first generation’. I felt I was from a different placeHynes left home as soon as he could, plunging into London’s hectic 00s music scene, but he felt a stark class difference between him and his new west London friends. “My background felt different and not just based on cultural differences or being ‘first generation’ or anything. I actually felt that I was from a different place,” he says, meaning blue-collar Ilford, not the media-class backgrounds of others on the scene. “Even the friends I had who lived in Forest Gate or Bethnal Green, even that part of east London, which is still so close, felt separate.”Test Icicles, a three-piece he formed aged 18 in east London, were jokily named for what they thought would be a short-lived thing (they were originally called Balls), and their energy outstripped their songwriting prowess. They split up in 2006 before they were due to tour the US, but Hynes kept his visa, moved to New York, and, having named himself Lightspeed Champion, paired country-style acoustic guitar with a baroque sensibility. His real unmasking as a songwriter, however, came when he started Blood Orange at the turn of the 2010s. One of the first songs Hynes wrote for the project wasForget It, a masterclass in soulful minimalism: Young Marble Giants meets D’Angelo. The whole project was more emotionally present, immediate and bold than anything he had done before, and more directly influenced by Black music.View image in fullscreenDev Hynes returning home to Essex.Photograph: Adam PowellHynes had the title for Essex Honey, the fifth Blood Orange album, years before he had any music – “I like the sound and how they connect as words” – and he had unfinished business to reflect on back home on the Essex border. For years, his background kept bleeding into song as he focused on the violence he experienced as a teenager, when he was beaten up so frequently that his mum put him in karate lessons. A song with Skepta,High Street, from the 2013 album Cupid Deluxe, had a lyric about Hynes “Racing down Ilford Lane going home / Thinking about should I try to fake a fall” after he had been jumped. Negro Swan contained Dagenham Dream, with a description of how “broken teeth and bloody nose” led him to “cut a line” in one of his eyebrows to fit in, “to act just like the others to get around”.He learned to skateboard as an alternative to getting the bus because the 387 that took him back home from his school in Chadwell Heath could be so brutal. “[The threat] would just build with all these kids in different schools and it would get so intense. There’d always be some grief or I’d be just, like, fucking terrified.” His only currency was being a great footballer, playing at county level for Essex and for the Dagenham & Redbridge youth team, which meant, although the streets remained dangerous, he wasn’t bullied at school itself. “The football thing did really save me,” he says. He still plays, meeting up every Wednesday in New York for a five-a-side with regulars including the Strokes’ frontman Julian Casablancas (Hynes has always played as an attacking winger, whereas Casablancas is “a bit of a classic number nine”).Another friend, Zadie Smith, his former NYC neighbour, appears on the album singing with strong vibrato on Vivid Light. “She was back in town for some book engagements, and she came over to my apartment to hear what I’d been working on,” he says. “I played her this song, and essentially shoved a mic in her face. She started just ad-libbing around. It’s something we’ve done before, usually hanging at hers, sitting around her piano. So it all felt very natural.”Hynes’s artistic relationship with England on Essex Honey is complex, at a remove but intensely perceptive in a way that reminds me of Smith. He says he lives in a bubble in New York and finds it easy to tune out of Trump 2.0 on the whole, but travelling back to the UK earlier this year with another New York football buddy, the photographer Adam Powell, was another matter. “He’s from Essex – he has the swords [from the Essex flag] tattooed on him as well,” says Hynes. The pair drove around, taking photos, including an amazing shoot inthe marshes of Essex around Rainham. “And I couldn’t believe how many flags there were.” Everywhere they went they saw the England flag flying: a recent craze across the country that has taken on a racist, xenophobic, us-and-them quality. “I had been seeing it [online] and I’d known, but … it was really intense to see. Honestly, it’s pretty scary.”Hynes used to cross the road to avoid the pubs displaying union jacks in Dagenham at a time when the far-right British National Party was on the rise – he knew what it meant – and he is fearful today’s flags are a portent of the UK’s political future. “It’s not looking good,” he says. “It’s looking like Reform are going to fucking do it. I don’t know if people are even fully acknowledging it, but it is terrifying.”But it would be too much to say you can hear grief for a country on Essex Honey. On the contrary, it is as if by making a record about loss he has also provided a blueprint to connect with the place once more. Back in that childhood bedroom, he would gaze at the streets outside and marvel, at how, for better or worse, it had remained how he always knew it. “Looking out my window is the same. That street does not change.”Essex Honey is out now on Domino/RCA. Blood Orange’s UK tour begins on 7 November at Alexandra Palace, LondonThis article was amended on 24 October 2025.

Few songs this year have stronger novelistic flair than Shelly, which witnesses the killing of a deer and spirals into a petrol-laden reckoning – like Olga Tokarczuk’s Drive Your Plow lit with flickers of warped cello. Tense, quiet verses with echoing, plucked guitar segue into grand choruses, Walton’s voice digitally manipulated into something omniscient and sinister.Listeners might already be familiar with Walton as an electronic producer, DJ and contributor to bands such as Caroline. Daughters’ musical twists draw on this varied career. Opener Sometimes bursts with fanfare, like a string band caught by surprise, while Born Again Backwards radically ups the BPM with a punishing, beautiful, looping drum fill. Dense walls of sound, expertly mixed bylongtime collaborator Aya, feel both gnarly and spiritual, and Walton’s morbid, magical thinking peaks on highlight Lambs, which briefly becomes a swirling jig. “May your life never end in death,” she bargains, with heart-aching gallows humour.Explore more on these topicsMusicExperimental musicPop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Her upcoming spiky solo debut, Mean Reds, disrupts that entirely. Supplanting the swaying Latin rhythms of bolero for a free jazz quartet, these eight tracks revel in atonal scrapes, cymbal splashes, keening horns and Singh’s lively vocals. Referencing avant garde pioneer Ornette Coleman’s free form improvisations as much as Joni Mitchell’s emotive lyricism, the result is a rowdy debut that launches Singh as one of the more distinctive new voices in jazz.Singh has previously dipped her toe into the genre by guesting with composer Tomeka Reid on her 2024 live suite of music inspired by Duke Ellington. Her first full foray into improvisation touches on the music of other contemporaries: she channels Diane Reeves’ soft melodics on the opening track River and Do Not Remain, while As Strange As It Is plays more akin to singers such as Cécile McLorin Salvant in its doubling of wonky, modernist horns and vocal melody. It’s when Singh cuts loose that she fully comes into her own. A raucous, tub-thumping energy drives her tunes such as Highway Monster, while Counting plays like a jazz-punk version of a Sesame Street song as Singh shouts “number words are hard it’s true”. She creates playful, unruly music that feels so alive thanks to its chaos, promising future stylistic twists to come.Ammar KaliaThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenSouth African singer Tyla.Photograph: Edwig HensonTyla – ChanelThe best of the singles the South African singer has released since her instant-classic self-titled debut album, Chanel shows how adept she is at turning Afro-house beats into dramatic pop: a rare feat.BBTLeon Thomas – BaccaratBuilding huge success from the old-school stuff of talent and hard touring, the US soul man releases a new EP today and Baccarat is the astounding highlight: outrageous funk-rock with a shuffle to make Tony Allen smile from on high.BBTJpegmafia and Danny Brown – RoachesThis bonus track from the Scaring the Hoes expanded edition is significantly less intense than that hare-brained record; positively feel-good, even, as Brown recalls childhood memories over bubbling, soulful production.LSBarry Walker Jr – Quiessence (ft Rob Smith and Jason Willmon)The Rose City Band’s pedal steel player stretches out and languishes in the pearly sighs of history’s best instrument, creating space for the guitarist and drummer’s light noodlings.LSUS Girls – Running Errands (Yesterday)Meg Remy has put out two versions of her new song Running Errands: the Today version is sumptuously full-band but Yesterday is even better, like a boom-bap hip-hop production.BBTDonna Thompson – MeteorsThe London jazz musician’s self-possessed meditations on love recall KeiyaA and Aja Monet at their most beatific: birdsong, silvery cymbals and light double bass soundtrack her attempts to reassemble her shattered heart.LSOneohtrix Point Never – LifeworldAs well as scoring Oscar-tipped Timothée Chalamet drama Marty Supreme, Daniel Lopatin has a solo album coming up too: its track Lifeworld is a wash of new age wonderment that locks into a subtle groove.BBTSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify.Explore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistJazzPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Accompanied by her son Kuljit on an early Roland synthesiser and drum machine, the pair laid down nine tracks of Punjabi folk vocals backed by hammering electronic percussion, disco basslines and fizzing synth melody.Only 500 copiesof the resulting album, Punjabi Disco, were pressed; it was released to confusion from a diaspora audience used to the bombast of bhangra. In the decades since, rare LPs have appeared on resale sites, but Kuljit’s recent rediscovery of the master tapes has now made the record widely available for the first time.View image in fullscreenMohinder Kaur Bhamra, Punjabi Disco.Photograph: Naya BeatThe blipping electronic toms and rattling shaker of opening number Disco Wich Aa set the tone, gradually building a swaying groove over siren-like synth melody before Mohinder’s falsetto vocal takes over, entreating the listener to come and dance. Employing the melismatic, note-gliding technique of Indian classical singing, her vocals are delightfully versatile, skipping over the fast-paced disco bass of Nainan Da Pyar De Gaya, yearning with drawn-out notes alongside the bossa rhythms of Soniya Mukh Tera and making full-throated declarations on the driving groove of Ve Tu Jaldi Jaldi Aa.Kuljit’s production can feel somewhat clunky, programming relentlessly up-tempo looping drum machine grooves with jolting bursts of synth sound. But the metallic harshness of the instrumentation paired with the warmth of Mohinder’s voice makes for a strangely engaging combination, blending the dancefloor movement with emotive melody. Nowhere is this more apparent than on Pyar Mainu Kar, where synths double a Punjabi folk melody traditionally played on a harmonium over bubbling disco bass, electronic toms that channel the undulation of tabla beats and Mohinder’s soaring vocals. Released a decade before the Asian underground dance music explosion, the charming, unusual Punjabi Disco reveals itself to be a key predecessor.Also out this monthTwo generations of Zulu guitarists,Madala KuneneandSibusile Xaba, release their debut album kwaNTU (New Soil/Mushroom Hour), a beautifully expansive collection of interweaving, finger-picked melody, husky vocalisations from elder Kunene and thrumming hand percussion. The final release fromAmadou and Mariam, after Amadou’s death in April, L’Amour à la Folie (Because Music), is a poignant testament to their musical connection, playing through the signature vocal harmonies of Sonfo and displaying Amadou’s rough-edged bluesy guitar style on Nakan. A career retrospective of Kenyan benga music pioneerJoseph Kamaruis released. Co-curated by his grandson, the sound artist KMRU, Heavy Combination (Disciples) showcases Kamaru’s infectious blend of 70s funk with plaintive group vocals, highlife guitar and driving grooves.

She was raised by her older brothers, John and Barry, who were 10 and eight when it happened, and sometimes by their father, Pat, an alcoholic for many years, violent with it, who struggled to care for his family. Pat and Bridget had moved to London from Ireland, and the Burkes lived on an estate in Islington, where the other families played a vital role in raising and feeding the children. On his deathbed, in 1994, Pat asked Kathy to do two things: to give up smoking, and to write more. It has only taken her 30 years, she says, but she’s finally done the latter.The entertainment industry is top-heavy with people from middle-and upper-class backgrounds who have a limited understanding of lives that don’t resemble their own. In my experience, one of the misconceptions they have about working-class life is that it is all grey skies and kitchen‑sink misery. Burke’s memoir has its painful moments, but the joy radiating from it is palpable and invigorating.As a small child, she remembers hanging around the ice-cream van (“the usual queue of kids forming a multicoloured snake”, she writes, deliciously) near her block of flats. A stranger appears, announces she’s won on the bingo, and offers to buy them ice-creams. “Ooh, ain’t you ugly,” she says to Burke, with breathtaking cruelty. Crushed, she turns her mortification into humour. “I’m the best dancer at the ugly bug ball, though,” she quips, and does a jig to make everyone laugh.Her teenage years in the 70s and 80s involve pinballing around London, giddy on punk and possibilityThe anecdote is telling, and soothing hurt with humour becomes a theme. Burke is sometimes evasive about deeper wounds, alluding to a bad love affair but keeping it out of focus. Stories of kindness come more easily, and as a child, she encounters a lot of it. Her teenage years in the 70s and 80s involve pinballing around London, giddy on punk and possibility. She bumps into Johnny Rotten, panics about what to say to him and then, perfectly, simply shouts at him to “fuck off”. She runs into the Clash, and almost becomes a roadie for them before deciding to take up a place at the legendary Anna Scher theatre school instead. That decision leads to a long career as an actor, writer and director.Burke is probably best known for her funny roles. Her early days of live comedy sound anarchic and gleeful. On stage with the musical duo Raw Sex at Chelsea barracks, their raucous performance earns heckles and jeers. She responds by shouting “Give Ireland back to the Irish!” before they all beat a hasty retreat. During the 1990s, she appears in Absolutely Fabulous and then becomes extremely famous co-starring in Harry Enfield’s sketch shows. Their teenage boy characters, Kevin and Perry (she was Perry, naming him after a friend), even get their own film.But she offers plenty of reminders that she has also been a serious actor, albeit rarely taken as seriously as she deserved. In 1997, she won the best actress award at Cannes for an extraordinary performance in her old mate Gary Oldman’s film Nil By Mouth. Elsewhere, however, a producer expresses his amazement that she is capable of doing an accent other than her own. There is short shrift for Danny Boyle, with whom she worked on a TV miniseries called Mr Wroe’s Virgins; she likens him to “a supercilious priest from my childhood”. (He fares better than her co-star Kerry Fox, whom she calls “a charmless prick”.) In the film Elizabeth, she is a sickly and memorable Mary Tudor. Its director, Shekhar Kapur, suggests that Burke might need extra help, as she is not the type who would usually play a queen. “I didn’t know when we met that you were working class,” he tells her. Burke remembers all of this with a shrug of frustration, but pay attention and you can discern fury bubbling up from the page.Autobiographies are rarely as blunt as they could be, for a variety of reasons. If this represents the toned-down version of Burke’s life, then I can only imagine what it would be like to hear her tell it at full throttle. A Mind of My Own ends abruptly, when she decides she wants to stop acting to focus on directing theatre, announcing her retirement on SMTV Live, the Saturday morning kids’ show hosted by Ant and Dec. I hope she writes about what came next, because whether she’s in the spotlight or not, her stories are vivid, bright and beautiful.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But for Tigest Girma it’s where her seductive ideas about vampires, university drama and Ethiopian mythology percolate.When characters for Girma’s bestselling fantasy books aren’t “doing what I want them to do” she comes down to the water for a break and imagines the scene from their perspective. “The calming water can spark ideas for me sometimes when I’m really stuck,” she says as we begin our late-afternoon stroll.We meet on a temperamental spring day at the Library at the Dock, overlooking the water glistening in the sun. Towards the city skyline, looming grey clouds appear to be picking up pace. “I swear it is about to rain,” Girma says.Her conversational tone is breezy and laid-back. During our walk together along the Victoria Harbour promenade she is not recognised once but the gen Z upstart has achieved something many other authors spend their lives chasing. Before her 27th birthday, she was a New York Times bestselling author.She has spent the day working on the third novel in her trilogy in the lead-up to the release of the sequel, Eternal Ruin, next week. Her first novel, Immortal Dark, debuted at the top of the New York Times bestseller list for young adult hardcover. It tells the story of an orphaned heiress searching for her abducted sister at Uxlay University, alongside vampires of African origin who feed on specific human bloodlines. It’s a fantasy world with east African mythology woven in.There is a lightness to the 27-year-old which seems at odds with the darkness and danger in her books. She laughs easily and smiles widely.View image in fullscreenGirma says reading fantasy fiction as a teenager helped her ‘be more courageous’.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianGirma has ventured to the city from Deer Park, in Melbourne’s west. It’s been home since her family migrated fromEthiopiawhen she was 13 and she found herself thrust into the western world. Beginning high school in Australia was “terrifying” and nothing like the US TV shows and movies – Hannah Montana and iCarly – that she watched in Addis Ababa. There were no American-style proms. No classic “mean girl”.“I had to learn everything,” she says.Hamish Macdonald: ‘The experience of hosting Q+A was totally overwhelming’Read moreGirma never thought of herself as a black girl until she started school in Melbourne. “I will never forget the first day of school when you just walk in and everyone’s turning around and you’re looking instantly for someone that looks like you,” she says. “No one’s there. I was like, ‘Oh, this is gonna be my reality now.’” She was asked questions about her home country like “did you ride a lion to school?” –“I had to always defend my country,” she recalls. “It was an unfair thing to put on a young girl.“They would only think of us a really poor, poverty-ridden country. That was not my reality.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningBeing othered in this way made her feel that being ordinary was not an option for her. It drove her to “perform better”.To try to make sense of her new life, she began devouring novels in her school library. Inside the pages of paranormal romance novels like the Twilight and Vampire Academy series she discovered dramatic plots that felt relatable.“I was like, this is safe, I feel safe here,” she says. “It was a way for me to navigate and be more courageous and braver in the world. I was finding my confidence through those fantasy books.”View image in fullscreenAt first she didn’t notice the absence of black characters in the books she loved.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianAs the wind stirs at our ankles, we reach Marvel Stadium at the end of the promenade. We decide to turn back and find a seat to seek shelter. Girma explains that a longing for her home country has played a role in her creating an entirely black cast for her fantasy trilogy. “I was really seeking that home away from home,” she says.Heather Rose: ‘My ancestors escaped the French Revolution – that really got me, even as a child’Read moreShe gestures at a bench for us to sit under a corridor of pepper trees. I ask about her childhood. She grew up as the middle child with two brothers. When they were playing PlayStation and she couldn’t watch her “silly American” shows, she would read books from the family’s collection. Mostly Ethiopian authors – animal fables that taught morals – and translations of classics including Cinderella.When she began reading fantasy and paranormal romance books later on, Girma didn’t notice the absence of black characters. So much so that when she began penning her own novels as a teenager she wrote white characters, replicating what she knew. “I just could not even conceive of us [in that fantasy world],” she says.In her early 20s Girma began noticing a cultural shift. Audiences appeared to be craving better representation of diversity on screen and in books. The 2018 sci-fi film Black Panther, set in a fictional African country, was a global box-office success. Girma says seeing a black girl on the cover of the young adult fantasy book Children of Blood and Bone by the Nigerian American author Tomi Adeyemi “blew my mind”.“These moments were coming together and I was noticing how much we were missing from the fantasy field,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘I hate the idea of loving a character and saying goodbye to them too quickly, so I wanted to stay with them for as long as I could.’Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The GuardianHer first novel was “whitewashed” but she never sent it to publishers. The second and third – both set in Ethiopia with black characters – were rejected. But she persevered, unable to let go of the thought that she could write black fantasy characters and make “it as great as I can”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe idea for Immortal Dark came in the depths of Melbourne’s lengthy Covid lockdowns. It was April 2021. Girma was rewatching Twilight with her older brother, a fellow fantasy lover.She typed a one-line concept into her phone notes: What if vampires originated in Africa?Days later, she tweeted a teaser – “college dark academia with black vampires”. “I was like – ‘Hey, do you want black vampires?’ And they were like – ‘Yeah, we want.’“I want it to be … where [black people] are desired, wanted, and we get the handsome guy, and we sort of live our best lives.“Now I have it in my fantasy books where it’s a safe place for all black girls.”Inklings of doubt from the former agent rejections lingered. But the reaction to the tweet, which she says attracted about 200 likes, changed her life.Girma envisioned her story as a trilogy – the types of fantasy book series she loved reading. “I hate the idea of loving a character and saying goodbye to them too quickly, so I wanted to stay with them for as long as I could,” she says.She adds: “Sometimes you have to take a complete stab in the dark when no one’s thinking of the idea. Sometimes it really works out and it makes magical things happen.”When she first heard Immortal Dark had reached the bestseller list, she assumed it was a mistake. “I was like, ‘Huh, we did do it.’ Like, we proved something here.“There is a need, and there’s a demand for black fantasy books, and they can do really well and be loved by non-black readers as well,” she says, her hands splaying out to emphasis the point.View image in fullscreen‘Doubt doesn’t care what you have done before,’ Girma says.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The Guardian“It was just like confirming something deep inside of me.”When I ask about overcoming the doubts about creating a series featuring black vampires, she replies: “The doubt never left.”She adds: “I could talk about doubt for like an hour.” She crosses her arms and leans forward.“Especially as a black woman – a black author – that doubt is never going to leave you.”As Girma began writing the third novel in the trilogy, she encountered doubt again “on my shoulder, screaming at me that you can’t do this again. Even though there are records that say I have done this twice. It made me realise doubt doesn’t care what you have done before.”It’s something she’s learned to be comfortable with by finding out it’s OK to fail – to do so quickly, learn from it and not seek external validation.“If you’re always looking outside, it’s never going to be inside of you. You’re not going to be able to manifest it within yourself.”Eternal Ruin by Tigest Girma is out on 28 October through HachetteExplore more on these topicsWalk with ...Australian booksFantasy booksYoung adultRaceFictionMelbournefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Turns out: absolutely notDominik DiamondWhen our family board game night got cancelled, I sampled digital spins on the classics instead. I’m not sure I should have bothered – with one exception …Fri 24 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 08.58 EDTShareIdon’t play video game versions of board games. Why would you? The whole point of video games is to be faster, more visually arresting, and less reliant on other humans than old games played with dice and cards. But a recent family board game night was derailed by clashing schedules and family civil war, so I spent a Saturday night trying them out on the iPhone instead.I started with Uno because that is the old family staple. We still use the Simpsons Uno set we got decades ago. It is simple and comforting, the chicken soup of card games. The iOS version is a different consommé altogether. A three-minute time limit for each round means it is as much about avoiding mistakes as it is about tactics. I like this development, but I miss the family banter (and ruthless switching allegiances) of our real-life family version. It’s not the same spamming a silly face at MoshOnion933. Trust me. I tried.I boot up Yahtzee With Buddies with relish, because Yahtzee is a rare game that I love but the rest of the family don’t. I liked the spins on the original, with multipliers appearing in certain scoring categories. I even liked the extra bells and whistles of different dice and chests to open, until I realised that these are just gateways to the inevitable micro-transactions, which include graphics jumping into your face with an offer to buy an extra roll if you are one six away from a Yahtzee. The final straw was when it started offering me scratch cards, the vilest form of gambling enticement outside the old Fifa packs.View image in fullscreenFever dream … Monopoly Go.Photograph: Scopely/HasbroMonopoly Go is even worse. You just careen around a board with so many beeps and vomited graphics that it makes your head hurt. You land on a space that means you get to attack another player’s landmark with a wrecking ball, but they defend you with what looks like Baby Yoda. This is like fever dream Monopoly: the kind ofMonopolythat you are forced to play by a vile serial killer who has kidnapped you.Selecting the Triple option eats up three rolls of the dice but gives you triple the rewards, just so you run out quicker and can be bombarded by more micro-transaction abuse. It’s no different from a slot machine. You can even set it to auto-play itself, while you passively watch a swirl of garish eye candy like you are trapped inside a 1970s washing machine. You don’t even get the sense you are playing a game. You’re just a mark in a colourful grift where you spend real money to watch fake numbers go up and down. The only people who think this is a game are the same ones who think Mrs Brown’s Boys is a comedy.I expected The Game of Life to be the same. But it was glorious!The old familiar choices burst into life again: Career or university? Married or single? One kid or four? The cost has gone up and now people have to pay you $20k when you get married - we just got a pasta maker – and you only get taxed if you land on a certain square, which means you only pay tax if you are unlucky. Wow! This is what life is like for billionaires! I yearn to feel the spinner from the original game in my hands, the second greatest analogue board game device ever (because nothing beats the Pop-O-Matic, the board game equivalent of bubble wrap.)View image in fullscreenDes res … Game of Life.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn my second game I concentrated on my career rather than having kids and ended up twice as rich! This isn’t so much a game as the most accurately detailed scientific life sim ever created. I only stop playing it because it depresses me how much easier it is to be successful in the game version of life. Also, I am in my 50s, and I should play something with more gravitas.Which brings me to chess: the board game that computers are, famously, best at. I wanted to see if someone could really add to the world’s greatest game in 2025. So I downloaded Zach Gage’s Really Bad Chess.I loved his Pocket Run Pool, which added crazy stunt balls and pockets and whatnot to the dignified pursuit of smacking balls against one another. His version of chess has a deceptively simple conceit: random numbers and starting positions of each piece. This means some games start you with four queens lined up in front of three knights and a pawn, and thus liberates chess from the austere rigidity of standard openings and gambits.It achieves the impossible in giving you a version of chess where you have to thinkmore. On later levels, the AI opponent has the lion’s share of the power pieces, so the difficulty curve is great. You play it with a smile on your face.Maybe it’s the less social board games that computers are better placed to serve us with: the only people who really talk while playing chess are bad guys in movies. Although I suspect there’s a Micro Transaction Chess Go! monstrosity out there somewhere, ready to ruin everything.Explore more on these topicsGamesMonopolyMobile gamesBoard gamesFamilyPuzzle gamescommentShareReuse this content"

This may be October, but there’s already a giant Christmas tree in the middle of the Hampstead theatre stage, which James Cotterill’s stylish design has transformed into the Upper West Side apartment of a non-religious Jewish family gathering for the holidays.Christmas may come earlier every year, but it has taken a while for this one to arrive: this is the UK premiere of Richard Greenberg’s Broadway hit from 12 years ago. It’s 1980, and the “ruthlessly” cheerful Julie is hosting along with her husband Ben, whose hopes for his college-age son Scotty extend all the way to the Presidency. Scotty’s earnest Harvard friend Jeff navigates his way naively around both the apparently endless rooms and the extended clan, which includes an “odd” cousin and a sketchy brother-in-law.View image in fullscreenDaniel Abelson as Ben and David Kennedy as Mort in The Assembled Parties at Hampstead theatre.Photograph: Helen MurrayAnd then there’sTracy-Ann Obermanas Ben’s sister Faye, in a performance so enjoyable that even facing upstage, the back of her glamorously coiffed head beams out charisma. “I love what you’re wearing,” she tells Julie. “Is it your mother’s?” Blanche McIntyre’s direction keeps the finely tuned comic dialogue rattling along in the first half, even as nothing happens and we wonder, along with the characters, exactly what story we’re in, “I’m just a character in a farce,” says Julie; “we’re in a potboiler here!” announces Ben.Really, we’re in the kind of old-fashioned play that Jeff’s mother has always loved, with impossibly “breezy dialogue” and charm. Only when we return after the interval – to the same family apartment, 20 years on – does the dramatic narrative reveal its shape, as Greenberg underscores familial patterns – such as Faye’s relationship with her daughter, and her own mother – with the cyclical nature of political change.Fine acting allows a crackling script to develop true warmth and Alexander Marks doubles brilliantly as the easygoing Scotty and his nervous, feckless younger brother. Sam Marks yearns sweetly for intimacy as Jeff, both the young man silently smoothing his friend’s pillow and the confident lawyer still a little in love with his friend’s mother, while Jennifer Westfeldt’s Julie delivers the second-act moments of heartbreaking tenderness. It’s a Christmas well worth waiting for.AtHampstead theatre, London, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreTracy-Ann ObermanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Jones, who wrote about his travels, made the obligatory trip to see the lava streams but as an artist he was more drawn to quiet, mysterious scenes in Naples and its surrounding landscape. Here he finds himself alone sheltering from the afternoon heat in the shady entrance to an ancient Roman tunnel that connected Naples with the seaside town Pozzuoli to its north. Jones finds a powerful fascination in the deserted silence of the place, the dark mouth of the sinister underground passage, the uneasy beauty of the hollow.The National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Young Nick from the biology department was a college middleweight champion. One of the (possibly unreliable) anecdotes with which underachieving history don George and wife, Martha, entertain their guests involves the couple once almost slugging it out during bouts run by her college president father. Only Nick’s wife, Honey, is temperamentally noncombative.This pugilism is fitting because Albee’s vast, verbally violent play dates from the period in the middle third of the 20th century when American dramatists – Eugene O’Neill, Arthur Miller, Lorraine Hansberry, Tennessee Williams and Albee – put their characters through 15 heavyweight rounds until bloodstained submission. Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier fought a brutal bout dubbed the Thrilla in Manila; George and Martha contest the Carnage in New Carthage, Albee’s fictional east coast college town.This Leicester revival is sponsored by De Montfort University, although its staff would soon be suspended if they copied almost any moment in the play. Alcoholics Anonymous might be a better corporate partner; over three hours, the four actors get through numerous bottles of stage booze. The departures for the bathroom that Albee gives every character, while primarily a dramatic contrivance to leave people alone to fight or flirt, may also have practical benefits for actors.View image in fullscreenMore Hammer than Mattel … Tilly Steele as Honey and George Kemp as Nick.Photograph: Marc BrennerAlthough Albee’s situations tend to be domestic and marital, he was tangibly a cold war dramatist. Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? opened during the Cuban missile crisis and that drama and the arguably superior A Delicate Balance (1966), in which a terrified couple seek sanctuary with their friends, contain a strong sense of the possibility of civilisation ending, which pessimists may think gives topicality to the revival.Cara Nolan’s production has an appropriately apocalyptic feel on a set by Amy Jane Cook where the vast blood-red front door to George and Martha’s campus home suggests a portal to hell. As the infernal hosts, Cathy Tyson and Patrick Robinson, vividly illustrating the couple’s lethal co-dependency, are so equally powerful that boxing judges would call a draw.Tyson shows Martha struggling to hold herself imperiously and seductively even as the booze makes movement perilous. Between the misogynistic one-liners that draw audience gasps, Robinson throws poignant flashes of the attractive brain and heart washed away by disappointment and liquor. As the other couple, roles that involve a lot of nervous listening, George Kemp and Tilly Steele start out with super clean clothes and souls that seem deliberately to invoke Ken and Barbie finding themselves in a scenario more Hammer than Mattel.Albee’s dialogue is often musical, both in contrasting male and female tones but also alternating pieces for two, three and four voices. The cast rises magnificently to this, especially in the demanding finale when a tragic-comic quartet is followed by a devastating duet. Albee’s fights – male v female, history v biology, fantasy v reality – are undoubtedly a knockout here.AtCurve theatre, Leicester, until 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreCurve theatreEdward AlbeereviewsShareReuse this content"

I had pushed my way to her through the crowded lobby to introduce myself as the composer of the opera, fearful it would be my only chance to meet my first goddess. My first singing nun.Was I that young? It was 7 October 2000. I was 39 and this was my first opera, my long-dreamed-of “big break”. Maybe I was naive, but I felt young and the world felt full of possibility that night. Much different from the world today.Dead Man Walking was a bold story for the opera world at the time, especially since new operas produced by big companies were still something of a rarity. Nobody could have imagined or predicted that the opera would be a huge hit with audiences and that 25 years later Dead Man Walking would have received more than 85 international productions in 13 countries, staged by companies, colleges, conservatories and community groups of all sizes. Nobody could have predicted that during those 25 years, dozens of new operas would be created each year for every imaginable size company and performance space by a vast range of composers and librettists.And nobody could have predicted that the opera would feel more powerful and resonant today than it did 25 years ago.With cruelty being normalised in the US and elsewhere, threats to democracy on the rise, calls for executions increased, “empathy” being labelled as weak, social media dominating and AI on the rise, the opera lands in a very different way in 2025. After itsNew York Metropolitan Opera premiere in 2023, Joyce DiDonato, Ryan McKinny, Susan Graham and the Met cast went toSing Sing, a maximum-security prison to perform excerpts from the opera. A number of the incarcerated population learned and sang chorus roles. It was a shattering experience to listen as armed guards discreetly wiped away tears.View image in fullscreen‘The intention was not to preach’ … Rehearsals for ENO’s new production of Dead Man Walking.Photograph: Manuel HarlanBack in the 1970s and 80s, during my teens and 20s, I was a determined piano and composition student, dreaming of writing songs for Barbra Streisand and musicals for Broadway. Opera seemed only rarely a viable contemporary expression, thanks to groundbreaking work by Philip Glass, John Adams, Meredith Monk and Carlisle Floyd. But it felt unreachable and untouchable.My life changed drastically with a hand injury in my late 20s – a focal dystonia. To make a living, I became a PR and marketing writer and landed a job at the San Francisco Opera.With the opera we were able to tell a deeply human story honestly, and authentically, and to allow the audience to feel it all as part of a community.Every day, I was immersed in the hard-working, astonishing world of opera: rehearsals, performances, meetings with artistic production, development and more. Back then, the company produced 10 operas in the autumn alone. I experienced and felt the majestic power of this art form. I was deeply inspired. In my spare time, I wrote art songs for the divas I was meeting and working with, including Frederica von Stade and Renée Fleming.Another dramatic turn happened in 1995, when the opera’s general director Lotfi Mansouri asked me if I’d ever considered writing an opera. He’d heard about my songs being performed internationally and was eager to discover a new creative voice for the opera stage. I was stunned.View image in fullscreen‘An unexpected, staggering journey’ … Jake Heggie.Photograph: James NiebuhrLotfi wanted to pair me with the great American playwright Terrence McNally as my librettist and he suggested a comic opera: something light, frothy and bubbly to celebrate the new millennium. Fortunately, Terrence had no interest in such an opera. He wanted a bold drama, American but universal, timeless but timely. Lotfi removed the mandate for comedy.It took a while, but during a fateful meeting in 1997, Terrence suggested the story Dead Man Walking. I knew it was the right thing; I felt shivers head to toe and started to feel drama and music big enough to fill an opera house. I was on fire with it.View image in fullscreenDrama and music big enough to fill an opera house … Crispin Lord, Michael Mayes and Malachy Frame rehearse for ENO’s 2025 staging of Dead Man Walking.Photograph: Manuel HarlanSister Helen Prejean’s bestselling memoir had, a few years previously, been made into a brilliant film written and directed by Tim Robbins, starring Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. The story was very much in the national dialogue and highly controversial. A Louisiana nun becomes a pen pal to a convicted murderer on death row, then visits him and becomes his spiritual adviser, ultimately accompanying him to his execution. On her journey she meets the murder victims’ families and the convicted murderer’s family as she navigates the justice system in the US. What she experiences ignites a call to justice in her heart and soul. An activist emerges.When we told Lotfi the idea, he too immediately recognised its power and timeliness. He reminded us that all of the popular classic operas of the past have a social justice message at their heart: The Marriage of Figaro, The Barber of Seville, La Traviata, The Ring, Eugene Onegin, La Bohème, Jenůfa, The Rake’s Progress, Peter Grimes and on and on. Sometimes the message is subtle; sometimes overt.Terrence’s vision of what Dead Man Walking could do as an opera, that it could not do as a book or movie, was to send us deeper into the drama by extending emotionally dramatic moments with real people on stage singing unamplified – allowing us to vibrate in the middle of that emotion. It was not to make a polemic, to preach or tell people what they should feel. It was to tell a deeply human story honestly and authentically, and to allow the audience to feel it all as part of a community. Raise the questions. Don’t provide the answers. We could take something that people usually only consider in the abstract – the death penalty – and put a human face on it.View image in fullscreenA story of redemption… Joyce DiDonato as sister Helen Prejean with Michael Mayes  as Joseph de Rocher in a production of Dead Man Walking at Teatro Real, Madrid, in 2018.Photograph: © Javier del Real | Teatro RealSister Helen was a guiding light and support from the beginning. She knew we’d have to change things to make it work for the stage, that we were not making a documentary or putting a book on the stage. “The only thing I ask, is that it remain a story of redemption,” she said.Terrence wrote the libretto quickly, and I responded in kind. We started our work in 1998 and had a workshop in August of 1999.The premiere happened just over a year later. Our stellar cast included Susan Graham as Sister Helen, John Packard as Joseph De Rocher, Frederica von Stade as Joseph’s mother. Joe Mantello was the director and Patrick Summers conducted. The response was overwhelming. Two performances were added to the original run. Seven opera companies immediately commissioned a second production and others followed suit.And after the premiere, Julie Andrews came backstage to give me a hug I will never forget. It has been an unexpected, staggering journey of community, connection and transformation. And the journey continues.Dead Man Walking has its UK staged premiere in anENO production at the London Coliseum from 1-18 November.

It was then picked up by a neighbour who thought it was someone’s forgotten delivery and took it in for safekeeping. Days later, after her husband mentioned the missing Picasso, she checked the package and called the police.Had the picture, which was painted by the Spanish artist in 1919, reached its destination, it would have been one of the stars of the foundation’sStill Life: the Eternity of the Inertexhibition. But it never did.The foundation said that although some of the works were carefully packaged, they were not correctly numbered, making “an exhaustive check” impossible. The delivery was nonetheless signed off and the van and its crew went on their way.The following Monday, the pieces, which had been under video surveillance all weekend, were unpacked.“Once the unpacking had been done by the CajaGranada foundation’s own staff, the works were moved to different parts of the exhibition room,” the foundation said in a statement.“Mid-morning that day, the exhibition’s curator and the foundation’s head of exhibitions noticed that one work was missing. The piece is a small gouache byPablo Picasso, called Still Life with Guitar.”The foundation reported the matter to the Policía Nacional, who began to investigate. A week of speculation over the painting’s fate came to a prosaic end on Friday, when the force announced that the work had been recovered.“It may never have made it on the van,” the Policía Nacional said in a short statement. “The Historic Heritage Unit is keeping the investigation open and scientific police have opened the package containing the painting and are examining it.”Theatre Picasso review – Pablo tears reality apart in a riotous celebration of his raging geniusRead moreThe Guardian understands that despite the highly publicised hiccup, the foundation is still keen to take delivery of Still Life with Guitar so it can be exhibited as planned.Picasso’s fame – and the enormous sums his works command – have long made his art a target for thieves around the world.In February 2007, two Picasso paintings worth €50m were stolen from the Parishome of the artist’s granddaughter. Two years later,a Picasso sketchbook worth more than €8mwas stolen from a Paris museum dedicated to the artist.Twelve Picasso paintings, valued at about £9m, were stolen from the French Riviera villa of another of his grandchildren, Marina Picasso, in 1989.Several other Picasso paintings have been stolen from galleries.

Where Almond was mercurial and histrionic, Ball assumed the role of mysterious and reclusive mastermind. Almond would invariably be writhing in something black and skin-tight, possibly festooned with zips, while Ball might be wearing a suit and tie and attending soberly to his keyboard. Ball told the Guardian: “We were a weird couple: Marc, this gay bloke in makeup; and me, a big guy who looked like a minder.”Ball’s death comes a few weeks after Soft Cell’s headlining performance at the Rewind Festival at Henley-on-Thames in August, where he took to the stage in a wheelchair. This was the result of a serious accident in March 2022, when he fell down the stairs at his south London home and broke his back, leading to a protracted stay in intensive care.“I was pretty much unconscious for about two months,as I was in an induced coma,” he said. “I was so medicated, I was on everything, from morphine upwards. I was even on fentanyl, and that’s the stuff that killed Prince.”He spent seven months in hospital, suffering medical complications including pneumonia and sepsis. He recovered sufficiently to be able to play live shows and to work in the studio, where Soft Cell had recently completed theirsixth album, Danceteria, named after the influential New York City dance club from the 1980s and due to be released next year.View image in fullscreenDave Ball performing during Soft Cell’s show Say Hello, Wave Goodbye at the O2 in 2018.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesBall was born into a single-parent household in Chester, and was given up for adoption at 18 months old. He subsequently grew up in Blackpool with his adoptive parents, Donald and Brenda Ball, who changed his first name from Paul to David. He had a younger sister, Susan, also adopted.He attended Arnold school in Blackpool, and met Almond in 1977 at Leeds Polytechnic, where they were both studying art. Almond was a performance artist at the time, challenging audiences by performing naked and daubing himself with cat food. “He had heard me making bleepy noises on a synthesiser and asked me to do music for his performances,” said Ball.A shared love of Northern Soul music prompted the pair to form Soft Cell. Financed by £400 from Ball’s mother, they recorded the EPMutant Momentson a primitive two-track tape recorder. The EP was eventually released in 1980 on the Big Frock label. When Soft Cell subsequently played at theFuturama 2 Festivalin Leeds (third on the bill after Siouxsie and the Banshees and U2), Ball spottedBBC DJ John Peeland gave him a white label copy of the EP. Peel subsequently played it, and it caught the ear ofStevo, supremo of Some Bizarre records, who signed Soft Cell.In July 1981 they released the singleTainted Love, distinguished by Ball’s baleful synth motif and Almond’s agonised vocal. Following an appearance on Top of the Pops, it shot to No 1 in the UK, selling more than a million copies. It would go on to be a sizeable hit in the US, reaching No 8 in the summer of 1982. November 1981 saw the release of Soft Cell’s debut album,Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, which reached No 5 in the UK and 22 in the US. It would be by far their most successful album.Soft Cell performing Tainted Love live on Top of the Pops.The Art of Falling Apart(1983) reached No 5 in Britain and 84 in the US, whileThis Last Night in Sodom(1984) – their last album beforeCruelty Without Beauty(2002) – reached 12 in the UK. However, they fared better on the singles charts, withBedsitter;Say Hello, Wave Goodbye;Torch; andWhatall Top 5 hits in the UK.Ball described how This Last Night in Sodom was the result of a period of extreme decadence and prodigious drug use. “You can hear the product of all that,” he told Thomas H Green at theartsdesk. “Mr Self Destruct, Slave to This – basically a reference to being a slave to the music biz but also a slave to whatever addiction you had. EvenL’Esqualitais a reference to a heroin shot, all about a Puerto Rican transvestite club in New York.”Ball had already recorded a solo album,In Strict Tempo, in 1983, and now formed the group Other People with his then wife Gini Hewes – they subsequently divorced – and Andy Astle, and they released the singleHave A Nice Day(1984). He subsequently made a couple of singles as part ofEnglish Boy on the Loveranch.View image in fullscreenThe synth-pop duo in 1983.Photograph: Eugene Adebari/ShutterstockHe also worked with Psychic TV, where he met Richard Norris. After calling themselves M.E.S.H. and recording the trackMeet Every Situation Head On, Ball and Norris morphed into The Grid in 1988 and released a string of successful singles, in particular the UK No 3 hitSwamp Thing.Soft Cell reunited for some live performances in 2000, but two years later Cruelty Without Beauty failed to reach the UK Top 100. In 2018 they staged what they thought wasa farewell concert at the O2 in London, and Ball revealed that his health had been poor. “I used to be a heavy smoker,” he told theartsdesk. “I hadCOPD, pneumonia, I was incapacitated, walking around with a stick. I no longer am but I’m still on steroids from the long years of smoking fags and sniffing God knows what.”Nonetheless, they gave a short UK tour in 2021, marking the 40th anniversary of Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, and in May 2022 they released the albumHappiness Not Included. It reached No 7 in the UK.In 2020 Ball produced a memoir,Electronic Boy: My Life in and Out of Soft Cell. After his death, Soft Cell’s manager Chris Smith commented: “He was respected by his peers, and I will miss him immensely, but I’m also really happy he got to see how loved he was in the most recent stages of his long career.”The statement went on to say that Ball is survived by his close family, including his four children.David James Ball, musician and songwriter, born 3 May 1959: died 22 October 2025Explore more on these topicsDave BallElectronic musicMarc AlmondPop and rockobituariesShareReuse this content"

West End casting directors raise concerns about trend for big starsFilm and TV stars are selling tickets, but director says reliance on famous names is ‘killing audiences’ intellects’Nadia KhomamiArts and culture correspondentFri 24 Oct 2025 08.59 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 13.56 EDTShareFrom Ncuti Gatwa in Born With Teeth toAlicia Vikanderin The Lady From the Sea and Susan Sarandon in Mary Page Marlowe, there is no shortage of starry celebrities being cast for the West End right now.It is a phenomenon happening in subsidised theatre too: Indhu Rubasingham’s inaugural season at the National Theatre features the likes of screen favourites Paul Mescal andNicola Coughlan.But over the last few years, the propensity to cast film and TV stars for the stage has become a point of contention in an industry still struggling from funding cuts and changing audience habits after the Covid pandemic. While some believe big names can help entice audiences and sell tickets, others say they stop risk-averse theatres from taking a chance on smaller productions with unknown casts.It was a debate freshly renewed this week when Nadine Rennie, a co-chair of the Casting Directors’ Guild,warned the trend was “killing” the industry, and mid-scale theatres would be the first to go – despite being where the household names of the future cut their teeth.Speaking at conference hosted by Spotlight at Rada, Rennie compared the proliferation of celebrity names on stages to “feeding a child too much sugar”. “It’s killing audiences’ intellects. I hear audience members say all the time: ‘I don’t know anybody who’s in this.’ Or they’re not excited about a new play by an emerging writer,” she said.Jill Green, a casting director for shows including The Devil Wears Prada, The Great Gatsby and War Horse, said many casting directors were increasingly being asked to cast big-name actors, with some theatres refusing to commit to booking a show until a recognised name was attached.“This does make it much harder for new writing and productions without headline names to secure a slot against star-led shows,” she said. “However, the real question is: what actually constitutes a ‘big name’ who can sell that many tickets? The pool of talent that genuinely moves the needle at the box office isn’t exactly Olympic-sized.”Her sentiments echoed those of the National Theatre’s director of casting, Alastair Coomer, who told the Spotlight conference that celebrity casting was “the biggest driver now” for audiences, putting immense pressure on the industry. “All of us are chasing the same very, very small group of people,” he said.But having a star on the bill is not without its benefit. Green said the theatre provided a “fantastic opportunity” for audiences to see a performer they admire taking on a role that truly suits their skill set. “It can also help fill houses, which in turn sustains a lot of jobs both on and off stage,” she added. “But ticket pricing has become a major concern – if prices rise to extortionate levels, we risk excluding audiences who simply can’t afford to go.”This is becoming apparent in the US, where the swing towards star casting isparticularly dramatic. Tickets for George Clooney’s Broadway debut in Good Night, and Good Luck went for upwards of $800 (£600), while those for Denzel Washington’s Othello went for up to $1,000.“Would I celebrate a world where my theatre was packed, but each ticket was £300, which is what’s happening on Broadway?” Nadia Fall, the artistic director of the Young Vic theatre,told the Guardian recently. “This is where the maths could lead us: theatre as a pastime for the elite.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Clooney  in Good Night, and Good Luck on Broadway earlier this year.Photograph: Andy Kropa/Invision/APThe theatre critic Arifa Akbar says there is a certain “circus” element to A-lister castings. “Many people come to see the star rather than the play. It’s a way of bringing in money and getting bums on seats, for sure, but it’s not a financial – or creative – solution for the industry in the long run because the demographic buying tickets for star-led shows won’t come when there’s no star in sight,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And shows can still go seriously wrong, however A-list the actor, as we saw in Sigourney Weaver’s weird, wooden turn in the West End’s The Tempest last year.”Kenny Wax, the producer of plays and musicals including Six the Musical, The Play That Goes Wrong and Why Am I So Single?, emphasised that seeing shows with big stars were rare – and sometimes transformative – experiences.He said: “When Tom Holland was cast in Romeo and Juliet it was an opportunity to get young people into Shakespeare who would have never gone to see that play otherwise. Kenneth Branagh is returning to the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon for the first time in over 30 years next year; that’s really exciting for youngsters to have a chance to see him live on stage.”Wax said there were “plenty of theatres and plenty of productions throughout the year to go around”. “This summer we had The Comedy About Spies at the Noël Coward, which had no big TV or film stars, but literally sold out 100% for 20 weeks. You don’t need a star. The quality and the cream always tends to rise to the top.”For Wax,Londoncontinues to strike a good balance between new work, risks and big stars – especially compared with New York, where “you can’t do it without the big stars”.“The American system is considered quite broken at the moment. It’s incredibly expensive to put on a play or a musical in New York. The Play That Goes Wrong cost about £250,000 in London, but when it opened in New York eight years ago it cost $4m. With the same set. The climate has only got more difficult. Since Covid, 46 musicals have opened on Broadway,and only three of them have been profitable– including our show Six.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndNcuti GatwaAlicia VikanderSusan SarandonPaul MescalNicola CoughlannewsShareReuse this content"

If you’re like Hannah, a recent subject of the Guardian’s My cultural awakening column, it’s to the sound of a rat whisking eggs. The series shares stories of people who made a significant life change thanks to a piece of popular culture, and in the case of Hannah, that meantcuring insomnia by watching Ratatouille. Every night for the last 15 years, at home or abroad, she switches on the Pixar classic and, within minutes, finds herself dropping off, thanks to the film’s comforting, consistent soundscape. It’s so effective, in fact, she’s never even seen it all the way through.Hannah’s might be a bit of an extreme example, but her tale does touch on something universal: culture seems to play an increasingly important role these days in helping people nod off. Head over to Spotify, Apple Music or any of the other music streaming sites and you’ll find endless playlists promising to ease you into a deep sleep. You’ll find similar on the BBC’s radio stations: 6Music’sDream Time, a late-night audio mix from DJ Zakia Sewell; Radio 1’sDeep Sleepscapes, which repurposes audio footage from the Beeb’s nature programming; orThe Sleeping Forecast, which splices ambient and classical music with snippets from the shipping forecast. That latter series comes fromRadio 3 Unwind, a new sister station to Radio 3 designed to “enhance wellbeing”, so naturally encouraging a good night’s sleep is central to a lot of their programming. There’s an entire sub-category of podcasting to send you under, too: series likeNothing Much Happens, which offers storytelling that is interesting enough to hold your attention but pitched at an intensity that won’t keep you gripped and wakeful.While audio might be a natural accompaniment to zonking off, screen-based culture is usually dissuaded by proponents of “sleep hygiene”. Still, as someone who regularly dozes off in front of the box, no matter how well-made and enjoyable the thing on it is, I can confirm that film and television can be of great assistance in conking out, too. And of course, “reading a few pages of a book before inevitably nodding off” has been a tried and trusted sleep aid for centuries.With all that in mind we thought it was a fine time to ask experts across TV, music, literature, podcasts and film about what culture they use to send themselves to sleep. Not out of boredom, we should add: these are all legitimately things they enjoy. So hopefully they prove suitably soporific for the insomniacs, and something good to check out for everyone else.TVView image in fullscreen‘Hot chocolate for the subconscious’ … David Attenborough in Life in Cold Blood.Photograph: BBC/PR IMAGEThere’s a precise sweet spot to insomnia-banishing TV. Firstly, a show shouldn’t be inherently boring; on some level, it needs to be something you’d watch anyway. But it also shouldn’t have an excess of narrative drive – after all, you’ll soon be drifting in and out of consciousness. And finally, the show must be tonally consistent and visually and sonically soothing.On all of these criteria,BBC naturedocumentariesscore highly. The quality is guaranteed; the format is gently episodic; and the tone, underwritten by long-established grandfather to the nation, David Attenborough, is hot chocolate for the subconscious. As a bonus feature, it’s easy to forget the underlying strangeness of nature. But if you drift off to sleep absorbing footage of bioluminescent marine creatures, billowing clouds of underwater snow and self-cloning crayfish, chances are you’ll have some captivating, borderline-psychedelic dreams.Phil Harrison, TV writer and author ofThe Age of Static: How TV Explains Modern BritainBooksAs an on-off insomniac, I am addicted to sleep hypnosis recordings. Because these invariably guide you to imagine yourself chilling by the ocean, anything water-themed is now sleep-inducing to me. So one of my favourite bedtime reads isEarth Prayers, a 2024 anthology edited by Carol Ann Duffy, for its hypnotic poems on water and the sea. We have Raymond Carver celebrating rivers; elsewhere, former Makar Kathleen Jamie writes from the perspective of the river Clyde, which describes itself, soporifically, as a “long level / liquid ear gliding slowly by”, listening to the “world’s words”. In Don Paterson’s Parallax, the moon lays “silent on the sea / as on a polished shelf”.Such tranquilising descriptions appear throughout these poems on flowers, animals, and the sky at night. Poetry is, in general, my favourite format to read in bed – wavelike in itself, it feels like the easiest format to dip into when you’re exhausted, the strongest competition against the all-too-seductive bedtime doomscroll.Ella Creamer, Guardian commissioning editor, books and writer of ourBookmarks newsletterMusicView image in fullscreenSleep cycle … William Basinski.Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The GuardianThe only time I ever listen to music to go to sleep is on a plane – and always the same record, to induce a sort of Pavlovian surrender. On one hand,William Basinski’s The Disintegration Loopsmakes perfect sense in that setting. The collection repeats the same orchestral motifs, which lends focus to my wayward mind. The loop gets quieter over the course of the first track’s 63-minute run time, which encourages my brain to wind down, and becomes less obtrusive as sleep hopefully comes on.On the other hand, Basinski completed recording in New York City on 11 September 2001, the album cover features smoke from the twin towers, and he dedicated the album to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. It’s probably the least appropriate thing you could listen to in order to relax while airborne.

It was shortly after his 2018 film Shoplifterswas released. I, like many others, loved its twisty story about a family where not everything is as it seems. After Life was a different beast. The supernatural story, set in a countryside house that functions as a purgatory of sorts, follows a group of recently deceased people trying to move on.It is, like Koreeda’s other films, beautifully shot, emotionally acute, and full of thoughtful reflections on what it means to be human. It is also perhaps one of the most gentlest things I’ve seen. Full disclosure: I myself didn’t fall asleep, though my boyfriend struggled to stay awake at times. With its unhurried pace, mesmerising cinematography, hushed dialogue and total absence of any sense of danger or melodrama, I could see why.Rebecca Liu, Guardian commissioning editor and film writerIf you want to read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayView image in fullscreenHarping on … Dave.Photograph: Gabriel MosesView image in fullscreenThe last dance … Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC StudiosExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletternewslettersShareReuse this content"

My look – skinny and not too good-looking – was in high demandJohn WalkerFri 24 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 12.59 EDTShareIhave always been a television addict. As a young boy growing up in Bath, I’d devour programmes such as Doctor Who, desperate to know how they were created. At 16, I dared to tell a school careers adviser that I wanted to work in TV; she laughed and said a career in television was for people who went to university. She suggested I get a job in retail. Dejected, I reluctantly took on a job at a supermarket, but made my way up through the ranks. They had a budget for making corporate films, and I ended up directing and producing their training videos.Then, in 1998, I saw an advert in a sci-fi magazine for unpaid extras for Auton, a Doctor Who spin-off. I dashed off an application and was thrilled to get a call weeks later, offering me a role as a villager.Walking on set the first time, I was like a kid in a sweet shop; it was everything I’d dreamed it would be. I was desperate to do it again, and signed up to an extras agency. I hoped to get the odd role, but to my surprise the bookings started flooding in, and I realised I could make more money being a full-time extra – or “background actor” – than in my retail job.Over the years, I’ve made over 2,500 appearances on camera, making me one of the most prolific extras in the UK. My look at the time – skinny, mid-30s and not too good-looking – was in high demand to play doctors, gentry in period dramas, police officers and journalists. I was cast as a newsreader so often that I started signing off with the same name every time – Peter Sommers has announced headlines in at least 30 films and TV shows, and he started being requested by directors.Eagle-eyed viewers might have noticed that, for a short while, there was only one GP working across Britain’s soaps: me, simultaneously treating the residents of Emmerdale, Hollyoaks and Coronation Street. There was a group of us who always played detectives on four different cop shows, too. We joked it was a wonder any cases ever got solved, given our vast workload.TV work led to films: I’ve appeared in Sherlock Holmes 2, as an assassin, and The Woman in Black, as Daniel Radcliffe’s butler. Most extra roles don’t include any lines, but sometimes you get the odd sentence or two.Experience: I am the air guitar world championRead moreMy friends are always spotting me on telly, but I’ve only been recognised by a stranger once. A lady stopped me and asked if I was the man racing in a child’s go-kart in a Pontins advert. I was more excited to be recognised than she was to spot me.John Walker go-karting in a Pontins advertThe best day I ever had on set was meeting my wife, fellow background artist Neilum. We were cast as a married couple on the soap Doctors. I fell head over heels for her immediately, andtold her I’d marry her for real one day. She told me afterwards she thought I was quite strange, but I must have grown on her as we tied the knot in 2013.We’ve appeared on hundreds of shows together since. People can see we have genuine chemistry, which helped us get roles. In 2015, our daughter India was born. We were offered extra work for her straight away. She loved it when she was little, but doesn’t want to do as much now she is 10.I still wanted to live out my dreams of directing, so I put some money into making my own film, which I am proud of and is now on Netflix, but it didn’t generate much revenue. Then a friend offered me a few days’ work as a runner on the set of Doctors. Most runners are in their early 20s, but I jumped at the chance to make tea and coffee aged 47.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I always make sure I’m nice to the background artists. Sadly, last year, Doctors was cancelled after a 24-year run. I was gutted – my family wouldn’t exist without that show. I did manage to leave my mark though – I made sure Neilum and India were in the background as a mother and daughter in the very last scene.In the last few years, our extra work has taken a back seat. I’m busy directing, plus I’ve written several books about my experiences, and Neilum runs a chaperone agency. I’d never say never to appearing in a great show if the right opportunity came along, but for now I’m happy staying in the background.As told to Heather MainDo you have an experience to share?

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve struggled with a lack of sleep and its after-effects for years. Besides a chronic pain condition that interferes with my sleep schedule, my sensitivity to sound and light means that it doesn’t take much to snap me out of slumber after I get there. At least I’m in good company: according to theNational Institutes of Health, more than 50 million Americans struggle with such sleep disorders.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.After trying almost everything, I finally turned to tech about a year ago. I had skeptically dismissed these sleep-focused devices as snake oil – and some are – but a few have been genuinely helpful. From simple noise-canceling earplugs to a headband that literally interferes with your brain waves, here are the tech tools that have helped me fall asleep and get the elusive rest I need.Jabees Peace Pillow SpeakerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Prakhar Khanna/The Guardian$35.99 at Jabees$37.99 at AmazonTheJabees Peace Pillowis a bone-conduction speaker that you put under your pillow. Since it transmits sound by contact with your head, no one else can hear it, but it doesn’t require anything in your ears. That’s precisely why I love it: it doesn’t require me to wear something tosleep. At just over an inch thick, it doesn’t cause any discomfort, especially for side sleepers.You can connect it to your phone with Bluetooth, load your own sounds on a memory card, or play preloaded sounds. My favorite is a gentle vibration that makes me drowsy without fail. The speaker is just loud enough to listen to these sound effects comfortably, and you can adjust it with physical buttons. While it hasn’t improved my sleeping habits, it does help me fall asleep more frequently.Elemind HeadbandView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Prakhar Khanna/The Guardian$349 at ElemindTheElemind Headbandis one of the few devices that worked really well for me. In simple terms, this headband hacks your brain waves and puts you into sleep mode. In technical terms, Elemind tracks your EEG brain activity and uses acoustic stimulation synced to your brain’s natural rhythms to help you fall asleep.But you don’t need to understand it to use it: just strap it around your forehead and turn it on. It’s comfortable enough to wear in almost all sleep positions and easily stays on until I fall asleep, although I almost always wake up without it on my head. It’s not a drug; you have to want to fall asleep. You can’t be doomscrolling on your phone and expect it to magically doze you off. I love naps, and it has helped me get more of those.If you are a frequent traveler like me, the Elemind is perfect paired with noise-canceling earbuds on a plane. It also helps with jet lag, when you land in a new time zone and find it impossible to sleep. While it’s expensive, for me the Elemind headband is worth its $349 investment. I just wish I didn’t have to charge it every two to three days.Noise-canceling headphones or earplugsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Prakhar Khanna/The GuardianIf you wake easily as I do, a pair of earplugs can be helpful to keep the world at bay while you’re slumbering. The active noise cancellation of AirPods Pro 3 or the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 can be useful as well, but if you want to save battery when traveling, investing in a pair of sleep-focused earbuds makes sense. I switch between QuietOn earbuds and Loop earplugs.QuietOn 4 Sleep EarbudsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of QuietOn$275.50 at Hearfit$315 at Salish Medical & Dental SupplyI love the QuietOn 3.1 Sleep Earbuds because they cancel lower-frequency, consistent sounds like car traffic, a running AC, or an airplane engine pretty well, and they last more than four sleep cycles. The new QuietOn 4 are comparable in every way, including the steep price of nearly $300. Anker’sSoundcore Sleep A30are a good alternative at $230, but if you want a pair of reusable earplugs under $50, one of theLoop productsis your best bet. They are comfortable to wear, inexpensive, easy to carry, and don’t require charging.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Filter USFree weekly newsletterA guide to buying fewer, better products.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Like the pillow speaker, theSoaak apphas white noise tracks that can help you sleep, but also much more. A $30 monthly subscription gives you access to tracks to reduce anxiety, enhance creativity, focus better, and more. I can’t speak to the science, but they’ve genuinely helped me when I’m restless in the early morning hours, even if the weird sounds can be disorienting the first time you try them.According to Soaak, the Sleep Well track is designed using “a blend of clinically curated sound frequencies”. Like the Elemind headband, they “target brainwave patterns” associated with relaxation, which help “calm the mind, lower stress, and induce a peaceful, sleep-ready state”.An eye mask for light-sensitive sleepersView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Isil Terzioglu/Getty ImagesMzoo Luxury Sleep Mask$22.79 at AmazonOK, there’s no tech here, but if you are sensitive to light, nothing helps more than covering your eyes with a comfortable sleep mask. I use one of the masks that Air France gave me on a long-haul flight, and while the strap has loosened over time, I continue to use it because of its comfortable fit.That said, I recommend going with a sleep mask that comes equipped with an adjustable strap and eye cups surrounded by soft foam padding. We have a list of thebest sleep masks, based on six weeks of testing with 24 masks, to help you find the one that suits you best.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Filter USfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In fairy tales, it’s where children get lost, where witches build houses made of cake, and where transformations occur in the shadow of trees. But it’s also a place of deep, loamy quiet – a world that hums with hidden life. This cake draws on that dark magic: a tender chocolate sponge, earthy and aromatic with cocoa powder and olive oil, topped with a rosemary-infused ganache and strewn with textures that nod to moist soil, fallen leaves, moss, bark and fungi. It’s Halloween baking, but less fright night and more folklore. The aim is to evoke an enchanted woodland, dark, lush and a little eerie. Serve simply, with whipped cream.Forest floor cakePrep10 minSteep10 minCook1 hr 15 minServes10-12For the cocoa cake base80ml unsalted butter, melted, plus extra for greasing200g plain flour75g unsweetened cocoa powder1tsp baking powder½ tsp bicarbonate of soda¼ tsp fine sea salt3 large eggs, at room temperature150g caster sugar80g soft brown sugar100ml olive oil2 tsp vanilla extract250ml plain unsweetened drinking kefir1 tsp instant coffee granulesFor the rosemary chocolate ganache200ml double cream2 large sprigs rosemary200g dark chocolate,finely choppedA pinch of flaky sea saltFor the forest floor decorations (all optional)Cocoa nibs, or crumbled brownies or cake offcutsRoughly chopped hazelnuts, or finely chopped pistachio nutsBlack sesame seedsRosemary sprigsChocolateshards, or chocolate-coated raisinsSmall edible flowersMeringue mushroomsHeat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and grease and line a roughly 28cm x 23cm baking tin.Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarb and salt into a large bowl.In a second bowl, whisk the eggs and both sugars until slightly thickened, then add the oil, melted butter and vanilla. Whisk well to incorporate, then add the kefir and mix smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry and whisk to combine.Stir the coffee granules into 100ml hot water, then add to the batter. Whisk gently until smooth (it will be quite runny), then pour into the prepared tin. Bake for 30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out with just a few moist crumbs. Leave to cool completely in the tin, then turn out on to a board.To make the ganache, gently heat the cream and rosemary in a small saucepan until just steaming, then take off the heat. Cover and leave to steep for 10 minutes, then reheat the cream. Put the chocolate in a small bowl, then strain the hot cream over it; discard the rosemary. Stir until smooth, then add the salt and leave to cool to a spreadable consistency. Spread over the cooled cake.To decorate, begin with the base ‘soil’ layer: scatter cocoa nibs over the surface for crunch and woodsy bitterness, then crumble over chocolate cake offcuts or brownies to mimic clods. Scatter chopped hazelnuts and finely chopped pistachios to suggest pebbles or gravel, and black sesame seeds for a speckled, organic texture. To introduce life and natural movement, add some botanical elements: sprigs of rosemary as pine or small trees; small edible flowers and micro herbs as forest blooms or green stirrings in the mossy undergrowth. To add structure and a sense of decay, break chocolate shards into irregular pieces and press upright into the cake. Caramelised hazelnut praline shards can also be added to suggest cracked amber or fossilised leaves. For a sense of the fairytale, small meringue mushrooms dusted with cocoa powder can be dotted around in odd-numbered clusters, and pipe on chocolate swirls to mimic creeping vines or roots. Allow some garnishes to trail over the side of the cake for a wild, untamed feel.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotBakingFoodDessertChocolaterecipesShareReuse this content"

The good news is, it is possible to learn how to be a good flirtGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailAlyx GormanFri 24 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 19.20 EDTShareFrom his birds-eye position in the booth, DJ Rakish has noticed a blue light disco effect on the dancefloor when he plays at “straightish” nightclubs. “If people aren’t already in groups, you definitely see the boys hanging around together and the girls hanging around together,” he says. There might be furtive glances here and there but, “particularly with younger people, game just doesn’t seem to exist at the moment”.Rakish is not alone in noticing a lack of casual flirting between strangers. Clinical psychologist and UCLA professor Dr Elizabeth Laugeson says: “There is some evidence that young adults today are … engaging in less traditional dating behaviour, compared to previous generations.”As more and more userslog off dating apps, singles are seeking novel ways to meet, fromspeed datingtorun clubstopadel and pickleball leagues. In the United States, some have even started organising “flirting parties”. But making a connection in real life means levelling up one’s game. The good news, experienced flirts and experts agree, is that the lost art of flirting can be relearned.“On the surface, it can kind of look like we’re losing our social skills as a society, and that’s not necessarily untrue,” Laugeson says. There are manifold reasons for this decline, she says, from reliance on technology to the ongoing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. This doesn’t mean people are less capable of flirting, “it probably just means that they have fewer opportunities to … practise those face-to-face, IRL romantic skills”.Golden retriever boyfriends and ick lists: gen Z’s dating rules are making them ‘constantly disappointed’Read moreMJ, a Melbourne woman in her early 40s, is experiencing this first-hand. She’s currently using dating apps and says “it’s bleak out there, I tell you”.“I’m definitely better in person when it comes to flirting. And that’s why it’s kind of sad that the apps are the main way for people to meet each other these days, because you don’t have that room to flirt. You can have a little bit of text banter, but it’s just not the same.”Rio, a gay man in his early 30s who was introduced to me by a colleague as the best flirt she knows, has plenty of game, but says many of his peers – straight and queer – are “so intimidated about approaching people”.View image in fullscreenOnce you’re already talking, sustained eye contact is also a good way of parsing whether a conversation might be a flirtation.Photograph: Ianni Dimitrov Pictures/AlamyWhen friends tell him about their romantic woes, he suggests exposure therapy. “I’m like, what you need to do is … talk to the person at the cashier and just say, ‘Hey, how are you? How’s your day?’ … Say thank you to the bus driver … Just have little tiny interactions with people around you.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningLaugeson, who developed an evidence-based and widely used social skills intervention called the Peers program, featured in Love on the Spectrum, has a much more detailed approach with the neurodiverse and socially anxious adults in her program, but her message is similar to Rio’s. Social skills are like muscles: “The more you use them, the stronger they get.”Her Peers workshops include rules for pre-approach eye contact: hold it for a beat, look away, then look back – don’t stare or body scan. Her recommendations for compliments are even more comprehensive: avoid anything generic or effusive; be specific, modest and, if youmustmake it physical, stay above the neck – “that pocket square matches your eyes”, not “you’d look great in a Superman costume”.When you don’t know someone well, broad compliments like “you’re beautiful” or “you’re so smart” are going to be off-putting, Laugeson says. “It comes off as if you’re trying too hard.”Just turn your attention to the other person, and what you’re reading from the other personDossie EastonSome of the joy of flirting lies in its ambiguity – a fleeting glance, a smile returned, an inside joke co-created – but even in a subtle game, the rules can be defined. In Peers, Laugeson draws on decades of social research to explicitly break down flirting into behaviours she calls “ecologically valid”.For Laugeson, successful flirting is behaviour that “feels natural and respectful, but also reciprocal”. While pick-up lines and over the top gestures are technically a form of flirting, “that’s not how we typically define successful flirting”.Dossie Easton, octogenarian author of The Ethical Slut, a relationship advice book often described as the bible of non-monogamy, has a more poetic definition: “It’s the notion of, I’ll show you my sacred beautiful energy and you show me yours. That’s what flirting is really about. The eyes get bright, the pupils dilate. We show a little of what our turn-on looks like or feels like, and the other person does the same. And that’s how we make connection.”To flirt well, Easton says, we must “let go of, ‘Am I doing this right? Am I OK? Do I look OK? Should I not do this ‘til I lose 20 pounds? … I’m 80 years old, is this still OK?’ And so on and so forth. And just maybe turn your attention to the other person, and what you’re reading from the other person.”Body language is critical here. “If I move a step closer to somebody, do they back off? Do they stay put? Do they move closer to me?”‘People say I come across as incredibly boring!’ How to find love on the dating apps – whatever the obstaclesRead moreOnce you’re already talking, sustained eye contact is also a good way of parsing whether a conversation might be a flirtation. MJ, who is autistic and says she sometimes struggles with this, has a good strategy when she wants to flirt: “I look at people just directly underneath their eyes, which is a lot less pressure than direct eye contact.”MJ says that for her, flirting is all about great banter. “I like it when someone can impress me, but in a way where they’re not trying too hard.”Easton agrees. Part of what makes flirting so fun is also the chance to show off. “You do get to put your best self forward.”In The Ethical Slut, Easton and her co-author Janet Hardy write that flirting should be a goal in itself, not a means to an end. A good example of this is “the way many gay men flirt with straight women – friendly flattery, lighthearted innuendo, nonthreatening intimacy, all made possible by the realisation that the interaction is intended simply for mutual pleasure, not in the hopes of a quick dash to the nearest bedroom”.For Rio, great flirting “should feel like someone has your back. They’re trying to promote you, essentially – not to be too corporate about it.” He says that even if a gesture catches someone off-guard, the person being flirted with should always feel the interaction is to their benefit.Easton finds there’s “a certain level of outrageousness” that can work very well. She recalls a time in the late 1970s when “I literally wrote my phone number in a matchbook and walked up to a guy and stuck it in his pocket and left. I just left, just went away. And by god, he called.” They spent some time together dating after that.Making one big move then leaving the room can be particularly useful when it’s unclear how welcome romantic attention might be – for instance, if the person you fancy works in the service industry. You’re hard put to gauge someone’s true receptiveness when they’re professionally obliged to be friendly to you, Easton says.If you are a straight dude at a club and you’re dancing, already you are doing way more than most of the other peopleDJ RakishShe has another rule of thumb for ensuring attention is welcome: “Once is asking, twice is checking and three times is harassment.”Being conscientious of other people’s boundaries is particularly important for straight men, she says. To be a great flirt, a straight man has to “somehow show that you’re safe”.“A couple of tall straight men I know when in a flirting situation always take a step back or two to prove that they’re not going to loom. And I think it’s a very wise move.”View image in fullscreen‘You don’t need to be good at it’: dancing is a matter of enthusiasm, not skill.Photograph: Maskot/Getty ImagesWhen DJ Rakish sees straight men flirt well, “10 times out of 10, it’s based on their … willingness to just dance.“If you are a straight dude at a club and you’re dancing, already you are doing way more than most of the other people who are just two-stepping to the side.”Dancing is a matter of enthusiasm, not skill. “You don’t need to be good at it … It signals that idea that maybe you don’t take yourself too seriously and … that can be a signal of safety as well.”Meanwhile, for women straight and queer, Easton suggests being more forward. “Many of us were raised in such a way that women were never expected to be the initiators.” So, when she was dating in “lesbian land … if you were ready to be an initiator, you kind of had to announce that”.“As women … we have a responsibility to be more clear.”For anyone who would like to make an ambiguous flirting situation more obvious, she also suggests simply calling it out. Ask: “Are you flirting with me? Is that what’s going on here? If that’s true, that’s fine, actually.”Of course, when you tip your hand, there’s always a chance the other person will leave the table. Rakish has advice for anyone who would love to flirt, but fears being turned down. A little bit of rejection is inevitable in matters of the heart, he says. But in the eternal words of Aaliyah: “Dust yourself off and try again … but not with that person.”Alyx Gorman is the author of All Women Want.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Chipping into the conversation this month is a £1,590 cotton hoodie with a faux fur-trimmed hood by Balenciaga, emblazoned with the word itself with the brand’s name scrawled into the Y’s cursive tail. Worn by Gwyneth Paltrow in the latest issue of British Vogue as she chops a pineapple in the very luxurious marble kitchen of her Hamptons home, the hoodie is the gag in the scene – but is it funny, or just obscene? Are you in on the joke?It will come as no surprise that it was designed by Demna Gvasalia. The ultimate provocateur, Demna (who goes by his first name) pulled “Is it ironic?” stunts like this throughout his tenure at Balenciaga (he recently moved to Gucci). He caused outrage withtrainerscovered in fake mud, a skirt that lookedlike a toweland a four-figure bag that resembled Ikea’s 75pFrakta carrier. There was also Kim Kardashian wrapped in Balenciaga-brandedduct tape, high-heeledCrocsandthatill-thought-outadvertising campaign. So while the collab between an ordinary item of clothing and the word “Luxury” is not that surprising in this context, it is timely, particularly as the high-end fashion market attempts to navigate its way through a slump after a three-year surge. While other brands have leaned into stories of craftsmanship or exclusivity as a way of justifying higher prices, the design of the Balenciaga hoodie resembles a £15 version fromTemu. All that is missing is, well, that luxury branding.“It’s interesting because that hoodie would not have been allowed to happen 10 years ago. Fashion brands strongly rejected the term,” says Jana Scholze, an associate professor at London’s Kingston school of art and co-curator of the V&A’s 2015 exhibition, What is Luxury?. The exhibition aimed to answer its own question by exploring over 100 luxury products includinga £100,000 wristwatch and DNA vending machine. Scholze says fashion brands typically described as luxury didn’t want to be involved in their clothes or the exhibition. In a year where the global luxury goods market exceeded£1tnfor the first time and the word was plastered everywhere, “fashion brands felt the term had become meaningless”.A decade later the term is more omnipresent and this time luxury brands are proudly self-identifying. Balenciaga obviously takes it one step further. Scholze considers the range “for people in the know” and suggests it appeals to a generation who have grown up online. “They follow certain influencers and they see a certain type of life portrayed to them they would like to reach. On open days [at Kingston], lots of applicants ask me, ‘Is there a job in this?’ They want to earn lots of money quickly. That’s their sole aspiration. It is brutally honest, but can we blame them?”View image in fullscreenCap, £425, BalenciagaPhotograph: BalenciagaLuxury is a word that has always been contentious. Dr John Armitage, an associate professor and author of books including Luxury Philosophy, says it first started being argued about over 2,000 years ago when Plato considered it inThe Republic. Armitage describes the word as a “shape shifter” explaining there is no clear definition. The Genevan writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau used it to describe “the enervation of virtue”, while Karl Marx expressed it as “the opposite of the necessary”.Perhaps Demna, who was named one of Time’s most influential people in 2022, is simply hinting that quiet luxury, a term describing discreet but expensive clothing that entered the mainstream lexicon thanks to TV shows such as Succession, is now over. Conspicuous consumption is back. See that aforementioned Birkin.Five-figure Labubus. President Trump’s gaudy goldOval Office makeover.Less stealth wealth and more shouty, Demna’s “Luxury” range also includes a £640 cotton T-shirt and a £425 baseball cap with purposefully scuffed edges. In September he unveiled his debut collection forGucci. The opening look consisted of a giant logo-ed Gucci trunk. There were also lots of faux-fur coats. Understated it was not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This transatlantic journey is well worth it for delicious and lovingly presented local fare (think Argyll venison and mussels brought into Oban harbour). The pub bustles with visitors and locals, while the adjoining restaurant is a warm space tocooriein from the wild west coast and enjoy the stunning views down the Clachan Sound.Calum HamiltonHomegrown ingredients in the South DownsView image in fullscreenOn a hot July Sunday in 2023 we came across theSussex Oxat the foot of the hills that lead up to theLong Man of Wilmington, near Alfriston, in East Sussex. Following a path from close to the pub, we climbed the hill to get close to the mysterious figure cut into the hillside and fell in love with the view. Galloping back down for lunch at the pub, we encountered a horse in its garden and its rider happily sipping a pint – a sight that seemed to symbolise what makes a great country pub. But the best was yet to come: a Sunday lunch with many of the ingredients coming from the pub’s own farm in Jevington, grass-fed and sustainably reared. Big, complex flavours in classic Sunday roasts testified to the wisdom of this approach. Ales are from the Long Man brewery. Vintage crockery and charming staff completed our wholly satisfying afternoon. We have returned many times since as we keep being drawn back to South Downs walks and this picturesque and wholly hospitable country pub.Noreen MeehanPuddings to die for in MonmouthshireView image in fullscreenI find everything about theAngel Innat Grosmont near Abergavenny to my liking. Centrally located in an ancient village set in glorious walking countryside, there is also a castle nearby where children can play while adults linger over drinks. The food is varied, generous and beautifully cooked by chef Jim Hamilton, with puddings to die for. The Angel Inn is also a friendly pub used by the community, with chess nights, quizzes and live music. There’s a central open fire, local beers, dogs, books and Welsh-language clubs. It is never cliquey and everyone is made to feel welcome.ClareSea bass after a long walk in foodie CeredigionView image in fullscreenY Talbot, inTregaron, west Wales, led the charge in making Ceredigion a great foodie location, and they’ve kept up the quality. Steaks are a speciality, plus high quality favourites such as slow-cooked Welsh lamb and beautifully prepared sea bass. Seasonal dishes use local produce and there are also lovely rooms. The pub is great to visit after a long walk (I really recommendCors Caron nature reservewith its peat bogs, ponds and walkways). It’s a dog-friendly place with beers from breweries like Wye Valley, Mantle and Purple Moose.Maisie BaynhamProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Building a bold new contemporary home directly on the British coastline is a tall order. Aside from the logistics of designing a house that functions successfully in such an unforgiving setting, planning permission is likely to make it a nonstarter. But on the shore of Loch Long on the Rosneath peninsula, 40 miles north-west of Glasgow, John MacKinnon and his wife Laura found a way to make it work for their house, Rock Cove. While the area is wild and ruggedly beautiful, its history has long been intertwined with the military and was once a brownfield site, home to disused Ministry of Defence huts and garages, overgrown and strewn with rubble.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Back in 2008, MacKinnon had bought a property on the same site, a 1940s cottage that had been repurposed as a navy signalling station. MacKinnon has a deep-seated passion for design, and worked closely with architect Stuart Cameron of Cameron Webster to completely reimagine this humble property as a modernist beach house, Cape Cove. He then began contemplating what could be done with the scruffy space alongside his new home.View image in fullscreenThe spectacular dining and living space features floor-to-ceiling windows.Photograph: David BarbourThe brief was for a house that made the most of the incredible setting and views by maximising the living space“Having worked with Stuart before, it was easy for us to progress. We had countless conversations around how we could create a house there, making something out of an eyesore, without impinging on Cape Cove’s space or views. To make the most of a relatively small space, we started thinking about a house that juts out over the rocks below.” The brief MacKinnon provided was for a house that made the most of the incredible views by maximising the living space, as well as somewhere that would be future-proofed for the couple’s eventual retirement: on one level, step-free and easy to maintain.Influences included the low-slung desert modernist architecture of California’s Palm Springs; the houses of Frank Lloyd Wright, especially the iconic Fallingwater in Pennsylvania; and Vandamm House, one of the sets from Hitchcock’s classic thriller North By Northwest, which was itself inspired by Fallingwater. “It’s about the clean lines and the connection to nature, through both the materials and the walls of glass,” says MacKinnon.View image in fullscreenAt 2 metres wide, the corridor also serves as an entertainment space.Photograph: David BarbourThe resultant building is simple yet completely arresting: a low-slung box cantilevered out over the rocks below. It’s no surprise that it has bagged several architectural awards.For those with a fantasy housebuild on their mind, Cameron has some advice: “Talk to the local planning department. Have any highly contemporary houses been approved in the last few years? Ask for their recommendations for architects. You could pay a small fee to two or three architects to come up with a basic design. Look for an architect who asks ‘what if?’, pushing the vision forward.”As with any design, there were trade-offs – the generous kitchen-dining-living space comes at the expense of the more modestly proportioned four en suite bedrooms, each of which opens on to the terrace that runs along one side of the house. The other side is windowless, providing privacy for both Cape Cove and Rock Cove.View image in fullscreenThe house looks over Loch Long.Photograph: David BarbourWith the front door necessarily located at the opposite end of the house to the cantilevered living area, a bold decision was taken to make the corridor into a room in its own right, a generous 2 metres wide. “It’s a great space to put tables during parties and John wanted somewhere to display his collection of Aboriginal art,” says Cameron.To cope with the sometimes extreme weather conditions, the floor-to-ceiling windows are triple-glazedIn line with the building’s modernist influences, the materials – such as wood and stone – are reusable and provide a close-to-nature feel. To cope with the sometimes extreme weather conditions, the floor-to-ceiling windows are triple-glazed, while the doors drop down on to seals when closed to keep the howling wind at bay. The exterior was wrapped in Kebony, a robust timber product, which has since weathered down to a pleasing silvery finish.View image in fullscreenAll four en suite bedrooms open on to a terrace running along one side of the house.Photograph: David BarbourIn a space this pristine, pieces such as the vast modular Ikea Söderhamn sofa pass as designer items. “It’s a great design and easy to buy replacement covers so, again, future-proof.” Similarly, the kitchen is a standard Howdens’ design, elevated by ultra-tough Dekton by Cosentino worktops. “Again, we’re thinking of durability, for our retirement, and also because we let out the house for holidays.”Life here has proved to be as satisfying as the couple anticipated. “We’re quite social creatures and like to fill the house with family and friends. But it’s nice to enjoy the place in solitude, to sit and watch the ever- changing weather,” MacKinnon says.Rock Cove can be rented throughholidaycottages.co.ukExplore more on these topicsInteriorsArchitectureHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Somewhere, possibly in the cellar or maybe the shed, there is a brown paper bag of bulbs I lifted from the old garden. Traditionally, I plant them in December – partly because life is always too busy, but also because as well as being cool, London autumns are increasingly wet, so that this helps stave off rot.There’s something enticing about a second-year tulip. Anyone after big, blousy show-stoppers will replace their bulbs every year, and come April I will dutifully like their Instagram posts. But with my garden currently a wasteland, it feels almost perverse to insert the opulence of brand-new botanical tulips – like putting a wedding hat on when you’re in your PJs. Should I find my bag of older bulbs, anything they offer up will be a little more muted, but, crucially, free.With my garden a wasteland, planting brand-new bulbs would be like wearing a wedding hat with PJsI’m increasingly leaning towards wild, or species, tulips. Smaller, with petals that end in pinches rather than a fulsome bloom, these bulbs pack less obvious punch but offer long-term benefits, naturalising and self-seeding far better than their one-hit-wonder cousins and jostling politely with other spring growth for a more meadowy look.Species tulips hail from the cool, rocky outcrops of mountain ranges of south-west Europe and central Asia, so they do particularly well with good drainage and are perfect for gravel gardens, rock gardens, free-draining soil, or – if, like me, you’re lumped, quite literally, with clay – in containers with a good deal of sand and grit mixed in.My gateway drug into species tulips wasTulipa saxatilis, which greets the spring sunshine by splaying its petals, showcasing a yolky middle beneath candy-lilac petals. If it were a full-blown botanical tulip, it would undoubtedly be too much, but nestled among substrate or pot-covering gravel, it is jewel-like and joyful.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

What does her story tell us about how Britain has changed?Zoe WilliamsFri 24 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 00.02 EDTShareIf the sitting Marquess of Londonderry died tomorrow, and in so doing bestowed a ladyhood on his 15-year-old granddaughter, would you ever know? Would you be able to find the great houses of Britain on a map, and connect them to their owners? It wouldn’t be true to say that the press has stopped covering the aristocracy, since the Telegraph diligently covers the great estates, but the discussion now comes framed by the idea of meritocracy, which is objectively pretty ridiculous. So the Hon Nick Howard told the Telegraph a fortnight ago, “If my son wants to take over [Castle Howard], he’ll have to pass an interview,” while other great estate owners stress their role as rewilders, ecowarriors or, at their most traditional, conservationists. These days, if you’re proud of heritage simply because you own it, you’re expected to keep quiet about it.Lady Annabel Goldsmith, who died at home on Saturday at 91, lived through an era, by contrast, in which aristocracy and wealth were extremely public. And she was its emblem, displaying a different facet in every decade.View image in fullscreen‘Elizabethan debutante’ … Annabel Goldsmith in 1952, when she was Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart.Photograph: Chronicle/AlamyAt the end of the 1940s, when she was 15, she became a lady when her grandfather died, and, believe me, everyone knew about it. When she had her coming-out ball in the 1950s, a young Queen Elizabeth attended, since the whole point was to be presented to the queen – it was social death for a debutante if she wasn’t.In the 1960s, she lent her name to Annabel’s, the nightclub set up by her first husband, Mark Birley, for poshos in London’s Berkeley Square. And in the 1970s, she was thought to have inspired the memorable and quintessentially aristo phrase: “When you marry your mistress, you create a job vacancy.” That was and still is attributed to the financier James Goldsmith, upon his marriage to Annabel, who had been his long-term mistress. In fact, he was quoting Sacha Guitry, the five-times-married French film-maker.Well into the 1970s, the aristocracy still had great cachet, and Annabel’s, the club, drew in a remarkable international A-list – Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Teddy Kennedy, David Hockney, Muhammad Ali. It’s not a given that anyone went there because they wanted to hang out with Princess Margaret and Prince Charles (as was). But certainly today, if you were, say, the singer Gracie Abrams, touching down in Heathrow and asking an underling where was the coolest place to hang out, they would not say, “So-and-so’s is cool because Prince William goes there.” And non-royal blue bloods wouldn’t even have the name recognition to be considered and then rejected.View image in fullscreenAt home with her children Zac, Ben and Jemima, 1985.Photograph: David Crump/ANL/ShutterstockAnnabel Goldsmith lived in this bizarre panopticon, where details of her personal life at its most personal seemed to be transmitted to the world in real time, whether lauded on the pages of Tatler or lampooned in Private Eye. It was during James Goldsmith’s criminal libel case against Private Eye in 1976 that he and Annabel first appeared in public, but their affair had been public knowledge for ages. They already had two children, for Pete’s sake. These libels were extensive, including that he’d helped Lord Lucan to disappear – but the press interest in James and Annabel boiled down to: anything they said, and anything they did. (In the end, James Goldsmith settled for an apology from Private Eye, which was a climbdown he later regretted, considering he originally wanted to see the editor in jail.)The world was always in her business, long before she wrote two memoirs, Annabel: an Unconventional Life in 2004 and No Invitation Required in 2009. She responded to the gossip with arch homilies on the subject of fidelity. In the 1980s, she thought it was for wimps – so long as your husband came home at the end of the day, who cared what he did in the middle? She said much later that she regretted not being a “one-man woman”, but it’s impossible to nail down which man she meant.View image in fullscreenSurrogate mother … with Princess Diana in London, 1989.Photograph: ShutterstockIn the 1980s, Annabel Goldsmith was mainly being a mother – the job she would later say she was “incredible” at. And even though the first crop were pretty well grown by then (Rupert, her first, was born in 1955, then Robin in 1958 and India Jane in 1961), the children she’d had with James – Jemima, Zac and Ben (born 1974, 1975 and 1980, when Annabel was 46) were only small. Rupert disappeared off the West African coast at the age of 30, presumed drowned.James Goldsmith had by then, perhaps inevitably, moved to New York with his next mistress, Laure Boulay de la Meurthe. He and Annabel remained married until his death in 1997.The semi-public openness about affairs of the heart back then – which slid into total openness if the participants were important enough – always felt like a way of signalling that aristos were operating to a higher moral code than middle-class respectability; that whatever rules we might try to codify, society and the economy were ordered and inherited via the caprice of our betters, which couldn’t be governed and democratised. Which doesn’t mean it was all fun, games and superiority: some absolutely dreadful things happened to Annabel Goldsmith, beyond the drowning of her firstborn. Her second son was mauled by a tiger when he was 12, and was left with life-changing facial injuries, in a private zoo incident for which she forever blamed herself (biographers always mention that the tiger was pregnant, as if to say, “Otherwise we all would have got along fine”).View image in fullscreenCampaigning for the Referendum Party with husband James and son Ben, 1997.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyIn the 1990s, Annabel was known as Princess Diana’s confidante or surrogate mother; she testified much later at Diana’s inquest. It was Annabel who knew that Diana hadn’t died in love with Dodi Fayed or pregnant with his child, saying she needed a new husband “like I need a rash on my face”. The phrase was absolutely typical of Diana, Annabel told the court, and it’s certainly idiosyncratic, analogising the nuisance of a spouse to a mild but public disfigurement.In the 2000s, she was president of the Democracy Movement, which dropped half a million quid in 2001 leafleting and making a general noise about the incursions of Brussels into British sovereignty. She said that year: “I’m not anti-European – my husband was half-European and my children are a quarter French.” This theme would become very familiar over the next two decades: you don’t want your own kids to lose their freedom of movement – you just want to end it for everyone else. But it rang no alarm bells back then, because Goldsmith seemed to be animated by the memory of her late husband more than by any particular desire for a constitutional crisis or for Britain to be permanently poorer. “I just don’t want to be governed by Brussels, and I don’t think people want to give up their sovereignty.”By the 2010s, as she moved towards her 80s, Annabel Goldsmith had plentiful grandchildren. Her kids with Goldsmith married young and bred fast, while her kids with Birley did the opposite, she once said, which had the happy result that her 14 grandchildren were closer in age than you’d think, even if that did make her sound like she was running a kennels. She loved dogs, by the way, and kept Norfolk terriers and grand basset griffon vendéens.View image in fullscreenSign of the times … the nameplate for Annabel’s nightclub.Photograph: Paul Fievez/ANL/ShutterstockThe structure of wealth has changed and globalised over the past century in ways we can discuss another day, but the distribution of land in the UK, from which a lot of the wealth and power can be inferred, has not altered as much as you’d think. About 25,000 landowners own half the country. In Guy Shrubsole’s 2019 book Who Owns England? he writes that30% of land in England is owned by aristocrats and the landed gentry. Approximately 17% of England and Wales remains undeclared at the Land Registry, and may also belong to the aristocracy; it probably consists of estates that have not changed hands in several hundred years.But what is different is the cultural footprint. The display-case living of the postwar gentry and aristocracy relied on the kind of formulas celebrities have today: dates in the calendar; events that included everyone who was anyone; places from which the unwashed were certainly excluded, but that they were implicitly invited to observe. The scrapping of the debutantes’ presentation to the queen in 1958 was a huge moment in the decline of this visibility, and seems to have been a querulous response to the growing expectations of egalitarianism, at least as a principle. Princess Margaret famously said: “We had to put a stop to it. Every tart in London was getting in.” In reality, the royals and the cadre directly beneath them were just trying to complete the logically impossible task of remaining innately superior while adapting to the fashion, which was that innate superiority was no longer a thing. No real attempt was ever made to reconcile these two positions – the contradiction was resolved by the upper classes just going quiet, like a dog hiding under a duvet.Annabel Goldsmith lived through the last of that visibility. And while her death is not the moment to wonder what combination of class self-consciousness and outside scrutiny caused the aristocracy to go underground, it should be noted that, while it was still very much overground, she was the face and spirit of the whole scene.Explore more on these topicsAristocracyMonarchyDiana, Princess of WalesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That prospect has provoked anger and disbelief among his opponents, leading to unrest across several regions.Biya, who has been in power since 1982 and is president of the rulingCameroonPeople’s Democratic Movement (CPDM), is the world’s longest-ruling head of state.In a statement released earlier this week, Clément Atangana, head of the Constitutional Council, confirmed the official results would be published on 27 October. The council has already dismissed 10 petitions alleging electoral malpractice, including several filed by opposition parties, in decisions that have only deepened public distrust in the process.Issa Tchiroma Bakary a former long-time Biya ally turned foe who leads the Cameroon National Salvation Front,declared himself the winner earlier this week, claiming to have secured 54.8% of the vote against Biya’s 31.3%.Tchiroma said the Constitutional Council would be “complicit in a breach of trust” if it upheld results that he said had been manipulated. “The vast majority of the Cameroonian people will never accept that the council validates the historic scale of ballot stuffing and falsification,” he said.Biya’s ruling party has denounced Tchiroma’s victory claim as “a grotesque hoax” and an “unacceptable fraud in a state of law”, saying in a statement it was “calmly awaiting the official results”.The world’s oldest president is running again: can anyone stop him from winning?Read moreProtesters clashed with security officers who threw teargas canisters on Wednesday in Tchiroma’s hometown of Garoua, in the north. At least two people were killed, including a teacher who died after stray bullets hit her. There were also demonstrations in the capital, Yaoundé, where crowds who gathered in key administrative areas were quickly dispersed by security forces.In the city of Maroua, in the Far North region, one of Cameroon’s poorest and Tchiroma’s political stronghold, the anger has taken on a deeply personal tone. Outside the office of the regional governor, a group of young people left a handwritten letter expressing desperation over poverty and political exclusion.“The young people of Maroua are writing to you today to inform you that we are fed up with this country because the Far North region is the poorest region,” it read. “All the citizens voted for Issa [Tchiroma], but the government wants to rig it. It’s better to go join Boko Haram in Sambisa [in Nigeria near the border with Cameroon] than to stay for another seven years. If you let us go, you and the CPDM activists will pay with blood in Maroua.”Authorities have moved quickly to try to quash dissent. In a televised address, the minister of territorial administration, Paul Atanga Nji, said more than 20 people detained during the protests would face trial before a military tribunal.“They face serious charges, including incitement to rebellion and insurrection,” he announced, warning that the government would not tolerate actions that threatened public order.There were reports of internet restrictions in the commercial capital of Douala and other parts of the country on Wednesday and Thursday, confirmed by the internet monitor NetBlocks. Camtel, the state operator, blamed connectivity disruptions on “a technical incident involving Wacs cable” and said service was gradually being restored in “certain areas”.The respected National Episcopal Conference of Cameroon hascalled for calm. “It is our prayer that, with the help of God and the commitment of all, our country will experience peace and stability in truth and will emerge stronger,” Andrew Fuanya Nkea, the archbishop of Bamenda and president of the NECC, said on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsCameroonAfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, the people of eastAfricaface an increasingly perilous situation while BAE prioritise their own commercial interests.”Between March 2023 and last month, EnComm Aviation’s aircraft delivered 18,677 tonnes of aid to Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Chad.The WFP estimatesthat one tonne of food – usually cereals, pulses and oil – can meet the daily needs of about 1,660 people.BAE’s ATP was considered ideal for humanitarian missions because it could operate on the shorter airstrips that are common in remote locations. Each aircraft could carry apayload of 8.2 tonnes (18,077lb).A pre-action letter sent by lawyers acting for EnComm to BAE Systems, dated 13 October 2025, says that, since the decision, its 12 aid aircraft “cannot be operated” and are now “worthless for their intended purpose”.The letter references emails and meetings between BAE’s senior leadership and EnComm Aviation that the Nairobi-based firm claims shows that it was led to believe BAE would provide continued support for its ATP for at least five years.View image in fullscreenDisplaced people wait for aid at a camp in Somalia, where 4.6m people are facing crisis levels of hunger and 1.8m children under five are acutely malnourished.Photograph: Gary Calton/ObserverSent by the London lawyers White & Case, the correspondence adds that the decision was taken “without any consultation with or formal notice to EnComm”.A BAE Systems spokesperson said: “We do not comment on potential litigation.”Correspondence from BAE Systems, meanwhile, shows that its decision to withdraw the airworthiness certificate for the ATP is “permanent and irreversible”.A letter from the defence firm’s head of regional aircraft programmes, dated 27 May 2025, said the firm intended to inform the UK Civil Aviation Authority it wanted to “start the process to voluntarily surrender the aircraft type certificate for the BAE ATP. The objective being to complete this activity by December 2026.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is now seeking £187m in losses and damages claiming “negligent misrepresentation and misstatement” by BAE.Analysts expect BAE system’s profits to increase further this year as it benefits from increased military spending globally amid growing instability.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

That would clear the way for US special operations or drones to destroy land-based targets, current and former officials said.The expanded naval presence “will bolster US capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States homeland and our security in the western hemisphere”, a Pentagon spokesperson, Sean Parnell, said in a statement.From Caracas, Nicolás Maduro slammed the enhanced US military presence. “They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war,” the Venezuelan president told state media later on Friday.For weeks, the Trump administration has been eyeing escalating its campaign against the drug cartels – as well as its effort to destabilize the Venezuelan president’s government – after an initial campaign of strikes on at least nine alleged drug-trafficking boats.Donald Trumpalso confirmed to reporters at the White House on Thursday that the next stage of his military campaign was to hit targets on the ground. “The land is going to be next,” Trump said. “The land drugs are much more dangerous for them. It’s going to be much more dangerous. You’ll be seeing that soon.”Trump did not discuss which targets in which countries the US intended to strike. But he directed the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who was seated beside him at the White House event about curbing the flow of illegal drugs into the US, to notify Congress about the administration’s plans.Asked whether he would declare war against the cartels, Trump suggested he would continue with individual strikes. “I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK?” he said. “We’re going to kill them, you know they’re going to be, like, dead.”Trump announced what appears to have been the first strike on a boat on 3 September, releasing a brief video of the attack. In the weeks that followed, the administration announced more strikes without disclosing details other than the number of people killed and the claim that the boats had carried drugs.Since the start of the military campaign, the administration has provided a dubious legal justification for the strikes, claiming the boats are affiliated with “designated terrorist organisations”, or DTOs, with which the US was now in a “non-international armed conflict”, the Guardian has reported.The administration has nevertheless provided no concrete evidence to date that those killed in the boat strikes were smuggling drugs to the US. In briefings to Congress, Pentagon officials in essence said the boats were legitimate targets because Trump had designated them as assets of cartels seen to be DTOs, people familiar with the matter said.The military campaign has also drawn in the Central Intelligence Agency. Trump confirmed on 15 October that he hadauthorized so-called “covert action”by the CIA in Venezuela. The Guardian has reported that the CIA has been providing a bulk of the intelligence used in the airstrikes.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together,” Fordwrote on Xalongside the Reagan video. “God bless Canada and God bless the United States.”Ford said the ad will run during the first game of the World Series, but, after speaking with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, Ford announced the campaign will end Monday.“Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,” Ford said. “We’ve achieved our goal, having reached US audiences at the highest levels.”The quick breakdown in relationships apparently stems from a one-minute television advertisement featuring Reagan’s radio address declaring that “trade barriers hurt every American worker”.Trumprespondedon Truth Social without evidence that Canada had somehow run a “fraudulent” and “fake” advertisement, and announced that “all trade negotiations with Canada are hereby terminated”.Rubio, the secretary of state,told reporterson Friday that Ford had aired commercials in the US which “took President Reagan’s words out of context”, adding that the Reagan Foundation had criticized the effort, too. “The President made his announcement that he suspended any trade talks with Canada for now,” Rubio said.The Reagan Foundation said on Thursday that the Ontario government’s advertisement “misrepresents” Reagan’s address, without elaborating how. It added that officials “did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks” and added that the organization was reviewing its legal options.Trump says all Canada trade talks ‘terminated’ over ad criticising tariffsRead moreIt also encouraged people to watch the video of Reagan’s speech on its YouTube channel.Ford’s office responded by reposting the longer, five-minute excerpt, andsaidthat the commercial uses “an unedited excerpt from one of Reagan’s public addresses, which is available through public domain”.Democratic lawmakers on the House ways and means committee jumped in to defend the Ontario advertisement. “This is the ad that drove Trump to cancel all trade talks with Canada,” the committeeposted on social media. “Unlike Trump’s AI slop, this is real and uses Reagan’s own words on tariffs.”The dispute comes as both countries face critical deadlines in the next few weeks. Next week marksthe cutoff for public commentson the scheduled review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which faces its mandatory six-year assessment in July 2026. The following day, 4 November, Carney, willdeliver a federal budgetexpected to focus on reducing reliance on US markets.Then on 5 November the US supreme court will hear constitutional challenges to Trump’s authority toimpose tariffsunder emergency powers. A federal appeals court ruled in August that such sweeping duties exceed presidential authority, potentially undermining the legal foundation for the 35% tariffs now applied to Canadian steel, aluminum, timber and automobiles.Chris Sands, the director of the Center for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, suggested the collapse in talks simply formalizes a dead-end process.“Can we stop trade talks? Yes, you can stop talks about steel, aluminum, energy, all of it,” he said.“But there was no evidence we were going anywhere anyway.”Sands noted the irony of Trump citing Reagan while reversing his trade legacy. “Reagan loved the country – he loved free trade. MaybeDonald Trumpbelieves that, but it’s not what he’s selling now.”Washington imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian imports this spring, prompting retaliation from Ottawa before Trump raised duties to 35% in August. Ontario, heavily dependent on cross-border manufacturing and automotive trade, has been particularly affected. The breakdown ultimately leaves Carney navigating domestic pressure with a minority government.“Carney’s trying to keep all the provinces together,” Sands said. “He’s walking a tightrope between angry Canadians, an angry Trump, and premiers who are going off-script.”Before departing for Asia on Friday morning, Carney acknowledged the changed reality. “We can’t control the trade policy of the United States,” he told reporters, noting that US policy had fundamentally shifted from previous decades.But he emphasized Canada’s readiness to resume detailed negotiations on steel, aluminum and energy sectors, “when the Americans are ready to have those discussions, because it will be for the benefit of workers in the United States, workers inCanadaand families in both of our countries.”For now, Carney said, Canada will focus on what it can control: building at home and “developing new partnerships and opportunities, including with the economic giants of Asia”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCanadaDonald TrumpTrump tariffsEconomic policyUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump later posted on Truth Social that “Canada cheated and got caught”. He claimed the ad was an attempt to influence the US supreme court hearings on the legality of his global tariffs,which begin on 5 November.Washington originallyimposed a 25% tariffon imports of Canadian goods including timber, steel, aluminum and cars in the spring, prompting retaliatory action from Ottawa. The rate wasraised to 35% by Trumpin August.Ontario has been particularly badly hit by the escalating trade war, and the province’s premier, Doug Ford, has been one of the most vocal critics of the US border taxes.Ford launched the province’s new advertising campaign featuring Reagan’s comments earlier in October. He said at the time in apost on Instagram: “Using every tool we have, we’ll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

And sometimes, for a short while it works, but only for a short time.“But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.”The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute, a non-profit organisation that works to advance his legacy and principles,wrote in a post on Xthat Ontario did not seek or receive permission to include the clips.The foundation said in a statement that the advert used “selective audio and video” and “misrepresents” Reagan’s comments. It said it was “reviewing its legal options”. Trump cited the foundation’s criticism in his Truth Social post.Fordwrote on Xon Friday: “Canada and the United States are friends, neighbours and allies. President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together.”Canada’s prime minister,Mark Carney, has said he was “disappointed” by Trump’s decision to raise the level of tariffs in August. The two leaders met earlier this month in an attempt to ease tensions over trade, and to prepare for a review of the US-Mexico-Canada agreement, a trade deal Trump negotiated in his first term but has since soured on.More than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the US, and almost C$3.6bn (£1.9bn) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump is due to have the first meeting in his second term with China’s president, Xi Jinping, at the end of the month in South Korea.Reagan’s 1987 speech was a defence of free but fair trade in which he explained his decision to put duties on Japanese goods in a trade dispute.In the full five-minute statement the then president said he had been “loth to take” the decision to put tariffs on Japan but had been forced to do so to hold it to its “trade agreement with us on electronic devices called semiconductors”.Reagan then gives a lengthy warning of the dangers of trade protectionism, describing how it contributed to the misery of the Great Depression in the 1930s.“High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,” he said. “Then the worst happens: markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpCanadaMark CarneyUS foreign policyAmericasTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Temu said it had launched an investigation to ensure it complies with safety requirements in New Zealand.Doctors said the pressure of the magnets had caused necrosis – tissue death – in four areas of the boy’s small bowel and caecum, which is part of the large intestine. Surgeons operated to remove the dead tissue and retrieve the magnets and the child was able to return home after eight days in hospital.“This case highlights not only the dangers of magnet ingestion but also the dangers of the online marketplace for our paediatric population,” said the authors of the paper, Binura Lekamalage, Lucinda Duncan-Were and Nicola Davis.Surgery for ingestion of magnets can lead to complications later in life such as bowel obstruction, abdominal hernia and chronic pain, they said.‘A perfect coincidence’: rare red lightning captured in New Zealand skiesRead moreTemu said it was sorry to learn of the boy’s surgery. “We have launched an internal review and reached out to the authors of the New Zealand Medical Journal article to obtain more details about the case,” a spokesperson said in a statement.“At this stage, we have not been able to confirm whether the magnets involved were purchased through Temu or identify the specific product listing. Nonetheless, our teams are reviewing relevant listings to ensure full compliance with local safety requirements.”TheChinese-founded e-commerce companyhas come under criticism in markets including the EU for allegedly not doing enough to rid illegal products from its platform.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandHealthAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The rejection was not without precedence – the former Morrison government alsorejected a freedom of information requestby Guardian Australia for the letters in 2021.The Department blocked the release of 23 letters in full, stating that 21 are “cabinet documents”, six are “documents affecting national security, defence or international relations”, all are part of “deliberative processes”, and all could reveal “certain operations of agencies”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailGeoffrey Watson, a former counsel assisting the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption who is now with the Centre for Public Integrity, said the latest refusal showed the government is “obsessed” with secrecy, and disputed the argument that the letters could be considered cabinet documents.“I think the assertion that all those categories would apply to these kinds of documents is bizarre. Even the general assertion that they [are] cabinet documents , they’re plainly not,” he said.“These are actually instructions issued to [a] particular minister as to what areas they need to focus on or to comment upon as part of a fair ministerial role … That’s actually just to do with the prime minister’s office allocating who does what and speaks on which issue that’s on part of cabinet. It’s not a cabinet document merely because it comes out of the office of somebody who is a member of cabinet.”Controversial FoI changes sparked after staff complained getting emails every 5 minutes may ‘jam something’Read moreWatson said on issues around national security and defence, the answer would be to “redact, not to withhold the entire document”.“Sounds like it’s really just another example of what appears to be an obsession with this government regarding secrecy.”No Australian prime minister has released the charter letters, but other jurisdictions nationally and internationally have been more transparent.The Queensland state government publishes each of its ministers’ charter letters, the EU commission releases mission letters for its commissioners, and Canada has also published its mandate letters to ministers outlining their responsibilities.In response to questions from Guardian Australia, a spokesperson for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet said it was “not appropriate to comment on specific matters”.“PM&C takes its legislative obligations seriously and processes all requests in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 1982,” they said. “All applicants are provided with reasons for decisions and advice on their review rights.”The Labor government has been under fire over its proposed amendments to the freedom of information act, which would widen cabinet document exemptions and widen exemptions for deliberative processes. This would make it even easier for FoI officers to refuse the release of a document on those grounds.Labor arguments for the reforms included claims AI bots were generating FoI requests, but a 17 October Senate committee hearing on the legislation was told the Home Affairs department and Services Australia had no evidence of AI bots making FoI requests.They noted the FoI act already ensures FoI requests made by bots do not have to be considered.After her request, Kovacic accused the government of presiding over a culture of secrecy.“From a massive spike in FoI refusals, to the weaponisation of NDA’s in stakeholder negotiations, and a secret manual telling government officials how to avoid answering questions at Senate estimates, this government has shown that the promise of transparency was nothing more than a pre-election talking point,” she said. Kovacic joined parliament in 2023, after the Morrison government.Explore more on these topicsFreedom of informationAustralian politicsLabor partyLiberal partynewsShareReuse this content"

The Israeli arms company won a $917m contract to build the system early last year.While the defence department argues the system is necessary to protect soldiers, the contract with Elbit Systems has been strongly criticised by the Australian human rights expert Chris Sidoti, who was a member of the UNcommission of inquiry.“Elbit is a key supplier of the Israeli military, a key enabler of the Israel Defense Forces in its commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza over the last two years,” Sidoti said.“No Australian company should be dealing with Elbit and certainly no part of the Australian government should be dealing with Elbit.”Elbit Systems has described itself as the “backbone” of the Israeli Defense Force’s (IDF) drone fleet, which has been used extensively in the assault on Gaza.Albanese urged to end ‘double standard’ on Israel after UN commission finds genocide occurring in GazaRead moreProf Donald Rothwell, an expert in international law at the Australian National University, said Israeli defence companies like Elbit Systems were “directly implicated in Israel’s alleged acts of genocide in Gaza”.“As such, Australia should not be engaged in any trade that supports that type of activity,” Rothwell said.Rothwell said Australia was bound by the genocide convention to not supply arms to Israel, but may be legally permitted to buy them from an Israeli company.“This one-way arms trade from Israel to Australia does not fall within the ambit of the genocide convention [or] the ICJ’s 2024 provisional measures orders,” Rothwell said. “However, it remains morally questionable given this arms trade supports the Israeli military industrial complex.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailSidoti, who is also a former Australian human rights commissioner, said “buying any goods or technology from Elbit finances its research and development of further, more sophisticated means of committing war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide”.“It is a violation of Australia’s international obligations to prevent genocide, to ensure respect for international humanitarian law and not to aid or assist the continuation of Israel’s unlawful activities in any way.“It is not simply a matter of not providing arms and munitions to Israel. Australia must not have any commercial dealings with Elbit whatsoever.”A defence spokesperson said the government was unable to ask another weapons company to supply the iron fist munitions as there were only produced by Elbit Systems.“Australia is not making weapons or ammunition in this country and supplying them to Israel,” the defence spokesperson said.Lara Khider, the acting executive director of the Australian Centre for International Justice, said the government’s contracts with Elbit Systems were a “clear violation of its obligations to prevent genocide”.“The interpretation of the obligation to prevent should not be so shallow as to only cover the transfer of arms,” Khider said.Fact check: is Australia exporting weapons to Israel?Read moreDr Juliette McIntyre, a specialist in international courts at the University of South Australia, said Australia had an obligation to not provide aid or assistance that would continue Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories.“Economic relations that support the ongoing occupation must end,” McIntyre said.“Moreover, trading arms with a state that is accused by multiple agencies of committing war crimes and genocide erodes the credibility of the rules-based international order, and signals a troubling acceptance from Australia regarding Israel’s conduct.”The prime minister and senior government ministers have repeatedly condemned Israel’s conduct in Gaza. In May, Anthony Albanese described the blockade of aidinto Gaza as “an outrage”. Last month, he formally recognised the state of Palestine.Greens senator David Shoebridge said international law was “crystal clear” and that “all countries must stop the two-way arms trade with Israel due to the genocide in Gaza”.Elbit Systems was contacted for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The next year, prices began to fall.The city’s median house price is still $10,000 lower than it was at its peak,data released by Domainon Thursday showed.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailWhile investors sayVictoriais a warning to other states, the pricing slowdown has helped more owner-occupiers enter the market.With more listings and less competition from property speculators helping to make the city more affordable, should the rest of Australia follow suit?First home buyers get a foot in the doorMelbourne was overtaken first by Canberra and later by Brisbane, where house prices rose nearly $400,000 in the past four years. At $1.083m, a median-priced house in Melbourne is now just $40,000 more expensive than in Adelaide, according to Domain data.Pricing grapheAustralia has on average seen soaring property investor activity and slumping first home buyer loans as higher prices and rising interest rates made mortgages less affordable for typical workers as theycompete with investors.But in Victoria first home buyers account for a growing share of home loans while investor activity has been slow to rise, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows.The state has seen the proportion of first-time buyers inch up in recent years, now accounting for nearly three in 10 home loans, while nationally the number declined.Graph of proportion of investors vs first home buyersThe rise came as the Victorian government introducedextra land taxfor investors, amounting to about $1,300 a year for a property worth $650,000. Alevy on platforms such as Airbnband expandedtaxes on vacant properties and landcame soon after.The land tax was explicitly aimed at boosting budget revenues, as Victoria’s debtcontinued to balloon, but the vacancy levy aimed to bring more homes to market.Property investment subsequently declined in Victoria relative to the rest of the country as landlords exited the market at growing rates, according to experimental data from Cotality.Fewer landlords has meant declining rental stock, down from 678,000 in September 2023 to 655,000 in March, with all the losses hitting metropolitan Victoria, according to state active bond data.‘Repeatedly outbid’: readers share stories of housing despair as Australia’s prices reach record highs againRead moreTim Graham, a board member of the Property Investors Council of Australia says this should be “a warning to other states that if you want to discourage investment and have less rental properties, you’re going to have a much bigger rental crisis on your hands”.Yet investor exit from Victoria to other states has coincided with relatively slower rental price growth, up 33% since the start of 2021 compared to 40% or more in the other major capitals.Graph of rent costs in each citySaul Eslake, an independent economist, claims Melbourne’s experience as vindication for the argument against offering lighter tax treatment for property investments.“This Victorian experience shows that removing tax breaks for property investors may well [reduce] investment [but] that is not necessarily a bad thing,” he said.Melbourne’s rise in the housing affordability rankings “should be celebrated rather than bewailed”, Eslake says.Building more homesMelbourne’s affordability has also been helped by consistently stronger supply growth.The Grattan Institute’s Brendan Coates argues cheaper and easier development has contributed more to Melbourne’s success than state limits on landlords.“Melbourne’s got some of the most affordable housing in the country now ... And that is in large part a success of building more homes,” he says.Victoria has consistently built at least 55,000 homes each year for a decade, while other states have struggled.Dwelling completions by state, year to JuneThe Victorian treasurer, Jaclyn Symes, says the government is aiming to further fuel housing development by “reforming planning, unlocking land for homes, and building a decade-long pipeline of new supply”.More construction has meant more homes on the market in Melbourne, keeping property listings higher in a year where they’ve declined in other cities, according toSQM data.An exception is Canberra, where above-average home building up to 2023 has led to a similar rise in the number of properties for sale, restraining price growth.Will greater affordability be short lived?Lower prices are gradually starting to work against Melbourne’s affordability. Property investorsurveyssuggest investors are buying back in, chasing bargain deals compared with hotter markets elsewhere.Projects have become less profitable, meaning building approvals declined in the year to June in Victoria while rising 32% in NSW and more than 10% in South Australia and Queensland.Falling interest rates and rising incomes will also help more investors and owner-occupiers push up prices around the country, according to Cotality’s head of research, Eliza Owen.Victoria’s heavier taxes on investors, though, could restrain the market from accelerating at its 2010s pace, Owen says.“Reducing that investor participation could help to maintain a lower level of price growth across Victoria, so long as it’s coupled with the right supply side responses,” she says.“For all of the negative attention that additional taxes and charges have drawn from the investor community, there’s clearly an upside here.”Explore more on these topicsHousingVictorianewsShareReuse this content"

Violations of its airspace are a sensitive issue after a number of suspected Russian drones crossed into its territory from Belarus in July, including one carrying explosives.Explore more on these topicsLithuaniaEuropeBelarusRussiaAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

Starving, cold, exhausted and struggling with sickness, an estimated 300,000 soldiers died.Researchers now say they have identified two unexpected diseases among soldiers who died in the retreat – paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever – which provide fresh insights into their plight.“I think that the key thing of why [the retreat] was such a failure was the cold and the hunger and so on. With or without infectious diseases, they would have died massively anyway,” said Nicolás Rascovan, the head of the microbial paleogenomics unit at the Institut Pasteur and an author of the study.“But I think what this [does] change is some of our knowledge of all the infectious diseases.”Writing in the journal Current Biology, Rascovan and his colleagues describe how previous analyses of DNA from soldiers buried in the same mass grave in Vilnius, Lithuania, had revealed evidence of typhus and trench fever.However, that work was based on a very sensitive technique, called nested PCR, which involved screening samples for particular pathogens.Using a different technique, called shotgun sequencing, Rascovan’s team was able to look for fragments of DNA that matched any out of 185 bacteria known to cause disease in humans.The results, based on DNA from the teeth of 13 soldiers who had not previously been studied, revealed one soldier had been infected with the louse-borne bacteriumBorrelia recurrentis, which causes relapsing fever, and four others had been infected with a type of the bacteriumSalmonella enterica, which causes paratyphoid fever, a disease spread by contaminated food or water. One of these four soldiers might also have had relapsing fever, the team said.The researchers say the findings fit with historical descriptions of the symptoms experienced by soldiers of Napoleon’sGrand Armée, such as fever and diarrhoea.Unlike the previous studies, however, the team found no traces of the bacteria that cause typhus or trench fever.Friedrich Engels ‘took creative liberties’ with descriptions of class divides in ManchesterRead moreWhile Rascovan noted it could be that these soldiers were not infected with those diseases, or had only a mild infection, the results could alternatively be explained by the breakdown of ancient DNA over time, or that the quantity of DNA present was below the detection limit of the technique used.The researchers carried out a number of statistical tests and analyses to ensure their results were robust and pointed to genuine infections.These included looking for the signs of DNA degradation that would be expected from authentic ancient DNA, and exploring where the DNA belonged on the evolutionary “family tree” of the two bacteria.“In light of our results, a reasonable scenario for the deaths of these soldiers would be a combination of fatigue, cold, and several diseases, including paratyphoid fever and louse-borne relapsing fever.While not necessarily fatal, the louse-borne relapsing fever could significantly weaken an already exhausted individual,” they write.Dr Michael Rowe, an expert in European history at King’s College London, welcomed the study.“The science is interesting because I think it does something which a historian couldn’t do,” he said, referring to the identification of the diseases.But he cautioned against assuming the devastation of the army was simply down to harsh weather that left soldiers susceptible to starvation and disease – a view Napoleon promoted.“That underplays the Russians and it underplays the fact that they actually do some very clever things and that they [have] got a very good strategy and they’ve got actually quite a sophisticated army,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNapoleon BonaparteBiologyInfectious diseasesMedical researchMicrobiologyFranceRussianewsShareReuse this content"

But the US has so far declined tosupply Tomahawk cruise missiles, a proposal that has also prompted concern in Moscow.Zelenskyy said Russia was trying to cause a “humanitarian disaster” this winter, adding: “We’re thankful to you that we are not alone in this situation – from the very beginning of the war but especially now, it’s very important.”Earlier, the Ukrainian leader visited King Charles at Windsor before heading to Downing Street for a one-on-one meeting with Starmer. The pair then moved to the Foreign Office for the full meeting with European leaders.Others attending in-person included Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary general, Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, and Dick Schoof, the prime minister of the Netherlands. The remainder participated online.The online and in-person gathering came a day after EU leadersfailed to make a firm decisionon whether to use €140bn (£120bn) frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Ukraine’s defence, while the relationship between the Trump and Zelenskyy remains delicate.Russia has, meanwhile, intensified its bombing of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Power and water were out in Kyiv and the northern city of Chernihiv this week, after targeted attacks aimed at breaking public resistance inside Ukraine.Before the meeting, Starmer accused the Russian president of wanting to prolong a war in which Ukrainian civilians were coming under attack. “From the battlefield to the global markets, as Putin continues to commit atrocities in Ukraine, we must ratchet up the pressure on Russia,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This week, Trumpcalled off a planned summit with Putin in Budapest, and on Wednesdayimposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia’s two largest oil companies.The US president has also begun to call for a ceasefire along the existing frontlines, rejecting Russian demands for more territory in eastern Ukraine as a condition for ending the fighting. But he declined to agree to supply Tomahawk cruise missiles to Kyiv after atense meeting with Zelenskyy in Washingtona week ago.Though Britain says it wants allies to step up the gifting of long-range munitions to ensure Ukraine can build on the chemical factory attack, it is unclear how far London would go to encourage Trump. With a range of over 1,000 miles, they could strike targets far beyond the Storm Shadow’s official range of 155 miles.Britain placed Rosneft and Lukoil under sanctions in the middle of the month, but the EU has not done so largely because Lukoil supplies Hungary and Slovakia. Instead, the bloc’s leaders agreed a sanctions package, its 19th against Russia, that would gradually ban liquefied natural gas imports by the beginning of 2027.Zelenskyy arrived in London after visiting Brussels. On Thursday, EU leaders sidestepped taking a decision on using Russia’s frozen assets to fund Ukraine’s defence, despite a plea from the Ukrainian president to take swift action to make Moscow pay for its war.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t remember doing it. I can’t make sense of it,” the 29-year-old said during the hearing in Albertville, as quoted by local newspaper Le Dauphiné Libéré. Simon was also fined €15,000 (£13,117) after she admitted the thefts during the hearing and offered apologies to the victims, local media reported.Friday’s ruling leaves a question mark over Simon’s participation at next year’sWinter Olympicsin Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo in Italy.

Hamas is not part of the PLO, which is dominated by its longtime rival Fatah.It comes as the wife of the Palestinians’ most popular leader,Marwan Barghouti, appealed on Friday to Donald Trump to intervene for her husband’s release from an Israeli jail, after the US President said he would “make a decision” on the matter.In a letter addressed to Trump, Fadwa Barghouti, whose husband is serving multiple life sentences since 2002 for deadly attacks on Israelis but is seen by many Palestinians as a potential leader who could unite their national movement, urged Trump to push for his discharge.“Mr President, a genuine partner awaits you – one who can help fulfil the dream we share of just and lasting peace in the region,” her appeal said. “For the sake of freedom for the Palestinian people and peace for all future generations, help release Marwan Barghouti.”‘The most popular Palestinian leader alive’: Releasing Marwan Barghouti could transform territories’ politicsRead moreTrump had on Thursday told Time magazine he was weighing whether to support the release of the imprisoned Fatah leader. “I am literally being confronted with that question about 15 minutes before you called,” he said. “That was my question of the day. So I’ll be making a decision.”Barghouti, 66, has been in prison for more than 20 years after being convicted of planning attacks that led to five civilians being killed, and sentenced to five life sentences plus 40 years. The trial wascriticised as deeply flawedby the Inter-Parliamentary Union.Palestinians have long sought his release, reportedly including him in recent hostage negotiations, but Israel has refused.Arab Barghouti, the leader’s son, said his father wasassaulted and beaten unconsciousby eight guards on 14 September as he was being transferred between Ganot and Megiddo prisons.The alleged beating followed a prison visit to the Palestinian leader by the Israeli national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, in August. Ben Gvir, a member of a far-right party who has past convictions from Israeli courts for incitement to racism and support for a terrorist organisation, taunted Barghouti in a video clip published at the time.According to Barghouti’s son, Ben Gvir also showed the 66-year-old prisoner a picture of an electric chair and told him he deserved to be executed.Fadwa Barghouti’s letter was sent to Trump while the US secretary of state,Marco Rubio, is in Israel as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to strengthen the ceasefire agreement.Rubio voiced hope on Friday of soon putting together an international force to police the ceasefire in Gaza and said Israel, which opposes including Turkey, could veto participants.“There’s [sic] a lot of countries that have offered to do it. Obviously as you put together this force, it will have to be people that Israel is comfortable with,” he said.Turkey, a Nato member and one of the region’s strongest militaries, was the first Muslim-majority country to recognise Israel.But under president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Turkey has welcomed Hamas leaders and been a vociferous critic of Israel, which Erdoğan accuses of committing genocide in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.Rubio has become the fourth member of Trump’s inner circle to visit Israel since the president’s trip to the Knesset last week — a move widely seen as a signal to the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that Washington is keeping a close eye on developments and wants to safeguard the fragile Gaza’s truce.Hamas said Friday in a statement it had received “clear guarantees” from mediators Egypt, Qatar and Turkey that “the war has effectively ended”.It called for greater pressure on Israel to allow in humanitarian aid.The World Health Organization said Thursday there had been little improvement in the amount of aid going into Gaza - and no observable reduction in hunger.“The situation still remains catastrophic because what’s entering is not enough,” WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said.Explore more on these topicsPalestineIsraelMarco RubioMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Efforts by the FBU to secure its release by pressing both the Israeli and UK governments have so far failed.Malone, a former Dundee firefighter, said: “There’s a real hurt that you feel that it’s sitting in a port doing nothing.”His previous efforts feature in the award-winning documentary Firefighters Under Occupation, which charts the daily challenges facing firefighters in the West Bank. “Firefighters have to contact Israeli forces to coordinate before they can fight a fire,” Malone said. “As a first responder, it’s something hard for us to imagine not being able to deliver your services in an instant.”Scottish government officials have raised the issue with the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) which is understood to have discussed the matter with Israeli authorities.A FCDO spokesperson said: “The UK continues to call on Israel to increase humanitarian and commercial access into the Palestinian territories by ensuring all aid crossings are fully operational, international NGOs are permitted to operate freely and safely, and humanitarian supplies are allowed to reach those in need at the pace and scale that is necessary to tackle this crisis.”The Israeli embassy has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsDundeeScotlandFirefightersWest BankIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The 54-year-old proudly stuck out his jaw to show the chunk of his cheek torn away by Israeli fire and traced the zigzag scar on his arm, the pink, raised flesh marking the bullet’s path through his body.“I got these in the second intifada,” said Dabaya, beaming. He pulled up a video of himself a year earlier confronting an Israeli personnel carrier in Jenin camp wielding only a flip-flop.As he spoke, an Israeli military truck rumbled by. This time he only stared as it passed, not daring to approach.Israeli soldiers have occupied Jenin camp since January, expelling all 14,000 residents from their homes and erecting earthen berms, raised barriers, to cut it off from the rest of the city. Though the military operation – dubbed “Iron Wall” – has successfully crushed Palestinian militants there, the soldiers remain.View image in fullscreenSmoke rises during an Israeli raid in Jenin in February.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesJenin was once known as the “martyrs’ capital” ofPalestine. The Jenin battalion, a militant group unique for its alliance of fighters from different Palestinian factions, fiercely resisted Israeli incursions. It was said that Jenin and Gaza were the two places Israel could never conquer.Gaza is now in ruins and the martyrs’ capital is silent. Israeli soldiers patrol Jenin’s streets freely and conduct near-daily raids. The resistance fighters who gave Jenin its reputation are now only a memory, their faces fading from the posters lining the streets under the unrelenting sun.“We are tired,” Dabaya said. “Resistance was a good idea, but look what happened to Gaza. All of the fighters are gone and we just want to live our lives in peace.” He has given up trying to check on his home in Jenin camp after soldiers caught and beat him badly last month.To the residents of theWest Bank, the war in Gaza was a warning. As they watched bombs destroy 88% of the Gaza Strip over the last two years, they realised there was no limit to what Israel would do to crush Palestinian militants.Now the war in Gaza is drawing down, Palestinians fear Israel will turn its focus on the West Bank.View image in fullscreenA Palestinian woman and girl carry their belongings along a bulldozed road past damaged buildings in the Jenin camp in March.Photograph: Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty ImagesEager to avoid incurring the same wrath as Gaza, voices of resistance have kept silent, even as the number of daily settler attacks and restrictions rises sharply. Wednesday’s preliminary approval in the Knesset of bills applying Israeli law to the occupied West Bank – aprocess halted on Thursdayafter Trump administration figures voiced strong disapproval – barely registered among Palestinians. Only two years ago it would have provoked mass protests.In Jenin, the boundaries of the military occupation are slowly expanding; soldiers pay daily visits to residents who live near the camp and bulldozers tear up their roads.“When we used to hear shooting, we used to think there was a fight in the camp. Now we know it was the Israelis – not one bullet comes from the Palestinians. There’s no one left,” said Hiba Jarar as she cleaned her house after it was searched by an Israeli soldier a few days earlier.Jarar lives in Jabria, a wealthy neighbourhood overlooking the Jenin camp. From her living room window she can see troops moving to and from their makeshift barracks, a repurposed apartment building.View image in fullscreenPalestinian children and journalists disperse as Israeli tanks enter the Jenin camp in February.Photograph: Jaafar Ashtiyeh/AFP/Getty ImagesShe is one of the last people in the neighbourhood. One by one, residents have been raided by the military and told to vacate. The row of luxury villas lies deserted, the torn-up road stopping at a mound of dirt heaped high by Israeli bulldozers.“The Israelis know they have nothing to fear any more. They raid houses with just a single soldier now. The soldier that searched my house was respectful, I was lucky. But who knows what will happen next time,” said Jarar.As resistance has been quashed, daily humiliations have increased. Videos of soldiers rounding up dozens of young men and forcing them to march, heads down, hands behind their backs, in mass arrests regularly circulate on social media.Mustafa Sheta, the general manager of the Freedom Theatre arts centre in Jenin camp, was arrested at his home in December 2023 by Israeli soldiers, alongside hundreds of other Palestinians. He was held for 15 months in administrative detention without charge – a common practice used by Israel to detain Palestinians indefinitely without trial.He described prison guards filming him and other inmates on their phones as they were strip-searched, and guards making detainees lie on their stomachs while they used their backs as springboards, jumping back and forth on their prone bodies.When Sheta was released from prison in March, he found Jenin camp occupied and the spirit of the city’s residents broken.“I was shocked because Jenin is the capital of resistance. Where are the fighters? What’s happened to the fighters? It felt like we lost the war, like we are losing this battle,” Sheta said.“People’s priorities, they’ve changed. In the beginning, we talk about revolution, about right of return, about political issues. But now they talk about something else – they ask what they can do in this new kind of life.”Questions of resistance have faded with the fighters who once claimed to have the answers. Now, residents are more occupied with the struggle of daily life as poverty and Israeli restrictions make eking out an existence ever harder.Yet, even if the fighters’ guns have fallen silent, a few of Jenin’s residents push for quieter forms of defiance to assert their existence.“They don’t deal with us even as animals, they consider us as nothing. So you need to again open that important discussion about how we can be resilient and stay in our homeland,” Sheta said.4:35Could the West Bank become the next Gaza? – video explainerExplore more on these topicsWest BankIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Water droplets cluster around the particles, modifying the structure of the clouds and increasing the chance of precipitation.Months of unpredictable weather over India’s capital had put the BJP’s cloud-seeding plans on pause. But days after Delhi’sair quality once again fell into the hazardous rangeafter Diwali festival, and a thick brown haze settled over the city, the government said the scheme would finally be rolled out.The Delhi environment minister, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, said the first trial flight – during which seeding flares were launched into the sky – was conducted on Thursday.The city’s chief minister, Rekha Gupta, said: “If conditions remain favourable, Delhi will experience its first artificial rain on October 29.”View image in fullscreenPeople light ‘eco-friendly’ fireworks during Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, in Delhi.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesExperts who have studied cloud seeding say it is no panacea. It is supposed to produce more frequent and heavier rain than the clouds would otherwise release, but the effect is often small. The process also requires clouds, and they are often not present over Delhi during winter when pollution peaks. It also does not address the root causes of pollutants.Two professors at Delhi’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences condemned the plan as a “gimmick”. “It is a textbook case of science misapplied and ethics ignored,” said Shahzad Gani and Krishna AchutaRao,writing in the Hindu newspaper.They equated the plans with the “smog towers” that were erected in Delhi by the previous government, at the cost of billions of rupees, but were found to be largely ineffectual at improving air quality.They also warned that there was little research into the long-term effects on repeated use of the chemicals used in cloud seeding, such as silver iodide or sodium chloride, on agriculture and human health.“Snake-oil solutions will not clear the air in Delhi or the rest of NorthIndia,” Gani and AchutaRao said.Delhi has been ranked as theworld’s most polluted cityfor more than a decade. In 2024, pollution levels – caused by a deadly mix of emissions from crop burning, factories and heavy traffic, which get trapped over the city when the air gets colder – rose by 6%.During winter, levels of PM2.5 and PM 10 – the fine particulate matter that causes pollution – in the city regularly go far above those seen during the famous “airpocalypse” in Beijing in 2013, before the Chinese government took stringent initiatives to clean the air.Explore more on these topicsDelhiAir pollutionIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

In the 2023-24 tax year, 66% of all contributions went into cash savings.Earlier this year,Rachel Reeves paused plansto limit the cash Isa allowance but in the run-up to next month’s budget there has been renewed speculation that it could be reduced to £10,000 in an attempt to promote growth.The Commons Treasury committee said on Saturday that the chancellor should not cut the cash Isa allowance, arguing this was unlikely to encourage people to put their money into the stock market. What was needed instead, the MPs said, was better financial education so people were able to make informed decisions about their savings.In a report based on hearings with experts, the committee quoted Martin Lewis, the founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, who said “this concept that, if you stop people saving in cash, they are going to put money in stocks and shares is false. For people to invest in stocks and shares, you need a cultural change”.How might Rachel Reeves target lawyers, accountants and doctors in her budget?Read moreThe committee heard from building society bosses who warned reducing the cash Isa allowance would have negative effects on homebuyers.They said building societies relied on savings deposits to fund mortgages and the market would become less competitive without the inflows, potentially pushing up rates.Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said the MPs backed the chancellor’s ambition to help savers earn better returns through informed financial decisions, “but we are a long way from that point”.She said: “This is not the right time to cut the cash Isa limit. Instead, the Treasury should focus on ensuring that people are equipped with the necessary information and confidence to make informed investment decisions.”She added that without better financial education she feared “the chancellor’s attempts to transform the UK’s investment culture simply will not deliver the change she seeks, instead hitting savers and mortgage borrowers”.Although the chancellor is not set to deliver her budget until 26 November, speculation as to its contents is already feverish. A possible cut to cash Isa limits is just one measure reportedly under consideration, alongside changes to the tax treatment of limited liability partnerships, changes to stamp duty and inheritance tax and amanifesto-breaking rise in income tax.The financial backdrop to the November statement suggests Reeves will face tough decisions to balance the books. A recent decision by the Office for Budget Responsibility todowngrade its estimatesfor economic productivity is expected to cost the chancellor an estimated £20bn a year.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025SavingsMortgagesSavings ratesRachel ReevesBanks and building societiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Both Cash and Berry have consistently denied any wrongdoing.The Conservatives have challenged Keir Starmer repeatedly about what he and his advisers knew about the case, and whether the prime minister or others intervened so as to avoid a potential row with China.But the letters published on Friday by the joint committee, which isholding an inquiryinto the affair, set out that once the formal prosecution case had begun, no politicians were involved, meaning it was only Sunak who was sent Collins’s statement.Speaking after the letters were released, Starmer’s press secretary said the Conservatives had “serious questions to answer” about their role in the affair following “weeks of baseless allegations”.However, a source close to Sunak said the former PM had checked with the Cabinet Office and found there was no record of Collins’s statement being put in his prime ministerial box, meaning he would not have seen it personally.In aletterto Matt Western, the Labour MP who chairs the joint committee, Collins and Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser, set out that a first draft of Collins’s witness statement was sent to Sunak’s office in December 2023, “to also be shared with No 10 special advisers”.By this point, the letter said, a description of China as an “enemy” initially included in a draft had been removed by Collins “as it did not reflect government policy”.This fact was passed on to police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), Powell and Collins said in their letter, and added: “We understand from CTP [counter-terrorism police] that the CPS were aware of this in December 2023, which was before charges were brought.”The letter reiterated the insistence of Starmer’s government that it had nothing to do with the collapse of the case and did not see subsequent statements requested from Collins by prosecutors, produced after the change of government.“Following the submission of the first DNSA [deputy national security adviser] witness statement to CTP, no minister or special adviser (including the current NSA) played any role in the provision of evidence. The DNSA understood from lawyers that following the charging decision, his witness statement could not be shared,” the letter set out.Later, the committee published aletter from Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, whose role has come under increasing scrutiny.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Following that date, no law officer intervened in the case at any stage,” he wrote.Starmer and his ministers have argued that the trial would not have had to be abandoned if the Conservatives had been speedier in replacing the Official Secrets Act, which dated from 1911. It has since been replaced with the National Security Act.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsRishi SunakChinaOfficial Secrets ActnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood the prison officer who authorised the release has been removed from duties while an urgent investigation takes place.One prison source described it as a “disaster waiting to happen” because of the high volume of releases being processed by inexperienced staff, with dozens of prisoners serving different tariffs being released at the same time.Recent law changes mean that foreign criminals such as Kebatu can be removed fromEnglandand Wales after serving a shorter sentence than domestic criminals. Kebatu was automatically eligible for immediate removal as soon as he was sentenced because of the time he had already spent on remand.Lammy said there was “no excuse” for the mistaken release, but that Labour had inherited “a collapsing prison system”.He said: “Let us be clear, we inherited a collapsing prison system in which the last government was releasing people early and which our prisons were overflowing.“And, indeed, we have a sentencing bill in parliament seeking to address that issue, and we have stabilised the system.“But that can be no excuse for wrongly releasing an individual, a dangerous individual, into the community.It is understood he had been due to be flown back to Ethiopia “imminently” from the detention centre. Offenders who are subject to deportation are normally transferred by a secure prison van directly to the removal centre.Kebatu was found guilty of committing two counts of sexual assault and one of attempted sexual assault in July, days after arriving in the UK on a small boat and taking up residence at the Bell hotel in Epping.He was also found guilty of one count of inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity and one count of harassment without violence, and has been in prison since 23 September.His case triggered protests outside the Bell hotel, which far-right activists sought to exploit, leading to assaults on police officers and 32 arrests.A Prison Service spokesperson said: “We are urgently working with police to return an offender to custody following a release in error at HMP Chelmsford.“Public protection is our top priority and we have launched an investigation into this incident.”The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, said: “The Epping hotel migrant sex attacker … is now walking the streets of Essex. Britain is broken.”The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “Remember: they told you that local mums who protested outside the hotel where this sex attacker stayed were the problem.”Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “It is disgraceful that a dangerous convicted paedophile who attacked a 14-year-old girl has been allowed to vanish. This despicable man is an illegal immigrant who should have been deported immediately he arrived.“This is breathtaking incompetence by David Lammy and Shabana Mahmood [the home secretary]. They have put our children at further risk by letting this dangerous illegal immigrant out on to our streets. They are responsible for anything he may do.“This should never have happened in the first place. Illegal immigrants ought to be deported within a week – but the Labour government is too weak to do that.“Whether it’s a migrantwho had been removed breaking back into the UK, the collapse of the rape gang inquiry, new China spying revelations, record illegal entries and now this – it’s been another litany of failure from the Home Office and home secretary this week.”The Liberal Democrat MP for Chelmsford, Marie Goldman, said she was struggling not to call for HMP Chelmsford’s governor to resign.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumEnglandEssexnewsShareReuse this content"

The humiliating result showed that the party is highly vulnerable to challenges from other progressive parties, as well as from Reform.It provoked renewed anger and concern from some Labour MPs, with one condemning what they called a “totally incoherent” strategy within No 10. “If the national vote acrossWalesin May is even in the ballpark of Caerphilly, there’s absolutely no way we can carry on like we are after that,” one senior backbencher said.Plaid Cymru’s victory in Caerphilly points to a new kind of electorateRead more“Obviously, parties in government struggle in byelections, but when your vote collapses to that extent, someone has got to take responsibility for it. Everyone’s miserable, everyone’s despondent. It’s not as if there is an obvious sort of answer or successor to get us out of this mess. But we’re all pretty clear, we can’t just carry on as we are.”The May elections, which include contests for more than 1,600 council seats across England, as well as for the Welsh and Scottish parliaments, have long been seen as a potential crossroads for Starmer, with some senior ministers predicting he could face a challenge if losses are particularly steep.In Caerphilly, Plaid Cymru’s candidate, Lindsay Whittle, received 15,961 votes, more than 47% of the total, while Reform’s Llŷr Powell, who had been the favourite, was almost 4,000 votes behind.Result graphThe loss is a blow to Reform, especially afterNigel Faragetravelled to the area more than once. But Powell said the race had taught the party valuable lessons before next May: “A big part of what we were trying to do here is to master our campaigning. We’ve trained so many people up on our systems. We’re now a grassroots campaigning party.”While the Labour collapse was widely expected, it has brought practical difficulties – it now holds just 29 of the 60 Senedd seats, making it harder to pass its budget – plus a more existential worry that the party has no answers to the challenge posed by Reform and, increasingly, other parties on the left.Many Labour MPs are worried that even if similar levels of tactical voting can hold off Reform in some areas, the beneficiaries could often be Plaid in Wales, the Scottish National party in Scotland and potentially the Greens or Liberal Democrats in parts of England.“Our strategy is based on the idea we can unify progressive voters around a ‘stop Reform’ campaign,” one MP said. “That works so long as you remain the most viable progressive party. But if people start to think that it’s maybe another party, then suddenly that tactical voting starts to work against Labour and you get punished really badly.”Several MPs said that while they had been buoyed up by Starmer’s passionatespeech to the Labour conferencein late September, in which he talked about leading a “fight for the soul” of the nation against Reform, there had been little to follow this up.“People want to hear not just what Labour stands against, but what it stands for,” one MP said.Another said: “Having managed to somehow stick his head outside the hostage cell, Keir’s captors have got him back inside and have sent out Shabana Mahmood to explain what we’ll do to people of different national origins who live and work in the UK. It is totally incoherent.”Plaid’s win was being put down in part to its clear, passionate call for the people of south Wales to reject Reform’s stance on immigration.View image in fullscreenThe Plaid Cymru leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth (left), walks to the Senedd in Cardiff with Lindsay Whittle after the byelection victory.Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty ImagesRhun ap Iorwerth, the party’s leader, said the people of Caerphilly had chosen “hope over division and progress over the tired status quo”. He added: “We are now the real choice for Wales, the only party able to stop billionaire-backed Reform and offer a better future that works for everyone. Wales is ready for new leadership.”Farage, who did not attend the count, said on social media that he had expected Reform to get 12,000 votes, which it did, but that this was not enough in the face of “the total collapse of the Labour vote to Plaid”, something he said was in part down to the popularity of Whittle, who had been a local councillor for nearly 50 years.Farage added: “The Senedd elections next year are a two-horse race betweenReform UKand Plaid Cymru.”This is a vision shared by many Labour MPs, who are unlikely to be reassured by Downing Street’s words about byelections being “always difficult for incumbent governments”.Another senior Labour MP said Thursday’s result, if replicated in May, “should be a blaring alarm” for a change in leadership. “We can’t just drift through winter on autopilot,” they said. “The loss of Caerphilly is the direct result of the party losing touch with its own voters.”Others were public in their call for change. Mainstream,the newAndy Burnham-backed centre-left Labour grouping, called the result “a tragedy, but not a surprise”, adding: “So long as UK Labour governs without a clear vision, detached from its moral purpose and democratic socialist foundations, losses like this will only become more frequent.”Speaking to the BBC after the result, the Labour Senedd member Alun Davies criticised his party in Westminster for the way it had been speaking about refugees and “using the language of Reform”.But the Cabinet Office minister, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said this was not a debate that could be ducked: “With regard to the issue of the small boats crossing the English Channel and securing our borders, that is because people are saying to us, very clearly, it’s a huge priority for them.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerWelsh politicsByelectionsWalesPlaid CymruReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

Discussions over his living arrangements had been held daily since the revelations earlier this week, the Telegraph reported.While Andrew’s initial response had been to dig his heels in, saying he was entitled to live there until the end of the lease in 2078, negotiations were continuing with a growing sense of inevitability that he would move out, the paper said. Royal sources had seen a “renewed determination” to force him out, it added.Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the report.Downing Street said on Thursday that MPs would not be given time in the House of Commons time to discuss Andrew’s situation because the royal family wished parliament to focus on “important issues”.Charles is understood to have tried to persuade his brother for some time to move. Should he be forced out of Royal Lodge, under the terms of the lease he would be entitled to £558,000.There is also the question of where he, and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, who also resides there, would go. It is not known how he would pay rent as it is unclear how he derives income, and the king is understood to have withdrawn financial support last year.The royal family sought to draw a line under the Epstein controversy when Andrew announced last week he wouldvoluntarily relinquish use of his titlesand honours, including that of Duke of York. They would be extant but inactive. But there have been calls for them to be removed altogether, which would require legislation.His announcement came after he consulted with the king and the Prince of Wales when it emerged he had emailed Epstein in 2011 saying “we’re in this together” three months after he said he had broken off all contact with the disgraced US financier.It also came just days before the publication of Giuffre’s memoir, Nobody’s Girl, in which she repeated her allegations she was forced to have sex three times with Andrew, which he vehemently denies, including when she was 17 and also during an orgy after she was trafficked by Epstein. Andrew paid millions to settle a civil assault case with her in 2022 with no admission of liability. Giuffre died by suicide aged 41 in April.Explore more on these topicsPrince AndrewKing Charles IIIMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

Witnesses said that following the lethal injection, Black started breathing and sighing loudly, and after several minutes groaned in agony, saying, “I can’t do this” and “It hurts so bad”. He repeatedly lifted his head. He was pronounced dead roughly 10 minutes after he had cried out in pain.This week, Henry, a federal public defender, told a judge that an electrocardiogram showed nearly two minutes of ongoing activity in Black’s heart after officials had declared him dead, the Associated Pressreported. She was testifying in court inongoing litigationchallenging the state’s lethal injection protocols.The Tennessee execution that ‘went horribly wrong’: how Byron Black’s killing unfoldedRead moreThe Tennessee attorney general’s office and corrections department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.On 5 August, Black, 69, was injected with the sedative pentobarbital, which was supposed to render him unconscious as it stopped his breathing and killed him. The state had argued Black would not consciously experience drawn-out pain. But Henry and a group of media witnesses in the execution chamber reported he was visibly in distress. She also said staff had struggled for roughly 10 minutes to find a vein in one of his arms and blood had oozed from the injection site.Henry told the Guardian after Friday’s hearing that Black’s legal team recently reviewed EKG records and saw continued activity for one minute and 50 seconds after the declared time of death. At that point, the EKG record stopped altogether, so it is possible his cardiac activity continued, she said, noting there was no EKG flatline recorded.The EKG, she said in the interview, provided further evidence the pentobarbital did not work as intended: “It’s very, very disturbing on so many levels.”If he was still alive when the official checked him, he should have been administered additional pentobarbital under the state’s protocols, Henry said. After death was declared, the prison also closed the curtain, blocking onlookers’ view. But the law dictates that witnesses have a right to view the entirety of the procedure, which would have been violated if he was not, in fact, dead yet.“That means the public and his attorneys didn’t have an opportunity to see if there was additional suffering,” Henry said.The EKG, she said, suggested state officials “don’t know what they are doing with this drug”. “Once we get access to information, we are finding the drug does not act in the body the way their experts say it will.”The discovery was distressing for the legal team, said Henry, who had represented Black for 25 years. “I was physically sick at the fact that he wasn’t dead when they said he was.”Black was a wheelchair user with lifelong intellectual disabilities, dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, severe heart failure and prostate cancer, said his lawyers, who fought for years to halt the execution. The county medical examiner’s autopsy,released in September, showed that during the execution, he developed pulmonary edema, a condition where the lungs become swollen with fluid, radio stationWPLN reported.Attorneys for people on death row have said theconditioncan cause excruciating pain and lead to a feeling akin to drowning and suffocation. Henry described it on Friday as a “torture” and an “incredibly painful form of waterboarding”.In the lead-up to Black’s execution, his lawyers cited the lung damage risks in their ongoing challenges, but the state’s medical experttestifiedthat people injected with pentobarbital should become unconscious within roughly 20 seconds, and that if pulmonary edema occurs, the individual would not perceive it, according to WPLN.Black was on death row for 35 years for the1988 homicidesof his girlfriend, Angela Clay, and her two daughters, Latoya, nine, and Lakeisha, six. He maintained his innocence, though his lawyers had focused their legal efforts on hisintellectual disability, arguing it was unlawful for the state to kill him in his condition.In Friday’s hearing, a lawyer for Tennessee argued that members of the execution team should not be compelled to testify in the ongoing litigation, which alleges the state’s protocols constitute cruel and unusual punishment,according to the AP. The state argued that the execution team members’ identities, which are kept secret, could be exposed, even if their faces and voices were masked.But Henry, who leads a group of death row attorneys, argued the direct testimony of those who carried out the killing was vital, noting her concerns that something may have gone wrong with the IV during the process: “Did the IV come out? Is that the reason that Mr Black exclaimed, ‘It’s hurting so bad’? Is the EKG correct?” she told the judge.Explore more on these topicsTennesseeCapital punishmentnewsShareReuse this content"

The goal, according to the department, is “to ensure transparency, ballot security, and compliance with federal law”.“Transparency at the polls translates into faith in the electoral process, and this Department of Justice is committed to upholding the highest standards of election integrity,” Pam Bondi, the attorney general, said in a statement to the Associated Press.Election monitoring is a routine function of the justice department, but the focus on California and New Jersey comes as both states are set to hold closely-watched elections with national consequences on 4 November. New Jersey has an open seat for governor that has attracted major spending by both parties and California is holding a special election aimed at redrawing the state’s congressional map to counter Republican gerrymandering efforts elsewhere ahead of the 2026 midterms.The justice department’s efforts are also the latest salvo in the Republican party’s preoccupation with election integrity after Donald Trump spent years refusing to accept the results of the 2020 election and falsely railing against mail-in voting as rife with fraud. Democrats fear the new administration will attempt to gain an upper hand in next year’s midterms with similarly unfounded allegations of fraud.The announcement comes days after the Republican parties in both states wrote letters to the department requesting their assistance. Some leading Democrats in the states condemned the decision.New Jersey attorney general Matt Platkin called the move “highly inappropriate” and said the DoJ “has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions”.Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic party, said: “No amount of election interference by the California Republican party is going to silence the voices of California voters.”The letter from the California GOP, sent Monday and obtained by the AP, asked Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the DOJ’s civil rights division, to provide monitors to observe the election in the five counties.“In recent elections, we have received reports of irregularities in these counties that we fear will undermine either the willingness of voters to participate in the election or their confidence in the announced results of the election,” wrote GOP chair Corrin Rankin.The state is set to vote 4 November on a redistricting proposition that would dramatically redraw California’s congressional lines to add as many as five additional Democratic seats to its US House delegation.Each of the counties named, they alleged, has experienced recent voting issues, such as sending incorrect or duplicate ballots to voters. They also take issue with how Los Angeles and Orange counties maintain their voter rolls.California is one of at least eight states the department has sued as part of a wide-ranging request for detailed voter roll information involving at least half the states. The department has not said why it wants the data.Brandon Richards, a spokesman for Governor Gavin Newsom, said the department has no standing to “interfere” with California’s election because the ballot contains only a state-specific initiative and has no federal races.“Deploying these federal forces appears to be an intimidation tactic meant for one thing: suppress the vote,” he said.Orange county registrar of voters Bob Page described his county’s elections as “accessible, accurate, fair, secure, and transparent.”Los Angeles county clerk Dean Logan said election observers are standard practice across the country and that the county, with 5.8 million registered voters, is continuously updating and verifying its voter records.“Voters can have confidence their ballot is handled securely and counted accurately,” he said.Most Californians vote using mail ballots returned through the postal service, drop-boxes or at local voting centers. But in pursuit of accuracy and counting every vote, California has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks – and sometimes longer.California’s request echoed a similar letter sent by New Jersey Republicans asking the DOJ to dispatch election monitors to “oversee the receipt and processing of vote-by-mail ballots” and “monitor access to the board of elections around the clock” in suburban Passaic county ahead of the state’s governor’s race.The New Jersey Republican state committee told Dhillon federal intervention was necessary to ensure an accurate vote count in the heavily Latino county that was once a Democratic stronghold, but shifted to Trump in last year’s presidential race.David Becker, a former DoJ attorney who has served as an election monitor and trained them, said the work is typically done by department lawyers who are prohibited from interfering at polling places.But Becker, now executive director of the Center for Election Integrity & Research, said local jurisdictions normally agree to the monitors’ presence.If the administration tried to send monitors without a clear legal rationale to a place where local officials did not want them, “that could result in chaos,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

President Ronald Reagan knew that we are stronger together,” Fordwrote on Xalongside the Reagan video. “God bless Canada and God bless the United States.”Ford said the ad will run during the first game of the World Series, but, after speaking with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, Ford announced the campaign will end Monday.“Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses,” Ford said. “We’ve achieved our goal, having reached US audiences at the highest levels.”The quick breakdown in relationships apparently stems from a one-minute television advertisement featuring Reagan’s radio address declaring that “trade barriers hurt every American worker”.Trumprespondedon Truth Social without evidence that Canada had somehow run a “fraudulent” and “fake” advertisement, and announced that “all trade negotiations with Canada are hereby terminated”.Rubio, the secretary of state,told reporterson Friday that Ford had aired commercials in the US which “took President Reagan’s words out of context”, adding that the Reagan Foundation had criticized the effort, too. “The President made his announcement that he suspended any trade talks with Canada for now,” Rubio said.The Reagan Foundation said on Thursday that the Ontario government’s advertisement “misrepresents” Reagan’s address, without elaborating how. It added that officials “did not seek nor receive permission to use and edit the remarks” and added that the organization was reviewing its legal options.Trump says all Canada trade talks ‘terminated’ over ad criticising tariffsRead moreIt also encouraged people to watch the video of Reagan’s speech on its YouTube channel.Ford’s office responded by reposting the longer, five-minute excerpt, andsaidthat the commercial uses “an unedited excerpt from one of Reagan’s public addresses, which is available through public domain”.Democratic lawmakers on the House ways and means committee jumped in to defend the Ontario advertisement. “This is the ad that drove Trump to cancel all trade talks with Canada,” the committeeposted on social media. “Unlike Trump’s AI slop, this is real and uses Reagan’s own words on tariffs.”The dispute comes as both countries face critical deadlines in the next few weeks. Next week marksthe cutoff for public commentson the scheduled review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which faces its mandatory six-year assessment in July 2026. The following day, 4 November, Carney, willdeliver a federal budgetexpected to focus on reducing reliance on US markets.Then on 5 November the US supreme court will hear constitutional challenges to Trump’s authority toimpose tariffsunder emergency powers. A federal appeals court ruled in August that such sweeping duties exceed presidential authority, potentially undermining the legal foundation for the 35% tariffs now applied to Canadian steel, aluminum, timber and automobiles.Chris Sands, the director of the Center for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, suggested the collapse in talks simply formalizes a dead-end process.“Can we stop trade talks? Yes, you can stop talks about steel, aluminum, energy, all of it,” he said.“But there was no evidence we were going anywhere anyway.”Sands noted the irony of Trump citing Reagan while reversing his trade legacy. “Reagan loved the country – he loved free trade. MaybeDonald Trumpbelieves that, but it’s not what he’s selling now.”Washington imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian imports this spring, prompting retaliation from Ottawa before Trump raised duties to 35% in August. Ontario, heavily dependent on cross-border manufacturing and automotive trade, has been particularly affected. The breakdown ultimately leaves Carney navigating domestic pressure with a minority government.“Carney’s trying to keep all the provinces together,” Sands said. “He’s walking a tightrope between angry Canadians, an angry Trump, and premiers who are going off-script.”Before departing for Asia on Friday morning, Carney acknowledged the changed reality. “We can’t control the trade policy of the United States,” he told reporters, noting that US policy had fundamentally shifted from previous decades.But he emphasized Canada’s readiness to resume detailed negotiations on steel, aluminum and energy sectors, “when the Americans are ready to have those discussions, because it will be for the benefit of workers in the United States, workers inCanadaand families in both of our countries.”For now, Carney said, Canada will focus on what it can control: building at home and “developing new partnerships and opportunities, including with the economic giants of Asia”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCanadaDonald TrumpTrump tariffsEconomic policyUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Following standard procedure, he was escorted to the blue sideline medical tent for a concussion evaluation by team physicians and an independent neurotrauma consultant.According to the league’s review, Daboll approached the tent during the evaluation and briefly stuck his head inside. Skattebo, who had come off the field on the same series, also entered the tent before the exam was complete. Both actions violated the league’s concussion protocol, which allows only essential medical personnel – the club physician, athletic trainer and independent consultant – to be present during a player’s evaluation.The Ravens’ doomsday clock inches towards midnight. Will their season survive?Read moreDaboll was later seen speaking animatedly with team doctor Scott Rodeo on the sideline while waiting to learn whether Dart would be cleared to return. After the game, the coach said he wanted to check on his quarterback’s well-being and determine whether to use a timeout to attempt a fourth-down conversion if Dart was available.The joint NFL–NFLPA statement issued Friday said the coach and player’s presence “created the perception that they were interfering with Dart’s exam”. Although the review found no evidence that either affected the medical evaluation or the care Dart received, the parties concluded that “their conduct was inconsistent with and demonstrated a disregard for the concussion protocol’s requirements and therefore constituted a violation.”League officials noted that the Giants’ medical staff and unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant otherwise “properly followed all steps required” by the collectively bargained concussion policy. The organization has since implemented “immediate remedial steps”, including additional staff training, refresher sessions for players and new procedures to ensure only authorized individuals can enter the medical tent during an evaluation.The league said it considered those corrective actions when determining the fines.The NFL’s concussion protocol has been the subject of heightened scrutiny in recent years after several high-profile head injury incidents, most notably thoseinvolving Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoain 2024. The league and players’ union jointly oversee the system and conduct automatic reviews anytime a player’s on-field evaluation prompts questions about compliance.Dart returned to finish the game against Philadelphia, a surprise 34-17 win for New York, and later cleared all required steps in the league’s return-to-play process.Explore more on these topicsNew York GiantsNFLConcussion in sportUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Now the league is getting its dueRead moreProsecutors said Jones leaked injury information about unnamedNBAstars to bettors before the public knew, while Rozier exploited knowledge of his own playing status to cash in.According to prosecutors, Rozier told a friend beforehand that he planned to remove himself early from a 23 March 2023 game against New Orleans with a “supposed injury”, information that was trafficked to bettors. He played fewer than 10 minutes before leaving with what was listed as a foot issue, a decision that proved highly profitable for those who had bet the under on his total points and rebounds (if nothing approaching Rozier’sannual salary of more than $26m).A second indictment alleges that Billups and others conspired with members of the Gambino, Genovese and Bonanno crime families to rig underground poker games in Manhattan, Las Vegas and the Hamptons using X-ray-equipped tables, altered shuffling machines and wireless signals to read opponents’ cards.Prosecutors described Billups as a “Face Card” – a famous lure used to attract wealthy gamblers to private games. At one 2019 game in Vegas, organizers allegedly told him to start losing because he had won too many improbable hands and might arouse suspicion. The operation, authorities say, ultimately netted more than $7m over six years. Billups’s lawyer called the allegations “ludicrous”, insisting his client would never risk his clean-cut reputation “for a card game”.The FBI director, Kash Patel, called the broader scandal “a criminal enterprise that envelops both the NBA and La Cosa Nostra”, estimating tens of millions in illicit gains. Prosecutor Joseph Nocella described it as “one of the most brazen sports-corruption schemes since online betting became legal in the United States”.The symbolism wasn’t lost on anyone. As Patel delivered his remarks in Washington, ESPN’s Get Up aired a segment on the arrests with an ESPN Bet promotional banner running beneath anchor Mike Greenberg’s face. The ticker – advertising the network’s own sportsbook launched last year with Penn Entertainment – scrolled across the screen for several seconds before vanishing midway through his commentary.Whether its removal was coincidental or deliberate was unclear, but the optics were unmistakable: ESPN’s lead morning host presenting in sober tones on gambling corruption while the company’s betting app flashed beneath him. The clip spread quickly on social media, a split-screen morality play for an industry that can’t decide if it’s covering the perils of gambling with journalistic rigor or profiting from it.Unreal scene from ESPN Get Up this AM.They’re talking the FBI’s arrests for NBA Sports Gambling. Mike Greenberg explains how ESPN used to shun sports gambling…while an ESPN BET promo is on the screen.The graphics team realizes the disconnect and takes the chyron down lolpic.twitter.com/ICCvyhJHPA— Trung Phan (@TrungTPhan)October 23, 2025Sports betting was sold with the promise of a new frontier of fan engagement. Since the US supreme courtstruck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Actin 2018, wagering has exploded from Vegas sideshow to national pastime.Fans can now bet on anything from the next basket to the next pitch with a few taps of their phones. The saturation has been relentless. Hockey fans were exposed to gambling ads as often as every 13 seconds during high-profile games, University of Bristol researchshared with the Guardian found. In June’s Stanley Cup final, viewers averaged 3.5 betting messages a minute as operators spent billions turning every play into a wager.“The constant barrage of marketing is especially dangerous for young and vulnerable groups,” the Democratic congressman Paul Tonko said, warning that the industry was grooming “a new generation of potential gamblers”.Through the third quarter of this year, legal sports betting generated $10bn in revenue, a 19% increase over last year. The NBA and other leagues have signed lucrative partnerships with data firms and sportsbooks – the NBA’s deal with Sportradar alone opened real-time micro-betting on in-game events, feeding a market that prizes information measured in milliseconds.That same infrastructure has made the games more vulnerable than ever. Every fragment of insider knowledge – a rest day, a substitution, an ankle tweak at shootaround – can be monetized. It’s a structural and practical invitation to temptation, and the sheer volume of prop bets on offer has made manipulation easy to conceal.The Rozier and Jones allegations feel like inevitable outcomes of a system that treats information itself as currency. Whatthe Tim Donaghy affairwas to referees, this is to the data-driven gambling economy.For the NBA, the timing is catastrophic. The league’snew 11-year, $77bn media-rights deal– signed last year and taking effect this week – was meant to herald a new era of global prosperity and record-shattering revenue. Instead, the season has opened under a cloud of federal indictments that reach into locker rooms and coaching staffs. Rozier and Billups have been placed on immediate leave.The league says it is cooperating with authorities and insists that “the integrity of our game remains our top priority”, but for many fans that integrity has now been called into question. The scandal has already prompted calls from regulators to re-examine prop bets, which the Ohio governor, Mike DeWine,urged banning earlier this yearafter a separate Major League Baseball investigation into suspicious wagers.It has also revived the question of who truly benefits from legalized gambling. States rake in tax revenue; leagues and media companies profit from sponsorships and advertising; and bettors, overwhelmingly, lose. Studies show nearly all sports gamblers lose long-term, with the heaviest damage concentrated among young men in low-income communities. Betting apps, armed withbehavioral algorithms, target those most likely to chase losses.The moral dissonance was once abstract. Now it’s on full display in perp walks and FBI press conferences. Sports thatonce warned about gambling’s corrosive influencenow depend on it. The NBA, NFL, MLB and NHL all run betting partnerships that blend sponsorship and content, even as they punish players for gambling violations. When ESPN – built on journalistic credibility – can’t discuss a gambling scandal without its own sportsbook flashing underneath, the conflict of interest is no longer theoretical, it’s televisual.Thursday’s indictments marked the logical endpoint of an economic revolution that turned fandom into a market and risk into entertainment. The money is enormous, the access seductive and the guardrails mostly voluntary.The same supreme court decision that unleashed the boom came with a warning. “The legalization of sports gambling is a controversial subject,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in 2018, acknowledging its potential to corrupt professional and college sports. Six years later, that warning has arrived in full.What began as a “fan engagement” experiment has become an existential threat to the trust that keeps fans watching. For the NBA, and for every league tethered to gambling dollars, the reckoning is here.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsGamblinganalysisShareReuse this content"

Rather than being on a peaceful cruise, he is captaining a sinking ship with his West Ham defenders playing their role by being all at sea in defeat by Leeds.Brenden Aaronson and Joe Rodon were allowed space in the box to put Leeds two up within a quarter of an hour. Leeds faded in the second half, offering West Ham a chance to fight back but the visitors lacked quality in the final third and could muster only a late consolation goal through Manuel Fernandes. The defeat leaves West Ham second bottom of the Premier League nine games into their worst start to a season in 52 years, and theironly win came against their current head coach.Leeds v West Ham: Premier League – live updatesRead moreElland Road was rocking as the third minute arrived. The Hammers’ vulnerability was already clear. A deep Jayden Bogle cross was headed along the six-yard line and Aaronson was the only one to react, while the Hammers defenders were all inevitably stood in the wrong place. Nuno is known for being able to organise a defence, so he will be deeply worried by the confusion suffered when trying to guard their own goal.The chants of “Sack the board” had already started in the away end by the time Sean Longstaff’s 15th-minute corner found Rodon unmarked five yards from goal, thanks to Lucas Paquetá’s dismal attempt at staying tight. It was another case of players failing to do basic defensive duties as neither claret-and-blue centre-back attacked the ball. Nuno turned away, looking deep in thought as the Yorkshire rain pounded down.“You have to face the reality of where we are: second bottom and we’re in trouble now,” the West Ham captain, Jarrod Bowen, said. “The only way this is going to change is if players step up, roll their sleeves up and get ready for the fight. We need more of that week in, week out. When things aren’t going so well, it’s easy to hide and be scared but as easy as it is to say, it’s hard to do. We have to do that, that’s my only mindset.”View image in fullscreenJoe Rodon plants his header beyond Alphonse Areola as West Ham concede a ninth goal from a corner this season, six more than any other Premier League side.Photograph: Richard Sellers/Getty Images/AllstarIn the 25th minute, Ollie Scarles was replaced after a lengthy delay while medical staff dealt with what appeared to be a serious shoulder injury. Nuno sent on striker Callum Wilson to end the inverted full-backs experiment, in the desperate hope it could change the direction of the match.West Ham began to show intent and Paquetá thought he had made some degree of amends for his non-marking when he rifled into the roof of the net after a Bogle clearance was blocked by Wilson into the Brazilian’s path. The flag belatedly went up, followed by a bizarrely long video assistant referee check caused by technological failure – somewhat explaining the 13 minutes of added time in the first half – when it was clear Paquetá was offside.The second half became a meek battle with a Leeds team dropping far too deep out of fear of conceding and a West Ham side devoid of confidence. The hosts ceded possession to West Ham, happy to wait to hit them on the counterattack.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What concerns Nuno? “Our approach to individual duels, our approach to defensive tactics, our confidence, so many things,” the West Ham head coach said.Leeds regularly released the pressure by launching passes up to Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who had opted against taking the knee before kick-off, to relieve the almost constant pressure they had brought on themselves. Fernandes’ 90th-minute headed flick was deserved and brought a level of intrigue to stoppage time but it was insufficient. “We had fighting will, passion and spirit to get it over the line,” Daniel Farke, the Leeds manager, said. “The nerves began again but it was also good the confidence to bring it over the line. It was a priceless three points for us.”By being physical and aggressive, Leeds know what they are doing under Farke, who has been in charge for more than two years. Nuno has had only four matches but already knows the prospect of bringing calmer waters to east London will be very difficult. “I am worried since I have arrived, it is not something that surprised me,” Nuno said. “I am worried but we are committed and embrace the challenge we have ahead of us.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueLeeds UnitedWest Ham Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Does anyone care?The Argentine has been as excellent as ever in his later years, but his presence and performance has yet to push MLS into the US mainstreamJohn MullerFri 24 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 13.28 EDTShareOK, show of hands. How many of you knew that Lionel Messi – a global superstar who hascommitted to spend his next three yearsin the United States – just completed the best individual season in Major League Soccer history?Be honest.Most people will be vaguely unsurprised by this news. You’re aware that the greatest soccer player of all time is winding down his career in North America, playing for whichever one has those pink kits that dot the planet like a beautiful toxic slime mold. Context-free highlights drift past the periphery of your consciousness, floating on the algorithm, and you heard a rumor the kids have started calling Messi “braceman” because he scores two goals every game. Which, yeah, of course he does. He’s Messi.MLS playoff picks: Will Messi, Son or a dark horse make a run to the title?Read moreEven among MLS diehards, Messi’s campaign seems oddly underappreciated. He won the Golden Boot andtied for most assists despite missing a quarter of the season, setting new records for non-penalty goals and goal contributions along the way. According to American Soccer Analysis’s advancedgoals addedmetric, he added twice as much value over the average player as second-place Denis Bouanga and left Carlos Vela’s 2019, the previous best MLS campaign ever, in the dust. In spite of it all, chatter around the league as recently as last month was that maybe, just maybe, San Diego’s Anders Dreyer or Cincinnati’s Evander would be a more deserving MVP.View image in fullscreenmessiIllustration: John MullerWhich brings us to the more important question: So what if Messi is tearing up MLS – does anyone actuallygive a crud?Supporters of opposing teams have reasons not to. After the thrill of seeing him in person (or selling that ticket to pay for the rest of the season) wore off, all that was left was dutiful acknowledgment of his greatness and creeping resentment of his intrusion on a niche fandom. The same league thatcancelled a fan-favorite podcastandreplaced writers with AIcan still find plenty of room in the budget to plaster Messi’s face everywhere, but the competitive balance thatused to be a point of pridewent out the window when one team spent more than double the average wage bill to assemble a Barcelona legends tour.There’s also plenty of evidence that your average American sports fan isn’t using Messi as a gateway to MLS as much as anticipated. League executivesonce predictedthat Messi mania and next year’s World Cup would “double our fanbase by 2026, then we double it and double it again.” Instead, average regular season attendance has dipped 5.5% year-on-year as MLS continues tolose ground to European competitionsin the American soccer boom. On Thursday, MLS boasted that its total weekly viewership for all matches had gone up 29%, but that could just as easily be explained by the increase in streaming and international linear deals the league signed between the 2024 and 2025 seasons.Google searchesfor Messi in the United States still trail Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays in Saudi Arabia, and spent the summer lagging behind the WNBA player Caitlin Clark, who has broken into the national sports conversation in a way MLS can only envy.View image in fullscreenIllustration: John MullerYes, the rest of the world still loves Messi. Millions of people watch his Inter Miami highlights and click on his name in headlines. No, they don’t appear to have been converted into rabid MLS aficionados. League commissioner Don Garber offered up someambiguous numbersearlier this year to support the claim that viewership is up “almost 50% compared to last year,” thenaddedthat it wasn’t “where we need to be.” Although Messi’s contract reportedly included a cut of streaming revenue from the MLS Season Pass package on Apple, the league announced this week that it will make playoff gamesfree to all Apple TV subscribers, suggesting that model hasn’t quite worked out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ted Lasso and Welcome to Wrexham brought soccer into the entertainment mainstream, racking up 418,000 and 24,000 reviews on IMDb, respectively. Apple’s glossy Messi Meets America docuseries has458 reviews. No, that’s not missing a comma.The problem is there’s not much of a story here. Messi issupposedto dominate MLS. When he succeeds, it’s because he plays in what the world still thinks of, however unfairly, as a “retirement league.” When he and his Barcelona pals sometimes struggle – Inter Miami only finished third in the Eastern Conference this year – well, what do you expect? They’re practically retired. There’s no narrative that can capture the imagination, just a weekly clip show ofotherworldly goalsthat seem to exist outside any real competitive context, even for fans of the competition.Maybe theMLSplayoffs can still give this experiment some juice. America loves a knockout tournament, and the closest Messi has come to conquering the world’s biggest sports market remains those magical first few weeks when Inter Miami won a mostly meaningless Leagues Cup in 2023. Or maybe he’ll turn back the clock at next summer’s World Cup and remind people that every minute he has left on the pitch is still must-watch TV.It seems more likely at this point, even after his extension, that Messi’s stint in Miami will pass into history as a half-forgotten footnote to a legendary career, leaving MLS with a handful of new records but no real transformative change.Explore more on these topicsMLSLionel MessiUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I don’t remember doing it. I can’t make sense of it,” the 29-year-old said during the hearing in Albertville, as quoted by local newspaper Le Dauphiné Libéré. Simon was also fined €15,000 (£13,117) after she admitted the thefts during the hearing and offered apologies to the victims, local media reported.Friday’s ruling leaves a question mark over Simon’s participation at next year’sWinter Olympicsin Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo in Italy.

Portugal had been outscored 40-0 by the United States in the previous 11 matches between them, plus Lavelle’s goal.Fatima Pinto scored her fifth international goal from atop the box through traffic late in the second half for the winner that gave Portugal their landmark victory.View image in fullscreenAlex Morgan waves to the crowd on Thursday night in Chester, Pennsylvania.Photograph: Ricky Fitchett/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“There is a standard of winning, and it kind of exceeds all those things, whether it’s the time apart or the age of the team or experience.

There’s another match scheduled against Portugal and one against New Zealand to close out the three-match window at the end of the month.The team needs the work before the results truly matter.“We didn’t look like the team that we’ve been working on but that’s what happens when you’ve got 113 days apart,” Hayes said.With Morgan in the house, the stadium underwent a makeover in honor of her big night.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Girls lined up at the Alex Morgan pre-wrap station to get their hair “game-day ready” and T-shirts and banners with her name on them were the hot items at merch stores. Fans everywhere raised signs showing Morgan love in her national team send-off.Even national team members who couldn’t take the field wouldn’t miss Morgan’s night. The 36-year-old Morgan retired from soccer last year when she became pregnant with her second child.American forward Trinity Rodman was on hand for Morgan’s celebration but did not play as she recovers from a knee injury. Rodman has only played for the Americans once since theywon the 2024 Olympic gold medalin France. Abby Wambach, Kelley O’Hara and Megan Rapinoe also attended the game.Besides World Cup titles in 2015 and 2019, Morgan also won an Olympic gold medal in 2012. She played in 224 matches for the US – and was honored with a framed jersey with that total as the number – with 123 goals and 53 assists. She was chosen the US Soccer Player of the Year in 2012 and 2018.Morgan also played in 150 NWSL matches over her career, which included stints with the Portland Thorns and the Orlando Pride. She rejoined the Wave in May as a minority stakeholder.Hayes only had Morgan for one game during her tenure. But the former Chelsea coach has been around the sport long enough to appreciate Morgan’s impact on the game – and for her to be feted at the same stadium where she scored her first national team goal in 2010.“There was nothing she didn’t achieve,” Hayes said a day earlier. “She was a player that epitomized everything this program is about. She’s an unbelievable credit to her family because her drive, her desire, her determination to prove herself at the highest level is second to none.“You can’t go anywhere in this country without them talking about Alex Morgan, and I think the sport should show a lot of gratitude to that, because it’s important for our players to be recognizable. And she is, without question, in recent times, one of the most recognizable faces in our sport.”Explore more on these topicsUSA women's football teamPortugal women’s football teamFriendliesWomen's footballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The omens for that are not promising. A similar referral of the Magnus Carlsen v Hans Niemann episode at the 2022 Sinquefield Cup took more than a year, and produced just a €10,000 fine for Carlsen and no other penalties. An online petition asking Fide to ban Kramnik has reached more than 13,000 signatures.Meanwhile, Kramnik has denied any bullying or personal insults directed at Naroditsky, and hasannounced his intentionto file a lawsuit against Fide, accusing the organisation of launching a smear campaign against him. Naroditsky’s mother, in herfirst personal statementsince his death, spoke of the emotional effect that the campaign had on her son.View image in fullscreen3995:Shakhriyar Mamedyarov v Alexey Sarana, Azerbaijan v Serbia, European Team Championship 2025. Black to move and win.Allegations of an opponent cheating online with the aid of computers are frequent. However, they very rarely occur over-the-board, while online websites have developed robust counter-cheating mechanisms such as fast inspection of suspicious results and moves.In recent years Kramnik, who won the world title from Garry Kasparov in 2000 then lost it to Vishy Anand in 2007, has been the most prolific cheat proclaimer. His evidence, when provided, is often obscure and unconvincing. Kramnik claimed that Naroditsky often looked away from the board when moving, implying that he had an engine connected within his vision but off camera.Naroditsky was a 2600+ grandmaster and a blitz specialist, so did not need to prove anything, but Kramnik was his childhood hero so he tried to argue to prove his innocence. However, the long campaign took its toll. His health suffered, and he looked distressed in the second half ofhis final videolast weekend.Was this the game which triggered Kramnik’s campaign, with its ultimately fatal consequences? Chessdom has publishedthis encounterfrom Titled Tuesday 2023, with Naroditsky’s crushing queen sacrifice at move 43. Many of Kramnik’s accusations have been directed at this event, which he calls Cheating Tuesday.The most famous case of alleged cheating, again with no clear evidence, was the then world champion Carlsen’s withdrawal from the 2022 Sinquefield Cup, later alleging that his opponent Niemann had cheated. The episode led to a $100m lawsuit and an out-of-court settlement. Niemann has since played successfully for three years without complaint, and is now ranked in the world top 20, while Carlsen this week joined in the condemnation of Kramnik: “The way he was going after Naroditsky was horrible.”Although Naroditsky was the most prominent subject of Kramnik’s investigations, he has been far from alone. The Czech Republic’s No 1, David Navara, who has autism and is among the most polite and pleasant of all grandmasters, was accused of cheating by Kramnik and at one point was reportedly suicidal. Navara actually sent a complaint to Fide, but the ethics and disciplinary committee took no action.England’s respected international master Tom Rendle has also been accused, as was the Ukrainian double world under-12 champion Tykhon Cherniaiev, then aged 14, who this column once singled out as among the most promising juniors of his generation. Cherniaiev was reported and blocked by Kramnik due to a single move which another GM considered “neither that strong nor too hard to find”.One of Naroditsky’s last opponents before he died, India’s Nihal Sarin, said: “The relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations he faced in recent months caused him immense pressure and pain. When respected figures spread unfounded allegations without accountability, real lives are destroyed.”Naroditsky was a supremely gifted streamer and commentator, whose articulate explanations of strategy and tactics inspired many. He had more than 800,000 followers on his Twitch and YouTube channels, and there have been more than a thousand comments, a record, to hismemorial article on chess.com.He defeated the world No 3, Fabiano Caruana,in the 2021 US Championship, and in the same year he scored inan internet game against Carlsenas Black in 21 moves with a queen sacrifice.Caruana has a mission in the current US championship, whose final round is on Friday evening (7.30pm BST start) and can be watchedlive on YouTube. If he wins the crown, Caruana will equal the achievements of Samuel Reshevsky in 1936-42 and Bobby Fischer in 1962-67, who both won four times in succession.Caruana’s rival has been the world No 8 Wesley So, a three-time US champion who is in good form after his victory in the $350,000 Sinquefield Cup. When Caruana and So were paired in round six, Caruana established a winning position, but failed to spot a forced checkmate and had tosettle for a drawafter thinking for just 90 seconds on his 41st move.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Niemann has been on his best behaviour, eager to rebuild bridges with the St Louis organisers following the 2024 US Championship where he trashed his hotel room after losing a game.He was smartly dressed, avoided saying that “Chess speaks for itself”, and after defeating Abhimanyu Mishra, who had been on an unbeaten streak of 71 games, reminded his interviewer that Carlsen had been on a 53-game unbeaten streak in 2022. before they met in the infamous game which led to the lawsuit.Fide to investigate Kramnik over attacks on Naroditsky as chess reels from player’s deathRead moreIn round seven, against his then co-leader Niemann, Caruana produced thegame of the tournament, a sensational display of original strategy. After the sequence 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bc4 d6 4 c3 f5!? 5 d3 Qf6! White should play 6 exf5! or 6 Ng5 keeping the position open and his forces mobile. After 6 0-0? f4! it is already strategically difficult as Black’s Qf6 is active.After that Black soon got his g and h pawns rolling. White could have done better with 15 Nc4 and 16 bxa7 to create some counterplay. As the game went, Black’s attack continued smoothly. The final position is a classic tableau. The black king still sits on e8, unmoved until White’s final spite check, while Black’s pawns swarm round the exposed white king. A most original game.England’s schoolgirl talent Bodhana Sivanandan, 10, produced the best result of her career last weekend when she defeated the former women’s world champion GM Mariya Muzychuk, rated 2485, in an impressive game at the European Club Cup in Rhodes. Sivanandan’s confident handling of her active rooks and queen in the middle game were the key.The game as played wascaptured by Chessbase India, with moves sped up for the camera to produce fast but easy to follow action. What next for Bodhana? She is now holding her own against seasoned women masters, despite her narrow opening repertoire and her sometimes passive middle games. Her Muzychuk victory should give her confidence for future battles to come against elite women.3995:1…Bxg3+! 2 fxg3 Ra2+ 3 Kg1 h2+ and White resigned.

As past opponents attest, there are no easy solutionsWill UnwinFri 24 Oct 2025 16.00 EDTShareNo coach has found a way to stopErling Haalandin his past 12 matches, the striker scoring in each and 22 times in all competitions for club and country. Pep Guardiola knows most about the Norwegian’s talents and jokingly suggested a plan to keep him out: “Four centre-backs.” There are no straightforward answers, especially as so many have tried and failed.On Sunday Aston Villa and Unai Emery will be tasked with formulating a strategy to keep Haaland quiet. Not that theManchester Cityplayer is particularly perturbed by not being involved for much of a match. His touches are infrequent but very often telling. The focus generally against Haaland is preventing the ball from reaching him but with City’s array of creative talents, that is easier said than done.Haaland comes alive inside the box, his ability to know where the ball will end up and his movement making defending against him a nightmare. At Villarreal on Tuesday he anticipated where Rico Lewis would put a cross and beat the centre-back to turn the ball home and give City the lead intheir 2-0 win.WhenWolves beat City 2-1 in September 2023they restricted Haaland to one chance, which was saved, and Ian Burchnall – an assistant coach at Molineux at the time – recalls how they did it. “The only time we had success was when we had Craig Dawson up against him and physically man-marking him inside the box,” Burchnall says. “Dawson did an unbelievable job because Haaland doesn’t take many touches. He’s unbelievably patient as a forward because they’re only ever playing against a low block. Haaland gets very few touches, so his patience and his focus to make movements inside the box is just unbelievable. You have to have someone that can match that inside the box.”View image in fullscreenIn 2023, Wolves had Craig Dawson ‘physically man-marking’ Erling Haaland, limiting the Manchester City striker to only one chance.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/EPAIt is not that Haaland drifts in and out of games – he is always doing his best to occupy defenders, waiting for his moment to pounce. It can lure opponents into a false sense of security, feeling they are on top because he is not involved. His tally of 11 Premier League goals this season matched or bettered the number scored by 12 of the division’s other 19 sides before this weekend’s round of matches.“We did have quite a good picture of him and the preparation was mostly that no one can stop him individually, so it must be a team effort,” says the former Werder Bremen defender Niklas Moisander, who faced Haaland three times. “A big part of the plan was how to stop him but it was mostly a collective effort and not individual. The main plan was to be compact and to have help around always when he had the ball or in the box. I’ve been lucky that I’ve been able to play against all the best in my generation: Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Robert Lewandowski. So I had some strikers to compare with, but I have to say he’s almost a perfect striker, complete.”How Haaland compares with Europe's other top-scoring forwards this season in club gamesOne of Haaland’s key roles is to stay high and lead counters or chase balls over the top. He can hold up the ball or run in behind. “It was mostly reading the game, anticipating and not coming into those situations where I would end up one against one against him, because then I would have stood no chance,” Moisander says. “When you play against the absolute top you can’t afford anything [because] half a second too late or a small mistake and it’s a goal. That was the feeling with him. You could have the feeling of: ‘Oh we played quite well against him’ – but then he had one goal or two at the end of the game.”As a No 9, Haaland’s physicality and athleticism make him stand out, possibly aided by themaple syrup it turns out he puts in his coffee. Trying to match what he does is almost impossible. Julián Alvarez is regarded as one the world’s leading strikers but he could not challenge Haaland for a starting spot andneeded to leave City. At international level Alexander Sørloth and Jørgen Strand Larsen are elite forwards but cannot oust their compatriot.“It’s really difficult but if you can stop supply to him, it’s great,” Burchnall says. “It’s not like you can double up on him because if you double up on him, you end up leaving space for somebody else inside the box. We just found it so hard to deal with him because he has so many different attributes. He’s strong in the air, can finish on both feet.”Bernardo Silva’s header at Villarreal showed the danger of overly focusing on Haaland, the 1.73m (5ft 8in) midfielder being allowed to wander into space and head home unmarked from close range.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As he has matured, Haaland has used the material to fire him. The greater the competition he is up against, the more he raises his game to give himself the best opportunity to outperform them.“He is so focused during the game, so you can’t really get him unbalanced,” says Moisander. “There was a couple of moments when we had some good relations and banter with him and tried to distract him, but all in good spirits, nothing too much. But you have to try everything. Those kind of players, you have to try to find the edge.”There is no one-size-fits-all solution for stopping Haaland. Many teams have been unable to keep him out.

Slot sought to point out that his comments had been complimentary when speaking on Friday. Speaking himself soon after, Amorim gave his response to the Dutchman’s initial comments. “I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team,” he said. “I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.”Bruno Fernandes will make his 300th appearance for United when Brighton visit Old Trafford on Saturday and Amorim was asked who beyond the captain maintains the standards expected at the club. “Harry Maguire. Diogo Dalot tries to do that,” he said. “Luke Shaw can show in some moments by the way he plays, when he’s so focused. I think Nous [Mazraoui] has a good impact. Licha [Lisandro Martínez], he is really important in this.”Victory over Liverpool means United have finally won two Premier League games in a row under Amorim. “It has to do a lot with attitude,” the Portuguese said when asked how this was achieved. “I’m not saying my players don’t want to win or run, but we need to sometimes [when] it’s getting harder [in matches] to force ourselves to do the basics. If you look at Brighton and the way they play, every team that pressed a little higher struggled and they won. We need to be prepared – not just against the top teams but against opponents that are [also] really good.”View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes holds a commemorative shirt ahead of his 300th appearance for Manchester United.Photograph: Zohaib Alam/MUFCFernandes joined United from Sporting for £46.5m in January 2020 and has been one of the few consistently high performers for the club in the intervening years. The 31-year-old considered joining Al-Hilal in the summer after the Saudi Arabian club made a £100m offer for him but decided to remain at Old Traffordafter speaking to his family and Amorim. Talking before his landmark game for United, the Portuguese, whose contract expires in June 2028, insisted he will discuss his future again only after next summer’s World Cup.“I’ve seen a lot of people talking that I had an agreement to go already next season. If the club has done that agreement, it wasn’t with me,” said Fernandes. “I haven’t spoken with anyone. I could tell you that there are still people talking to me and saying that they will be very eager to have me next year, of course. But from my side, that’s not talked about. Because my agent also knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Because until then, I won’t speak to anyone.”Fernandes went on to say that Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who signed for United in the summer, are the type of personalities United require, before going on to to praise their fellow new recruits Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens. “We need big characters because at this club being good players sometimes is not enough because of the pressure,” said the captain. “Cunha has that good arrogance to do the good things. Bryan, the same. He’s not afraid to take the ball, do his play. We brought two players who were aware of the Premier League also. And then we bought a very young goalkeeper [Lammens] and a centre-forward [and] they hit the ground flying [running]. We know Ben will be judged by scoring goals or not.

He has done the same with the company that owns Hillsborough, Wednesday’s stadium. As a result, administrators have taken over the day-to-day running of one of England’s historic clubs, with a view to stabilising financial performance and, ultimately, finding a new owner. Going into administration is a measure of last resort for any struggling business and carries sanctions in English football. Sheffield Wednesday have been docked 12 points by the EFL, leaving them adrift at the bottom of the Championship on -6 points, 13 behind Blackburn Rovers, the next side in the table.Why has it happened?Chansiri has placed the club into administration because he has run out of money, but the story of how Wednesday got to this point is long and painful. The Thai businessman, whose family control one of the world’s largest producers of canned tuna, bought Wednesday for a reported £30m in 2015. He went on to raise ticket prices, churn through managers and announce sponsors thatwere not commercially active. The EFL first issued Chansiri with a disciplinary charge over Wednesday’s accounts in 2019, but in 2020 the club received a 12-point deduction over accounting relating to the sale of Hillsborough to Chansiri’s Sheffield 3 business. Those 12 points were reduced to six on appeal, but relegation to League One followed. The Owls returned to the Championship in 2023 and were immediately placed under transfer embargo on account of money being owed to HMRC, with the same punishment imposed again the following season. This summer, the club were hit with five sanctions, three of which related to unpaid taxes, wages and transfer fees and led to a ban on recruitment for three transfer windows. This month reports began to circulate that HMRC was soon to serve Wednesday with a winding-up petition over an estimated £1m owed by Chansiri, but the owner has pre-empted such a move, requesting administration.Sheffield Wednesday deducted 12 points after filing for administrationRead moreWhat happens next?Administrators from the company Begbie Traynor are in place at Wednesday and control the day-to-day running. Its aim is to reorganise the business so that debts can be addressed and the club can be sold. Administrators are legally allowed to take eight weeks to establish a proposal for how to run the business as a going concern. Paul Stanley, one of the joint-administrators, described the steps that would be taken next: “Our immediate priority is to ensure that we are able to operate as normal for the next home fixture against Oxford United on Saturday. In the coming weeks, we will work closely with the staff, the Supporters’ Trust and the wider community to ensure that the club is placed in the hands of a suitably qualified and well-financed new owner.”Does Chansiri stand to benefit from administration?If the club are sold, Chansiri will receive money from the transaction as the leading shareholder and lender. But legal requirements mean he will come towards the bottom of the pile. Under the football-creditors rule the first people to be paid off will be players, managers and other staff as well as other clubs who may be owed money. Then come the club’s secured creditors, those who have collateral against their lendings, followed by unsecured creditors such as HMRC and, finally, shareholders. The further down the order of priority the less likely those debts are to be repaid in full and Chansiri’s estimated loans of £100m to the club are understood to be unsecured.Could a regulator have prevented this?The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has said Wednesday’s administration is “exactly why this government set up the new independent football regulator”. It will have a remit to secure the financial stability of English football and its clubs and is expected to come fully into effect for the 2027-28 season. As part of its powers the regulator will conduct an expanded owners’ and directors’ test which will allow it to establish the source of any potential takeover funding. More significantly, it will also be able to mandate that clubs maintain enough cash in their bank accounts to cover predictable running costs such as wages and taxes. A spokesperson for the IFR said on Friday: “It is unacceptable that fans of football clubs face this level of uncertainty. Our regime will work to prevent instability and protect clubs for the benefit of supporters and their communities.”Explore more on these topicsSheffield WednesdayFootball politicsChampionshipexplainersShareReuse this content"

The Brentford centre-back knew what he was going to do. Another summer, another change; another push to find a footballing home. It was June 2024 and as he enjoyed a lunch in the sunshine with his brother and friends in their hometown of Zwolle in the Netherlands, he could reflect on an excellent season on loan fromLiverpoolat Mainz. “Then I got a tap on my shoulder,” Van den Berg says.It was Arne Slot. Another guy who had grown up in the area. Slot’s first job as a manager had been with the PEC Zwolle under-13s after he retired as a player at the club in 2013; Van den Berg, playing a year up, was in his squad. Now Slot had been confirmed as Jürgen Klopp’s successor at Liverpool and he was looking forward to the start of pre-season.Brentford rise above snobbery to remain awkward, all-action opponentsRead more“I was a bit surprised,” Van den Berg says. “And maybe it was a little bit awkward. It was just funny … coming from the same hometown, he’d coached me when I was a kid and now he’s the guy at Liverpool. He was just like: ‘How’s your off-season been? Have you been working? Are you ready for pre-season?’ I said: ‘Yes, of course.’ But in my own head, I was thinking: ‘Yeah, I’m ready but hopefully I’m not even coming back for pre-season,’ because I wanted to leave.”Van den Berg’s move to Liverpool from PEC Zwolle as a 17-year-old in 2019 had descended into a nightmare. After making four appearances in the domestic cups, he was dropped into the reserves and came to feel forgotten. Living on his own, he was overwhelmed by loneliness and felt his mental health crash. It reached the point where he did not want to go in for training.It was not the reason why Van den Berg did not fancy a return to Liverpool with Slot because he was back on the up, having rebuilt himself initially at Preston, where he went on loan for the second half of the 2020-21 season and the whole of the following one.It is as if Van den Berg’s body lightens when he remembers his time at the Championship club. “Life-saver is a big word but it opened me up again,” he says. “I just enjoyed playing and feeling important; feeling useful … let me say it this way.”View image in fullscreenShaun Whalley, of Shrewsbury, (left) competes with Sepp van den Berg in one of only four appearances for Liverpool during an FA Cup fourth-round replay in 2020.Photograph: Malcolm Couzens/Getty ImagesVan den Berg would endure a horror ankle injury on loan at Schalke in 2022-23 that needed surgery and almost seven months out but Mainz could hardly have gone better, even if what he describes as the “hierarchical” system in German football had unusual consequences.“I played every game for Mainz but I was still 20, 21 and so before every training I had to check the air pressure of the balls and if they were not correct I had to blow them up myself – with the two other young players,” he says. “Every training I had to bring the balls and the bibs. And every training I had to bring the balls and the bibs back in. It’s because you are the youngest player.”Van den Berg needed regular starting football and he knew he would not get it at Liverpool. Yet Slot was persuasive. He did go back for the pre-season and he loved Slot’s sessions, his man‑management, too.“It was totally different,” Van den Berg says. “The years before, I never had this feeling of me having a proper chance. A few weeks down the line, he was saying: ‘You’re doing very well. I want you to stay.’ If you have the manager of Liverpool saying that, it’s not nothing. So, of course, I started thinking again. ‘Maybe I should stay, maybe I should sign a new contract here.’ It was weird.“He was open, easy to speak to. We’re both Dutch, so we are very direct. I like that. He told me: ‘You’re not going to start but I believe if you stay you will get a chance in the future to start.’”Van den Berg was not swayed. He knew what he had to do. His transfer toBrentfordfor an initial £20m was completed towards the end of the summer window last year and it had to be a strange feeling, three days later, when he was an unused substitute on the visiting bench against Liverpool at Anfield in the second round of Premier League fixtures.View image in fullscreenSepp van den Berg (left) has found a particular connection with Brentford’s sleep consultant, with whom he confides.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe defender has found alignment at Brentford. The more he talks about the personnel and the environment, the more perfect he makes it sound. It is the friendliness, the transparency, the spirit of equality and togetherness. “Because the building is small, you see everyone,” he says. “You see the technical directors almost every day. You see the owner [Matthew Benham] coming into the dressing room every home game and shaking your hand.”Van den Berg was an important player last season for Thomas Frank, the manager who persuaded him to sign, starting 29 times in the league. And he has arguably been even more so for the new manager, Keith Andrews. As he prepares to face Slot and Liverpool at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday, the numbers show he has not missed a minute.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The game is in the grip of a data arms race and yet many clubs are getting theirs from the same sources. What sets Brentford apart and gives them an edge is that the data they use is proprietary, in-house, coming principally from Benham, who has made his fortune out of statistical modelling.“The main reason they signed me was because my data was very good, especially at Mainz,” Van den Berg says, but it goes deeper than that. Brentford get data on their players from gym sessions, training and matches – even after matches. “There are so many new places they can find data or new things they can figure out,” Van den Berg says.It informs Brentford’s approach and so does another, more human detail – the famously strict “no dickheads” policy. The club take their due diligence on signings very seriously. When they wanted Vitaly Janelt from Bochum in 2020, for example, they asked him to name his favourite restaurant. They then visited it to ask the staff how Janelt was with them. Did he treat them with respect? When the answers were positive, they pressed on with the deal.“It’s what they have said many times – we don’t sign dickheads,” Van den Berg says. “I’m used to coming into new clubs and meeting new people and it was definitely one of the easiest coming in here. I love everyone in the building.”View image in fullscreenSepp van den Berg, during a Liverpool warmup in 2019, wants clubs to look out for their younger players more after his ‘dark days’ on Merseyside.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersVan den Berg has found a particular connection with Brentford’s sleep consultant, Anna West. The way he tells it, she is more like a psychologist – a neutral outsider in whom to confide and share, to lessen any burdens. “My girlfriend, Bente, is at university in Amsterdam and my family is in Zwolle so I live alone,” he says. “It’s just nice with Anna to have someone I can speak to in person. I find it very helpful.”It is easy to wonder whether things would have worked out better for Van den Berg if Liverpool had looked after him differently. “It was definitely dark days,” he says. “As a 17-year-old boy coming in from a different country, you’re not the priority.“I was going home crying at some points and then not speaking to anyone. Do you call this depressed? I think it’s a bit too heavy a word. But I wasn’t feeling well. I wasn’t in the head space you are supposed to be in. I had no confidence and that really affected me as a footballer. I was just constantly doubting myself, like I was not good enough. I didn’t want to go to training, which is not me. Then, you know you are really down low.“Looking back, if someone had taken care of me as a young player, it would have helped me, for sure. For young guys going abroad, going to big clubs, I’d say to parents: ‘Be careful. Make sure the kid is OK.’ I have lovely parents, my mum FaceTimes me every day but still she didn’t know 100% how I felt. And for the clubs, definitely look out more for the younger players.“On the other hand, I did learn a lot from the situation. It made me the guy I am today. My injury at Schalke, as well – it makes you stronger. You learn so much because you go into such a dark space. It feels like your whole world dies in front of you because football is your world. Luckily, I survived it.”Explore more on these topicsBrentfordLiverpoolinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The 33-year-old will hope to be recalled for Saturday night’s trip to Brentford, with the champions searching for their first Premier League win sincebeating Everton in the Merseyside derbyon 20 September. Defeats byCrystal Palace,ChelseaandManchester Unitedhave left them in fourth, four points behind the leaders Arsenal.Brentford’s Sepp van den Berg: ‘At points at Liverpool I was going home crying’Read more“The way he trains, and when we do finishing drills, you cannot lose that,” said Liverpool’s head coach of Salah. “The only thing is we have to keep bringing him into those positions and he has to bring himself into those positions.“There are a lot of things that can happen when you get older. But if I can select one player who has the ball 12, 13 yards from goal and he should score that to save my life, I would have Mo in that position. Now he needs to show that he can get into those positions.”Salah scored 29 goals and assisted a further 18 in the Premier League last season, but is struggling to back up that form. He has not scored in the league since a last-minutewinner from the penalty spot against Burnleyon 14 September.“I hope he is not ever going to take it well, because the moment you are going to take it well then you miss the fire,” Slot said of leaving Salah out of the starting XI for the game against Frankfurt. “That goes for every player, by the way. Not only Mo. The moment you start to accept that you are not playing any more and you are fine with that, then you miss the fire that is needed to play at this level.”Quick GuideBenítez back in management at PanathinaikosShowPanathinaikos have appointed former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager Rafael Benítez, the Greek club said on Friday, with the 65-year-old replacing Christos Kontis, who was sacked following Thursday's 3-1 Europa League defeat at Feyenoord.Greek media reported Benítez had signed a two-year contract with the Athens-based club. The Spaniard (pictured) was most recently at Celta Vigo, where he wasdismissed in March last yearafter eight months in charge.The deal includes an option to extend for an additional year and is worth around €4m (£5.2m) per season, which local media reported was the highest salary ever paid to a coach in the Greek top flight.Benítez memorably guided Liverpool to the 2005 Champions League title and led Chelsea to the 2013 Europa League crown, in addition to domestic and European successes with Valencia, Inter and Napoli.The Spaniard will be tasked with reviving Panathinaikos' fortunes, as the 20-time Greek champions sit seventh in the Greek Super League and have made an inconsistent start to their Europa League campaign, suffering back-to-back defeats after an opening win.ReutersPhotograph: Peter Byrne/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Afterlast weekend’s defeat by United,Virgil Van Dijk called a team meetingwithout the coaching staff to discuss the team’s poor run of form that saw them lose four games in succession in all competitions. “For me he has been the most influential I have had since I have been a manager,” Slot said of his captain. “He has been a leader throughout my period here.

It really is one of life’s enduring thrills. So the first time I’d seen or heard of Loum Tchaouna was when he picked up the ball in the 68th minute at Turf Moor, looked around a bit and thought: “Sod it, I’ll just whack it from here.” And how! What a brilliant way to introduce himself to my brain – which was perhaps not his ultimate goal; in this instance a goal was very much his ultimate goal.By the time of this last-on-MOTD wonderstrike, I’d obviously spent the previous hour watching various other footballers at work – most of them pretty familiar. The odd one did require a cursory Google. Who is Eli Kroupi? Who are all these Chelsea players? Do they really have the same sized squad as all the other teams? If I was cloning footballers in a laboratory and slipping them into the Champions League squad, I’d call them Reggie Walsh.Tchaouna firecracker adds sheen to Burnley’s French-inspired defeat of LeedsRead moreAfter Tchaouna’s beauty, I decided against looking this guy up. Partly to just savour the moment, and partly for fear of great anticlimax. The fact he is playing for Burnley (no disrespect, etc) suggests his YouTube highlights reel won’t reach that level. They are so often set to slightly overenergetic Europop with some hasty cuts just before the player gives away possession or balloons one over the bar.But to be deadly serious, maybe it was much, much bigger than that. At some momentbetween Kroupiand our friend Loum, had I reached my elastic limit of footballers? A limp spring, no more disk space. Manage storage, delete your WhatsApp conversations and your duplicated photos, save the entire 1987 QPR squad to the cloud. Give £3.99 a month to the man for another gigabyte. There is no room at the inn.There are just so many footballers. They keep appearing, every year, younger than the last ones. Fifteen-year-olds in the Premier League, now born so recently that I haven’t heard of what was No 1 on the day of their birth because it’s too modern.Perhaps this is what being old is. Looking around and just seeing a neverending procession of new people. Is it acceptable to demand new footballers do more than just one thing before I enmesh them into the Rolodex of players that swirls way too near the front of my brain? There’s a bouncer standing outside that particular cortex with a clipboard and an earpiece yelling “One in, one out” to an ever increasing line of teenagers in an array of Premier League football kits.View image in fullscreenMax meet Eli, Eli meet Max: the Bournemouth forward celebrates his first goal against Crystal Palace.Photograph: MI News/NurPhoto/ShutterstockMore fruits of the Loum, if you will, and I’ll drop out Ian Juryeff, and bring you in. A bit like making friends when you’re 46. I’ve already got some good ones. I’m time-poor, exhausted and can’t face wading through small talk about siblings and whether you enjoy Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves as much as I do. If you want to break into my top 50 now, you’ve frankly got to be extraordinary – and I’m not giving enough back to deserve that kind of effort.It is curious that with footballers, you just add and add and add and never delete. This bulging, unaudited list … will it ever burst? There are probably podcasts and supplement takers on Instagram who tell you how to free your mind of worthless information like this so you can reach some kind of higher plane of existence. That is of course, if there is a higher plane than being able to recall the Crystal Palace starting XI in the 1990 FA Cup final – Gary O’Reilly and Phil Barber took me a while.Depending on your vintage, your blank canvas may have been infiltrated in much the same way as mine. Dad relentlessly telling me about Gilzean and Greaves, finding common ground with Glenn Hoddle. More ingredients: add one packet of Top Trumps from Clive’s house. Martin Buchan, Gordon McQueen – always go height with McQueen, 6ft 3½in. Unbeatable – the taller the better for mid-80s Top Trumps. Diego Maradona was nothing; a high centre of gravity was key.Regular listeners will know of my obsession with the unspectacular, solid, run-of-the-mill footballer, ideally of the 90s. I’m astonished that I’ve never written about it before (please don’t check). Stir in Panini 86 and 87. Norwich City.

Opinion is valuable. Sometimes, though, the discussion verges on hysteria, can feel misplaced and, as England head into the first of four friendlies in their “Homecoming Series”, it all feels a bit over the top.Brazil look to youth as they start 2027 World Cup buildup with Lionesses fixtureRead moreWin, lose, draw, play Beever-Jones at left-back, stick Le Tissier on as a centre-forward, none of it really matters. The point is: now is the time to experiment, to try things, to risk failure. As Wiegman put it before’s England’s game against Brazil at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday: “You have to find opportunities to try things out. You don’t get that many opportunities to do that any more in international windows. Now we have these friendlies and yes, of course, we want to win every single game, but it is also an opportunity to try out things and to see different players and combinations. That’s what we’re going to try to do, because it might be the last period we can do that in.”Asked about whether there was enough leeway given to England to be able to experiment, Wiegman – after working out what leeway meant, with no direct Dutch translation of the word – added: “I can’t control that. We’re so visible, so you all have your opinions and that’s OK. What I’m trying to do is do the best for the team, get the best team on the pitch and see different things in these four games. Of course we always play to win, but now we also play to develop and in every game you do develop.“Sometimes I really want to see a player no matter how the game goes, I want to see someone because we want to learn. We have to qualify first, but it’s in the tournament [the World Cup] when you are set on things. That’s how it goes. I just try to stick in the bubble. I know what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.”The most explosive reaction toWiegman’s squad announcementwas her statement that Le Tissier’s primary position for England is as a right-back. Even the Manchester United social media admin jumped on the criticism, posting on various social media channels: “Maya Le Tissier has started 104 games for United, 103 of them have been at centre-back.” “I don’t react on social media,” said Wiegman. “I watch Maya all the time and she does a great job. How our team is built at the moment, with the players we have, she’s most likely to play right-back. I also know she can play as a right centre-back and she does a really good job for Manchester United and she does a good job for us too.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And with Lucy Bronze being eased back from injury, and Ella Morris out with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, England are light on solid options in that position. Should Le Tissier be brought into the starting XI or come on as a substitute in her less regular position and do a terrible job, that plan will probably be rethought. For now, however, it is a reasonable adjustment.It turns out we will probably see more changes and experimentation than Wiegman would likely have planned for, with the manager announcing that an elbow injury means Hannah Hampton is out of action, leading to a call-up for Brighton’s Sophie Baggaley. The Arsenal centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy is also ill and has returned home to recover.Wiegman had already lost Katie Reid and Grace Clinton to injuries, while Jess Park’s concussion forced her withdrawal. And these absences follow the long-term ones of Leah Williamson, Lauren Hemp and Lauren James. Wiegman confirmed Keira Walsh will be captain against Brazil in the absence of Williamson and after the retirementof Millie Bright. “When Leah is not available, Keira is the captain,” she said.Ultimately, there is a lot to be learned from these four fixtures that will complete England’s calendar year. Perhaps we all just need to relax and enjoy them.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Few embody what it means to play for Wales more than the trailblazing midfielder who will bring her near 20-year international career to a close on Saturday at the age of 38.When Fishlock takes to the field in a Wales shirt for the 166th and final time against Australia , it will be the closing chapter of a storied international career, a farewell to a player who has gone above and beyond to put the women’s game in her country on the map.Wales legend Jess Fishlock announces international retirement after ‘incredible journey’Read more“I made the decision after the Euros,” she told Welsh media. “It wasn’t a decision that I made lightly … In the end, I just felt that I wouldn’t be able to commit to the cycles as much as I have in the past. That’s just not who I am. If I commit to something, I like to commit to it full throttle, and I just felt like I couldn’t really do that.”Since her international debut against Switzerlandin 2006, Fishlock has been the heartbeat of the team, driving standards on and off the field. Her playing style epitomises who she is as a person – the ultimate team player who covers every blade of grass and leads by example whether wearing the armband or not.View image in fullscreenKerstin Stegemann, of Germany, (right) is beaten to the ball by Jess Fishlock in 2007 at the beginning of her career for Wales.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images“I think it is impossible to sum Jess up in a few words,” her former Wales teammate Helen Ward says. “For the entirety of my 15-year Wales career, Jess was at the heart of it all. She was always the go-to player and person. When things were going well, it was usually down to something Jess was doing or had done; and when things weren’t going so well, she was the person we looked to to drag us through. From a young age, she just had that leadership quality, that aura about her. She always was part of the group.”Fishlock’s presence on a team sheet presented a different proposition for an opponent before a ball was kicked. She is a perfect combination of natural talent, determination and passion. Dictating play from the middle, she possesses the skill, vision and creativity that have enabled her to stay at the top domestically and internationally since making her senior debut for Cardiff City Ladies at the age of 15.The stats say it all. She will end her international career as Wales’ record appearance holder and goalscorer and a five-time Welsh footballer of the year. She played a key role in theirhistory-making Euro 2025 qualificationcampaign and fittinglyscored their first goalat a major tournament.View image in fullscreenJess Fishlock celebrates with teammates after scoring Wales’s first goal at a major tournament in their Euro 2025 match against France.Photograph: Stéphane Mahé/Reuters“Playing with Jess was one of the biggest honours of my career,” Ward says. “I know she’s stolen the [top goalscorer] record off me but I was lucky enough to hold that for 10 years and a huge part of that, funnily enough, was down to Jess. I would hedge a bet that she assisted well over half of those 44 goals. From the minute I stepped on the pitch for Wales, we just had a connection that grew stronger and stronger.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She has paved the way for future generations of Welsh footballers and raised the profile of the sport and her nation wherever she has played. Domestically, she has plied her trade in eight different countries and picked up silverware in most. Seattle has been her home for the most part since her move to the US in 2013 and she is hoping to have another NWSL season with the club before she hangs up her boots.Her influence away from the pitch is no less significant. One need only to listen to understand how seriously she takes driving the game forward. As part of the generation who struggled to gain investment and visibility, she has bridged the gap to the modern era, unafraid to stand up for what she and her teammates need and deserve. Her visibility as an openly gay footballer and the work she has done for the LGBTQ+ community are crucial and earned her an MBE in the 2018 Queen’s birthday honours.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of an artwork created to celebrate Jess Fishlock’s contribution to Welsh football.Photograph: Huw Fairclough/Getty Images“She’s just an icon for the country,” Ward says. “She wants to do things right. She wants to look after people whether that’s people in the LGBTQ+ community, whether that’s helping out at food banks when she’s back home, donating money to unbelievable causes, but without shouting about it, because it’s not her … She’s also a huge family person. She looks out for everybody close to her however she can. I think what she’s done for her little town of Llanrumney in Cardiff and for the country as a whole goes way beyond football. She transcends the game.”Explore more on these topicsWales women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A pulsating encounter at the top of the Prem table ended withNorthamptonultimately pulling Saracens apart after blowing an early 17-0 lead.Noah Caluori had dominated the buildup after his five tries against Sale, but Tommy Freeman of England restated his class with a phenomenal four tries, while Fin Smith orchestrated a vintage attacking performance. Phil Dowson’s Northampton look well equipped for another title.“Tommy does so many things so well,” Dowson said of Freeman, who may soon feature at outside-centre for England. “He looked physical, fast, skilful, took the ball in the air beautifully. He’s just a phenom at the moment.”Henry Pollock had bleached his hair as if to remind everyone he remains one of the coming men in English rugby, but it was a touch of class from his fellow British & Irish Lions Freeman and Smith that made the first score. The fly-half floated a cross-kick right for Freeman where the wing gained 50 metres. Smith then dinked a delicious grubber kick for the full-back George Hendy to pounce on.View image in fullscreenNorthampton’s Henry Pollock sported a new blond haircut against Saracens.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAThe incisiveness of Northampton’s attacking leftSaracenssuffering from a collective case of twisted blood. Smith nudged another teasing grubber to the tryline where Saracens’ Max Malins tried desperately to touch down in-goal. The ball squirted out, allowing the Northampton openside Tom Pearson to score.Mark McCall’s side could not escape their own half. Smith whipped a sensational pass to Hendy, who fed Freeman for try No 3. But Saracens are serial champions for a reason and were soon on the scoreboard. First Fergus Burke raced under the posts, released by Nick Tompkins; then Burke’s perfectly weighted grubber allowed Jack Bracken to apply a scorching finish.Pearson was shown a yellow card with Northampton forced on to the back foot. Juan Martín González bashed over and Owen Farrell’s conversion meant Saracens, almost unbelievably, led 19-17 at half-time.After the Saracens lock Hugh Tizard scored, another Farrell conversion took the visitors further ahead. Northampton needed something and Pollock provided it, intercepting in midfield to buy the field position that brought a yellow card for the Saracens prop Marco Riccioni and a second try for Pearson.“I think they’ve probably done their analysis in the week,” McCall said of Pollock’s superb, momentum-shifting intervention. Dowson’s take was different. “Lee Radford [Saints head coach] said at the time, that’s totally out of system and if it hadn’t come off, I would have taken him off.“He’s capable of those things,” Dowson added. “That’s what Henry brings to the table. He’s high energy, you can see him talking and winding people up. He’s also got a great feel for the game – that intercept was not something we’d practised, planned or foreseen. He’s made a read.”Saracens led by two but not for long – Pollock nearly powered over – before Mitchell teed up Freeman, and Smith’s conversion had Northampton five ahead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Farrell missed the conversion and almost instantly Smith’s perceptive kick put Freeman in for his fourth.“I thought the whole game was fun to watch,” said Dowson. “It was a really enjoyable game. It’s easy for me to say that from a winning position but I thought it was a good example.”McCall said of Caluori’s evening: “It was going to be good experience no matter what – whether it’s a good experience in the moment, or in a couple of weeks, or a couple of months.”Freeman described his newest England colleague Caluori as “a good kid, a freak of an athlete with the world at his feet”. His assessment of the match?“Very fun. That’s why we play the game. It was just good to come on the right side.”Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbySaracensNorthamptonRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "12.02 EDTFernandes still committed to Man Utd ahead of landmark 300th gameJamie JacksonBruno Fernandes:The Manchester United midfielder will make his 300th appearance for the club against Brighton on Saturday. Fernandes joined United from Sporting for £46.5m in January 2020. The 31-year-old considered joining Al-Hilal in the summer after the Saudi Arabian club made a £100m offer for him but ultimatelydecided to remain at Old Trafford. Speaking before his landmark game for United, the Portuguese, whose contract expires in June 2028, insisted he will only discuss his future again after next summer’s World Cup.“I’ve seen a lot of people talking that I had an agreement to go already next season. If the club has done that agreement, it wasn’t with me,” said Fernandes. “I haven’t spoken with anyone. I could tell you that there are still people talking to me and saying that they will be very eager to have me next year, of course. But from my side, that’s not talked about. Because my agent also knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Because until then, I won’t speak to anyone.”Fernandes went onto state that Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who both signed for United in the summer, are the type of personalities the club require before going onto to praise fellow new recruits Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens. “We need big characters because at this club being good players sometimes is not enough because of the pressure,” said the captain. “Cunha has that good arrogance to do the good things. Bryan, the same. He’s not afraid to take the ball, do his play. We brought two players who were aware of the Premier League also. And then we bought a very young goalkeeper [Lammens] and a centre-forward [and] they hit the ground flying [running]. We know Ben will be judged by scoring goals or not. But apart from that, he’s been doing great. He’s got his goals already [too].“Sometimes I get upset with [Mbeumo] in training because he’s like, one touch more, and I say: ‘Bryan, you don’t need that. You can one touch and shoot because you’re more than able. You did that against us when you were at Brentford. You just have to make it for us now. The shirts have changed, but you’re the same player so we need that from you.’”ShareUpdated at12.06 EDT"

TheWelsh Rugby Unionhad been pushing for a two-team solution but, after a period of consultation, has now announced there will be funding for only three pro sides in the future.The four existing regions – Cardiff,Scarlets, Ospreys and Dragons – will remain for the moment but are to be reduced to three by 2028, with teams based in the capital city, east Wales and west Wales. It means there will be insufficient room for both the Scarlets – formerly Llanelli – and the Swansea-based Ospreys who could now come under pressure to merge. If a merger proves impossible – highly likely with so much history and rivalry involved – a “fair and transparent” tender process would decide the outcome.Welsh wipeout in Lions squad for first time since 1896 reflects sorry declineRead moreIt will inevitably trigger a further period of uncertainty for players and supporters. The WRU, however, says the decision “reflects the need to concentrate talent, improve competitiveness and ensure financial sustainability” within Welsh rugby. “We have heard loud and clear from the consultation that people want a long-term fix and not a short-term patch,” said Richard Collier-Keywood, chair of the WRU Board. “We have listened and we agree.”The extended timeline is shaped by the fact the WRU is committed to the United Rugby Championship until 2028 and would be liable for a heavy fine if a club were to withdraw prematurely. However, if the URC finds a replacement before then – there has been speculation about a potential American franchise – Welsh representation could theoretically be reduced as early as the start of the 2027-28 season.The process is the product of rugby’s increasingly tough financial landscape and Welsh rugby’s lack of success. Between them the regions have not won a big trophy for years and the national side’s fortunes have taken a sharp dip during which they have endured a record 18-game losing streak and sunk to 12th in the world rankings.WRU bosses have made clear, however, that doing nothing was no longer an option. The three proposed sides will each initially receive annual funding of £6.4m, rising to £7.8m. Two elite women’s teams will also be funded but the upheaval will prompt renewed questions from politicians and fans, with rugby’s popularity in Wales traditionally based around fierce local rivalries.View image in fullscreenJac Morgan, on the ball against Leicester, has indicated he will depart Welsh professional club rugby if his Ospreys side cease to exist.Photograph: Ben Evans/Huw Evans/ShutterstockMPs have already announced plans to question the WRU about the outcome of its consultation and the impact on the sport’s wider economic and cultural importance in Wales. “With rugby woven into the fabric of life in communities up and down the nation, the proposed structural changes announced by the WRU today will resonate far beyond the pitch,” said Ruth Jones MP, chair of the Welsh Affairs Committee.Next month’s autumn international series is now certain to take place against a renewed backdrop of domestic bickering, with the WRU-owned Cardiff and the Dragons having already signed up to a new Professional Rugby Agreement while theOspreysand Scarlets have yet to do so.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

First, however, they facealmost certain relegationafter the EFL’s penalty left them on -6 points, 15 adrift of safety.The administrator Begbies Traynor is in charge of a process that will aim to sell Wednesday’s assets, and those of a separate Chansiri company that owns the Hillsborough stadium, to recoup debts that include an estimated £1m in tax owed to HMRC.

It needn’t have ended this way. But we are overjoyed to have Dejphon Chansiri out of our club for good.”Wednesday’s manager, Henrik Pedersen, his coaching team, players and wider club staff met the administrators in the training-ground canteen on Friday morning. The Dane said entering administration was necessary to embark on a new era. He said he had not spoken to Chansiri but that his conversations with the administrators left him hopeful that job losses would be prevented.Pedersen stressed “a sad situation can also still be a good day”, adding: “We knew from the last five, six, seven, eight months it cannot continue. We need a fresh restart to use the potential of this fantastic club. Now there is a belief, a hope, there is a feeling of looking towards better days. When I close my eyes, I can see a bright future for Sheffield Wednesday.”Club staff were emotional at the news and Pedersen said: “There is insecurity. Do we get our salary now? What happens now? Will it be better? Will it not be better? The general feeling was that they are all looking forward to the future together with Sheffield Wednesday.”View image in fullscreenSheffield Wednesday’s manager, Henrik Pedersen, said: ‘We have to be a new Sheffield Wednesday with an old heart.’Photograph: Matt West/ShutterstockThe situation at Wednesdayhas been deteriorating sharplysince the summer when the manager Danny Röhl and several key players departed after wages were not paid. The EFL said in August it was deeply concerned about the club’s financial situation and Wednesday began the season with only 15 first-team players. Since then the club has been living hand-to-mouth, with any income – such as solidarity payments provided by the Premier League – used to deal with debts. With reports of an imminent winding-up petition being issued by HMRC, it appears Chansiri ran out of options.Kris Wigfield, one of three joint-administrators appointed by Begbies Traynor, said: “Like many football clubs, [Wednesday] has been trading at a significant loss for several years, with those losses historically funded by the former owner Mr Chansiri. Due to increased financial pressure on the club, the owner has chosen to place the club and the stadium company into administration which will enable us to market the club and the stadium as a whole, which is great news for supporters of the club. The joint administrators have taken over the running of the club with immediate effect to protect the interests of creditors, and to ensure Sheffield Wednesday can continue operating while we seek a new owner as swiftly as possible.”The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said Wednesday’s plight served as another reminder of the need for the independent football regulator, which was signed into law this year. The regulator is expected to be in operation for the start of the 2027-28 season. “Having been in this position with my own team, Wigan Athletic, I know everyone who loves the club will be hoping for a resolution as soon as possible,” Nandy said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Before Oxford’s visit on Saturday the administrator and the supporters’ trust called on fans to reengage.“The club’s most urgent need is stability and income,” the trust said. “The phase of resistance has achieved its goal – now begins the phase of renewal.

That means reliable, powerful production from star hitters George Springer and Vladimir Guerrero Jr as well as pesky, tough at-bats from veterans like Alejandro Kirk and Daulton Varsho.GBOhtani may be the best ever, butGuerrero is even hotter right now. He’s hit six home runs and is batting .442/.510/1.440 this postseason. If anyone can knock the Dodgers’ pitching staff off their rhythm, it could be him.AEThey must grind down the Dodgers’ starters.Toronto’s contact-heavy lineup has to extend at-bats, raise pitch counts and force Dave Roberts to lean on his bullpen. Defensively, they can’t give away extra outs. If Vlad Jr stays scorching and Bo Bichette protects him, they’ve got a puncher’s chance.BAGThe Jays have to wear down the healthy LA startersand get to the bullpen that the Dodgers have been able to hide during the playoffs. Toronto must put pressure on the defense and take all chances they can on the basepaths. But on the field, do not take any chances: that means conservative play and taking the outs in exchange for single runs in a bid to avoid the big inning at all costs.DLView image in fullscreenVladimir Guerrero Jr has been the most productive hitter in this year’s playoffs, leading all batters in hits (19), homers (six), slugging (.930) and OPS (1.440).Photograph: Mark Blinch/Getty ImagesWhat the Dodgers need to do to winThe Dodgers are most dangerous when the bottom of their lineup gets on baseand frustrates opposing pitchers with long at-bats. If they receive steady production from reliable postseason contributors like Tommy Edman, Max Muncy and Enrique Hernández, then the Blue Jays will need to score in bunches to keep pace. The Dodgers will also win if their starting pitching keeps performing the way that it has: In 10 starts, the LA starters have a 1.40 ERA and 0.75 WHIP over 64.1 innings pitched. In nine of those 10 starts, the starting pitcher has allowed four hits or fewer.GBScore three runs a game.Their pitching staff is so strong that even if their batting lineup has an off night, they’ll probably still win. They just held the Brewers, who had the best record in baseball this year, to four runs in four games. One pitcher might have a meltdown, but it’s hard to imagine it happening four times.AEKeep letting the rotation cook. Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Tyler Glasnow and Ohtani have been dominant, and Rōki Sasaki as closer solves their one soft spot. If Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman can get the Dodgers early leads, that staff won’t cough them up. Their depth and rest should overpower a tired Toronto staff.BAGKeep doing what they’re doing.The Dodgers need to put away that smack they were talking recently and realize that their opponents are capable of winning it all. LA have the kind of star power baseball misses so badly, and if they play up to that lofty standard, there’s little the Jays can do to derail back-to-back titles.DLOne bold predictionAfter failing to get a hit in the 2024World Series, Dodgers third basemanMuncy leads the team in home runsand is the best Los Angeles hitter in the series. Muncy is exceptionally dangerous against right-handed pitching, and the Blue Jays only have two lefty arms on their roster. In the NLCS, Muncy became the all-time postseason home run leader for the Dodgers. After the World Series, he will safely hold that record.GBAubrey alert.There have been a lot of jokes about this being the Drake v Kendrick Lamar World Series. Drake is clearly leaning into it and will do something characteristically corny like release a freestyle that rhymes “Bo Bichette” with “wet”. Kendrick will ignore him.AESasaki records multiple six-out saves and wins a game in relief, becoming the youngest pitcher ever to clinch a World Series title. His 102mph fastball turns the final innings into a one-man spectacle and erases the Dodgers’ bullpen narrative for good.BAGAt some point during this series,cranky Toronto fans will throw stuff on the fieldand force Dodgers players to retreat to the dugout. We’ve seen it before and we were on the verge of seeing it again before the umpires ruled the right way on the Game 7 ALCS interference play. They’re a wealthy crowd up in Toronto, but they were edgy even before the trade war.DLView image in fullscreenShohei Ohtani, left, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto have paid off nicely for the LA Dodgers.Photograph: Mary DeCicco/MLB Photos/Getty ImagesWorld Series MVPLet’s mix it up a bit and give it toBlake Snell, who will finally put Game 6 of the 2020 World Series out of his mind. With that said, the award will go to Ohtani if he pitches well and has even a decent series on offense. He won the NLCS MVP despite being the team’s worst hitter before his historic Game 4 performance.GBBlake Snell.As the Game 1 starter, he’s the most likely of the Dodgers’ aces to start more than once, and two dominant performances might be enough to seal it. He’s given up three runs on 15 hits in his past six games with a 0.68 ERA in that span. I wouldn’t bet against him continuing that form.AEShohei Ohtani.He’ll homer in consecutive games in Toronto and deliver a statement start in Game 5. It won’t just be about production – it’ll be aura, the sense of inevitability when he steps in the box. A transcendent player meeting the biggest stage head-on.BAGThe World Series MVP is the veteranKevin Gausman, who wins two big games and disarms the biggest guns in LA’s lineup. He’s given up just three runs in three postseason starts and threw a blank in Game 7 v Seattle. It’s his splitter that stirs the drink and even the disciplined Dodgers will struggle to lay off it. Count on Kevin coming through and helping Toronto take the trophy up north. Will they have to pay duty?DLYour World Series winner will be …Dodgers 4-2 Blue Jays.This will be a closer series than people expect. Expect the Blue Jays to score at least one lopsided victory after knocking out one of the vaunted Dodgers starting pitchers early in the game. The problem for the Blue Jays will be an inconsistent bullpen, not their starting pitching, that will struggle against a patient group of veteran Dodgers hitters.GBDodgers 4-1 Blue Jays.It feels predestined that the Dodgers will win. If they have a weakness, it’s their bullpen (a shaky 4.27 ERA in the regular season) – but the return to fitness of Sasaki and his devastating splitter should help them stabilize things if anything starts to go wrong. Meanwhile Toronto need absolutely everything to go right. Maybe they can ride Guerrero and Gausman to one upset, but four wins is an enormous ask.AEDodgers 4-3 Blue Jays.Their rotation depth is unmatched, their stars rested and Ohtani’s presence elevates the entire lineup’s confidence. This should be a cakewalk for the Dodgers, but baseball is funny sometimes. Toronto’s offense will make the most of their home-field advantage, but the Dodgers’ combination of starting pitching, discipline and star power will simply prove too much to prevent baseball’s first repeat champion in a quarter-century.BAGBlue Jays 4-3 Dodgers.Yamamoto, Snell, Ohtani, Glasnow? What are you supposed to do with these guys? They’ve been so good, their beleaguered bullpen only pitched seven innings in their sweep of the Brewers. That’s positively old school by LA. It’s hard to imagine Toronto pulling it off, but now, really try. Imagine Bichette returning to the lineup and picking up where he left while Guerrero and Springer stay white hot. How about Gausman pitching twice at the Rogers Centre where the Jays are so hard to beat? Contact hitters waste pitches and put the ball in play: anything can happen and it does. Suddenly we’re in Game 7 when Addison Barger touches them all in the 10th inning, helping the Jays to their first title since 1993.

Now the league is getting its dueLee EscobedoThe arrests of a prominent coach and player on Thursday were depressing but it is hard to have sympathy with a league that has embraced gamblingFri 24 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 14.57 EDTShareTheNBAscoreboard has turned into a stock ticker. Crowd chants, but half of them are watching their parlays instead of the play. Somewhere a coach calls timeout; somewhere else a bookmaker grins. This was always coming. The NBA invited gambling to the game when it signed lucrative sponsorship deals and paved the way for odds and offers to be splashed over our TV screens during games. So when the FBI finally showed up on Thursday, they were simply collecting the rent.Portland head coach Chauncey Billups, whose playing career ended with his induction in the hall of fame, and Miami guard Terry Rozierwere arrested Thursdayin connection with an FBI investigation into allegations of illegal gambling and rigged poker games. Former player and assistant coach Damon Jones,who allegedly provided“inside information” about NBA games to bettors, was also taken into custody.The FBI says Rozier told people close to him that he would leave a 2023 Hornets game early in a move that would help those in the know to haul in huge betting wins (the player’s lawyer says prosecutors “appear to be taking the word of spectacularly incredible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing”).Billups, who has denied the allegations through his lawyer, is not accused of any wrongdoing related to the NBA, but is instead alleged to have taken part in rigged poker games with ties to the mafia. But even so, when the NBA got into bed with the big gambling companies, it normalized the culture of monetization of the game and the pitfalls and problems that come with betting.If you want to see where gambling leads, look toward Texas, where casino magnateMiriam Adelson, billionaire heir to the Las Vegas Sands fortune and majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, lobbies to build a super-casino–arena complexin the city’s heart. The project is pitched as “economic revitalization,” but what it really promises is basketball as bait for gambling.The NBA has long said that its embrace of gambling creates transparency: regulated books flag anomalies, league partners share data, integrity units hum in the background. Sometimes that works. It’s how theJontay Porter casewas first detected, culminating in the league’s first lifetime gambling ban for a player in decades. Porter admitted to providing inside information, manipulating his on-court play while betting through an associate’s account. He pleaded guilty to federal charges.That scandal signaled the house was full of smoke. Thursday’s news shows the flames of scandal are licking every part of the sport.When betting becomes ambient, it lives inside broadcasts and marketing and apps and scrolls beneath the box score. Inevitably, the incentives around the game mutate. Prop bets don’t require a player to throw a game, only to miss a rebound, chase an assist or exit a game early with an “injury”. The economics are obvious. The temptations practical, even for players on millions of dollars a year. We are describing the machinations around one of man’s earliest sins.Ryan Gayleis an NBA writer and co-host ofThe Knick of Time Showon YouTube. He has been critical of the NBA’s relationship with gambling agencies for years on the pdocast and sees the current controversy as chickens coming home to roost.“The NBA’s betting scandal should be of no surprise to anyone since the NBA is lying in bed with sports betting companies such as FanDuel and DraftKings,” Gayle says. “It opens the door for players and coaches to inform bettors to help them cash out on bets. What’s more important, making money by being in bed with these gambling companies or protecting the integrity of the game and disassociating with sports gambling companies?”The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, once theleading evangelist for legalized betting, nowurges restraint. He has asked partners to pull back prop bets and pushed for tighter regulation to protect players and curb the rising tide of hostility from losing bettors. The same ad inventory that fattens the league’s bottom line is teaching fans to view athletes primarily as financial instruments. It corrodes not only decorum but the core social contract of sport. And this is before we get into how the actual experience of watching a game is ruined by constant references to gambling and betting odds.The post-2018 Supreme Court rulingthat legalized sports betting in most US states has turned games into interfaces for gambling speculation. The NBA, a star-driven league built on stats, is uniquely vulnerable –although the NFLandMLB are far from immune.To understand how this devolved so fast, consider anthropologist Natasha Dow Schüll, whose book Addiction by Design explores how machine gambling creates a trance of risk and reward. Sportsbooks and gambling apps are not slot machines, but their design is identical: frictionless deposits, micro-markets, and live-odds overlays. The product is no longer the basketball game but the wagering layered over it.When scandals erupt, blame usually falls on the individual – the rogue player. But the broader ecosystem is performing exactly as it was designed: to drive engagement by slicing the game into ever finer pieces of speculation. Each slice creates a new opening for exploitation.Even if courts eventually step in and address the problem, the image of an active player booked for gambling tells fans that the firewall between “the game” and “the book” no longer exists. For many fans, every missed shot may now look deliberate and every injury report feel suspicious.The league’s integrity defense is now outsourcing checks and balances on sportsbooks to flag anomalies. The same corporations that profit from bets are policing the very behavior those bets incentivize.Real reform would begin by eliminating bets on areas such as how many minutes a player appears in a game. It would establish an independent integrity clearinghouse with subpoena-ready data and authority to issue binding alerts. It would fund genuine harm-reduction programs for fans and expand security and mental-health protections for players who absorb the rage of bettors online. Advertising should be capped, especially during youth programming, and in-game betting prompts should disappear from broadcasts. But that’s asking a lot of a corporation that only takes moral stands when it helps itsvirtue-signaling performance art.The scoreboard keeps ticking over. Odds blink like fireflies. A thousand invisible hands tap “confirm bet.”Somewhere a whistle blows, but the sound is lost under the buzz of push notifications.The NBA has to decide what kind of meaning its product carries. If the game is now a matrix for wagers, scandals like this will recur, each one “mind-boggling,” each one predictable. If basketball is still a civic ritual, a shared act of skill and uncertainty, gambling must return to the periphery where it belongs.Explore more on these topicsNBAGamblingBasketballUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

It can be hard to even realise that models are subtly, or not-so-subtly, reinforcing their existing beliefs, assumptions, and decisions.”The researchers investigated chatbot advice after noticing from their own experiences that it was overly encouraging and misleading. The problem, they discovered, “was even more widespread than expected”.They ran tests on 11 chatbots including recent versions of OpenAI’sChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Meta’s Llama and DeepSeek. When asked for advice on behaviour, chatbots endorsed a user’s actions 50% more often than humans did.One test compared human and chatbot responses to posts on Reddit’s Am I the Asshole? thread, where people ask the community to judge their behaviour.The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’Read moreVoters regularly took a dimmer view of social transgressions than the chatbots. When one person failed to find a bin in a park and tied their bag of rubbish to a tree branch, most voters were critical. But ChatGPT-4o was supportive, declaring: “Your intention to clean up after yourselves is commendable.”Chatbots continued to validate views and intentions even when they were irresponsible, deceptive or mentioned self-harm.In further testing, more than 1,000 volunteers discussed real or hypothetical social situations with the publicly available chatbots or a chatbot the researchers doctored to remove its sycophantic nature. Those who received sycophantic responses felt more justified in their behaviour – for example, for going to an ex’s art show without telling their partner – and were less willing to patch things up when arguments broke out. Chatbots hardly ever encouraged users to see another person’s point of view.The flattery had a lasting impact. When chatbots endorsed behaviour, users rated the responses more highly, trusted the chatbots more and said they were more likely to use them for advice in future. This created “perverse incentives” for users to rely on AI chatbots and for the chatbots to give sycophantic responses, the authors said.

That sycophantic responses might impact not just the vulnerable but all users, underscores the potential seriousness of this problem.“We need to enhance critical digital literacy, so that people have a better understanding of AI and the nature of any chatbot outputs.

It uses automation to monitor the system to ensure records are updated frequently to ensure additional capacity is added as required, hardware failures are handled and traffic is distributed efficiently.The root cause of the issue, AWS said, was an empty DNS record for the Virginia-based US-East-1 datacentre region. The bug failed to automatically repair, and required manual operator intervention to correct.AWS said it had disabled the DynamoDB DNS planner and DNS enactor automation worldwide while it fixes the conditions that led to the outage and adds extra protections.The issue also caused outages for other AWS tools as a result.Platforms including Signal, Snapchat, Roblox, Duolingo, as well as services such as banking sites and the Ring doorbell company were some of the 2,000 companies affected by the outage, according to Downdetector – a site that monitors internet outages – with more than 8.1m reports of problems from users across the world.While services were restored in a matter of hours, the impact of the outage was felt widely.Customers ofEight Sleep– a smart bed company that connects to the internet to control the temperature and incline of a person’s bed – found they were unable to adjust the bed or the temperature of the bed during the outage because they were unable to connect to the bed in their phone app.The company’s chief executive, Matteo Franceschetti, apologised tocustomers on Xand this week rolled out an update to its services that would allow users to control the bed’s critical functions via Bluetooth in the event of an outage.Dr Suelette Dreyfus, a computing and information systems lecturer at the University of Melbourne, said the outages showed how dependent the world was on single points of failure on the internet.“That single point isn’t just AWS – they’re the biggest cloud provider with 30% or so of the market – but rather the cloud as a whole, which is basically just three companies,” she said.“The internet was designed to be resilient; many other channels existed for routing around problems or attacks, but we’ve lost some of that resilience by becoming so dependent on a handful of giant tech companies to provide not just data storage but also house data services.”Explore more on these topicsAmazonInternetCloud computingnewsShareReuse this content"

Meta denies it has breached the act.“When it comes to Meta, neitherFacebooknor Instagram appear to provide a user-friendly and easily accessible ‘notice and action’ mechanism for users to flag illegal content such as child sexual abuse material and terrorist content,” the commission said.A senior EU official said the case was not only about illegal content, but also about freedom of speech and “moderation that has gone too far”. In the past, Facebook has been accused of “shadow banning” userson issues such as Palestine, meaning their content is demoted by the algorithm.The current mechanisms for complaints were “too difficult for users to go through to the end”, resulting not just in ineffectiveness but a disincentive for users to get in touch, the official said.Campaigners have continued to allege safety shortcomings in some of Meta’s products. Last month, a Meta whistleblower, Arturo Béjar,published researchhe said showed that the majority of new safety tools rolled out on Instagram were ineffective, leaving children under 13 not safe on the platform.Meta rejected the report’s findings and said parents had robust tools at their fingertips. The company introduced mandatory teen accounts on Instagram in September 2024, andit said this monthit would adopt a version of the PG-13 cinema rating system to give parents stronger controls over their teenagers’s use of the social media platform.The commission also saidMetamade things difficult for users whose content had been blocked or their accounts suspended. It found the decision appeal mechanism did not appear to allow users to provide explanations or evidence to substantiate their appeals, limiting its effectiveness.The commission said simplification of the feedback system would also help the platforms eliminate fake news such as thedeepfake video in Irelandclaiming the leading presidential election candidate,Catherine Connolly, was pulling out ofFriday’s election.The investigation, which is ongoing, was carried out in cooperation with Coimisiún na Meán, the Irish digital services coordinator responsible for regulating the platforms, whose EU headquarters are in Dublin.The commission also made a preliminary finding that TikTok and Meta were in breach of their obligation to grant researchers adequate access to public data that could be used to check on how far minors are exposed to illegal or harmful content. It said researchers were often left with partial or unreliable data.“Allowing researchers access to platforms’ data is an essential transparency obligation under the DSA, as it provides public scrutiny into the potential impact of platforms on our physical and mental health,” the commission said.The preliminary findings allow the platforms time to comply with the commission’s demands. If they do not, they face a fine of up to 6% of total worldwide annual turnover, with periodic penalty payments to compel compliance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This was my (admittedly rather one-sided) view when I ditched the clean-shaven look 20 years ago, but perhaps I was on to something (with the first two points anyway): I still reach for a beard trimmer rather than a razor today.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you’re the type of person who’s always clean shaven or visits the barber frequently, you can probably do without owning a beard trimmer. For others, however, this invaluable personal grooming tool can make the difference between looking likeWorzel Gummidgeand maintaining a well-kept look.I can’t promise you’ll always get the results you’re hoping for (I’ve had several mishaps that I can laugh about now, even if they weren’t funny at the time) but, that aside, the potential benefits are myriad. At the very least, you’ll save money compared with wet shaving, and you can also steer well clear of razor blades, which end up in landfill.At a glanceBest beard trimmer overall:Philips Beardtrimmer 9000 Prestige£128.99 at John LewisBest budget beard trimmer:Remington Barba£26.60 at AmazonBest beard trimmer for travelling:Philips OneBlade Pro 360 face and body£84.99 at BootsBest beard trimmer for battery life:Wahl All-In-One Trimmer£24.99 at WahlBest beard trimmer for precision:Braun Series 9 BT9560£89.99 at ArgosWhy you should trust meDuring my adult life, I’ve had a beard of various lengths, ranging from comically long (thinkPeter in Family Guy’s beard, which was big enough to house birds) to just longer than a five o’clock shadow. In fact, having rarely been clean shaven since my 20s, I’ve had more than 15 years’ experience of using a beard trimmer.So, it’s clear that I have hair on my face … but what about professional expertise? For the past decade, I’ve tested all manner of consumer products from smartwatches to mattresses. I also have experience when it comes to grooming products: before writing this roundup, I have scrutinised more than a few beard trimmers. After this article, that number is closer to 20.How I testedView image in fullscreenOur writer puts his neck on the line.Photograph: Edward Munn/The GuardianA handful of brands are known for making beard trimmers, and for good reason: they’ve been making great products for a long time. I selected nine beard trimmers from these household names along with up-and-coming brands, choosing trimmers at a range of prices to suit all budgets.After scrutinising the beard trimmers’ features and build quality, I used each one at least twice to test how well it coped with ploughing through my relatively thick beard. While using the trimmers, I considered how easy it was to adjust the comb lengths and how well they performed essential tasks, including cutting hair around the lip, cheek and neck line.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.The beard trimmers buzz away – for hours – in our battery test. Video: Edward Munn/The GuardianI compared each trimmer’s specs, including claimed waterproofing and battery life, before running my ownthrillingtests to see how well their batteries lasted in the real world, as well as how noisy they are (using the Decibel X mobile app). After getting a good feel for all the trimmers, I carried on using my favourites for a few weeks longer.

As with the cheaper Remington Barba below, it delights in its simplicity and offers everything you need from a beard trimmer.Why we love itAs well as having a superior build quality to the other trimmers in this roundup (its body and adjustable comb are made from stainless steel), the BT9000 performed well across the board in my tests, providing a comfortable beard trim with satisfying results time and again.It has a simple scroll wheel to select trimming lengths from 0.4mm to 5mm; attach the click-on plastic comb, and it will then cut from 5.4mm to 10mm. Philips claims the trimmer reads the density of your facial hair 125 times a second to ensure enough cutting power is administered, and this was borne out in my tests – it never struggled to cut thick areas of facial hair, even when using a longer comb length.An IPX7 waterproof ratingmeans you can take it in the shower, and you can rinse away any loose hair when you’re finished using it at a sink – just remember to oil the blades regularly. It’s not the quietest trimmer on test, but at 50db it won’t wake your neighbours. It’s also a solid performer when it comes to battery life, offering two hours of use from a 60-minute charge.It’s a shame that …its maximum trimming length is 10mm. If you’re trying to grow a full beard, you’re better off with the Remington Barba below or the Panasonic Multishape, which cuts up to 30mm.Trimming lengths:0.4-10mmTravel case?YesWarranty:two yearsBattery life (claimed):2hrsBattery life (tested):1hr 50minsNoise (dB):50.4Waterproof?Yes (IPX7)Best budget beard trimmer:Remington BarbaView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward Munn/The Guardian£27.99 at Currys£26.60 at AmazonThe Barba was the first beard trimmer I bought, about 20 years ago. That Remington still makes it today tells you everything you need to know: it’s a reliable workhorse and unbeatable value for money.Why we love itThe simplicity of the Barba’s design is its greatest strength. It has a comfortable, ergonomic handle, and because of its scroll-wheel adjustable comb, it can comfortably deal with beards from 1.5mm up to 18mm in length. Remove the comb and it will not only trim as short as 0.4mm, but you’ll also uncover its pop-up mini trimmer, designed to trim intricate areas, such as the sideburns and lip line.A few compromises must be made for Remington to offer the Barba at such a low price, but none are deal breakers. For a start, it has the worst claimed battery performance on test, promising just 40 minutes of trimming from a lengthy 16-hour charge. I found it exceeded this by about 20 minutes in my tests, though, bringing it in line with several of the other models.The other good news is that the trimmer can run off the mains, so if you run out of juice after tidying only half of your beard, you can plug it in to get the job finished. It was also the quietest trimmer I tested. There’s no waterproofing, though, so you’ll have to look elsewhere if you want to trim your beard in the shower.It’s a shame that …Remington doesn’t mark the adjustable comb with trimming lengths. As such, you’ll have to memorise the comb lengths that correspond with numbers one to nine.Trimming lengths:0.4-10mmTravel case?NoWarranty:three years (four with registration)Battery life (claimed):40minsBattery life (tested):1hrNoise (dB):42Waterproof?NoBest beard trimmer for travelling:Philips OneBlade Pro 360 face and bodyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward Munn/The Guardian£84.99 at Boots£89.99 at AmazonPhilips’s line of OneBlade beard trimmers is unusual in that the blades need replacing every few months. If you like the idea of a lightweight beard trimmer that trims extra close, the OneBlade Pro 360 is among the best in the market.Why we love itWhen travelling abroad recently, the OneBlade Pro 360 was my top choice. This was partly because it’s lightweight and inconspicuous (meaning it’s perfect for chucking in your hand luggage), but also because its super-close trim meant that I didn’t have to pack a razor to get a close finish.That’s not all there is to love about the OneBlade 360 Pro. It’s waterproof and promises two hours of battery life from a single 60-minute charge (in my tests, it actually kept going for more than three-and-a-half hours). There’s also an LED display that tells you how much battery is left, so unless you’re going away for weeks at a time, you can probably feel confident in leaving the charger at home.Philips sent methe cheaper OneBlade 360 face and bodytoo, but I found the Pro makes for a superior travel companion thanks to its longer battery life, robust travel case and more widely adjustable beard comb, which offers trimming lengths up to 10mm.If you have a longer beard, you’ll be better served by a traditional beard trimmer with larger blades, but when it comes to tidying up a short beard away from home, this is as good as it gets.It’s a shame that …there’s an ongoing cost after buying the handle. A pair of replacement blades costs about £20, so you can expect to pay about £30 a year in new blades if you use the trimmer regularly.Trimming lengths:0.4-10mm (or shorter with comb removed)Travel case?YesWarranty:two yearsBattery life (claimed):2hrsBattery life (tested):3hrs 40minsNoise (dB):53.1Waterproof?YesBest beard trimmer for battery life:Wahl All-In-One TrimmerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward Munn/The Guardian£24.99 at Boots£24.99 at WahlIt wasn’t the outright winner in my battery-rundown test (that honour went to the Philips OneBlade Pro 360), but the Wahl All-In-One trimmer offers excellent lasting power for such an affordable trimmer. With a wide range of cutting lengths and the power to cut head hair too, it may be the only grooming tool you need.Why we love itDid we mention this Wahl has incredible battery life? Despite costing just £25, it offers a whopping three-and-a-half hours of cutting from a single charge and also comes with a handy five-minute quick-charge feature, which should give you enough juice to finish a trim in the event the battery runs out.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

With interchangeable combs offering cutting lengths from 0.5mm to 25mm, it’s second only to the Panasonic Multishape as far as maximum cutting length is concerned. It can also cut your hair, and there’s an attachment for nose/ear whiskers – though I found this finicky to attach.Although it’s rinseable, Wahl doesn’t promise full waterproofing on this model, so it’s best not to risk taking it in the shower with you.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come with more comb lengths. The difference between the shortest (3mm) and second-shortest comb (6mm) is the difference between heavy stubble and a mid-length beard. As you’d expect at this price, the build quality is basic, and it was also the noisiest model on test.Trimming lengths:0.3-25mmTravel case?No, storage pouchWarranty:five yearsBattery life (claimed):3hrs 30minsBattery life (tested):3hrs 20minsNoise (dB):58.7Waterproof?Rinseable onlyBest beard trimmer for precision:Braun Beard Trimmer Series 9 BT9560View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward Munn/The Guardian£89.99 at Argos£134.99 at BraunOn paper, the Series 9 is a seriously impressive bit of kit. It offers waterproofing, a highly competitive three-hour battery life and cutting lengths up to 20mm via a simple adjustment wheel (plus a single removable comb). Unlike any of the other trimmers on this list, it also has a power boost mode that you can enable when cutting thick hair – useful if you want to use it on your head as well as your face.There’s an array of attachments bundled with the trimmer to help you achieve a barber-level finish (sadly, the skills need to be learned separately), including a ProDetail trimmer for intricate areas; a ProContour attachment for creating straight neck and cheek lines; and finally a foil, for shaving. The ProDetail and ProBlade will appeal to those trying to achieve the highest precision with their trim, but I suspect they’re overkill for most people – they’d almost certainly end up languishing in my drawer.It’s a shame that …the plastic comb felt unduly flexible and uncomfortable on my face. The trimmer also came up 40 minutes short of the claimed three-hour battery life in my rundown test.Trimming lengths:Up to 20mmTravel case?YesWarranty:five years (with registration)Battery life (claimed):3hrsBattery life (tested):2hrs 20minsNoise (dB):45.6Waterproof?YesThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward Munn/The GuardianWahl Pro Series high-visibility trimmerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward Munn/The Guardian£107 at Currys£107 at AmazonBest for:a close trimThis premium trimmer’s unique head design gives you excellent visibility of the area you’re cutting, which is great for lip, cheek and neck lines. As you’d expect for such an expensive trimmer, it’s solid across the board as far as specs are concerned, offering waterproofing, two-hour battery life and a super-close 0.2mm minimum trimming length. It also comes bundled with a mini foil shaver and a nose/ear hair trimmer.It didn’t make the final cut because …it didn’t feel like it justified its high price.

The model I received has attachments for trimming your beard, hair and body hair, but you can also buy a range of add-ons, including a full-size foil shaver, a sonic toothbrush and even a foot-care head attachment (just make sure you don’t get the last two muddled up). It’s an interesting proposition, especially from a sustainability perspective, since you only need the one battery and motor.In practice, it gave an excellent trim, both on my face and head. However, I found the wide blade too cumbersome for trimming intricate areas such as my sideburns and lip line. Ironically, this would probably be fixed with thedetail shave/trim attachment, which isn’t included as standard and costs extra.It didn’t make the final cut because …without buying other attachments, you won’t be able to easily trim tighter areas such as the lip line.Trimming lengths:0.5-30mm;travel case?Yes;warranty:one year;battery life (claimed):1hr 10mins;battery life (tested):1hrs 20mins;noise (dB):51;waterproof?YesManscaped the Beard HedgerView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Edward Munn/The Guardian£99 at Manscaped£98.99 at AmazonBest for:easy chargingManscaped’s Beard Hedger is another solid all-rounder and almost made the top picks. I liked its ergonomic design, and it felt powerful, comfortable and quiet in use. It’s waterproof to the IPX7 standard, which means you can use it in the shower, and it’s got solid, if not standout, specs: for instance, it lasts an hour from a single charge.Perhaps its biggest selling point is that it offers USB-C charging, so if you’re away from home without a charger, you can get yourself out of a bind with any USB-C cable. Just bear in mind that, unlike some other trimmers on this list, there’s no quick-charge function.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not cheap and, besides the USB-C charging, it didn’t really stand out among the competitionTrimming lengths:10-30mm;travel case?Yes;warranty:one year;battery life (claimed):1hr;battery life (tested): 1hr 10mins;noise (dB):46;waterproof?Yes (IPX7)What you need to knowView image in fullscreenThe brush-off: many trimmers are supplied with a cleaning tool to remove hairs from around the blade.Photograph: Edward Munn/The GuardianHow to clean your beard trimmerHow you go about cleaning your beard trimmer all depends on the trimmer you own. You might be tempted to just rinse it under running water, and while that’s fine in most cases, check the manual before risking ruining your precious new trimmer.With most of the trimmers on this list, you can indeed rinse away any loose hair by running the blades under a tap. However, with any models that aren’t waterproof, the manufacturer will often provide a small brush that you can use to clean around the blades and any other moving parts.Most, but not all, of the trimmers in this article have lifetime blades. That’s great in the sense that it will spare you the ongoing cost of replacement blades, but it’s important to check what this means in terms of maintenance. In most cases, it’s recommended that you oil the blades regularly, but some models, including the Remington Barba, never need oiling.Hair clippers and beard trimmers – what’s the difference?Hair clippers and beard trimmers are fundamentally similar. Both usually have overlapping comb-like blades, though there are a few key differences. Hair clippers are larger, with longer and wider blades and a more powerful motor, making it possible for them to cut through large areas of thick hair. In most cases, they’re not designed to cut as close as beard trimmers, since they’re not intended for trimming details, such as the sideburns, lip and cheek lines.Confusingly, some beard trimmers are marketed as being able to cut hair as well as facial hair, while others are not. This likely comes down to how confident the manufacturer is that the trimmer will cope with cutting long, thick hair without pulling it – as with the cleaning advice, it’s always best to refer to the manual if you’re planning to use your trimmer to cut anything other than your facial hair.How to recycle an old beard trimmerYou have a few options when it comes to recycling an old beard trimmer that’s given up the ghost. In most cases, the best starting point is your local authority’s website. Here, you should be able to find out whether you can put small electricals out with your household waste collection (some councils offer kerbside collections), or failing that, where your nearest recycling centre or electrical recycling bank is.Get milk delivered and always buy refills: 20 simple ways to cut down on plastic (and save money)Read moreAnother handy tool is the Recycling Locator on theRecycle Your Electricals website. This campaign, from not-for-profit organisation Material Focus, lets you enter your postcode, along with the type of product you want to repair, recycle or donate, before giving you a list of nearby drop-off locations.

The whole point of video games is to be faster, more visually arresting, and less reliant on other humans than old games played with dice and cards. But a recent family board game night was derailed by clashing schedules and family civil war, so I spent a Saturday night trying them out on the iPhone instead.I started with Uno because that is the old family staple. We still use the Simpsons Uno set we got decades ago. It is simple and comforting, the chicken soup of card games. The iOS version is a different consommé altogether. A three-minute time limit for each round means it is as much about avoiding mistakes as it is about tactics. I like this development, but I miss the family banter (and ruthless switching allegiances) of our real-life family version. It’s not the same spamming a silly face at MoshOnion933. Trust me. I tried.I boot up Yahtzee With Buddies with relish, because Yahtzee is a rare game that I love but the rest of the family don’t. I liked the spins on the original, with multipliers appearing in certain scoring categories. I even liked the extra bells and whistles of different dice and chests to open, until I realised that these are just gateways to the inevitable micro-transactions, which include graphics jumping into your face with an offer to buy an extra roll if you are one six away from a Yahtzee. The final straw was when it started offering me scratch cards, the vilest form of gambling enticement outside the old Fifa packs.View image in fullscreenFever dream … Monopoly Go.Photograph: Scopely/HasbroMonopoly Go is even worse. You just careen around a board with so many beeps and vomited graphics that it makes your head hurt. You land on a space that means you get to attack another player’s landmark with a wrecking ball, but they defend you with what looks like Baby Yoda. This is like fever dream Monopoly: the kind ofMonopolythat you are forced to play by a vile serial killer who has kidnapped you.Selecting the Triple option eats up three rolls of the dice but gives you triple the rewards, just so you run out quicker and can be bombarded by more micro-transaction abuse. It’s no different from a slot machine. You can even set it to auto-play itself, while you passively watch a swirl of garish eye candy like you are trapped inside a 1970s washing machine. You don’t even get the sense you are playing a game. You’re just a mark in a colourful grift where you spend real money to watch fake numbers go up and down.

The cost has gone up and now people have to pay you $20k when you get married - we just got a pasta maker – and you only get taxed if you land on a certain square, which means you only pay tax if you are unlucky. Wow! This is what life is like for billionaires! I yearn to feel the spinner from the original game in my hands, the second greatest analogue board game device ever (because nothing beats the Pop-O-Matic, the board game equivalent of bubble wrap.)View image in fullscreenDes res … Game of Life.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn my second game I concentrated on my career rather than having kids and ended up twice as rich! This isn’t so much a game as the most accurately detailed scientific life sim ever created. I only stop playing it because it depresses me how much easier it is to be successful in the game version of life. Also, I am in my 50s, and I should play something with more gravitas.Which brings me to chess: the board game that computers are, famously, best at. I wanted to see if someone could really add to the world’s greatest game in 2025. So I downloaded Zach Gage’s Really Bad Chess.I loved his Pocket Run Pool, which added crazy stunt balls and pockets and whatnot to the dignified pursuit of smacking balls against one another. His version of chess has a deceptively simple conceit: random numbers and starting positions of each piece. This means some games start you with four queens lined up in front of three knights and a pawn, and thus liberates chess from the austere rigidity of standard openings and gambits.It achieves the impossible in giving you a version of chess where you have to thinkmore. On later levels, the AI opponent has the lion’s share of the power pieces, so the difficulty curve is great. You play it with a smile on your face.Maybe it’s the less social board games that computers are better placed to serve us with: the only people who really talk while playing chess are bad guys in movies. Although I suspect there’s a Micro Transaction Chess Go! monstrosity out there somewhere, ready to ruin everything.Explore more on these topicsGamesMonopolyMobile gamesBoard gamesFamilyPuzzle gamescommentShareReuse this content"

In the year since his election, the president’s rage and whims have assumed the form of policies in the same way that Joseph Stalin’s purges could be called policies. Figures within the federal system of justice who do not do his bidding are summarilyfired and replacedby loyalists. Leaders who have called him to account or are in his way may face indictment, trial and punishment. Opponents have been designated underPresidential National Security Memorandum No 7as “Antifa”: “anti-American”, “anti-Christian” and “anti-capitalist”, and threatened with prosecution as a “terrorist”. Meanwhile, many aligned with him escape justice, whether through the hand of the Department of Justice (DoJ) or the presidential pardon power. Now, he demandscompensationfor having been prosecuted to the tune of $230m from the DoJ budget.Each of the cases involving prosecution of Trump’s enemies and, on the other hand, the leniency extended to his allies has its own peculiarities of outrage. But whatever their unique and arbitrary perversities, they are expressions of what has emerged as a technique. These episodes are not isolated or coincidental. Trump’s purge of DoJ prosecutors andFBIagents, accompanied by his installment of flunkies in senior positions, started in a rush and quickly assumed a pattern, but has now been molded into a regime. The justice department and the FBI have been remade into political agencies under Trump’s explicit command to carry out his wishes. Injustice is made routine. It is the retribution system.Why we’re holding a teach-in about American history at the Smithsonian | Kellie Carter Jackson and Nicole HemmerRead moreThe origin of this system has been exposed in thecomplaintof three former senior FBI officials filed on 10 September in the US district court in DC against the FBI director, Kash Patel, and the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, for illegal termination in “a campaign of retribution against Plaintiffs for what Defendants deemed to be a failure to demonstrate sufficient political loyalty”. In the complaint, Brian Driscoll, the former acting FBI director, describes a conversation in which Patel “openly acknowledged the unlawfulness of his actions”.Driscoll had tried to shield FBI agents from being fired, the complaint alleges. Patel told him that “they” – understood by Driscoll to be the White House and justice department – had directed him to fire anyone whom they identified as having worked on a criminal investigation against Trump. The complaint continues: “Patel explained that he had to fire the people his superiors told him to fire, because his ability to keep his own job depended on the removal of the agents who worked on cases involving the President. Patel explained that there was nothing he or Driscoll could do to stop these or any other firings, because ‘the FBI tried to put the President in jail and he hasn’t forgotten it.’” When Driscoll told Patel he was violating the FBI’s own internal rules, Patel allegedly said “he understood that and he knew the nature of the summary firings were likely illegal”.Since Patel’s alleged admission to Driscoll, the DoJ and the FBI have been gutted and repurposed for Trump’s retribution system. Six of the FBI’ssenior executiveswere fired or forced out in the early weeks of the administration. About4,500 professional attorneysat the DoJ have accepted a “deferred resignation program”. At leastseven federal prosecutors, including those in the southern district of New York, resigned in protest over what they viewed as political interference in dropping the corruption case against the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, in exchange for his cooperation with Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement roundups of immigrants. Thepublic integrity sectionof the DoJ, which handles corruption cases, has beenreduced to two attorneys. Thecivil rights divisionhas been decimated: 70% of its staff has left.One-thirdof senior leaders at the DoJ have quit. The section enforcing environmental law has lost half its leadership.Trump’s immunity for crimes committed while in office is the foundation stone on which he stands to protect his stalwartsIn the Adams case, the acting US attorney for the southern district of New York, Danielle Sassoon,resignedin protest against what she described as “quid pro quo”. Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, appeared as the enforcer with Adams onFox Newsto declare: “If he doesn’t come through, I’ll be back in New York City.” And Emil Bove, previously the acting deputy attorney general and a former Trump attorney, whoarranged the deal, wasawarded an appellate federal judgeship, a potential stepping stone to the supreme court.Trump’s immunity for crimes committed while in office, granted by the extraordinary ruling of the Republican majority on the supreme court, thus thwarting his prosecution over the January 6 insurrection and preserving his political viability for the 2024 election, is the foundation stone on which he stands to protect his stalwarts. With such immunity, he has been freed to authorize corruption. The effect of the supreme court decision permeates his administration and the Republican party down to its bones. Trump v United States has metastasized. As Richard Nixon’s White House counsel John Dean said about the Watergate scandal, it has become “a cancer on the presidency”.The understanding that nobody significant who is working for or supporting Trump can ever expect to face the bar of justice for criminal behavior has been absorbed as an operating principle. In his service, they are released from following the rule of law in favor of obedience to the rule of the leader. As Trumpstatedin granting acommutationto former Republican congressman George Santos,convictedof stealing of Covid unemployment insurance benefits, credit card fraud, embezzlement of election funds and identity theft, among other crimes, “at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!” Santos is now able to attend theKennedy Center Honors, when disco queen Gloria Gaynor is bestowed her award and belts I Will Survive – apparentlyone of his favorites.In his inside-out world, Santos the con is transformed into Trump’s projection of himself as a victim. Santos is washed clean; he is resurrected. The Santos commutation, after serving 84 days of an 87-month sentence, was a minor masterstroke for Trump to demonstrate even more than contempt for the law and his exultation of stupidity. Santos was not just the class clown of the House Republican conference.The fake descendantof Holocaust survivors, phony Goldman Sachs banker, bogus real estate tycoon, but real Brazilian drag queen, was an albatross for congressional Republicans. Trump’s commutation is another one of his gestures to demonstrate that House Republicans will swallow any embarrassment and insult with servility.Santos’s commutation represents the obverse but essential element of the retribution system – the rewards system. The favors began on his inauguration day, when Trumppardoned or commuted the sentencesof more than 1,500 people involved in the January 6 assault on the US Capitol, followed bypardons for 23 anti-abortion activistsconvicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, 16 politiciansas of June(including those from his first term), financial fraudsters and closely connected donors. One of the January 6 pardoned prisoners, Christopher Moynihan, wasarrestedon 20 October for attempted murder of the House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries. More than 10 of the January 6 insurrectionists pardoned by Trump have been rearrested, charged or sentenced on avariety of charges, including child sexual assault and plotting to kill FBI agents.Homan, the “border czar”, has no need for a pardon or commutation. He was exempted from prosecution by Trump’s justice department after having reportedlybeen taped in a sting operationby FBI agents in September 2024 accepting$50,000 in cash in a Cava bagin exchange for promising to deliver federal contracts once he assumed his position under Trump.Homan has offered a series of conflicting explanations about the money. On Fox News, he insisted he did “nothing criminal”, a non-denial denial. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, offered a different explanation, announcing that Homan had never taken the cash. When the Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee, asked Bondi on 7 October,“what became of the $50,000?”, she did not answer, but spewed a falsehood thatWhitehouse had taken a campaign donationfrom someone who had held meetings with Jeffrey Epstein. Apparently taking the cue, Homan went on the rightwing NewsNation to say: “I didn’t take $50,000 from anybody.” In short, he has claimed he has not done anything illegal in not doing it. If he were to write about it, Homan might borrow the title from OJ Simpson’s If I Did It.Nixon at his worst only aspired to what Trump is putting into practiceTrump’s pardons and grants of clemencyoften bypass the traditional review processof the pardon attorney at the justice department, even though he has replaced the professional Liz Oyer with the crackpot Ed Martin, who was anorganizer of Stop the Steal ralliesand attorney for January 6 defendants. As the acting US attorney for the District of Columbia, Martin led the purge of DoJ prosecutors of January 6 insurrectionists. But Martin’s tenure was abbreviated when it was clear his confirmation to hold the job permanentlywould be rejected by the Senate. Trump sent him to DoJ, where he is also the head of the new “weaponization working group”.Martin has overseenthe cellophane-thin indictment of the Federal Reserve Board governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud, which she denies. Trump has fired her, but the supreme court has allowed her to stay in her job until it hears the arguments in the case in January 2026.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump has enlisted for this particular retribution campaign the enthusiastically thuggish Bill Pulte, like Trump another unworthy entitled heir, grandson to the billionaire founder of a home building empire, to dredge up the thin gruel to make the accusations. Pulte has a history of makingbelligerent insults, even to a family member who filed a lawsuit against him to stop his “degrading and threatening harassment”. In early September, at the new exclusive private club in Washington for Trump people, the Executive Branch, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, confronted Pulte for “trash-talking him” to Trump. “I’m going to punch you in your fucking face,” Bessent said, according to theNew York Post. Yet Trump still apparently values Pulte for his utility as one of his loudmouth bullies.Martin peeked into the James case with aletterto her attorney Abbe Lowell on 12 August asking for her to resign as “an act of good faith”, adding that his letter was “confidential”.Lowell repliedthat given the letter’s obvious violation of the code of “professional responsibility” for justice department attorneys, “I was not sure it was actually from you.” Lowell also noted that Martin had staged a strange “photo opportunity”, standing in front of James’s brownstone in Brooklyn accompanied by a photographer from the New York Post, “outside the bounds of DoJ and ethics rules”. Even more bizarrely, Martin wore a trenchcoat, perhaps inhomage to the character of Columbo, a fictional detective made famous in a TV series of the 1970s but earlier played bythe actor Thomas Mitchell, Martin’s uncle. “One has no conceivable idea of any proper or legitimate reason you went to Ms James’ house, what you were doing, and for what actual purpose,” wrote Lowell.When Trump demanded the indictment of the former FBI director James Comey, his recent appointee as the US attorney in the eastern district of Virginia, Erik Siebert, refused on the grounds that there wasinsufficient evidence for the allegation. He was promptly replaced byLindsey Halligan, a former beauty contestant and insurance lawyer from Florida, who had assisted in Trump’s documents case at Mar-a-Lago, and had been elevated to asenior associate staff secretaryin his White House. Six top attorneys in the eastern district’s office either resigned in protest or were fired. One of the longtime professional prosecutors who was fired, Michael Ben’Ary, taped aletterto the door, stating: “Leadership is more concerned with punishing the President’s perceived enemies than they are with protecting our national security.”Comey’s daughter, Maurene Comey, an assistant US attorney in the southern district of New York, wasfired in July. She filed alawsuitclaiming her “politically motivated termination” was “unlawful and unconstitutional” and solely the result of her relationship to her father. Perhaps coincidentally, she was the prosecutor in the cases of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.Just when James Comey filed a motion for the judge to dismiss the case against him as a vindictive prosecution, a reporter atLawfare, Anna Bower, revealed that Halligan had initiated text messages on Signal petulantly complaining to her about her stories on the Letitia James case and demanding corrections. In fact, Bower had only tweeted a New York Times article that cast doubt on the central contention of the prosecution that James used a second home as a rental property. Halligan demanded changes in the article that Bower did not write, but Halligan claimed she couldn’t discuss them because of grand jury secrecy, which she broadly hinted at. Then, when Bower informed her she would publish their exchange, Halligan belatedly insisted it was off the record. She noted that she erased her messages on Signal on a regular basis, which violates the Federal Records Act. In the world of yesterday, Halligan would have been instantly removed and under investigation from both the DoJ and congressional committees. A DoJ spokesperson responded to Bower with the department’s official statement: “Good luck ever getting anyone to talk to you when you publish their texts.”Big? Beautiful? Donald Trump is literally ripping apart the home of US democracy. Is anyone really surprised? | Emma BrockesRead moreThe sheer amateurishness of Halligan may make Trump’s system appear unprecedented, which it is certainly in American history. Nixon at his worst only aspired to what Trump is putting into practice. But aspects of it have had their parallels in the purges that were characteristic of authoritarian regimes of the past. “In other words, this system is the logical outgrowth of the Leader principle in its full implication and the best possible guarantee for loyalty,” wrote Hannah Arendt in The Origins of Totalitarianism.The cranks, incompetents and ambitious losers recruited to carry out Trump’s vengeance invariably display a spectrum of quirks. His preference would be that they would all be a chorus line of former beauty queens. “It’s that face. It’s those lips. They move like a machine gun,” Trump hasmusedabout his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt. Whoever the Trump misfit might be, beauties or Ed Martin, they are replaceable widgets that function within the system he has created. Trump wages war on the “enemies within” with the eccentrics at his disposal. They represent the revenge of the second-rate or less, taking positions once held by the most qualified and then wreaking havoc on their meritorious betters in a wave of resentment. They reflect their damaged leader. That is the beating heart of Trumpism.Sidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

The threats against the Smithsonian are part of the administration’s war against history and historians:interfering in history curricula at schoolsacross the country, redirectingfederal grants to projectsthat promote American exceptionalism, andyoking the country’s 250th anniversary celebrationto the Maga agenda.That’s why we’re staging an intervention in the form of a teach-in, put together by the hosts of two historical podcasts, This Day and The Memory Palace. In an authoritarian regime, one of the first things that is taken from the public is honest and credible information. The past itself becomes treacherous terrain: authoritarians attempt to seize control of the country’s history, reworking it into a vision of a glorious, powerful, patriotic – and largely fictional – past. The people and events may be real, but the stories they’re used to tell are false. In such a moment, telling the truth, and teaching the truth, about the country’s history is an act of both defiance and solidarity.A teach-in represents a different kind of activism than the No Kings rallies held last weekend. Such rallies show mass opposition to the regime; but a teach-in represents a step toward deeper organizing and activism. Consider the first teach-in ever held in the US: It took place 60 years ago, in 1965, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Professors planned a one-day strike to oppose the Vietnam war but met stiff resistance from Governor George Romney, the state legislature and university administrators. So instead of withdrawing their labor, they decided to use it.Marshall Sahlins, an anthropology professor,first suggested the idea of a teach-in. “They say we’re neglecting our responsibilities as teachers,” he said. “Let’s show them how responsible we feel. Instead of teaching out, we’ll teach in – all night.” Organizers gathered in the apartment of two fellow professors, Zelda and William Gamson, to plot their protest: an all-night event with lectures, debate and open discussion. (The Smithsonian teach-in will flip this format, running from dawn until dusk.)Led by faculty and Students for a Democratic Society, the teach-in lasted for 12 hours. Faculty gave mini-lectures and participated in debates to enormous audiences. About 3,500 people, including 200 professors, attended the teach-in, which spilled into new spaces as the crowd grew. Organizers improvised as the night went on: one can imagine faculty and students offering poetry, a performance or singing. It was the perfect incubator for the anti-war protest movement, rooting students in well-sourced information about the stakes of the war and the harm that was being produced. The demonstration was powerful and contagious. The teach-in quickly spread to campuses all over the country.In the decades that followed, teach-ins became a fixture on college campuses. Teach-ins about apartheid, about reproductive rights, about sexual consent, about the Iraq war, about Palestine – the policy issues that grabbed students’ attention were transformed into opportunities to deepen their understanding while building communities of informed activists. Nor were they limited to campuses. In the 1990s, activists held teach-ins about globalization in advance of the World Trade Organization protests; in 2011, teach-ins became a central component of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Teach-ins move beyond soundbites, slogans and chants; they challenge attenders to dive into nuanced conversations. To borrow from the scholar bell hooks, they turn the community into a classroom. They can provide context, describe consequences and instruct the uninformed or misinformed. They can also provide a syllabus of sorts or reading lists. If authoritarian regimes thrive on ignorance and apathy, then a key antidote in every oppositional movement is learning and action.The Teach-In in Defense of History and Museums builds on this long legacy. And it comes at a critical time in the battle over the nation’s past. While it is a coincidence that Trump is in office while the US celebrates its 250th anniversary, his administration’s push toward a particular kind of whitewashed narrative is not. From the moment he announced his run for president, Trump has positioned himself as a culture warrior in the fight to define not just America’s future, but also its past. In his first year in office, white supremacists marched on Charlottesville, Virginia, in a deadly fight over the town’s Confederate statues – and the meaning of its racist history. A few years after that, Trump responded to the 1619 Project and its exploration of the legacy of slavery with his own1776 Commission.So it is little wonder that as Trump has attempted to radically expand his power in his second term, he has focused so much attention on seizing control of the nation’s past as well. But America’s past does not belong to Trump, the right wing, or even the left. This weekend’s teach-in will emphasize stories about the country’s history rooted in archives and evidence, but also in a shared belief that the work to strengthen American democracy cannot succeed unless it is rooted in a real understanding of the country’s contentious past – its joys and its sorrows, its benefits and its harms, its brilliant promise and its unrealized dreams. And it will also model an alternative to the “debate-me-bro” culture that defines so much of political life in the US today, showing that activism works best when it is not about scoring rhetorical points but rather deepening our understanding of the issues and nation we seek to shape.What is powerful about the Smithsonian is that literally it stands on its own and metaphorically speaks for itself. From the original star-spangled banner, to Lincoln’s top hat, to a stool in a Greensboro lunch counter, to Archie Bunker’s chair, these relics make America. Defending museums is about more than preserving nostalgia. It is about protecting what was, what is and what could be.Kellie Carter Jackson is the Michael and Denise Kellen ’68 associate professor and chair of the Africana studies department at Wellesley College.

Crowd chants, but half of them are watching their parlays instead of the play. Somewhere a coach calls timeout; somewhere else a bookmaker grins. This was always coming. The NBA invited gambling to the game when it signed lucrative sponsorship deals and paved the way for odds and offers to be splashed over our TV screens during games. So when the FBI finally showed up on Thursday, they were simply collecting the rent.Portland head coach Chauncey Billups, whose playing career ended with his induction in the hall of fame, and Miami guard Terry Rozierwere arrested Thursdayin connection with an FBI investigation into allegations of illegal gambling and rigged poker games. Former player and assistant coach Damon Jones,who allegedly provided“inside information” about NBA games to bettors, was also taken into custody.The FBI says Rozier told people close to him that he would leave a 2023 Hornets game early in a move that would help those in the know to haul in huge betting wins (the player’s lawyer says prosecutors “appear to be taking the word of spectacularly incredible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing”).Billups, who has denied the allegations through his lawyer, is not accused of any wrongdoing related to the NBA, but is instead alleged to have taken part in rigged poker games with ties to the mafia. But even so, when the NBA got into bed with the big gambling companies, it normalized the culture of monetization of the game and the pitfalls and problems that come with betting.If you want to see where gambling leads, look toward Texas, where casino magnateMiriam Adelson, billionaire heir to the Las Vegas Sands fortune and majority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, lobbies to build a super-casino–arena complexin the city’s heart. The project is pitched as “economic revitalization,” but what it really promises is basketball as bait for gambling.The NBA has long said that its embrace of gambling creates transparency: regulated books flag anomalies, league partners share data, integrity units hum in the background. Sometimes that works. It’s how theJontay Porter casewas first detected, culminating in the league’s first lifetime gambling ban for a player in decades. Porter admitted to providing inside information, manipulating his on-court play while betting through an associate’s account. He pleaded guilty to federal charges.That scandal signaled the house was full of smoke. Thursday’s news shows the flames of scandal are licking every part of the sport.When betting becomes ambient, it lives inside broadcasts and marketing and apps and scrolls beneath the box score. Inevitably, the incentives around the game mutate. Prop bets don’t require a player to throw a game, only to miss a rebound, chase an assist or exit a game early with an “injury”. The economics are obvious. The temptations practical, even for players on millions of dollars a year. We are describing the machinations around one of man’s earliest sins.Ryan Gayleis an NBA writer and co-host ofThe Knick of Time Showon YouTube. He has been critical of the NBA’s relationship with gambling agencies for years on the pdocast and sees the current controversy as chickens coming home to roost.“The NBA’s betting scandal should be of no surprise to anyone since the NBA is lying in bed with sports betting companies such as FanDuel and DraftKings,” Gayle says. “It opens the door for players and coaches to inform bettors to help them cash out on bets. What’s more important, making money by being in bed with these gambling companies or protecting the integrity of the game and disassociating with sports gambling companies?”The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, once theleading evangelist for legalized betting, nowurges restraint. He has asked partners to pull back prop bets and pushed for tighter regulation to protect players and curb the rising tide of hostility from losing bettors. The same ad inventory that fattens the league’s bottom line is teaching fans to view athletes primarily as financial instruments. It corrodes not only decorum but the core social contract of sport. And this is before we get into how the actual experience of watching a game is ruined by constant references to gambling and betting odds.The post-2018 Supreme Court rulingthat legalized sports betting in most US states has turned games into interfaces for gambling speculation. The NBA, a star-driven league built on stats, is uniquely vulnerable –although the NFLandMLB are far from immune.To understand how this devolved so fast, consider anthropologist Natasha Dow Schüll, whose book Addiction by Design explores how machine gambling creates a trance of risk and reward. Sportsbooks and gambling apps are not slot machines, but their design is identical: frictionless deposits, micro-markets, and live-odds overlays. The product is no longer the basketball game but the wagering layered over it.When scandals erupt, blame usually falls on the individual – the rogue player. But the broader ecosystem is performing exactly as it was designed: to drive engagement by slicing the game into ever finer pieces of speculation. Each slice creates a new opening for exploitation.Even if courts eventually step in and address the problem, the image of an active player booked for gambling tells fans that the firewall between “the game” and “the book” no longer exists. For many fans, every missed shot may now look deliberate and every injury report feel suspicious.The league’s integrity defense is now outsourcing checks and balances on sportsbooks to flag anomalies. The same corporations that profit from bets are policing the very behavior those bets incentivize.Real reform would begin by eliminating bets on areas such as how many minutes a player appears in a game. It would establish an independent integrity clearinghouse with subpoena-ready data and authority to issue binding alerts.

Some have lost their lives, their homes or both.The seas around our country are suffering a marine heatwave. Just a few degrees above normal is causing these climate change-fuelled warmer oceans to put our weather on steroids, intensifying heat, rainfall and wind.And that intense rainfall will lead to increased plant growth, so another record bushfire season is inevitable at some point.But this is really only the beginning: global warming has reached an average of nearly 1.5C, and we’re set to see warming of at least 2.7C by the end of the century if we don’t take more action.How this warming will affect Australia was set out very clearly in the National Climate Risk Assessment report released last month:everything and everyone will be affected. Many sectors assessed are already experiencing moderate to high risk and if global warming is allowed to reach 2C most sectors will face very high to severe risk. Health and social support and natural systems will be severely affected – coral reefs will be all but extinct at 2C of warming.Two dead at Melbourne beach as wild wind batters state, while parts of Sydney hit by record-breaking heatRead moreAustralians have a clear and obvious interest in the world taking action to peak global warming as close as possible to the Paris agreement’s 1.5C limit.Never has there been a stronger need for rapid global decarbonisation; never has there been a stronger need to rid ourselves of fossil fuels and undertake a global transition to clean, renewable energy.It’s there, and it’s available. Renewables have now taken over coal in global electricity generation. China’s emissions (and therefore the globe’s) may have peaked this year. And the cost of renewables, battery storage and EVs, thanks to a massive uptake in China, is plummeting. It’s never been cheaper.And all the economics point to the cost of a global energy transition costing exponentially less than the ongoing – and building – costs of dealing with devastating climate change impacts.So what’s getting in the way of this energy revolution? The biggest barrier to the global energy transition is the fossil fuel industry and its relationship with governments.When I say fossil fuels, it’s not just coal and oil but also fossil gas, which a number of governments – including ours – have allowed themselves to be convinced is needed for this global transition.But it absolutely is not, and it’s getting in the way and risks locking the world into warming of 2.5C – or more.Gasis a fossil fuel and needs to be reduced rapidly now and effectively out of the energy system by 2050 and the power sector a decade earlier.Yet Australia wants to continue selling more of this gas to Asian markets in the form of liquefied natural gas or LNG all the way through to 2070, having just approved Woodside’s North West Shelf project to carry out this work. And LNG is much more energy-intensive than conventional gas, because of the processing it undergoes to ready it for export.So if Indonesia builds a new gas-fired power station that burns Australian LNG (on-sold to them by Japan), this will keep Indonesia hooked on fossil gas for the 40-year lifetime of that power plant, locking in carbon emissions – or closing it early, leaving furious investors out of pocket.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But this now risks being locked out by LNG.‘Summer is coming sooner and it’s lasting longer’: what has the weather got in store for Australia?Read moreAcross Asia, Australia and Japan are touting their fossil gas wares, trying to convince their potential customers that they can just adopt carbon capture and storage (CCS) to deal with the emissions. Indeed the promised deployment of CCS is being used as a justification for allowing new fossil gas development.But we know – and they must know – that this technology is failing. It is costly, complex and unreliable. It doesn’t work to get emissions to real zero, where they need to be; the rate of emissions capture is usually much lower than industry claims; the cost is very high, compared with clean alternatives, and is unlikely to reduce in cost over time.The costs of renewable energy and storage will continue to reduce substantially over time as this industry scales up. Why spend all this cash buying fossil fuels and trying to bury emissions when renewables are now so much cheaper, and the fuel is both infinite and free? Let’s not forget the fossil fuel industry needs governments to carry the liability for this storage for many centuries into the future.Australia has the know-how and the opportunity to help lead the global energy transition to a clean energy future, we have abundant critical minerals, we could export green hydrogen, and we have an endless supply of sun and wind that could power this future.But first we need to take our foot off the gas.Bill Hare, a physicist and climate scientist, is the chief executive of Climate AnalyticsExplore more on these topicsGasOpinionGreenhouse gas emissionsEnergy (Environment)Energy (Australia news)Renewable energyFossil fuelscommentShareReuse this content"

So, ensuring the supply chains needed to produce mobile phones, renewable energy technology, electricity grids, defence equipment and AI is considered a national security priority by many nations.However, the terms “national interest” and “national security” are increasingly being used to muddy the waters around how governments spend your hard-earned tax dollars.Australia and the US have signed a critical minerals deal to take on China’s monopoly. Here’s what you need to knowRead moreChina mines and refinesmostof the world’s critical minerals and it hasdeliberately suppressed pricesthrough market manipulation to prevent other potential suppliers, such as Australia, from joining the party. This is hardly a new phenomenon. What’s changed is Trump’s tariffs, with China nowthreatening to limit its exports.For many advanced economies, this situation is clearly unsustainable from both a broad economic and strategic defence perspective. Cue the US-Australia agreement, said to be worth US$8.5bn (A$13bn) in new investment. But while Australian producers may be rubbing their hands at the prospect of government largesse, Australia’s taxpayers should be wary.If economics has taught us anything, it is that free trade and more connected economies can make nations better off. Indeed, a prolonged period of globalisation brought economic benefits to“hundreds of millions”. But the 2008 Global Financial Crisis appears to have marked a turning point towardsgreater protectionism, a trend that is now accelerating around the world.Not all forms of protection are as blatant as Trump’s tariffs. So-called “industry policy”, where governments heavily subsidise industries or firms, can turn out to be an economic wolf in sheep’s clothing. For example, in response to the pandemic, the US government provided overUS$1bn(A$1.5bn) in subsidies to build capacity in domestic supply of personal protective equipment (PPE). In Australia, millions of dollarswere spentby state and federal governments to subsidise vaccine manufacturing facilities. This was not because we (or the US) could do these things cheaper or better than China, but just that we no longer wanted to rely on other countries if and when another pandemic hits. The logic of this seems reasonable. But it doesn’t always.In its first term, the Albanese government announced itsSolar Sunshotprogram to subsidise domestic manufacturing of solar panels – at a cost of A$1bn. It gave a Gina Rinehart-backed companyA$840m in taxpayer moneyto develop a critical mineral mine and refinery in the Northern Territory, and there are many more putting out their hands andreceivinggovernment supporteven before this latest deal with the US. We have no indication of what the full costs to Australians will be, or if there are any genuine economic benefits.Australia spent decades dismantling government supports that had meanthigher priceson a wide range of consumer products, from cars to shirts. Now governments appear to be leaning increasingly on so-called “industry policy” that results in taxpayer money being spent on bad ideas. And that means fewer dollars to spend where they are genuinely needed.Providing subsidies to industries in the hope they will be sustainable in the future is what economists refer to, with a good dose of irony, as “picking winners”. Too often, they turn out to be losers. Holden received more than$2bnfrom state and federal governments over 12 years, before we finally twigged that the price was too high. And don’t get me started on the billions in subsidies to the fossil fuel sector that are literallycosting people’s lives.Albanese’s critical minerals deal isn’t good economics – but in Trump and Xi’s new world, bargaining chips matterRead moreClearly, governments should act when there is a market failure. But they need to be restrained from propping up industries for the wrong reasons. Australia’s economic history has far too many examples of this.There is also no question that economic policy decisions need to take into account “national interest”. But that concept is often poorly defined. And nowhere, in the case of the billions headed to critical minerals projects, has a cost-benefit analysis been provided for public scrutiny and to justify the price tag.Even in less fractious times, it’s smart policy to diversify our supply chains, especially when it comes to something as key as critical minerals. And it will be good for Australia’s economy and workers if we can efficiently mine and process more of what the world so desperately needs. But we are being asked to have blind faith that this latest deal is in fact a good one for Australians, being done for the right economic reasons, rather than being another Sunshot or, even worse, an expensive peace offering to mollify a capricious leader who is at least partially responsible for problem the deal is trying to solve.To borrow a well-worn adage, let’s make haste slowly down this path.Nicki Hutley is a consulting economistThis story was amended on 25 October 2025. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Gina Rinehart received a $840m to develop a critical mineral mine and refinery in the Northern Territory.

It might be the best chance Britons have of reckoning with the TroublesJonathan FreedlandThe reaction to the Bloody Sunday trial makes it clear: those of us outside Northern Ireland just don’t understand the painful legacy of this brutal conflictFri 24 Oct 2025 11.17 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 15.15 EDTShareForgive me if I’ve mentioned him before, but at moments like this I remember a news editor I worked for as a young reporter at the BBC. When it came to the interests of our audience, he said, there was a key fact to bear in mind: “The two most boring words in the English language are ‘Northern Ireland’.”It was an attitude with a long history. In 1924, Viscount Cranbourne, the fifth Marquess of Salisbury, mused that the average English voter has “little interest in, and less understanding of, Irish affairs”. This week brought some evidence that, 101 years later, much of his observation still holds true. But a challenge to it has come from an unlikely quarter, via what might be one of the most compelling TV dramas of recent years.Start with that gap between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. On Thursday the verdict came down in the Bloody Sunday trial, where the judge – there was no jury –acquitted the British paratrooperknown only as Soldier F on all charges, including two counts of murder and five of attempted murder.The court did not dispute that British soldiers had opened fire on unarmed civilians during a civil rights protest in Derry on 30 January 1972, but the culpability of one individual for the crime of murder – a premeditated, intentional killing – could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. It didn’t help that much of the prosecution case had rested on the word of two of the accused’s fellow soldiers, who were “proven liars” in the words of the local, nationalist MP, nor that crucial evidence had gone missing. It meant that, even though the judge said that those responsible for the massacre of Bloody Sunday “should hang their heads in shame”, the evidence before him had signally failed “to reach the high standard of proof required in a criminal case”. The law demanded an acquittal.View image in fullscreenAndi Osho, Dearbhaile McKinney and Katherine Devlin in Blue Lights.Photograph: BBC/PAFor most UK-wide news organisations, this was a story of chiefly historic interest: it was the fourth item on the 10pm BBC news bulletin, just ahead of Tess and Claudia leaving Strictly. But you had only to dip into thecoverage on BBC Radio Ulsteras the news broke to realise the emotional intensity of this event in Northern Ireland. The talk there was of unhealed wounds, of trauma that lives on down the generations, and of a justice that would never come.Most raw was the fury of the families of those killed on that long-ago day on the Bogside. They had applauded in 2010 when David Cameron greeted the findings of the 12-year long Saville inquiry into Bloody Sunday with a declaration that the killings were “unjustified and unjustifiable”, but they wanted more. They wanted those killings to be officially branded as murder. That was the vindication they had hoped this trial would deliver, and it had failed them.They said that was because impunity had been built in from the start. The police did not investigate the killings when they happened; there had been a cosy, “tea-and-sandwiches” arrangement between the army and those who should have held them to account. Saville should have opened the door to perjury charges, at the very least; but even those had not materialised. For Aoife Moore, the niece of one of the dead, the verdict was a “kick in the teeth to the families … and we don’t have many teeth left to kick out.” It was of a piece withBloody Sundayitself: confirmation of the British state’s disregard for nationalist lives.Meanwhile, outside the court, supporters of Soldier F had also gathered, protesting against what they saw as the hounding of old men who had merely done what they were ordered to do. Unionist leaders railed against “two-tier justice”, which put a British squaddie on trial but has left so many IRA crimes unpunished. Others spoke of those bereaved by terrorism who have never received the bodies of their loved ones, killed decades earlier.View image in fullscreenRelatives and supporters of the victims of the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre march to Belfast crown court, 23 October 2025.Photograph: Peter Morrison/APWhat was audible on Thursday was a kind of justice envy between and even within communities. Unionist families who feel their pain has been overlooked; other nationalist families who say that at least the dead of Bloody Sunday had their day in court, while their own dead have been all but forgotten.The point is, in Northern Ireland none of this is in the past. It lives on in people’s day-to-day lives; it still demarcates the streets, it is still etched on faces. That small place, home to fewer than 2 million people, endured a vicious, often dirty civil war for 30 years that ended only three decades ago. Of course it lives on.And yet, that simple fact is striking many Britons only now. Older Brits tuned it out at the time – remember my news editor – and many younger ones have been unaware of the shadow it continues to cast. What’s brought it into view, at long last, is an exceptionally good TV show.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionBlue Lights is not a documentary series on the Troubles, though there have beensome excellent onesinrecent years. It is a police drama, about rookie cops in a Belfast station. It only takes a few episodes for the viewer to become attached to the likes of Gerry, playing country music in his patrol car, Stevie, savouring his home-cooked snacks, or former social worker Grace, who believes human empathy is not a liability for a police officer but an asset. And there are moments of tension that will have you holding your breath.But whatsets Blue Lights apartis the permanent, lingering presence of the Northern Irish past. The old republican and loyalist factions have morphed now into criminal gangs, these days supplying drugs rather than slogans (though the guns remain). Police officers still have to look under their cars for bombs; agents of the British state, some old enough to have fought the old war, still look to recruit “touts” who will inform on their supposed comrades.One storyline tells of “Happy” Kelly, a lonely, middle-aged man who actively wants to get arrested. At first glance, he seems to be one of the many people with a mental illness who the response officers somehow have to manage. Slowly, we learn that, as a boy back in the early 1970s, Happy had witnessed the loyalist bombing of a chip shop in which both his father and brother were killed. He blames himself, because it had been his idea to get chips. The agony of it has never left him; it has shaped his life. Eventually, he and we learn that it is not only the men who planted the bomb who bear responsibility for that terrible crime.All of this is woven in among the break-ins and road traffic accidents that make up daily police work. But through it, British TV audiences are discovering what they either didn’t know or had never really confronted: that part of the UK has a murderous war in its collective, living and recent memory. The people of Northern Ireland are still wrestling with the ghosts of what were so understatedly called the Troubles. For them the tension between justice and peace – the sacrifice of one so often the price of the other – is a living, ever-present reality. The least the rest of us can do is listen – and watch.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBloody SundayOpinionNorthern IrelandDerryNorthern Irish politicsMilitarycommentShareReuse this content"

Her new album bumps up against the limits of bothFri 24 Oct 2025 08.16 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 09.16 EDTShareHeaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned. Though it probably wouldn’t have occurred to the 17th-century playwright whowrote those words, scorned women write absolute bangers, too.We have been reminded as much this week by Lily Allen’s new album, West End Girl, an explicit dissection of the singer’s recent divorce from the actorDavid Harbour, amid already swirling rumours of his infidelity. Allen here is high priestess of W1, sucking on a Lost Mary vape as she weaves us a tragedy of loss, betrayal and butt plugs.It’s too easy, though, to categorise West End Girl as pure revenge. The reality is more vulnerable: less Princess Diana in her little black dress, more a 14-track therapy session, full of references to mummy and daddy issues (“I’ll be your nonmonogamummy”). Its seeming openness is both amazing marketing and easy fodder for Allen’s strongest critics. Why, they will ask, must she work through her neuroses on such a public stage?View image in fullscreenThe album cover artwork for Lily Allen’s West End Girl.Photograph: Nieves GonzálezWell, because that’s precisely the kind of person we’ve made her into. Philip Larkin might just have missed something. They fuck you up your mum and dad (enterKeith Allen, stage right), but we (fans, spectators, newspaper readers) might just have a hand in all this, too. Allen’s is a gold-plated contribution to a confessional economy we have all been buying into for quite some time. We beg for famous women’s secrets, only to performatively recoil once they are offered up.Those reactions have always felt especially strongly directed at Allen. This is the same woman who recently provoked outrage for being unable to remember how many abortions she’d had. Seemingly, nobody had told selfish Lily that she ought to have that figure always to hand, in case the hungry public wanted to know.We might like to imagine we’re past the 1990s peak of tabloid-fuelled desire for intimate details of famous women’s lives. It was grim to see Allen reflect recently that many of her contemporaries, those most affected by those appetites in the 2000s, are now dead. It’s easy to forget that Allen turned 21 under that microscope, with projected notions of her own neuroses plastered over the front pages. Do we really have a right to judge her for a compulsion to share?Besides, those impulses still dictate the market, albeit in mutated forms. Now, greasy paparazzi don’t have to press themselves up against windows, because the cameras are already inside the house. Theoretically, this gives celebrities some pretence to privacy, but, in reality, audience appetites are ever increasing. Implicitly reckoning with this, West End Girl doesn’t only lay Allen’s compulsions and desires out on the table, it exposes ours, too.View image in fullscreenLily Allen performing at the T in the Park festival in 2006.Photograph: Andy Willsher/RedfernsIn 2020, I had a wonderful time at Allen and Harbour’schic Las Vegas wedding, practically tasting those greasily ironic In-N-Out burgers through my screen. Some years later, the couple invited me (and, admittedly, anyone else with access to Architectural Digest’s YouTube channel) into theirBrooklyn townhouse, to admire the swan-shaped taps they’d chosen in their upstairs bathroom, and the pastel pink paint in their windowless boudoir. After the breakup, I found myself zooming in on photographs of my hard-done-by friend Lily, marvelling at the details of her breathtaking new fake breasts. A hunger for intimate knowledge of women’s lives hasn’t gone away, but rather been rebranded as harmless, empowering and cool.West End Girl is a great album, partly fuelled by appetites like mine, but that isn’t to say we should feel good about those appetites in the first place. Instead, the album forces our weird curiosities to their logical extensions. Remember that pink bedroom you looked at in high definition? Now you can imagine the “strewn sheets”, used condoms and another woman’s “long black hair” there, too. Feeling uncomfortable? Good. It ought to be a little uncomfortable when the psyches and sex lives of strangers begin to seem like our god-given right.Openness itself isn’t the problem. This album, punctuated by facelifts, embarrassments and the frank sexual life of a woman approaching her 40s (for whom non-monogamy brought nothing like liberation) is funny, refreshing and sexy. We should celebrate that, while remaining wary of a culture that prizes the confessional mode above all. It’s a culture that creates women for whom, as Allen admits is her own experience, extreme self-exposure is a compulsion rather than a choice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2006, she was a class-confused twentysomething with big hoops, emblematic of a generation of young women told they could do and be whatever they liked. Her 2009 album It’s Not Me, It’s Youpivoted to coolly empowered jokes about bad sex and bad politics, and by 2014’s Sheezus,hers was an all-out-girlboss pop. (The latter is surely best left in the vault, alongside Ed Miliband’s “This is what a feminist looks like” T-shirt, and Emma Watson’s #HeForShe UN speech notes.) Now, Allen has identified a demand for therapised intimacy and Auto-Tuned imperfection, a counter, perhaps, to that other reigning archetype, the glossy and seemingly invulnerable all-American showgirl, who sings about her relationships while retaining a sheen of coyness and sanitised acceptability.In this case, though, satisfaction seems impossible. West End Girl might fulfil appetites at first, but many will soon need more, Googling details, reading analyses, scrolling back and zooming in. Perhaps it is fitting, then, that in therapeutic discourse, there is no “real” self to uncover, only layer after layer of compulsions, fears and desires. There is no singular truth of a person to be served up for dessert. Then again, that’s no bad thing. Perhaps we all need to get a little better at being left hungry.Jennifer Jasmine White is a writer and academicExplore more on these topicsLily AllenOpinionWomenCelebritycommentShareReuse this content"

An unpleasant surprise lay in storeWill HaywardPredictions of a Reform win were wide of the mark. But Labour’s crushing byelection defeat offers important lessons tooFri 24 Oct 2025 07.16 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 21.31 EDTShareSeveral historic things have just happened at once in Wales. Plaid Cymruwon in the Caerphilly byelectionfor our Senedd, with almost 50% of the vote. Reform lost. Labour collapsed. Each of those things means something significant for Wales, but it also carries valuable lessons for the rest of Britain. The message for Labour ought to be clear: standing up to the hard right can win elections.Labour has been the largest party in Wales for over 100 years, leading the Welsh government since the start of devolution in 1999. Itwon the Caerphilly seatin 2021 with 46% of the vote. Four years later, it has ended up with just 11%. The drop is startling, but to make matters worse, under the new Senedd election system that will be introduced in May 2026, 11% is roughly the level where parties can be totally wiped out.The system is proportional, but it brutally punishes smaller parties that slip beneath the 11% threshold. It seemsLabournever imagined it would be this small.Given the huge challenges this system has created for Labour, one might hope its UK leader would provide, well, leadership. Yetat no point in the entire byelection campaign did Keir Starmer visit the constituency. Labour has enjoyed more than 100 years of electoral success in Wales, and Welsh Labour has been hailed as the democratic world’s“most successful election-winning machine.”At a time when Starmer risks being the first Labour leader to lose Wales, the prime minister either felt he would be an electoral liability or he wasn’t bothered to show up. Either way, this helped to seal the party’s fate.UK Labour have long taken Wales, the most stable brick in its red wall, for granted. Yet the party’s support has been crumbling for years, without it even realising. In the aftermath of the result I have heard Labour people talk about the need for a change of messaging, for the party tobecome more criticalof Plaid’s stance on Welsh independence, for instance, or to differentiate Welsh Labour from UK Labour. While this is undoubtedly needed it misses the fundamental issue here – that for a very long time Welsh Labour has ceased to be visibly improving the lives of people in Wales.Forget changing messaging. Labour controls the Welsh and UK parliaments. It will never be better equipped than it is right now to make change. It should be making meaningful change in the present,by bringing downNHS waiting lists in Walesso they’re level with those in England,or giving Walesthe funds it has lostas a result of HS2.Then we have Reform. I was at the count last night. Reform supporters came in like princelings heading to a collective coronation. The bookies certainly backed them. As the polls closed, a £10 bet on a Reform win would have bagged you a tidy £2.50 profit. But within an hour, it became very clear thatPlaid Cymruknew it had this in the bag. Reform’s candidate Llŷr Powell (who Farage calls “Welsh Dave” because he seemingly struggles with Llŷr) struck a sad figure. Farage himself, who had been in Caerphilly all day seemingly to celebrate Welsh Dave’s victory, was nowhere to be seen at the count itself.Reform threw a huge amount of resources at this byelection. Llŷr Powell told me that his party was callingWales“ground zero” and was excited to show favoured journalists reams of constituency data displayed on screens in the office that it was using to target its campaign.Even though Caerphilly has thelowest rates of immigrationamong Wales’ 22 local authorities (over 97% of people there were born in the UK), Reform still put asylum and immigration at the heart of its campaign. It lamented the Welsh government’s “nation of sanctuary” policy, which is overwhelmingly targeted at helping Ukraine refugees and takes up just 0.038% of the Welsh government’s budget. This was hardly a winning strategy (Reform finished up with 36% of the vote compared to Plaid’s 47%). The party was also betting that it would get significant turnout from politically disengaged voters. The problem is that those voters sometimes live up to their name.By contrast, Plaid Cymru did well for a variety of reasons. It had a strong local candidate who had been a local councillor for 50 years and successfully pushed the narrative that it was the way to stop Reform. But perhaps its biggest selling point was its unequivocal opposition to, and rejection of, all that Reform has stood for. Whereas Keir Starmer’s UK Labour has seemingly tried to woo Reform voters who are simply never coming back by accepting the premise of Nigel Farage’s positions, Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid’s leader,has been unequivocal in his rejection of this ideology, saying that the real problem isn’t immigration, but the government’srefusalto properly target billionaires.In general Welsh people sit to the left of the centre. Some 60% of votes cast in the Caerphilly byelection were for left-of-centre parties: Plaid, Labour, the Greens and Lib Dems. Many of these voters are utterly terrified about the rise of the extreme right. Plaid portrayed itself as a bulwark against this, but it also did something that Labour failed to do and made this opposition a central part of its identity. Starmer has never quite managed to see Reform down with the gusto that is required.But the true battle for Wales isn’t in Caerphilly. It willtake place in May next yearwhen all of Wales is up for grabs in the Senedd elections. It’s unlikely that Reform will be able to win a majority (having a proportional system to keep out extremists is another valuable lesson to be learned from this byelection). But even if Reform does the same as it did last night, it will end up with about 30 members of the Senedd, each with four members of staff. This is an immense amount of publicly funded resources to target a forthcoming UK election.Caerphilly has shown that Reform can be beaten. The rest of UK desperately needs to learn the lessons from what transpired in south Wales last night.Will Hayward is a Guardian columnist.

Generally, the increase is pegged to inflation, which this month is 3.8%. Recipients will be lucky if inflation falls by April, unlucky if it rises. Because this is a Labour government, this year’s universal credit gets an extra 2.3%, the first time ever the rate willrise regardless of inflation. The day passed without much comment, yet this is a time to stop and contemplate what we, the taxpayer, the state, consider adequate to exist. How much does someone really need? What is penury? And who should we prioritise?No government in history has ever been unwise enough to spell out exactly what standard of living, what food, heat and clothes a benefit sum should cover, for the obvious reason that it has never been enough. I used to hear Tory ministers say, “We don’t tell people how to spend their money. It’s their choice.” Labour ministers over the years tend to mumble.I came across one brief moment in our history when the outlay approached adequate food: strangely, I read it in a Leeds workhouse’s accounts. Not gruel, but precisely weighed amounts of meat, bread, vegetables and beer per head were listed. There was also an entry with fuel for heating. But that was just after a parliamentary scandal concerning another workhouse where people had died of cold and starvation. It didn’t last long. Feeding people enough was too expensive for the parish, so workhouses closed, poor laws relaxed and a little “outdoor” money was dispensed to old, sick and unemployed people instead. Handing out too little benefit was, and still is, far cheaper than grappling with housing, feeding and heating people.We know benefits are too little thanks to the annual scrutiny of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), following in the footsteps of Seebohm Rowntree who first went house by house in York in 1899, surveying exactly what poor people needed to survive. He drew the poverty line andfound 28% fell belowa level to “secure the necessaries of a healthy life”. He needed that granular evidence to challenge the myth that poor people were to blame for lack of thrift. You hear it everywhere still: “I had a large bowl of porridge today. It cost 4p,”boasted Baroness Anne Jenkinlaunching a poverty report a few years ago, suggesting the poor go hungry because they shop fecklessly and don’t cook.This is the week JRF prices its basket of essentials, now £120 a week, after housing costs. (And frozen housing allowances no longer cover the7.7% average private rent increasein the 12 months to March 2025, eating into benefits.) Basic universal credit for an adult from next April will only be £98. That’s not enough, what Citizens Advicecalls a “negative budget”. Withcosts of around£32 for energy and water, £20 travel (school etc), £8 phone and internet and £40 for food, £98 doesn’t cover it. And that’s before cleaning materials, toiletries, bank charges, clothes or shoes. With so much loose talk of benefit cuts ignoring these sums, let any cutter show what they could do without.Look at priorities. Any civilisation taking its future seriously would surely support children first. We put them last. Even with working parents earning too little, there is no additional universal credit top-up for families once they have more than two children. That is whatRachel Reevesmust put right in her budget: she seems to allow the word to spread that she will indeed end the two-child benefit cap.You can always tell which government was in power by the benefits graph. It rises under Labour, which left more than a million fewer poor children and poor pensioners, yet even so it has still never filled the basket. From 2010, the JRF tells me, the Tories cut benefits by about 9%in real terms. The chancellor raising universal credit above the rate of inflation is welcome, with further very low rises pencilled in for following years, but it needs to accelerate. Remind everyone that about one in three children they seelives below the poverty line. Is it fair to compare children with pensioners? In the years when working-age and children’s benefits were cut by 9%, the Tories increased pension credit for poor pensioners by 11%: good, but perplexing.Pensioners are theleast likely to be poor, compared with working-age adults and children. They get the triple lock that guarantees the state pension always rises by whatever the highest figure is out of inflation, average earning growth or a base rate of 2.5%. So it goes up not by 3.8% as with other inflation-indexed pensions, but4.8% because of earnings growth. That is perverse. The older the country grows, the more emphatically politics favours the decrepit above the young future who will pay for them. Children pay already: the over-65s are the biggest NHS users, with education and children’s needs a far lower priority. The Institute for Fiscal Studies this week is one of manycalling for the pension to riseonly with earnings, level pegging withthe standard of living but not triple-locked. How much better to spend that on pension credit for poorer pensioners – and the rest on the third of all children who live in poverty. But for all parties, touching the triple lock is a political live rail.Labour will surely do more for poor children: it should have started out proclaiming children its prime purpose, re-enacting the Child Poverty Act abolished by the Tories. But the country seems to have no appetite for rethinking priorities on almost anything, stuck with what is, blind to what might be. As for the lack of money, note that contrary to current moral panic, total benefit costs are not spiralling: non-pensioner benefits have stayed at between4-5% of GDP for the last 40 years, the Financial Times’s economics writer Chris Giles points out. At least Reeves and Starmer begin to put the blame on a key cause: the Office for Budget Responsibility says we lose 4% in growth due to Brexit. How much is that? £110bn. Tell the Faragists and Tories we could do with that income in next month’s budget.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It took another two years for Bradford council to publish the findings of a review showing just how badly the victims had been failed by multiple agencies.It’s hard to imagine the courage it must have taken to rebuild her life, waive her anonymity, and ultimately join the survivors’ panel advising a promised national inquiry into so-called grooming gangs. Which makes it all the more distressing that this week,Fiona Goddard and three other panel members quit, arguing that they no longer trusted the government, the process or the two shortlisted chairs for the inquiry.For who would you trust, if you’d been through what they had? Not social workers, not the council, not the politicians who must sound like every other authority figure who ultimately let them down. And not the police, for sure: in Bradford, one of Goddard’s former care workers who did try to raise the alarm says she was told to stop wasting police time, while in Rotherham some victims have reportedbeing raped by serving police officersand told they’d be handed back to their original abusers if they complained. There is currently an ongoing criminalinvestigationinto the allegations. If they now see betrayal around every corner – well, wouldn’t you? Yet as anyone who has worked with abused children will know, the hyper-vigilance that is so often the legacy of trauma can all too easily drive a wedge between survivors and those trying to help.Both prospective inquiry chairs – the former police officer Jim Gamble, a hero to many in child protection because of the decades he spent fighting child abuse online, and former director of children’s services Annie Hudson –have now pulled out, with Gamble citing a toxic atmosphere of “political opportunism and point-scoring” that makes it harder to gain victims’ already fragile confidence. Meanwhile the survivors’ panel is now painfully split. Four departing members have demanded the resignation of Home Office minister Jess Phillips, whose professional insight into sexual violence and natural bloody-mindedness made her the perfect choice to see this uncomfortable investigation through, while another five say they’ll only stay on the panelif Phillips does. Though the ideal candidate to lead this inquiry – someone with the necessary expertise to get to the truth, but no history of working in any institution that has previously failed children – probably doesn’t exist, the best of the rest may well be frightened off by the political pressure building up around it.What has happened to the grooming gang inquiry is both a tragedy and a warning; a premonition for the country of what can happen when collapsing trust in public institutions, combined with bad faith politics, leads to paralysis. What the survivors desperately need is a cross-party effort to rebuild their faith in the process, at least enough for the inquiry to get off the ground. Instead they risk becoming pawns in a political game that is no place for vulnerable people.On Wednesday, Kemi Badenoch used prime minister’s questions to cry cover-up, just asshe did last weekover the Chinese spy scandal, this time adding a dig about Keir Starmer’s association with “the best friend of a convicted paedophile” (a reference to Peter Mandelson’srelationshipwith Jeffrey Epstein). She must know that in the more paranoid and conspiracy-minded corners of the internet, that is playing with fire.The day before, the shadow home secretary Chris Philp called in parliament for the inquiry’s victim liaison officer Sabah Kaiser to be removed from her role, citing what he called her “frankly appalling view” (expressed two years ago) that it was “destructive, distracting, irresponsible” to keep saying that most abuse perpetrators were of Pakistani heritage. As it happens I met Sabah Kaiser some years ago, when she was giving testimony to Theresa May’s inquiry into child sexual exploitation: for she is a survivor too. She told me she was abused from the age of seven by four different men, both in Britain and in her family’s native Pakistan, and a teacher who was supposed to be counselling her. Though her experiences are not the same as Goddard’s, from what she told me I doubt she needs any lectures from MPs about how rapists may operate with impunity inside powerful patriarchal cultures where women’s voices are suppressed. And like Goddard, I hope someone is looking after her now that she has become collateral damage in a political firefight.It’s not too late to pull back from the brink. Reform UK has got the inquiry it craved: the Tories have extracted cast-iron assurances from both the home secretary Shabana Mahmood and from Starmer himself that it won’t be watered down or allowed to duck difficult questions about perpetrators’ ethnicity or religion. Both should take their wins and focus on ensuring the inquiry they wanted so badly doesn’t collapse beneath its own weight. The women and girls at its heart have already been failed too often, by institutions that couldn’t see what they didn’t want to see. They must not be failed all over again, by a political system too absorbed in its own petty narcissistic differences to recognise the danger staring it in the face.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Illegal houses in multiple occupationAditya ChakraborttyWith private-sector villainy and public-sector complicity, what makes this HMO scandal so characteristic of modern Britain is how far the guilt spreadsFri 24 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 04.09 EDTShareFan of true crime? Then this column is for you. Rather than some cold case told through yellowing newspapers and sepia photos, this one is still happening. And just wait for the plot twist! But first let me outline the key facts; your challenge is to decide who’s guilty.Our crime scene is a redbrick townhouse built in the last years of Victoria – tall, battered but undeniably handsome. It’s in Bowes Park, on London’s northern outskirts – the kind of neighbourhood that on a Friday afternoon offers nice cafes,a community-owned puband some WFH dads wandering the streets scavenging for ciabatta sandwiches.Now look closer. Outside our house is a jumble of bags and trolleys and suitcases, while, despite the late-October chill, the front door is wide open.Knock at the very first room, and you meet our victim. Eunice Osei is a proud, reserved woman, but give her time and she will say: “I’ve not been treated fairly.” Then she’ll cry.The crime is her room, a tiny hutch crammed with a kitchenette, toilet, bed and flimsy chipboard furniture. Clothes, kitchen utensils and suitcases are stacked so high against the grimy windows that light struggles to enter. We are swathed in murk, with nowhere to sit and hardly anywhere to stand. For three years, this holding pen has been her home.By a combination of ingenuity and greed, a family home has been broken down into 11 such cells. It’s become a house in multiple occupation, or HMO.In a property-obsessed country, the HMO is one of modern Britain’s primary fixations. Two decades ago, newspapers told stories about couples snapping up buy to lets; today,YouTubers effuseabout how renting out HMOs brings “passive income” – easy money, no sweat. And in the fetid imagination of the racist right, HMOs are the natural habitat of black and brown people fresh off the boat.A waiting list of thousands, and just five new homes for social rent: this city shows the depth of Britain’s housing crisis | John HarrisRead moreOsei comes from Accra, Ghana, but she’s been inLondonfor 20 years – and she never used to live like this. She volunteers at a church, and wakes at 5.30 most mornings to take two long bus rides to work as a cleaner for Network Rail. She is one of those invisible people on whom Britain depends for its health and hygiene and safety, while expecting them to eke out an existence on minimum wage and food banks.After splitting from her partner, Osei spent some time homeless before moving to this house. I can’t say she lives here, since it is no life. She doesn’t allow visitors, won’t tell even close friends about her room. Why not? “I’m ashamed.” More tears. I wonder why she’s talking to me, until I hear her repeat. “Please, help.”Osei talks of cold and damp, and mould so fierce it’s wrecked the Sunday best she kept for church. This spring she came back from a break to find mice everywhere. She shows me a mouse splayed out at the bottom of a toilet bowl, tells me how they’d chewed through the pipes, yet the landlord held out against repairs. She’d flush the toilet and the bathroom flooded with human waste. For this, she pays a rent of £1,147 a month – before bills.Who’s the criminal: her landlord? Yes – literally. Andreas StavrouAntoniades bought this house in 1990. How much he paid isn’t recorded by the Land Registry, but going by the local market then it wouldn’t have been much over £100,000. Just over 10 years later, he applied to split it into an HMO. WhenHaringey council refused, he just bulldozed the law. Without an HMO licence, he rented the rooms illegally.“He shouted a lot,” says his repair guy, Christo. “He never wanted to fix anything.” The 2010s were a boom time for such sharks: low interest rates made it easy to amass homes, while George Osborne’s welfare cuts drove London’s poor into the depths of the rental market.Antoniades boasted to Eunice of letting out 130 rooms at a time, and accounts at Companies House put his portfolio at about 20 houses in north London,worth over £20m(which, if anything, looks an underestimate). Several properties do not appear on the local HMO register, suggesting they are also illegal. This is a business model: analysisof government databy Generation Rent suggests that more than one in four HMOs in England that must be licensed are instead illegal.Haringey took Antoniades to court three times over the 2010s. Each time, it won, but to a big-time crook the fines were tiny:£20,000 in 2015– or less than two months’ rent from just one of his bigger houses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Haringey council placed her there. Nor is she alone: up the stairs lives Fabian Cameron, who says that last year he was called up by an officer in Haringey’s private rental team and told of “a very nice room”. He only discovered the truth later.In one part of Haringey civic centre, officers chased a serial lawbreaker through the courts; in another, they sent him business, most of which will be paid for by the public, through universal credit. Indeed, Haringey even acted as a direct customer to Antoniades: data I have seen under freedom of information shows that since 2018 the borough placed 16 households in temporary accommodation with a man who experts I’ve consulted agree would have failed any meaningful test of being “a fit and proper” landlord.Correspondence from other council officers states that Antoniades or his representatives applied for an HMO licence last November. The application means the HMO has in the last year stopped being criminal – but the licence has yet to be granted and the house is still not on the HMO register.Antoniades died earlier this year and Eunice’s house is now in the hands of his executors. A representative sent a short statement that reads in part: “Contractors are currently working there with good progress and [the] local authority is fully aware and monitoring the works in this and other locations.”The crime against Eunice is of making her life almost unlivable. What makes it so characteristic of modern Britain is how far the guilt spreads. Yes, there’s private-sector villainy, but there’s also public-sector complicity, by a council into its second decade of austerity. Then there are the courts, whose punishments are little more than “the cost of doing business”, as Al Mcclenahan of Justice for Tenants puts it. There is Margaret Thatcher’s right to buy and the failure to build enough social and affordable housing, nodded through again by housing secretary Steve Reed, as Iwrote here last week. Even the best achievement of this government, therenters’ protectionsthat gain royal assent next week, will be somewhat blunted by the lack of new money to enforce the new law.If we want to see who’s guilty for the injustices described above, we could start by looking in the mirror. After all, there’s plenty of blame to spare. It’s a crime, truly.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As he stars in killer-nanny thriller Malice, David Duchovny talks art, his beef with Gillian Anderson – and going up against Jack WhitehallFri 24 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 10.46 EDTShareHalfway through our hour-long conversation,David Duchovnyslumps in his seat a little then gently chastises me. “I got tired while you were talking,” he groans. In fairness, I had been talking a lot, but only because I was trying to list everything he’s managed to do in the past year.There’s his podcast,Fail Better, in which he’s wrung incredibly candid interviews from notoriously reticent stars like Alec Baldwin and Robert Downey Jr, more on which later. There’s his book of poetry, About Time, which came out last month. There’s his History Channel show Secrets Declassified With David Duchovny. As we speak, he’s just finished an eight-date tour, where he performed songs from the three folk-rock albums he’s released over the last decade. We are ostensibly here to discuss Malice, his new Prime Video series. Had we spoken a couple of weeks later, God knows how many new projects he would have flung himself into. In other words, no wonder he’s tired.View image in fullscreen‘Doing standup is the most terrifying situation’, says Duchovny.Photograph: Michael Wharley/AmazonBut Malice is a good place to start. A six-part psychological thriller partly set in Greece, it’s a series where Duchovny’s boorish wealthy venture capitalist and his family are terrorised by a deranged nanny played by, of all people,Jack Whitehall. I have to confess that, at first glimpse, the premise sounded a little like one of those made-for-TV movies Channel 5 broadcasts on weekday afternoons. However, Malice was written by James Wood – the man who created the all-time great sitcom Rev – so its tone is enjoyably sharp and ripe. And anyone possessed with a desperate need to see David Duchovny’s buttocks will be fully satisfied within the first five minutes.“I hate that that’s the introduction to the character,” he grimaces when reminded of this. “That’s not the way it goes. That’s not who this guy is gonna be. But I guess that’s OK.”Duchovny’s character ends up forming a key part of the central mystery. “This isn’t a whodunnit, because you know who did it straight off the bat,” Duchovny smiles. “And I was scared about this at first. Like, who’s going to continue to watch if we give it away?” Instead, the mystery revolves more about motive than victim, although saying any more would give too much away.Duchovny is quick to praise Whitehall, whose appearance is his first serious dramatic role. “If comedians commit to the acting part of acting, they’re some of the best actors,” he says of Whitehall’s uncanny creepiness. “Doing standup is the most terrifying situation, standing with a bunch of people and having to make them laugh. They can be very brave people.”You could argue that Duchovny is just as courageous. The bulk of his work outside acting revolves around a form of intensely personal bloodletting, allowing him to probe his demons in a manner that his acting career doesn’t allow. Part of the reason he’s able to get his Fail Better guests to open up so freely is his willingness to go there first. He convinced Downey Jr to talk about his period of addiction and incarceration – a subject that has previously caused him to walk out of interviews – by mentioning his own experiences with AA.His interview withGillian Anderson, with whom he had a fractious relationship during the filming of The X-Files, is revelatory; an hour of two people discussing things that had been deliberately left unsaid for decades, from Duchovny’s unwillingness to support Anderson’s request for equal pay to their failure to inform each other about their desire to leave the series.View image in fullscreenSurf’s up … Duchovny with Carice van Houten and Jack Whitehall (far right) in Malice.Photograph: AmazonWhat’s more, his poetry book is sometimes so intimate it’s almost uncomfortable to read. One poem, Dead Seven, concerns the death of his father; another describes the moment he had to reckon with the sight of a dead mouse during a walk with his three-year-old daughter (“It is Daddy who cannot face too much death,” he writes).The introduction of the book states that “Poetry is not useful. And that is exactly why we need it.” More than anything, this sentiment feels like it informs Duchovny’s entire worldview; that a meandering search for personal fulfilment will always outshine relentless careerism. “I have young kids who are entering the workforce, and it just seems so much bleaker than it was when I was their age,” he says. “When they were in school, everything was all about ‘How is this useful? How is this going to be used?’ Everything is used. Everything is efficient. And it’s moral. Like, if you can’t use it, there must be something wrong with it. Imagine not having to worry about whether we can make money off this thing and it’s just the thing that we’re playing at.”As such, he says, his writing and music and podcasting represent a form of play. “I like to play different games,” he says. “I take play very seriously, but I don’t want to be a pretentious asshole either.”Duchovny describes Malice as “a bingey thing,” with all six episodes available at the same time. It’s a far cry from the role that made him famous, as Fox Mulder in The X-Files, on which he worked for 10 months a year for seven years. As soon as I bring it up, I feel slightly guilty; surely every time Duchovny sits down with anyone he must sense in the pit of his stomach that the subject is bound to come up.View image in fullscreenDavid Duchovny as Jamie Tanner and Jack Whitehall as Adam in Malice.Photograph: Yannis Drakoulidis“It’s not the pit of my stomach, but it’s like, I probably don’t have anything to say about it,” he shrugs. I marvel at the fact thatThe X-Fileswas a product of the old network days, where seasons would run for 25 episodes, then have another 25 ready for the same time next year. “It’s unthinkable now,” he nods. “You look at something as great as Game of Thrones or even The Sopranos. We did over 200 episodes, and they’ve done 60 or 70. And that’s not to denigrate them at all. I mean, that’s fantastic artistic work, but the sheer volume is something to be impressed by as well.”What’s even more impressive to him is the fact that every X-Files episode had to stand alone. “It’s really a testament to the writers’ room, and to [creator] Chris Carter,” he says. “We’re not even talking about 25 episodes of Law and Order, where you need a case each week. We’re talking about 25 episodes that could each stand as a movie. I’m glad I only had to memorise the fucking lines.”This, the fact that the show went on so long and maintained such high standards, seems to be the thing that gives him the greatest sense of pride. “Nobody gives awards for that,” he says. “Nobody gives awards by cross-referencing quantity with quality. But I think they should. In my mind, I giveChris Carterand the writers’ room awards, and I give Gillian and I awards for the amount of work it took to do 25 episodes in 10 months. Nobody gives awards for how hard it was to do that show. But I know it.”Duchovny left The X-Files after seven seasons. Although this was partly down to tiredness, he also started to feel boxed in by the phenomenon the show had become. “When I first got off The X-Files, it was like, ‘I just want to make art, and I only want 100 people to like it.’ I was reacting against this global embrace. I was like, ‘Oh, never again. I’m gonna do arty things and little theatres and make a really unpopular TV show.’”View image in fullscreenBack in the day … Duchovny as Fox Mulder with Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully in The X Files.Photograph: 20th Century Fox Television/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockArguably, it was the best move he could have made. Although he went on to star in another long-running show (Californication, popular enough to win him a Golden Globe), walking away from a show like The X-Files at the peak of its global success has given him both the space and the courage to show us who he really is.He admits he’s still torn between the safety of a television set, with its schedules and its routine and its money, and the more adventurous avenues of his career where he’s willing to give more of himself to a potentially smaller audience. “I approach the smaller stuff almost like mom and pop stuff, because I control it all,” he says. “And then you contrast that with something like The X-Files or a big Amazon show which isnotmom and pop.”“For me, at this point, it’s always about trying to find that thing that speaks to me,” he continues. “And some of the projects I do speak less audibly to me, but they’re interesting in terms of life. You know, I think saying yes gets you further than saying no.”Looking at everything he’s done, not just in this last year but over the past three decades, it feels like this might be Duchovny’s motto. “Saying no might get you a coherent career,” he smiles, “but saying yes gets you an adventurous one.”Malice is on Prime Video from 14 November.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaDavid DuchovnyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If it’s not a reboot (I Know What You Did Last Summer) or sequel (Final Destination Bloodlines), it’s a prequel (The First Omen; A Quiet Place: Day One), the return of a beloved gothic icon (Luc Besson’s Dracula: A Love Tale; Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein), or a slasher movie (Dangerous Animals) in which the psycho killer’s weapon of choice is not blades, but sharks. Or it’s a thrilling, deliriously inventive dispatch from one of a new wave of horror auteurs shaking up the cinematic zeitgeist: Ryan Coogler’sSinners, say, or Zach Cregger’s Weapons.By playing with metaphor, imagery and narrative, horror has always addressed hard truths about death, decay and the human condition that mainstream productions tend to shy away from as too disgusting, embarrassing or distressing. In an era when thrillers, romcoms and action films are unwilling to rock the boat lest they upset risk-averse studios and streaming services, horror films are uniquely equipped to tackle the hot-button issues of our times: migration (His House); mental health (Smile 2); toxic masculinity (The Invisible Man); artificial intelligence (M3gan); cults (Midsommar); zealotry (Heretic); gender dysphoria (I Saw the TV Glow); conspiracy theories (Broadcast Signal Intrusion); Zoom meetings (Host); pandemics (The Sadness); ecology (In the Earth); politics (The Purge); dementia (Relic); pregnancy and motherhood (Huesera: The Bone Woman; Mother’s Baby) and – an ever-popular theme in the horrorsphere – bereavement (The Babadook; Hereditary; Talk to Me; Bring Her Back and so on).In an age of polarisation, institutional collapse, climate anxiety and the breakdown of a shared reality, horror has emerged as the genre most capable of processing our fractured moment. Once reviled by respectable film critics as being only a short step up from pornography, horror today is not just having a moment; it is revealing itself as the defining genre of the 21st century.View image in fullscreenPrimal fear … The Monkey.Photograph: BFA/AlamyThe last great flowering of horror was during the 1970s, when George A Romero, Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter and Wes Craven dragged the genre, kicking and screaming, out of the gothic past and into the world of rural America, shopping malls and suburbia, in subversive films that reflected widespread social unease and distrust of authority in the era of Vietnam, Watergate and a disillusioned counterculture. But horror moves in cycles, from innovation to exploration to recycling and parody, and by the 1990s the films had got bogged down in spoofs (Scary Movie), duff remakes (The Haunting) and slumming A-list directors who imagined they were tapping into subtexts no one had ever spotted before (Bram Stoker’s Dracula; Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein; Wolf).How The Blair Witch Project changed horror for everRead moreThen, just in time for the millennium, an unholy trilogy of hits restarted the moribund pulse of the genre to send it roaring into the next century.The Blair Witch Projectshowed that an entire branch of film-making could be revolutionised on a rock-bottom budget, making ingenious use of the internet as a marketing tool and substituting the primal fear of getting lost in the woods for expensive special effects. It wasn’t the first horror film to use “found footage”, but it was instrumental in turning this into one of low-budget film-making’s most cost-effective stratagems.And alongside Blair Witch, two other films signalled the revival of an almost forgotten subgenre – the ghost story, reworked for the modern age and a media-savvy audience. M Night Shyamalan’s The Sixth Sense parlayed a devastating twist into the alternative reality scenario that would underpin so much of the horror and sci-fi of the new century. And the cursed VHS tape of the J-horror phenomenon Ring was a harbinger in the use of new technology that would permeate the genre with spine-chilling spins on social media, influencers, AI and the Dark Web.View image in fullscreenEye-catching … The Ring.Photograph: Omega/AllstarPost-Ring, the increasing availability of DVDs and spread of broadband made non-anglophone horror cinema, especially from France, Japan and South Korea, more accessible to horror fans in the west, permanently altering what “American” or “western” horror even means as directors such as Jordan Peele and Ari Aster would later consciously draw from this international lexicon. The New French Extremity (typified by Irréversible, in which a man gets his face mashed to a pulp by repeated blows from a fire extinguisher, or Martyrs, in which a woman is flayed to death) pushed the envelope of what was acceptable on screen. The subgenre eventually dubbed “torture-porn” (Hostel; The Human Centipede (First Sequence); and you really don’t want to know what happens in A Serbian Film) upped the ultragore content for a few years before giving way to less grim, more viewer-friendly ghosts, curses and bogeymen. Torture-porn’s influence lingers on today in mean-spirited splatterfests such as Terrifier 3, which made back 45 times its $2m budget, so evidently there is still a market for untrammelled sadism as practised by killer clowns. The box office success of Terrifier 3 alongside Robert Eggers’s upmarket-leaning Nosferatu underlines the genre’s new ecosystem, in which elevated and exploitative horror play with and off each other.The Babadook at 10: how a tiny Australian film became a horror hit – and an unlikely queer iconRead moreWhile the Blair Witch/Ring wave proved horror could be profitable and innovative, the current wave’s inflection point arrived with The Witch (2015), before being cemented by Get Out (2017) andHereditary(2018). This moment succeeded where earlier innovations failed because it coincided with a rise in internet-fuelled alienation and a new understanding of trauma, including cultural and generational, that horror was uniquely positioned to process. Meanwhile, the new wave of horror auteurs is helping to take the genre out of the exploitation and midnight movie circuits and into the arthouse. The likes of Jordan Peele (Get Out), Jennifer Kent (The Babadook) and Eggers (Nosferatu) seem not to regard horror as a genre apart, but as an integral part of their creative toolkit. And they have abandoned the traditional 90-minute running time in favour of an epic length more often associated with blockbuster releases, giving themselves space to explore themes, develop characters more fully.View image in fullscreenBed fellows … The Babadook.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyPeele’s Nope (130 minutes) is not just a horror film, but a neo-western science-fiction horror film. Kent’s The Nightingale (136 minutes) is a period rape-revenge horror drama that also addresses colonialism. Ari Aster’sMidsommar(147 minutes) is folk horror that tackles bereavement, trauma and a crumbling relationship. Coogler’s Sinners (137 minutes) is a deep south gothic musical period action drama, with vampires. (That some mainstream critics couldn’t get on board with Coogler introducing vampires into the mix suggests old anti-horror prejudices die hard.)Get Out: the film that dares to reveal the horror of liberal racism in AmericaRead moreThe new horror auteurs know the genre’s history, and use their knowledge to add non-formulaic twists and turn audience expectations upside down. Beyond expanded running times, directors such as Cregger, Peele and Aster are pioneering formal innovations that distinguish elevated horror on a technical level: discomfiting or unnatural colour palettes; compositions that deny the viewer safe framing; and most radically, their deployment of extended silences and narrative ambiguity to build unease or dread in audiences rather than jolting them with a continual barrage of jump-scares. Cregger’s Barbarian, about an Airbnb stay that goes horribly wrong, weighs in at a relatively snappy 102 minutes, but its unorthodox structure is pure 21st century, as are the film-maker’s astute casting choices, which ramp up the tension. His follow-up, Weapons (128 minutes) ekes out the details of its central mystery – 17 missing children – via separate points of view that ultimately dovetail in a perfectly judged climax that fully embraces both humour and horror, but without ever turning the film into a horror-comedy.The films of the new horror auteurs are taken seriously by critics, who sometimes use the term “elevated horror” to distinguish them from cheap and cheerful splatterfests of yore. The shift became official when the Sundance, Cannes and Toronto film festivals began programming horror films in their main competitions – a transformation enabled by a generational changing of the guard in film criticism, as younger critics who grew up valuing horror as legitimate art displaced older gatekeepers. But horror is also helping to blur the boundary between arthouse and mainstream. Horror’s unique economic model – low budgets that can reap astronomical profits – grants auteurs a creative freedom that big-budget film-makers can only dream of, and explains why streamers and studios, otherwise allergic to risk, are willing to gamble on formally daring horror projects they’d never greenlight in other genres. The production and distribution company Blumhouse Productions produced Oscar-nominated dramas such as Whiplash and BlacKkKlansman, but made its name with the successful Paranormal Activity found-footage franchise, and steered Peele’sGet Outto a critical and commercial success that sparked a flurry of media discourse about post-racial America, and the potential of non-white or female film-makers to introduce new perspectives to a genre that was formerly almost exclusively overseen by white men.Hit horror Weapons doesn’t have a deeper meaning but that’s OK | Jesse HassengerRead moreThe name of another distribution company, A24, has become so synonymous with elevated horror that fans and critics sit up and take notice when they see it attached to new projects, whether that’s award-winning work by Yorgos Lanthimos, Joanna Hogg and Sean Baker, or the latest film by Australian duo Danny and Michael Philippou, whose supernatural thriller Talk to Me was a word-of-mouth hit a few years ago. Their recent follow-up, Bring Her Back, is built round a performance by Sally Hawkins so terrifying you’ll never again be able to watch Paddington without shuddering.View image in fullscreenSeeing red … Andrea Riseborough in Possessor.Photograph: Sundance pressOn the slate of another celebrated distributor, Neon, Bong Joon-ho’s Oscar-winning Parasite and Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire rub shoulders with Sydney Sweeney in nunsploitation shocker Immaculate (a metaphor for forced birth if ever there was one), gnarly rape-revenge fantasy Revenge from the director Coralie Fargeat, who would go on to gross out audiences across the globe with Demi Moore squelcher The Substance, and the output of Brandon Cronenberg, whose Possessor and Infinity Pool explore the sort of body horror pioneered in the 1970s by his father, David.Shocking red: behind the scenes on classic horror Don’t Look Now – in picturesRead moreIn the space of six months, Neon landed a one-two combo of hits from another film-maker with horror in his genes: Osgood Perkins, son of Anthony Perkins, who played Norman Bates in Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho. Longlegs was a nightmarish FBI procedural starring Nicolas Cage as a grotesque occultist serial killer; Neon borrowed its marketing tactics from The Blair Witch Project, forgoing expensive TV spots in favour of cryptic internet clips and billboards displaying phone numbers connecting to pre-recorded messages from the film’s killer. Perkins followed it with splatter comedy The Monkey, adapted from a story by Stephen King. “Everybody dies,” says one of the doomed characters. “Some of us peacefully and in our sleep, and some of us horribly. And that’s life.”And in today’s world, real life is more terrifying and depressing than anything a film-maker could dream up. In the traditional Hollywood model, corruption is exposed by a righteous media, and the president of the United States (as played by Viola Davis or John Cena in recent action films) is firmly on the side of good against evil, but this approach just won’t cut it any more. Horror is perhaps the only genre that faces the challenges and anxieties of the ever-devolving present with its eyes wide open. If we are indeed living in End Times, it has us covered, providing a space in which our collective fears are let off the leash and allowed to run free – safely contained by the edges of the screen and a finite running time."

Four years separate The Boy Who Played the Harp from his last solo album, the platinum-selling We’re All Alone in This Together. Perhaps more strikingly, it’s been two years since he released Split Decision, the collaborative EP with Central Cee that spawned Sprinter: not just the longest-running UK rap No 1 in history, but the track that finally did the thing that it seemed increasingly unlikely a UK rap track would ever do and became a hit in the US, selling a million copies and even winding up on Barack Obama’s annual playlist. But rather than attempt to capitalise on its US success, as Central Cee did – jumping on tracks by big names ranging from J Cole to Ice Spice to Jung Kook from BTS; releasing a debut album that was announced on a live NFL broadcast, featured a plethora of American guest stars and ultimately wound up in the US Top 10 – Dave essentially withdrew from music.It was, by any metric, a counterintuitive move, and anyone wondering why, or what he’s been doing, will find some answers in The Boy Who Played the Harp. It opens with portentous-sounding organ and a couple of verses that do exactly what you might expect an artist in his position to do: reassert his vast success and wealth – he’s “already a legend”, his home apparently comes with a “garden the size of Adam and Eve’s” and “a forest” – but that turns out to be a feint, both musically and lyrically.The Boy Who Played the Harp is a very muted-sounding album indeed, big on sparse arrangements, gentle piano figures and subtle pleasures: the unsettled, skittering beats and helium vocal samples that open 175 Months, the quietly eerie harmony vocals that appear midway through My 27th Birthday. Several of its tracks run over the six minute mark, while even its poppiest moments – No Weapons, which reunites him with Sprinter producer Jim Legxacy, and Raindance, a collaboration with Nigerian singer Tems – feel understated. And once the opening verses of History are out of the way, it’s an album noticeably light on self-aggrandising swagger: to judge by the rest of the lyrics, Dave has spent a significant proportion of the last couple of years consumed by a series of existential crises. “Why don’t you post pictures, or why don’t you drop music?” he admonishes himself at one point. “Or why not do something but sitting and stressing yourself?”View image in fullscreenDave: The Boy Who Played the Harp album artwork.Some of his issues are universal, the kind of thoughts that tend to plague people in their late 20s, that weird period in life where you realise that you’re incontrovertibly an adult, whether you feel like one or not. He spends a lot of The Boy Who Played the Harp thrashing over the pros and cons of settling down, unable to work out whether it’s something he is emotionally capable of or not: “You should have had kids … don’t you feel like you’re behind?” he frets on the crestfallen Selfish. The brilliant Chapter 16 is styled as a lengthy dialogue between Dave and Kano, the latter now a patriarchal figure in UK rap, whose career began when Dave was at primary school. It shifts suddenly from discussing the music industry and the impact of sudden fame on your friends to Dave petitioning Kano, a contented family man, for relationship advice: the latter hymns the pleasure of swapping “a silver Porsche” for “leather Max-Cosi baby seats in the SUV”.View image in fullscreenDave, centre, flanked by his collaborators on The Boy With the Harp, from left: Kano, Jim Legxacy, Tems and James Blake.Photograph: Gabriel MosesBut he also seems conflicted about his career, worrying aloud about whether his lyrics are sufficiently socially aware, and whether they have any impact even if they are, working himself up into such a state on My 27th Birthday that he ends up questioning whether the world actually needs to hear anyone rapping at all: “We don’t need no commentators, we can leave that to the sports / Just listen to the music, why’d you need somebody’s thoughts?”The irony is that he has already answered that question. An album full of self-examination by a rich and successful pop star might seem like a schlep on paper, but Dave is a fantastically smart, sharp lyricist, more than capable of making it work – The Boy With the Harp feels fascinating, rather than self-indulgent – just as he’s technically skilled enough to make the album’s muted sound a bonus: it focuses attention on his voice and exemplary flow.It’s a point underlined when he finally shifts his gaze outwards on Marvellous and Fairchild, two tracks that emphasise his brilliance as a storyteller: the former tracks a 17-year-old’s progress from drugs to violence to jail, while the latter slowly details a sexual assault, shifting from Dave’s voice to that of female rapper Nicole Blakk, before exploding into a burst of rage that variously takes in “incels”, the murder of Sarah Everard, and hip-hop’s objectification of women: “I’m complicit, no better than you”. It’s harrowing, gripping and powerful: all the evidence you need that Dave’s doubts about himself are unfounded.Explore more on these topicsDaveRapHip-hopalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

(Harbour has not responded to the album’s contents.)In aninterview this week with Katie Grand’s Perfect magazine, Allen admitted that the record was likely to further stoke her tempestuous relationship with the media.“I don’t make it easy for myself, do I?” she said. Still, beyond the obvious tabloid catnip contained within the album – including lyrics about discovering “sex toys, butt plugs, lube inside / Hundreds of Trojans” (condoms) on the song Pussy Palace – some newspapers have bordered on sharply personal criticism when covering West End Girl. The headline on the Times’ review stated: “You almost feel sorry for David Harbour.” In a 2/5 review, the Financial Times accused Allen of “a hollow performance”.Otherwise, Allen’s return to music, seven years after the release of her last album, No Shame, was greeted with widespread acclaim – and due consideration for its musical virtues. In afour-star review, the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis wrote: “What ties the songs together beyond the story they tell is the striking prettiness of the tunes, which seem, jarringly, more evocative of a romantic fairytale ending than the anger and unhappiness the lyrics convey.”View image in fullscreenWhile Allen’s latest drop references her marital breakdown, the singer says it is not ‘all gospel’.Photograph: Charlie DenisIn another four-star review, the Telegraph praised the technicalities of Allen’s writing: “The power of West End Girl lies in the way it clearly presents itself as one side of the story: a woman trapped in her own head. Narrative tension builds because listeners can’t pull out for a wider perspective on the situation, allowing us to share in Allen’s claustrophobia and paranoia.” The Daily Mail’s four-star take said it sat alongside Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours, Amy Winehouse’s Back to Black and Adele’s 21 in the annals of great pop breakup albums.Lily Allen: West End Girl – a gobsmacking autopsy of marital betrayalRead moreThe Independent awarded it five stars, and highlighted the relatability of Allen’s themes – not just hyperpersonal disclosure, but an illustration of “how easy it is, in love, to drown in someone else’s shame and mistake it for your own”.Petridis also drew on how Allen’s fans may have grown up alongside her and relate to the story she tells about modern relationships: “Underneath all the gory details, it seems to tacitly suggest that open arrangements are easily abused, usually by men, and that believing you’re above outmoded concepts of fidelity – ‘a modern wife’, as Allen puts it at one point – is no guarantee you won’t get your heart broken.”The fan response on the Popheads subreddit and the Popjustice forums – two of the busiest and most ardent destinations for pop discussion online – was almost uniformly positive. One viral tweet likened the album to Lorde’s cultishly adored second album, about the tempestuous rites of first heartbreak: “Can’t believe Lily Allen is about to drop the Melodrama for divorced white British women over 40.”View image in fullscreenAllen married David Harbour in 2020.Photograph: Vianney Le Caer/Invision/APHow the acclaim informs what Allen does next remains to be seen. No Shame received similar levels of praise but was her lowest-selling album – although her 2006 debut Alright, Still was released in the pre-streaming era, making it tricky to compare on an even playing field. She has not announced any tour dates in support of the record, and hasn’t played live since 2019. In September, she said that she was temporarily stepping away from Miss Me?, the highly successful BBC podcast she presented with childhood friend Miquita Oliver, “while I go and do some new stuff for a bit” – presumably the album.Lily Allen’s West End Girl is funny, sexy, jawdropping – and forged in the fires of tabloid Britain | Jennifer Jasmine WhiteRead moreIn the break since Allen released and toured No Shame, she has found success as a theatrical actor. The opening song and title track of West End Girl appears to document Allen discovering that she has landed the lead role in 2:22 A Ghost Story at the Noël Coward theatre in 2021, which necessitated her to move from her adopted family home in New York back to London, and the cracks it apparently created in her marriage. She earned excellent reviews and aLaurence Olivier award nominationfor best actress for her performance.Allen subsequently starred in a revival of Martin McDonagh’s play The Pillowman as well as Hedda, a reimagining of the Henrik Ibsen play directed by Matthew Dunster.For now, Allen has no more roles on the cards. One she can play, though, is that of godmother to a new wave of younger pop stars forged in her image. In 2022, the US star Olivia Rodrigo invited Allen on stage with her at Glastonbury to cover the latter’s 2008 song, Fuck You, which they dedicated to the US supreme court justices whooverturned Roe v Wade. Billie Eilish is a fan; her unbarred, conversational delivery is audible in the output of Charli xcx and Lola Young.As UK producer PinkPantheress put it: “Lily Allen made sounding like yourself feel cool.” On West End Girl, she certainly doesn’t sound like anyone else.Explore more on these topicsLily AllenPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In front of Elverket – a former power station that for much of the last 30 years has been at the centre of Stockholm’s experimental dramatic output – posters proclaim that theatre is dead. Inside the former turbine hall, either side of a red chandelier-lit platform surrounded by contorted bodies,Hamletand Ophelia, brilliantly played by Gustav Lindh and Gizem Erdogan, are furiously channelling the rage of a generation, loudly hitting the walls with bars. In the play’s final seconds, gravediggers give way to builders dressed in high-vis come in to cover the stage in tarpaulin and start work.This adaptation of Shakespeare’s tragedy, not so cryptically subtitled The Death of Theatre, is the venue’s last ever theatre production before it is shut down. Dramaten, the royal dramatic theatre that functions as Sweden’s national stage, has been forced to let go of the venue, which over three decades became a well-funded home for risk-taking performances and new writing. Among its greatest hits were Personkrets 3:1, a six and a half hour long play written and directed by the late Lars Norén about homelessness, drug addiction and mental illness; the Swedish premiere ofSarah Kane’s Cleansed; and Tusen år hos Gud (A thousand years with God), a sprawling dance-theatre-opera based on the writing of Stig Dagerman. In 2006, I saw a young Noomi Rapace star in Kane’s brutally violent play Blasted here.View image in fullscreenChannelling the rage of a generation … Gustav Lindh as Hamlet at Dramaten theatre, Stockholm.Photograph: Ola KjelbyeBut now government funding freezes have resulted in a real terms decrease of about 50m SEK per year since 2017 for Dramaten, which is fully owned by the state. The situation worsened in 2023, when a three-year funding freeze meant they were forced to make redundancies and cut productions. At its height, Elverket was putting on up to 10 productions a year. Now Dramaten cannot afford to pay Elverket’s rent, let alone to put on two to three productions there a year.What form Elverket’s next evolution will take is not yet known. But given the high rent and the real-estate potential of this vast black-box space in the desirable area of Östermalm, its days as a theatre are almost certainly over once Hamlet closes in December. “Cultural twilight is under way,” wrote critic Jacob Lundström in Dagens Nyheter. “A couple of blocks away, the historic Park cinema is about to become a gym. What will happen to Elverket is unclear. Maybe it will become a Five Guys?”AcrossEurope, a combination of funding cuts, culture wars and rising rents is picking off cultural spaces. Stockholm, a city long accustomed to a rich offering of theatre, music and film is watching its cultural fabric fray at the edges. Dance museum Dansmuseet closed its centrally located venue for financial reasons after 72 years in January; the former theatre Maxim reopened last year as a broader cultural venue after it was forced to close for nearly two years after a rent increase; Stockholm’s oldest remaining cinema, Zita, was driven to launching a fundraising campaign after coming under financial strain.While arts cuts started under the leadership of the Social Democrats, before the current centre-right governmentassumed power in 2022with the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats, the last two years have seen increased financial pressure on cultural institutions. The current government has also been accused of implementing a “nationalist education project” in the form of amuch criticised “cultural canon”that was unveiled in September.The Swedish culture minister, Parisa Liljestrand, tells me the government’s culture budget has increased every year since coming into power and that the budget proposal currently on the table includes an additional 300m SEK to the cultural sector. But, she adds: “Which stages or venues that Dramaten uses is determined by the operation itself, it is not regulated by the government.”Actor Erdogan, who has starred in the TV series Caliphate, police drama Thin Blue Line and The Playlist, says to make theatre in 2025 more than ever feels like a “force of resistance”.“It is here and now, it is here in the room, we experience it together. Our heartbeats almost sync, like it can be at the cinema as well,” she says. “I am worried that if you take away these rooms it will leave a big empty room which is vital for us humans to experience these things together.”As well as offering huge flexibility in terms of seating and staging, Elverket’s space also lends itself to encounters between people before and after productions. After the show, a group of young women approach Erdogan for a chat.View image in fullscreen‘Resistance’ … Gizem Erdogan as Ophelia in Hamlet at Dramaten theatre, Stockholm.Photograph: Ola KjelbyeOn stage, the mood is charged, says Lindh, who played Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment at Dramaten in 2022. “There is an anti-war message, there is a cry for help for the state of the world in our production.”The background of war, emphasised by the fact that Laertes goes off to fight rather than to study in Paris, resonates strongly in a modern European context – particularly inSweden. Politicians here have spent much of the last two years warning of the need to prepare for a possible military conflict.There’s also contemporary currency in the re-framing of Ophelia, who has significantly more words than in the original (Mattias Andersson, the play’s director and Dramaten’s artistic director, redistributed some of Hamlet’s soliloquies in his adaptation). Sharing the spotlight, Hamlet and Ophelia channel the energy and frustration of an entire generation of young Swedes faced with huge structural challenges. One particularly prominent member of that generation, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, that same evening addressed addressed supporters in nearby Sergels Torg after beingdetained by the Israeli military.In his office at Dramaten’s main theatre, Andersson says that Hamlet has resonated with him since he was a teenager. It captures the youthful sense, he says, of feeling “everything is rotten and fake and feeling that one should react, do something.” After seeing a version he didn’t like at a festival a couple of years ago, he started playing around with different Swedish translations and wondered where a modern version would feel most at home.“I started to think a lot about places in urban areas where there is room for discussion of existence, discussion of humankind’s eternal questions through art and theatre,” he says. When they are being erased as they are in so many European cities now, he wondered,will they be missed, and by whom? Is theatre as important to society as Andersson and his colleagues believe it to be? Which brought him to Hamlet as a play that “comes forward from primal depths to be performed for the last time”.The answer his production gives, in its own meta way, is not encouraging. In Shakespeare’s original, Hamlet puts on a play-within-play called The Murder of Gonzago, in order to confirm Claudius’s guilt by watching his reaction to a reenactment of his father’s murder. In Andersson’s version, the play is about injustice, power games, and genocide, but Claudius and Gertrude’s reaction to his diatribe is one of indifference.There is still hope, Andersson says. The play’s subtitle, he clarifies, is a provocation rather than a statement. “I don’t believe in theatres’ death in that way,” he says. In today’s world, in fact, live experiences have even more power to make an impression, which makes him feel hopeful for theatre’s future. “The human contact, analogue meeting, that is so enormously unique when we all are pulled into our screens.”Hamlet is showing at Dramaten, Stockholm, until 14 DecemberExplore more on these topicsStageSwedenEuropeArts fundingWilliam ShakespeareHamletnewsShareReuse this content"

The result is a masterful new album – made with a little help from Lorde and Zadie SmithByTim BurrowsFri 24 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 09.50 EDTShareDevonté Hynes is telling me how he came to be living back in his childhood home in Ilford, east London, at the age of 37, after his mother had fallen ill. “It was a surreal experience,” he says of the sudden move from Brooklyn, where he makes music as Blood Orange, to sleeping in the bedroom where he once put up posters of David Beckham and the Smashing Pumpkins. “Physically, you’re bigger: your shape has changed. But the space is the same. The memories are the same.”Hynes came back to England to be by the bedside of his mother in hospital, and stayed at home a while after she died in 2023. This tragic disruption produced his fifth full-length release,Essex Honey, a clear contender for album of the year. It’s a record grounded by grief but fizzing with the memory flashes that came with returning home to the edge of Essex; the record that sounds most like the place he left almost two decades ago.Hynes started out in the 2000s making dance-punk with Test Icicles and indie-pop as Lightspeed Champion, and then settled into poignant, groove-led R&B as Blood Orange, and was sought as a songwriter by Solange, Mariah Carey, Carly Rae Jepsen and more. Fields, a classical collaboration with Third Coast Percussion, was Grammy-nominated in 2021. But Essex Honey exists at a slight remove to everything that came before it: it is full of wide, ambient vistas that segue from mournful to sublime like an estuary sky, as the lyrics contemplate death, youth and the restorative effects of the English countryside.Hynes is talking to me from New York, a rare moment at home before he embarks on a tour weaving together headline solo dates with support slots in arenas for Lorde, who appears on the album. “There is a lot of work to do after the passing of someone … a lot of logistical work that has to happen,” he says of the days and weeks after his mother’s death. “I was very aware that I had to kind of just function in this period. And so I was. But, you know, in the back of my mind, I kept thinking, like, I feel like this is gonnabite meat some point in the future.”He had been scheduled to tour his classical compositions in 2023, including at Sydney Opera House. “I wanted to keep going. And then I was like … I couldn’t picture doing it. I spoke to my sister about it. Sometimes you just need the blessing of someone to be like, no, it’s OK. You don’t have to do it.” He took time off to grieve instead, eventually renting a place in Paris. He hadn’t planned to make a record about his mother’s death, but he found himself working on tracks just to process things.The most directly autobiographical is The Last of England. It starts with a snatch of a recording of a conversation at the dinner table his sister had with his mother during Christmas 2022. “I think we were talking about the Beatles, and my nephew is in the background running and screaming,” he says. “But its importance is it became the last Christmas we all had together, and the last time I saw my mother not in hospital.” The song goes on to describe the horrific mundanity of being in a hospital room after your mother has died. “Nothing more to do but leave / Following the corners of the room / A knitted heart, they gave to me / I wash my hands and stare into the drain,” he sings.View image in fullscreenDev Hynes and Solange Knowles in Los Angeles in 2012.Photograph: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic“I was interested in being extremely literal and having no real metaphors, musically and lyrically,” says Hynes. A member of hospital staff gave him a knitted heart after his mother died. “I really love [my work to be] to the point. There’s such a crazy beauty in that.”Iwas keen to speak to Hynes about Essex Honey after hesaid in an interviewhow my bookThe Invention of Essex: The Making of an English Countyhad helped him look again at the place he grew up. To me, Essex represents social and political revolutions in the country at large, from the Windrush docking at Tilbury to the rise of Thatcherism among the upwardly mobile working class. I wrote the book in an attempt to tell this story behind my home county, how it became a place apart in the British unconscious after industrialisation, socialism and war led to a mass movement of people from the East End of London starting afresh there. Hynes and his family were part of a later wave of that movement.He was born in Leytonstone, east London, in 1985, before his parents, Wendela and Louis, moved the family east to Ilford, a town that’s technically part of Greater London but Hynes still considers Essex, as it was before the capital’s city boundary expanded outwards in the 1960s. Wendela was a nurse and then eventually became a health visitor around Dagenham, “coming back with these horror stories of teenage pregnancies and young addiction and abusive partners, or elderly people who were somewhat unattended and not looked after”. Louis did various odd jobs, initially engineering work before he was in charge of looking after maintenance at the Marks & Spencer in Ilford town centre. Hynes had his first job there too, as a cleaner – he calls it his version of nepotism.Ilford, he says, was an estranging, “enclosed” place to grow up, partly due to the fact that it had no underground transport links (upon his return to the UK, Hynes was so amazed to find Ilford connected to central London by the new Elizabeth line that he included a lyric about it on The Last of England).Music came into his life via piano lessons with a teacher who tapped the keys with her pen if he played a wrong note. At nine he started the cello (he plays it on Essex Honey) and joined the school orchestra. It was a private kind of solace, practising in his bedroom as an escape; guitar came later. Essex Honey channels this insularity, alluding to other formative cultural influences:The Fieldsamples the gorgeous guitar of the Durutti Column’s Vini Reilly; while Westerberg incorporates a cover of the chorus of a Replacements song; and the piano-led closing bars of Mind Loaded are like a half-remembered hardcore melody that calls back to his sister’s love of Ministry of Sound raves. Part of the opening track, Look at You, hat-tips to British Channel 4 sitcomDesmond’s: “The actor who portrayed Desmond [Norman Beaton] is from Guyana where my mum is from, so I always felt a special connection,” says Hynes.My background felt different and not just based on being ‘first generation’. I felt I was from a different placeHynes left home as soon as he could, plunging into London’s hectic 00s music scene, but he felt a stark class difference between him and his new west London friends. “My background felt different and not just based on cultural differences or being ‘first generation’ or anything. I actually felt that I was from a different place,” he says, meaning blue-collar Ilford, not the media-class backgrounds of others on the scene. “Even the friends I had who lived in Forest Gate or Bethnal Green, even that part of east London, which is still so close, felt separate.”Test Icicles, a three-piece he formed aged 18 in east London, were jokily named for what they thought would be a short-lived thing (they were originally called Balls), and their energy outstripped their songwriting prowess. They split up in 2006 before they were due to tour the US, but Hynes kept his visa, moved to New York, and, having named himself Lightspeed Champion, paired country-style acoustic guitar with a baroque sensibility. His real unmasking as a songwriter, however, came when he started Blood Orange at the turn of the 2010s. One of the first songs Hynes wrote for the project wasForget It, a masterclass in soulful minimalism: Young Marble Giants meets D’Angelo. The whole project was more emotionally present, immediate and bold than anything he had done before, and more directly influenced by Black music.View image in fullscreenDev Hynes returning home to Essex.Photograph: Adam PowellHynes had the title for Essex Honey, the fifth Blood Orange album, years before he had any music – “I like the sound and how they connect as words” – and he had unfinished business to reflect on back home on the Essex border. For years, his background kept bleeding into song as he focused on the violence he experienced as a teenager, when he was beaten up so frequently that his mum put him in karate lessons. A song with Skepta,High Street, from the 2013 album Cupid Deluxe, had a lyric about Hynes “Racing down Ilford Lane going home / Thinking about should I try to fake a fall” after he had been jumped. Negro Swan contained Dagenham Dream, with a description of how “broken teeth and bloody nose” led him to “cut a line” in one of his eyebrows to fit in, “to act just like the others to get around”.He learned to skateboard as an alternative to getting the bus because the 387 that took him back home from his school in Chadwell Heath could be so brutal. “[The threat] would just build with all these kids in different schools and it would get so intense. There’d always be some grief or I’d be just, like, fucking terrified.” His only currency was being a great footballer, playing at county level for Essex and for the Dagenham & Redbridge youth team, which meant, although the streets remained dangerous, he wasn’t bullied at school itself. “The football thing did really save me,” he says. He still plays, meeting up every Wednesday in New York for a five-a-side with regulars including the Strokes’ frontman Julian Casablancas (Hynes has always played as an attacking winger, whereas Casablancas is “a bit of a classic number nine”).Another friend, Zadie Smith, his former NYC neighbour, appears on the album singing with strong vibrato on Vivid Light. “She was back in town for some book engagements, and she came over to my apartment to hear what I’d been working on,” he says. “I played her this song, and essentially shoved a mic in her face. She started just ad-libbing around. It’s something we’ve done before, usually hanging at hers, sitting around her piano. So it all felt very natural.”Hynes’s artistic relationship with England on Essex Honey is complex, at a remove but intensely perceptive in a way that reminds me of Smith. He says he lives in a bubble in New York and finds it easy to tune out of Trump 2.0 on the whole, but travelling back to the UK earlier this year with another New York football buddy, the photographer Adam Powell, was another matter. “He’s from Essex – he has the swords [from the Essex flag] tattooed on him as well,” says Hynes. The pair drove around, taking photos, including an amazing shoot inthe marshes of Essex around Rainham. “And I couldn’t believe how many flags there were.” Everywhere they went they saw the England flag flying: a recent craze across the country that has taken on a racist, xenophobic, us-and-them quality. “I had been seeing it [online] and I’d known, but … it was really intense to see. Honestly, it’s pretty scary.”Hynes used to cross the road to avoid the pubs displaying union jacks in Dagenham at a time when the far-right British National Party was on the rise – he knew what it meant – and he is fearful today’s flags are a portent of the UK’s political future. “It’s not looking good,” he says. “It’s looking like Reform are going to fucking do it. I don’t know if people are even fully acknowledging it, but it is terrifying.”But it would be too much to say you can hear grief for a country on Essex Honey. On the contrary, it is as if by making a record about loss he has also provided a blueprint to connect with the place once more. Back in that childhood bedroom, he would gaze at the streets outside and marvel, at how, for better or worse, it had remained how he always knew it. “Looking out my window is the same. That street does not change.”Essex Honey is out now on Domino/RCA. Blood Orange’s UK tour begins on 7 November at Alexandra Palace, LondonThis article was amended on 24 October 2025.

Ever sincethe Mouse House bought Lucasfilm for $4bn in 2012, there have been those who blame the studio for turning George Lucas’s mythic space opera into an endlessly respawning content farm.But let’s give them credit where credit’s due: according toa new Associated Press interview with Adam Driver, Disney did at least have the presence of mind to politely decline a film whose entire premise would have been enough to make Darth Vader himself force-choke the pitch meeting from beyond the grave. Yes, it is (or would have been) Ben Solo: The Movie, directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Driver as the resurrected Sith-Jedi protagonist of that oh-so-wonderful entry, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.Yes, Driver really does seem to think this film, provisionally titled The Hunt for Ben Solo, is one people might actually want to see. After traumatising the collective psyche of legions ofStar Warsfans by reintroducing the long-dead Palpatine, entirely wiping the events of the previous film, and introducing something called the “Force dyad” to explain why Rey and Ren are suddenly snogging, Disney was invited to bring back Kylo for a high-jinks sequel.“We presented the script to Lucasfilm,” said Driver. “They loved the idea. They totally understood our angle. We took it to [Disney supremos] Bob Iger and Alan Bergman and they said no. They didn’t see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that.”Driver goes on to say during the interview that he was baffled as to why anyone wouldn’t want to see a Soderbergh Star Wars movie. “We wanted to be economical with it, and do it for less than most but in the same spirit of what those movies are, which is handmade and character-driven,” he says. “Empire Strikes Back being, in my opinion, the standard of what those movies were. But he is, to me, one of my favourite directors of all time. He lives his code, lives his ethics, doesn’t compromise.”View image in fullscreen‘He lives his code’ … Driver hoped to work with Steven Soderbergh again after collaborating on Logan Lucky (pictured).Photograph: Radial/Kobal/Rex/ShutterstockThe problem is that the question is not whether filmgoers want to see a Star Wars movie made by Soderbergh, a director who could make a tax audit look stylish. It is why would anyone ever want to see the return of Kylo Ren, Ben Solo, Darth Moody or whatever his latest alter ego is? It’s bad enough that we are apparently getting a film in which Daisy Ridley’s Rey will try to restore the Jedi Order, though giventhis movie was announced in 2023and still hasn’t even entered production –unconfirmed rumours suggest it’s on hold pending script approval– there is hope.Kylo Ren is not Spider-Man, Rey is not Wonder Woman: these are not beloved icons of 20th and 21st-century pop mythology who can be wheeled out and reimagined endlessly for decades to come. They are half-finished characters from a franchise that forgot what its own story was about.And then there’s the fact that Ben Solo really did die at the end of The Rise of Skywalker. Is there some unspoken Hollywood rule that if enough people thought a movie was rubbish, we can all forget everything that happened in it? Can there ever be a viable explanation for Ren’s resurrection that gives any self-respecting Star Wars fan those two hours of our lives back?We’ll never know what Driver’s movie might have looked like, and that’s a good thing. After all, nobody demanded a sequel to Waterworld in which Kevin Costner opens a desalination startup. So why this?To many Star Wars fans, The Rise of Skywalker is upsetting because we can never forget about it. It’s there on Disney+ as a canonical big-screen Star Wars movie, for ever. We can try our best to ignore it, to imagine that the original Star Wars trilogy (and perhaps Rogue One) exist in glorious isolation. But there will always be the memory of this most soulless and confected of episodes lumbering through the canon. So no,Adam Driver, we don’t want a Star Wars movie about Ben Solo.Explore more on these topicsFilmStar WarsAdam DriverSteven SoderberghStar Wars: The Rise of SkywalkercommentShareReuse this content"

This may be October, but there’s already a giant Christmas tree in the middle of the Hampstead theatre stage, which James Cotterill’s stylish design has transformed into the Upper West Side apartment of a non-religious Jewish family gathering for the holidays.Christmas may come earlier every year, but it has taken a while for this one to arrive: this is the UK premiere of Richard Greenberg’s Broadway hit from 12 years ago. It’s 1980, and the “ruthlessly” cheerful Julie is hosting along with her husband Ben, whose hopes for his college-age son Scotty extend all the way to the Presidency. Scotty’s earnest Harvard friend Jeff navigates his way naively around both the apparently endless rooms and the extended clan, which includes an “odd” cousin and a sketchy brother-in-law.View image in fullscreenDaniel Abelson as Ben and David Kennedy as Mort in The Assembled Parties at Hampstead theatre.Photograph: Helen MurrayAnd then there’sTracy-Ann Obermanas Ben’s sister Faye, in a performance so enjoyable that even facing upstage, the back of her glamorously coiffed head beams out charisma. “I love what you’re wearing,” she tells Julie. “Is it your mother’s?” Blanche McIntyre’s direction keeps the finely tuned comic dialogue rattling along in the first half, even as nothing happens and we wonder, along with the characters, exactly what story we’re in, “I’m just a character in a farce,” says Julie; “we’re in a potboiler here!” announces Ben.Really, we’re in the kind of old-fashioned play that Jeff’s mother has always loved, with impossibly “breezy dialogue” and charm. Only when we return after the interval – to the same family apartment, 20 years on – does the dramatic narrative reveal its shape, as Greenberg underscores familial patterns – such as Faye’s relationship with her daughter, and her own mother – with the cyclical nature of political change.Fine acting allows a crackling script to develop true warmth and Alexander Marks doubles brilliantly as the easygoing Scotty and his nervous, feckless younger brother. Sam Marks yearns sweetly for intimacy as Jeff, both the young man silently smoothing his friend’s pillow and the confident lawyer still a little in love with his friend’s mother, while Jennifer Westfeldt’s Julie delivers the second-act moments of heartbreaking tenderness. It’s a Christmas well worth waiting for.AtHampstead theatre, London, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreTracy-Ann ObermanreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was then picked up by a neighbour who thought it was someone’s forgotten delivery and took it in for safekeeping. Days later, after her husband mentioned the missing Picasso, she checked the package and called the police.Had the picture, which was painted by the Spanish artist in 1919, reached its destination, it would have been one of the stars of the foundation’sStill Life: the Eternity of the Inertexhibition. But it never did.The foundation said that although some of the works were carefully packaged, they were not correctly numbered, making “an exhaustive check” impossible. The delivery was nonetheless signed off and the van and its crew went on their way.The following Monday, the pieces, which had been under video surveillance all weekend, were unpacked.“Once the unpacking had been done by the CajaGranada foundation’s own staff, the works were moved to different parts of the exhibition room,” the foundation said in a statement.“Mid-morning that day, the exhibition’s curator and the foundation’s head of exhibitions noticed that one work was missing. The piece is a small gouache byPablo Picasso, called Still Life with Guitar.”The foundation reported the matter to the Policía Nacional, who began to investigate. A week of speculation over the painting’s fate came to a prosaic end on Friday, when the force announced that the work had been recovered.“It may never have made it on the van,” the Policía Nacional said in a short statement. “The Historic Heritage Unit is keeping the investigation open and scientific police have opened the package containing the painting and are examining it.”Theatre Picasso review – Pablo tears reality apart in a riotous celebration of his raging geniusRead moreThe Guardian understands that despite the highly publicised hiccup, the foundation is still keen to take delivery of Still Life with Guitar so it can be exhibited as planned.Picasso’s fame – and the enormous sums his works command – have long made his art a target for thieves around the world.In February 2007, two Picasso paintings worth €50m were stolen from the Parishome of the artist’s granddaughter. Two years later,a Picasso sketchbook worth more than €8mwas stolen from a Paris museum dedicated to the artist.Twelve Picasso paintings, valued at about £9m, were stolen from the French Riviera villa of another of his grandchildren, Marina Picasso, in 1989.Several other Picasso paintings have been stolen from galleries.

West End casting directors raise concerns about trend for big starsFilm and TV stars are selling tickets, but director says reliance on famous names is ‘killing audiences’ intellects’Nadia KhomamiArts and culture correspondentFri 24 Oct 2025 08.59 EDTLast modified on Fri 24 Oct 2025 13.56 EDTShareFrom Ncuti Gatwa in Born With Teeth toAlicia Vikanderin The Lady From the Sea and Susan Sarandon in Mary Page Marlowe, there is no shortage of starry celebrities being cast for the West End right now.It is a phenomenon happening in subsidised theatre too: Indhu Rubasingham’s inaugural season at the National Theatre features the likes of screen favourites Paul Mescal andNicola Coughlan.But over the last few years, the propensity to cast film and TV stars for the stage has become a point of contention in an industry still struggling from funding cuts and changing audience habits after the Covid pandemic. While some believe big names can help entice audiences and sell tickets, others say they stop risk-averse theatres from taking a chance on smaller productions with unknown casts.It was a debate freshly renewed this week when Nadine Rennie, a co-chair of the Casting Directors’ Guild,warned the trend was “killing” the industry, and mid-scale theatres would be the first to go – despite being where the household names of the future cut their teeth.Speaking at conference hosted by Spotlight at Rada, Rennie compared the proliferation of celebrity names on stages to “feeding a child too much sugar”. “It’s killing audiences’ intellects. I hear audience members say all the time: ‘I don’t know anybody who’s in this.’ Or they’re not excited about a new play by an emerging writer,” she said.Jill Green, a casting director for shows including The Devil Wears Prada, The Great Gatsby and War Horse, said many casting directors were increasingly being asked to cast big-name actors, with some theatres refusing to commit to booking a show until a recognised name was attached.“This does make it much harder for new writing and productions without headline names to secure a slot against star-led shows,” she said. “However, the real question is: what actually constitutes a ‘big name’ who can sell that many tickets? The pool of talent that genuinely moves the needle at the box office isn’t exactly Olympic-sized.”Her sentiments echoed those of the National Theatre’s director of casting, Alastair Coomer, who told the Spotlight conference that celebrity casting was “the biggest driver now” for audiences, putting immense pressure on the industry. “All of us are chasing the same very, very small group of people,” he said.But having a star on the bill is not without its benefit. Green said the theatre provided a “fantastic opportunity” for audiences to see a performer they admire taking on a role that truly suits their skill set. “It can also help fill houses, which in turn sustains a lot of jobs both on and off stage,” she added. “But ticket pricing has become a major concern – if prices rise to extortionate levels, we risk excluding audiences who simply can’t afford to go.”This is becoming apparent in the US, where the swing towards star casting isparticularly dramatic. Tickets for George Clooney’s Broadway debut in Good Night, and Good Luck went for upwards of $800 (£600), while those for Denzel Washington’s Othello went for up to $1,000.“Would I celebrate a world where my theatre was packed, but each ticket was £300, which is what’s happening on Broadway?” Nadia Fall, the artistic director of the Young Vic theatre,told the Guardian recently. “This is where the maths could lead us: theatre as a pastime for the elite.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Clooney  in Good Night, and Good Luck on Broadway earlier this year.Photograph: Andy Kropa/Invision/APThe theatre critic Arifa Akbar says there is a certain “circus” element to A-lister castings. “Many people come to see the star rather than the play. It’s a way of bringing in money and getting bums on seats, for sure, but it’s not a financial – or creative – solution for the industry in the long run because the demographic buying tickets for star-led shows won’t come when there’s no star in sight,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And shows can still go seriously wrong, however A-list the actor, as we saw in Sigourney Weaver’s weird, wooden turn in the West End’s The Tempest last year.”Kenny Wax, the producer of plays and musicals including Six the Musical, The Play That Goes Wrong and Why Am I So Single?, emphasised that seeing shows with big stars were rare – and sometimes transformative – experiences.He said: “When Tom Holland was cast in Romeo and Juliet it was an opportunity to get young people into Shakespeare who would have never gone to see that play otherwise. Kenneth Branagh is returning to the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon for the first time in over 30 years next year; that’s really exciting for youngsters to have a chance to see him live on stage.”Wax said there were “plenty of theatres and plenty of productions throughout the year to go around”. “This summer we had The Comedy About Spies at the Noël Coward, which had no big TV or film stars, but literally sold out 100% for 20 weeks. You don’t need a star. The quality and the cream always tends to rise to the top.”For Wax,Londoncontinues to strike a good balance between new work, risks and big stars – especially compared with New York, where “you can’t do it without the big stars”.“The American system is considered quite broken at the moment. It’s incredibly expensive to put on a play or a musical in New York. The Play That Goes Wrong cost about £250,000 in London, but when it opened in New York eight years ago it cost $4m. With the same set. The climate has only got more difficult. Since Covid, 46 musicals have opened on Broadway,and only three of them have been profitable– including our show Six.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndNcuti GatwaAlicia VikanderSusan SarandonPaul MescalNicola CoughlannewsShareReuse this content"

I think it’s great because Bridget’s a properLondonheroine and the idea of having Bridget ever present in a brilliant location in the centre of London is really exciting.”He added that “this is the first time they’ve had a romantic comedy character.”Big knickers, bad decisions and old bats: Renée Zellweger on the return of Bridget JonesRead moreView image in fullscreenA life-sized bronze statue of the character Indiana Jones being cleaned as it's unveiled in Leicester Square in 2023.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PADesigned by London-based studio 3D Eye, it will become a permanent fixture in the square, which is already home to bronze statues of Paddington Bear, Mary Poppins, Harry Potter, Batman, Gene Kelly in Singin’ in the Rain, Indiana Jones, Charlie Chaplin and Daniel Kaluuya’s character in Get Out.Zellweger will be in attendance for the unveiling, alongside Fellner, co-star Sally Phillips, and Chiwetel Ejiofor and Leo Woodall, who played men vying for the heroine’s affections in the most recent instalment: Mad About the Boy.In that film, Jones struggled to raise two young children after the death of husband, Mark Darcy, played by Colin Firth.It remains unclear whether the statue will depict the character in this fourth film, or whether the bronze will reflect her fondness for chardonnay, cigarettes and big knickers.‘Tears were running down my face’: why Bridget Jones 4 is the most moving romcom of modern timesRead moreView image in fullscreenHarry Potter fans Finn and Joey Bruce, and Sam Parker with a new statue of Harry Potter unveiled in Leicester Square, 2020.Photograph: James Veysey/REX/Shutterstock“I love the idea that [Fielding’s] brilliant writing in a newspaper 30 years ago ends up as a statue in Leicester Square,” said Fellner. “It’s kind of gorgeous.”He added that while Fielding has not written a fifth book in the series from which a film could be adapted, he would be eager to pursue a fifth film, should she come up with an idea.

It is the first time Munday has taken legal action.Taken in two sittings in late 2003 and early 2004, the images are arguably the most distinctive portraits of the monarch. They have been shown in some of the UK’s most prestigious art galleries.Munday said he was trying to be legally recognised as a joint artist with Levine, who he claims came to him because Levine could not have created the holographic image without his expertise.“I’ve been going through this cycle for 20 years,” said Munday, who trained in holography after graduating from college in the early 1980s. “I’m not young any more; it felt like this had to be fought now or never.”The images were commissioned by the Jersey Heritage Trust to mark the 800th anniversary of the self-governing dependency of the UK pledging allegiance to the English crown.Munday claims he and Levine, in conjunction with the trust, came to a settlement in 2005 about authorship of the portraits but that Levine has since breached that.View image in fullscreenChris Levine with Equanimity in 2004.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThe trustsued Levine in July 2024for alleged breach of contract and copyright and claimed the artist owed it money from sales of allegedly unlicensed copies of the portraits, potentially worth millions.The parties settled out of court in September this year and said in a joint statement: “The parties acknowledge that Chris Levine was the sole artist commissioned by the Jersey Heritage Trust to create the portrait and both parties remain incredibly proud of the creative collaboration between artist Chris Levine, holographer Robert Munday of UK Company Spatial Imaging, Jeffrey Robb also of UK Company Spatial Imaging and Dr John Perry (USA) which resulted in the groundbreaking and iconic portrait of Her Late MajestyQueen Elizabeth IItitled Equanimity.”Munday said he decided to take legal action after Levine posted a statement on Instagram after the settlement with the trust. “Truth prevailed,” Levine wrote in a post that has now been deleted. “I was the sole artist commissioned and am now legally recognised as the sole author of the work.”While the joint statement named Munday, it called him a collaborator and not a co-creator of the portrait. He is seeking to be named as a co-author of the works and for Levine to publicly state they created the portraits together.Levine said: “Mr Munday does not hold any copyright in Equanimity or Lightness of Being. Jersey Heritage Trust, who commissioned the work, have publicly confirmed that I was the sole commissioned artist.”He referred to Munday as “a technical subcontractor” hired to assist in production “as part of my team, not as an artistic partner”.He added: “Extraordinarily, as yet no details have been provided to me or my lawyers, and while I will not comment further on ongoing legal proceedings, I am confident that the facts, witnessed by all involved, will once again speak for themselves. This is an ongoing attempt to rewrite history and the motives are obvious. Any claim on my rights will be fiercely defended. This is my art.”Levine, who studied graphic design at Chelsea School of Art and computer graphics at Central Saint Martins School of Art, told the Guardianin 2009that he did not consider himself a photographer. “I’m an artist who works with light and who uses photography in his projects,” he said.Levine’s forthcoming monograph Inner Light: The Portraiture of Chris Levine uses the Lightness of Being on the cover and in the 2009 Guardian interview he picked the portrait as his best shot.It was included in Sotheby’s showPower & Image: Royal Portraiture & Iconographyin 2022 alongside seven portraits of different queens.The subheading and text of this article were amended on 24 October 2025. Rob Munday is the artist suing for co-author credit, not “Ben Munday” as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsPhotographyQueen Elizabeth IIMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

From that hook, Kathryn Bigelow has fashioned an almost unbearably tense thriller out of the American response. As government agencies and armed forces kick into “defcon” mode, the subsequent 15 minutes or so are seen several times from multiple points of view – a missile defence battalion in Alaska, White House politicians and advisers (including Rebecca Ferguson), the military high command, the president himself (Idris Elba). It’s a dazzling, skilful piece of cinema, laser-focused despite the huge (yet utterly believable) cast, with Bigelow’s fascination with the nuts and bolts of statecraft to the fore.Simon WardellStiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost (Ben Stiller, 2025), Apple TV+After the deaths of his parents, comic double act Jerry Stiller (AKA George’s dad in Seinfeld) and Anne Meara, actor-directorBen Stillerdecided to pay tribute to them with a documentary. And there’s plenty of the expected talking heads, archive clips, home videos and unheard tapes to make this a solid eulogy to the popular entertainers and their 62-year marriage. But, fascinatingly, what transpires is more akin to a therapy session for nepo baby Ben, as he acknowledges their “very big shadow” on his own career and – in conversation with his wife and children – his failures as a father and husband.SWHalloween (John Carpenter, 1978), 11pm, BBC TwoIt may not have been the very first slasher movie, but John Carpenter’s 1978 film is certainly the most influential, despite being almost quaint in its restraint when it comes to the blood and guts. The prowling camera, the masked killer, the “final girl” – they’re all here and used superbly, with the tension amped up by the director’s own minimal but menacing piano score. Jamie Lee Curtis’s career was defined by her role as suburban Illinois teenager Laurie, who is menaced by escaped mental patient and sister killer Michael Myers on trick-or-treat night.SWExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightThe Walking DeadAlan PartridgeGraham NortonKim KardashianBryan CranstonKathryn BigelowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You could have taken that as evidence pop had moved on. In Britain, 2018 was a year that the well-mannered boy/girl-next-door pop of George Ezra, Jess Glynne and Ed Sheeran held sway; Allen seemed symbolic of a messier, mouthier era. Afterwards, Allen stepped away from music, concentrating instead on what you’d have to call a diverse portfolio of interests, including acting, podcasting, launching her own sex toy and selling photographs of her feet to fetishists on OnlyFans.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for West End Girl.Photograph: BMG Music/Murray Chalmers PR/PABut pop has a habit of developing in a cyclical way. When Olivia Rodrigobrought Allen on stage at Glastonbury in 2022, it highlighted how deep her impact on the younger artist’s songwriting ran: you could trace a direct line between Allen’s splenetic, sweary Smile and Rodrigo’s similarly forthright brand of breakup anthems. And Rodrigo is merely one among a succession of younger female artists claiming Allen’s influence: Billie Eilish, Sabrina Carpenter, Charli xcx, PinkPantheress. IfLola Younghad a fiver for every time she was compared to Allen, she would never need to work again.So West End Girl arrives in a very different and more welcoming climate to its predecessor. But although you can hear a Charli xcx influence on the fizzing, trebly synths and Auto-Tune overdose of Ruminating, and a whisper of PinkPantheress about the two-step garage-fuelled Relapse, West End Girl really doesn’t seem like an album made for opportune reasons. It feels more like an act of unstoppable personal exorcism. It appears to pick through the collapse of Allen’s second marriage so unsparingly, with such attention to vivid, grubby detail, that you have to assume the lyrics were reviewed by a lawyer. (She told British Voguethat the album references things “I experienced within my marriage, but that’s not to say that it’s all gospel.”)While you can’t tell where poetic licence has been applied, its narrative arc traces accepting an open marriage along certain guidelines (“He had an arrangement, be discreet and don’t be blatant,” Allen sings on Madeline, “there had to be payment, it had to be with strangers”) only for the relationship to explode when it transpires that the husband isn’t abiding by the rules. There are confrontations with other women, a visit to an apartment where Allen (or her character) believes her husband is practising martial arts but where she finds “sex toys, butt plugs, lube” and “a shoebox full of handwritten letters from brokenhearted women”. There is a brief, unhappy attempt to beat him at his own game – on Dallas Major, she joins a dating app under an assumed name, but keeps repeating the phrase “I hate it”. It reaches a bitterly unhappy denouement: “It is what it is – you’re a mess, I’m a bitch … all your shit’s yours to fix.” It’s simultaneously gripping and shocking. There are moments when you find yourself wondering if airing this much dirty laundry can possibly be a good idea, impeccably written and laced with mordant wit though the lyrics are.Lily Allen: Pussy Palace – videoObviously said lyrics will attract the lion’s share of attention. In an era where every pop song is combed through for inferences about the artist’s private life, Allen has dramatically upped the ante: certainly, Taylor Swift complaining that another star once called her “boring Barbie” seems pretty small beer by comparison. But there’s far more to West End Girl than just cathartic disclosure. The songs skip through a variety of styles: the title track’s orchestrated Latin pop; Beg for Me borrows from Lumidee’s 2003 R&B hit Never Leave You; Nonmonogamummy blends electronics and dancehall-influenced guest vocals by London MC Specialist Moss.‘I had all these feelings of rage I couldn’t express’: Olivia Rodrigo on overnight pop superstardom, plagiarism and growing up in publicRead moreWhat ties the songs together beyond the story they tell is the striking prettiness of the tunes, which seem, jarringly, more evocative of a romantic fairytale ending than the anger and unhappiness the lyrics convey. And West End Girl seems to reserve its sweetest melodies for its bleakest moments. 4chan Stan is possessed of a wistful loveliness at odds with its internet basement dweller-referencing title; Pussy Palace – the one with the lyric about butt plugs etc – may well be the most musically addictive, hook-laden track here: it’s as if Allen is defying you not to hit rewind even if you don’t want to hear its squalid story more than once.It’s hard not to wonder whether West End Girl is going to get the reception it deserves for its boldness and the quality of its songwriting: it would be a great pop album regardless of the subject matter. Perhaps some listeners will view it as too personal to countenance. Or perhaps fans who have grown up alongside Allen, now 40, will find something profoundly relatable in the story it has to tell about modern relationships. Underneath all the gory details, it seems to tacitly suggest that open arrangements are easily abused, usually by men, and that believing you’re above outmoded concepts of fidelity – “a modern wife”, as Allen puts it at one point – is no guarantee you won’t get your heart broken. We shall see. What’s for certain is West End Girl is a divorce album like no other.This week Alexis listened toDaniel Avery – The Ghost of Her Smile ft Julie DawsonThe British dance producer explores what he calls “the shoegaze and ethereal corners inside my skull” in the company of NewDad vocalist Dawson to blissful effect.Explore more on these topicsLily AllenAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Don’t provide the answers’: composer Jake Heggie on 25 years of Dead Man WalkingAs his groundbreaking opera about the death penalty comes to the UK, Heggie reflects on its enduring power and the story’s relevance in an age of divisionJake HeggieFri 24 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTShare‘But you’re so young!” Julie Andrews exclaimed on opening night of Dead Man Walking, 25 years ago at the San FranciscoOpera. I had pushed my way to her through the crowded lobby to introduce myself as the composer of the opera, fearful it would be my only chance to meet my first goddess. My first singing nun.Was I that young? It was 7 October 2000. I was 39 and this was my first opera, my long-dreamed-of “big break”. Maybe I was naive, but I felt young and the world felt full of possibility that night. Much different from the world today.Dead Man Walking was a bold story for the opera world at the time, especially since new operas produced by big companies were still something of a rarity. Nobody could have imagined or predicted that the opera would be a huge hit with audiences and that 25 years later Dead Man Walking would have received more than 85 international productions in 13 countries, staged by companies, colleges, conservatories and community groups of all sizes. Nobody could have predicted that during those 25 years, dozens of new operas would be created each year for every imaginable size company and performance space by a vast range of composers and librettists.And nobody could have predicted that the opera would feel more powerful and resonant today than it did 25 years ago.With cruelty being normalised in the US and elsewhere, threats to democracy on the rise, calls for executions increased, “empathy” being labelled as weak, social media dominating and AI on the rise, the opera lands in a very different way in 2025. After itsNew York Metropolitan Opera premiere in 2023, Joyce DiDonato, Ryan McKinny, Susan Graham and the Met cast went toSing Sing, a maximum-security prison to perform excerpts from the opera. A number of the incarcerated population learned and sang chorus roles. It was a shattering experience to listen as armed guards discreetly wiped away tears.View image in fullscreen‘The intention was not to preach’ … Rehearsals for ENO’s new production of Dead Man Walking.Photograph: Manuel HarlanBack in the 1970s and 80s, during my teens and 20s, I was a determined piano and composition student, dreaming of writing songs for Barbra Streisand and musicals for Broadway. Opera seemed only rarely a viable contemporary expression, thanks to groundbreaking work by Philip Glass, John Adams, Meredith Monk and Carlisle Floyd. But it felt unreachable and untouchable.My life changed drastically with a hand injury in my late 20s – a focal dystonia. To make a living, I became a PR and marketing writer and landed a job at the San Francisco Opera.With the opera we were able to tell a deeply human story honestly, and authentically, and to allow the audience to feel it all as part of a community.Every day, I was immersed in the hard-working, astonishing world of opera: rehearsals, performances, meetings with artistic production, development and more. Back then, the company produced 10 operas in the autumn alone. I experienced and felt the majestic power of this art form. I was deeply inspired. In my spare time, I wrote art songs for the divas I was meeting and working with, including Frederica von Stade and Renée Fleming.Another dramatic turn happened in 1995, when the opera’s general director Lotfi Mansouri asked me if I’d ever considered writing an opera. He’d heard about my songs being performed internationally and was eager to discover a new creative voice for the opera stage. I was stunned.View image in fullscreen‘An unexpected, staggering journey’ … Jake Heggie.Photograph: James NiebuhrLotfi wanted to pair me with the great American playwright Terrence McNally as my librettist and he suggested a comic opera: something light, frothy and bubbly to celebrate the new millennium. Fortunately, Terrence had no interest in such an opera. He wanted a bold drama, American but universal, timeless but timely. Lotfi removed the mandate for comedy.It took a while, but during a fateful meeting in 1997, Terrence suggested the story Dead Man Walking. I knew it was the right thing; I felt shivers head to toe and started to feel drama and music big enough to fill an opera house. I was on fire with it.View image in fullscreenDrama and music big enough to fill an opera house … Crispin Lord, Michael Mayes and Malachy Frame rehearse for ENO’s 2025 staging of Dead Man Walking.Photograph: Manuel HarlanSister Helen Prejean’s bestselling memoir had, a few years previously, been made into a brilliant film written and directed by Tim Robbins, starring Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. The story was very much in the national dialogue and highly controversial. A Louisiana nun becomes a pen pal to a convicted murderer on death row, then visits him and becomes his spiritual adviser, ultimately accompanying him to his execution. On her journey she meets the murder victims’ families and the convicted murderer’s family as she navigates the justice system in the US. What she experiences ignites a call to justice in her heart and soul. An activist emerges.When we told Lotfi the idea, he too immediately recognised its power and timeliness. He reminded us that all of the popular classic operas of the past have a social justice message at their heart: The Marriage of Figaro, The Barber of Seville, La Traviata, The Ring, Eugene Onegin, La Bohème, Jenůfa, The Rake’s Progress, Peter Grimes and on and on. Sometimes the message is subtle; sometimes overt.Terrence’s vision of what Dead Man Walking could do as an opera, that it could not do as a book or movie, was to send us deeper into the drama by extending emotionally dramatic moments with real people on stage singing unamplified – allowing us to vibrate in the middle of that emotion. It was not to make a polemic, to preach or tell people what they should feel. It was to tell a deeply human story honestly and authentically, and to allow the audience to feel it all as part of a community. Raise the questions. Don’t provide the answers. We could take something that people usually only consider in the abstract – the death penalty – and put a human face on it.View image in fullscreenA story of redemption… Joyce DiDonato as sister Helen Prejean with Michael Mayes  as Joseph de Rocher in a production of Dead Man Walking at Teatro Real, Madrid, in 2018.Photograph: © Javier del Real | Teatro RealSister Helen was a guiding light and support from the beginning. She knew we’d have to change things to make it work for the stage, that we were not making a documentary or putting a book on the stage. “The only thing I ask, is that it remain a story of redemption,” she said.Terrence wrote the libretto quickly, and I responded in kind. We started our work in 1998 and had a workshop in August of 1999.The premiere happened just over a year later. Our stellar cast included Susan Graham as Sister Helen, John Packard as Joseph De Rocher, Frederica von Stade as Joseph’s mother. Joe Mantello was the director and Patrick Summers conducted. The response was overwhelming. Two performances were added to the original run. Seven opera companies immediately commissioned a second production and others followed suit.And after the premiere, Julie Andrews came backstage to give me a hug I will never forget. It has been an unexpected, staggering journey of community, connection and transformation. And the journey continues.Dead Man Walking has its UK staged premiere in anENO production at the London Coliseum from 1-18 November.

Although Bach famously never travelled far, he was by no means immune to the popular zeitgeist, falling in love with imported works by composers such as Vivaldi and the Marcello brothers, whose music he copied and transcribed in his own inimitable way. This double disc, ingeniously programmed by French violinist Amandine Beyer, pays homage to those Italophile tendencies, juxtaposing Bach’s works influenced by Italian originals with music by the composers themselves.View image in fullscreenBach from Italy artworkPhotograph: Harmonia MundiSome associations are obvious, such as Vivaldi’s concerto for four violins that 25-or-so years later became Bach’s concerto for four harpsichords. Others are more oblique, such as Bach’s double violin concerto that merely begins with the same melodic motif as a Vivaldi trio sonata. Beyer, very much first among equals here, is joined by the musicians of Gli Incogniti in spirited, light-of-foot performances. There’s an alluring sense of fantasy about Vivaldi’s D minor concerto for two violins and cello, for example, ditto Alessandro Marcello’s spritely oboe concerto, both of which Bach transcribed for keyboard. Three Brandenburg concertos positively sizzle. The connections, if occasionally on the tenuous side, are fascinating.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicJS Bachalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

In fairy tales, it’s where children get lost, where witches build houses made of cake, and where transformations occur in the shadow of trees. But it’s also a place of deep, loamy quiet – a world that hums with hidden life. This cake draws on that dark magic: a tender chocolate sponge, earthy and aromatic with cocoa powder and olive oil, topped with a rosemary-infused ganache and strewn with textures that nod to moist soil, fallen leaves, moss, bark and fungi. It’s Halloween baking, but less fright night and more folklore. The aim is to evoke an enchanted woodland, dark, lush and a little eerie. Serve simply, with whipped cream.Forest floor cakePrep10 minSteep10 minCook1 hr 15 minServes10-12For the cocoa cake base80ml unsalted butter, melted, plus extra for greasing200g plain flour75g unsweetened cocoa powder1tsp baking powder½ tsp bicarbonate of soda¼ tsp fine sea salt3 large eggs, at room temperature150g caster sugar80g soft brown sugar100ml olive oil2 tsp vanilla extract250ml plain unsweetened drinking kefir1 tsp instant coffee granulesFor the rosemary chocolate ganache200ml double cream2 large sprigs rosemary200g dark chocolate,finely choppedA pinch of flaky sea saltFor the forest floor decorations (all optional)Cocoa nibs, or crumbled brownies or cake offcutsRoughly chopped hazelnuts, or finely chopped pistachio nutsBlack sesame seedsRosemary sprigsChocolateshards, or chocolate-coated raisinsSmall edible flowersMeringue mushroomsHeat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and grease and line a roughly 28cm x 23cm baking tin.Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, bicarb and salt into a large bowl.In a second bowl, whisk the eggs and both sugars until slightly thickened, then add the oil, melted butter and vanilla. Whisk well to incorporate, then add the kefir and mix smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry and whisk to combine.Stir the coffee granules into 100ml hot water, then add to the batter. Whisk gently until smooth (it will be quite runny), then pour into the prepared tin. Bake for 30 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out with just a few moist crumbs. Leave to cool completely in the tin, then turn out on to a board.To make the ganache, gently heat the cream and rosemary in a small saucepan until just steaming, then take off the heat. Cover and leave to steep for 10 minutes, then reheat the cream. Put the chocolate in a small bowl, then strain the hot cream over it; discard the rosemary. Stir until smooth, then add the salt and leave to cool to a spreadable consistency. Spread over the cooled cake.To decorate, begin with the base ‘soil’ layer: scatter cocoa nibs over the surface for crunch and woodsy bitterness, then crumble over chocolate cake offcuts or brownies to mimic clods. Scatter chopped hazelnuts and finely chopped pistachios to suggest pebbles or gravel, and black sesame seeds for a speckled, organic texture. To introduce life and natural movement, add some botanical elements: sprigs of rosemary as pine or small trees; small edible flowers and micro herbs as forest blooms or green stirrings in the mossy undergrowth. To add structure and a sense of decay, break chocolate shards into irregular pieces and press upright into the cake. Caramelised hazelnut praline shards can also be added to suggest cracked amber or fossilised leaves. For a sense of the fairytale, small meringue mushrooms dusted with cocoa powder can be dotted around in odd-numbered clusters, and pipe on chocolate swirls to mimic creeping vines or roots. Allow some garnishes to trail over the side of the cake for a wild, untamed feel.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotBakingFoodDessertChocolaterecipesShareReuse this content"
