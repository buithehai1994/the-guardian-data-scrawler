The family lived in a flat in a Stockholm suburb and Sofiye worked for the municipality in the home help department. She learned Swedish and her children went through the Swedish school system. Her youngest son was born in Sweden and her 18-year-old son, Hamza, who is studying in college to be a technician, doesn’t know life anywhere else.Three years ago, however, after unsuccessfully seeking refugee status four times, Sofiye lost her right to work and is now living under the threat of a deportation order. For the last two years she and two of her children have been living in limbo in an asylum return centre in an industrial area near Stockholm’s Arlanda airportThe situation is causing her so much anxiety that for the last two months she has lost her appetite and been vomiting with stress. As she spoke to the Guardian she held a plastic bag into which she regularly retched.View image in fullscreenThe asylum return centre near Stockholm’s Arlanda airport. The Swedish migration agency said it had made efforts to ensure the centres were appropriate for children.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The Guardian“I cannot sleep. I sleep just one or two hours. I throw up. I am so stressed. I don’t want to speak to the children because here,” she said, pointing to her head, “is occupied. I don’t know physically, mentally what I should do.”The centre, one of a growing number of reception and return facilities aimed at housing an estimated 11,000 asylum seekers in the coming years, is part of Sweden’s increasingly hostileasylum and immigration policy. The centre-right government, which depends on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats, says it wants to “redirect focus” away from receiving asylum seekers to instead becoming a “country for labour immigration”.The government recently celebrated data showing that Sweden had its lowest level of asylum seekers since 1985, claiming that lower numbers “create better conditions for successful integration”. Thousands of people like Sofiye – who have lived in Sweden for years and are well-established in society and the job market, with children who were born in Sweden – face deportation.Among the recent policy changes include asylum seekers being placed in reception centres instead of being provided with individual accommodation who are then offered “repatriation grants” to leave the country voluntarily.The government has also introduced stricter conditions for gaining citizenship and tightened family reunification rules. Applicants must prove their identity through an in-person visit and provide more documentation than was previously the case.Committing a crime can now result in losing the right to live in Sweden for anyone who is not a Swedish citizen. In 2025 a total of 440 people were subjected to criminal deportations, according to government figures.“If you do not want to become part of this community, you should not come to Sweden,” the government has stated.View image in fullscreenA ‘refugees welcome’ demonstration in Gothenburg in 2015. The attitude towards immigration in Sweden has hardened in the years since.Photograph: Scanpix Sweden/ReutersThe hostile environment is a far cry from Sweden’s immigration policies of the past. In 2014, at the start of a period when the number of people arriving to Europe from countries in the Middle East rose sharply, the then prime minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt, made a speech urging Swedes to“open your hearts”to newcomers.The direction of travel is unlikely to change even with a general election next year, say observers, as the main political parties, including the opposition centre-left Social Democrats, have embraced similar hardline policies.“Many people that we meet say to us: ‘We came to Sweden believing this was a country that respected human rights: where are they?’” said Nannie Sköld, a counsellor at Stockholm Stadsmission’s Who Am I Tomorrow? project, which provides legal and psychosocial support to individuals and families with deportation orders.The latest government figures show that 8,312 people returned to their home countries in 2025, the highest number in a decade, while the number of asylum seekers decreased by 30% on the previous year.“We meet people who came to Sweden for work or to study, and people who don’t have grounds for asylum,” said Sköld. “We also meet people who are fleeing from the Taliban or they are LGBTQ from Uganda, and who then see that their request for international protection is denied.”One of the changes that was having a particularly damaging impact is the decision to abolish “track changes”, she said. The new rule, which came into force at short notice last April, prevents people who have had their asylum applications rejected from applying for a residence permit, even if they have worked in Sweden. It also prevents those who had already obtained a work permit from extending it.The decision is estimated to have put 4,700 people who were established in Swedish society at risk of deportation.Sköld added: “People [who] are well integrated and established in Sweden … are asking: ‘What else could I have done? … How could I possibly prove my worth if even doing everything that is supposedly correct isn’t enough and will never be enough?’”Life in the return centres is tough. The facility near Arlanda, which also houses new arrivals, is an “open” centre, meaning people can come and go. But getting around from there is logistically difficult and many people are getting by on a few kronor a day. It was a difficult place to be in for children, said Sköld, who said her team heard from LGBTQ asylum seekers that the shared spaces could feel unsafe. Many there suffer from poor mental health as a result of their precarious circumstances.“There is a lot of fear, a lot of anxiety,” she said. “People who have received a deportation order fear being deported any day.”View image in fullscreenThamer says his sons are willing and able to work.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianThamer and Faten are a married couple who came to Sweden from Iraq on work visas with their two sons, who are now 20 and 16. Their third son was born in Sweden in 2021. But they now face deportation after their asylum applications were denied and work visas expired. Thamer said that a criminal organisation has threatened to harm their children if they return to Iraq.“There are people who have lived in Sweden for 30 years but they don’t talk Swedish like me,” said Thamer, 52. “I write as well, not just speak. What do they want more than that? I am not a criminal.”Thamer said he was offered a job as a car mechanic but was unable to take it because his work visa had expired. “Sweden wants men and I have three. Can they not make use of them?”The Swedish migration agency said it was unable to comment on individual cases. It was “working to ensure that the [reception and return centres] are safe for everyone staying there, with particular consideration given to children and other vulnerable groups, such as LGBTQ persons”, a spokesperson said.*Those interviewed requested their surnames not be published as their cases arein processExplore more on these topicsSwedenEuropeMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

But behind the scenes the EU and the UK could close the joint bank account and cut up the credit cards, or at least set in motion a form of financial separation that limits the power of a controlling former partner.It won’t be easy to walk away and it won’t be quick. But a degree of separation is necessary and, crucially, achievable.‘At the table or on the menu’: a turbulent Davos week with Trump’s circus in townRead moreAs a tumultuous week in the Swiss Alps ends with a reprieve for Greenland and there is talk of a post-Davos peace deal for Ukraine, maybe some believe a mix of distraction and appeasement can placate the US president. Or that midterm elections in the US will lasso Trump and tame him permanently.If only that were likely. What we know is that the breakdown of a post-second world war order is set in train – let’s face it, the signs have been flashing red since the 2008 financial crisis – and Washington’s next incumbent is likely to be just as belligerent when international rules constrain them.There is some recognition in the shifting tectonic plates of international financeThere is some recognition in the shifting tectonic plates of international finance, which show a separation from the White House wrecking ball is on almost everyone’s mind.The S&P 500 might say the opposite, sucking in, as it does, so much international money that its rise seems unstoppable. In other financial markets, the reverse is true.For instance, China has spent the past year reducing its US government bond holdings. In other words, it has cut the amount it lends to the US government via the bond markets. Japanese pension funds have done the same.In part their policy is driven by the fear of a stock market crash now that US share prices are at highs not seen since the dotcom bubble at the turn of the century. What is fantastic today could bring tears tomorrow, so those who lend must take a more cautious view and hedge against disaster.China and Japan are also selling up because they have trouble at home, encouraging them to repatriate or redirect their foreign investments, but that is a different, if connected, story.The ongoing leaching away of bond investors means the cost of US government borrowing has begun to rise, little by little. IfEuropewere to begin instituting a financial divorce, it too would start selling the US bonds it holds.This week a fearless and spirited pension scheme – the main retirement fund for Danish academics – provided a glimpse of what could be the norm.The AkademikerPension said it would sell all remaining US government bonds in its multibillion-pound fund by the end of the month. The investment director Anders Schelde made the announcement as Trump was still threatening to invade Greenland.“The decision is rooted in the poor US government finances,” he said. “Thus, it is not ⁠directly related ⁠to ​the ongoing rift between the US and Europe, but of course that didn’t make it more ‍difficult to take the decision.”The holding is small, at $100m (£73m). Nevertheless, its impact as a beacon to others could be huge.European regulators could help by making it easier for other pension funds to sell their US bond holdingsEuropean regulators could help by making it easier for other pension funds to sell their US bond holdings. Some experts believe pension funds slavishly followed credit rating agency verdicts. And while most agencies downgraded the US last year, they still say it is a safe bet.It should be remembered that credit ratings agencies were at the heart of the 2008 crash. They said the financial products containing US sub-prime mortgages were safe. They weren’t.If pension funds can consider US debt to be more at risk, they can reduce their holdings. There is a cost, there always is, to a reduction rather than a Danish-style clear-out, which is that the bonds remaining in any portfolio are worth less. And the more pension funds sell, the lower the value goes.But there is a gain, just as there is to the Danish, of a less risky portfolio once the number and value of US bonds is reduced.Europeans could also lend to themselves, if Brussels created a market for bonds denominated in euros. This would create a rival market to US Treasury bonds, offering an alternative safe haven that would drain the US market even further.As a proposal it dates back to a 2010 document from the Bruegel thinktank,which it recently updated. Since then the EU has corralled its disparate members to agree one-off eurobonds, most recently the borrowing that underpinned its post-Covid €385bn (£334bn) NextGenerationEU recovery scheme.Like previous schemes it was a one-off. As Bruegel andmore recently the Peterson Institutehave argued, there needs to be a permanent market that could begin to rival the US and others. The opportunity is ripe. Funds across the world are looking for safe havens and Europe could be one of those places.Brussels could start with a coalition of the willing rather than all 28 countries. It could reluctantly admit that much of the money would be generated by banks in London, which hosts bond markets that run deeper and wider than anything on the continent.And why would that be a problem? Politicians in Berlin, Amsterdam, Dublin and maybe even Paris want the UK to be pulled closer to the EU. If there is more money to be made, then resistance on both sides of the Channel could ebb away.And if there is a degree of insulation from Trump’s threats of financial punishment from Europeans creating their own debt market, in their own currency, then all the better.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsViewpoint columnGlobal economyDavos 2026TariffsDonald TrumpTrump tariffsEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

They can fluently read the nuances of snow and fine-tune their bodies to cross the finish line faster than anyone else.The Canadian snowboarder Ryan Wedding had these skills – but also the quality that catapults amateurs to an elite level: a highly competitive instinct to succeed that can at times manifest in a desire to crush fellow competitors.Those traits were perhaps not as useful as he would have hoped when he competed in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. The course was icy, he misjudged turns and in the end, he failed to reach the podium.But the latter quality – the fierce and relentless desire for success – apparently served him in his rapid rise to leader of a notorious drug trafficking ring which, according to US authorities, raked in $1bn in cocaine sales each year. Wedding allegedly ordered the deaths of those standing in his way.View image in fullscreenThe FBI shows a poster with one of the FBI ten most wanted fugitives, Ryan James Wedding.Photograph: Federal Bureau of Investigation/APOn Friday,top US law enforcement officials announced Wedding had been taken into custody, capping the Canadian’s arc, from prodigious young athlete to a drug boss allegedly nicknamed “El Jefe”, “Giant” and “Public Enemy”. His story has unfolded like the plot of an airport bookstore thriller, with allegations of a witness murder, a corrupt lawyer and shipments of cocaine moving undetected over national borders.But while the core of the story is true, analysts suggest US authorities may have exaggerated the scale of Wedding’s enterprise, creating a kingpin who has now been seized with fanfare just as the Trump administration demands the Mexican government do more against drug trafficking.By all accounts, Wedding’s early years in the northern Ontario city of Thunder Bay, could not have been further from a life of flashy cars, drug cartel alliances and an international manhunt. His grandparents owned the Mount Baldy ski resort, a modest hill that laid the groundwork for the skills needed to compete as a snowboarder at world-class venues.After the disappointing result at the 2002 Olympics, the trajectory of Wedding’s life shifted dramatically. A profile in Toronto Life said he worked as a bouncer at a club, and aggressively worked out at the gym to build his physique.He dabbled in flipping properties, acquired a small collection of expensive vehicles and began dressing in fashions popularized by gang members who frequented the clubs where Wedding worked.In 2006, he was named in a search warrant investigating a marijuana-growing operation in British Columbia, but was never charged. Four years later, however, Wedding was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine after attempting to buy the drug from a US government agent and was sentenced to four years in prison.Incarceration meant that he missed the chance to compete for a hometown crowd when Vancouver hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics.Canadian Olympic snowboarder turned alleged cocaine kingpin in custodyRead moreBut prosecutors say he used the time to forge key relationships with drug dealers, expanding his network and developing trusted contacts that would, in years to come, give him immense reach.The scope of his alleged network was laid bare in January when Jonathan Acebedo-García, a Canadian citizen, was killed at a popular restaurant in Medellín, Colombia’s second-largest city.According to CBC News, Acebedo-García met Wedding in a Texas prison, and began working with him after both were released. He became a trusted ally – until he began working as an FBI informant. Wedding would later call him “the rat” and a “snitch”.Prosecutors say that Wedding displayed his capacity for revenge when he used a Canadian blog calledThe Dirty Newzto track down Acebedo-García and his wife.Authorities allege the website’s owner agreed to not post about Wedding. Instead, he allegedly accepted money to post a photograph of Acebedo-García, which he did on 5 November 2024 with the caption: “This guy single handedly 🐀 out one of the strongest underworld networks that this 🌍 has seen Good chance he’ll never be found again.” The site Dirty Newzhas since been seizedby US authorities.Nearly three months after that post, gunmen located Acebedo-García, who had been living in Medellín for a year. They followed him to the upscale neighbourhood of El Poblado.1:04Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding arrives in US on drug charges – videoThere, at 2.30pm on 31 January, he ordered food at Mi Arepa, a popular restaurant chain specializing inthe traditional cornbreads.While he was eating, a gunman entered the establishment and shot Acebedo-Garcíafivetimes in the back of the head, killing him instantly, before fleeing on a motorcycle.Wedding is believed to have sent a “bejewelled necklace” to one man involved in the killing, and circulated a photo of Acebedo-García’s body to his associates to serve as a warning for disloyalty.The brazen, daylight murder in Medellín is the latest in a string of contract killings which prosecutors have linked to Wedding. In 2023, gunmen attacked a rental home in Caledon, Ontario, believing they were targeting rival criminals who had stolen a drug shipment. Instead, they killed Jagtar Singh Sidhu, 57, and Harbhajan Kaur Sidhu, 55, who had arrived in Canada four months earlier. Their daughter Jaspreet Kaur Sidhu,was shot 13 timesand left critically injured. The next year, 39-year-old Mohammed Zafar was shot dead while sitting in his car in the driveway of his Brampton, Ontario, home over what police say were drug debts.On 5 December, Ontario’s law society suspended the licence of a lawyer who the FBI says advised Wedding to have a key witness murdered.View image in fullscreenCocaine from one of three seizures this year in the Los Angeles area from a group allegedly led by Ryan Wedding sits on a table at the FBI office in Los Angeles on 17 October 2024.Photograph: Christina House/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesDeepak Balwant Paradkar, a lawyer based in the Toronto suburbs, used the social media name @Cocaine_lawyer and cultivated a reputation for helping high-profile drug dealers evade charges.“[Paradkar] told [Wedding], ‘If you kill this witness, the case would be dismissed,’” said Bill Essayli, the first assistant US attorney for the central district of California. “That lawyer is now in custody, and he’ll be extradited and brought to justice here in the United States.”Paradkar has been released on bail pending extradition proceedings and has said that he intends to fight the charges.For years, Wedding evaded capture by hiding inMexico, allegedly under the protection of the Sinaloa cartel. In November, the reward for information leading to his arrest was upped to $15m – a bounty that put him on a level with the most powerful cartel bosses in Mexico.View image in fullscreenThe FBI director, Kash Patel, speaks about the arrest of former Ryan Wedding on multinational drug trafficking charges in Ontario, California, on Friday.Photograph: Amy Taxin/AP“Make no mistake about it, Ryan Wedding is the modern-day iteration of Pablo Escobar,” said the FBI director, Kash Patel. “He is the modern-day iteration of El Chapo Guzmán.”But security experts in Mexico were sceptical about the comparisons of Wedding to figures like El Chapo, who co-founded and led the Sinaloa cartel, one of the world’s most powerful criminal organisations, until he was extradited to the US in 2017.“There’s no indication [Wedding] controls territory, nor that he’s at the head of an armed militia, nor that he’s a major player politically,” said Stephen Woodman, a security analyst in Guadalajara, Mexico.And though US authorities claim Wedding’s enterprise was trafficking 60 tonnes of cocaine a year, this figure does not appear in the indictment, which only mentions specific cases of a few hundred kilos being moved at a time.“I’d say this is a very performative [US] administration that likes to put faces on the issue of international drug trafficking,” said Woodman. “And you can expect films and documentaries to be made about this guy.”Explore more on these topicsDrugs tradeUS crimeCanadaMexicoAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then, arriving at Joint Base Andrews,Joe Bidenoffered farewell remarks to his loyal staff. “We’re leaving office,” he said, “We’re not leaving the fight.”But, one year later, Washington, and the world, have mostly moved on from the 46th president. Biden, 83, has been writing a lucrative memoir, planning a presidential library andfighting prostate cancer. He was once the most powerful man on the planet, but now Biden’s public appearances have been scarce and his influence has palpably diminished.Chris Whipple, an author of books including The Fight of His Life: Inside Joe Biden’s White House, said: “He’s been the invisible man. He’s been very smart to stay under the radar because the last thing the Democratic party needs is any reminders of his final year in office, his ill-starred 11th-hour abdication and the resulting defeat of Kamala Harris.”Former presidents have by tradition tended to keep a low profile out of respect for the office, giving their successors time and space to find their feet and make the Oval Office their own. Trump, as ever, was an outlier as he continued to lambast Biden and falsely claim the 2020 election had been stolen during his political exile.American democracy on the brink a year after Trump’s inauguration, experts sayRead moreBiden, who surprised many with the scale and ambition of his legislative agenda during the first two years of his presidency, saw his opinion poll numbers sag as he neared the end of his term. Adisastrous debate performanceagainst Trump fuelled concerns about his age and forced him to abandon his bid for re-election.A year ago this week he cut a forlorn figure sitting beside his wife, Jill, in the US Capitol Rotunda in Washington as Trumpdelivered an inaugural addressthat spelled out his determination to erase the Biden legacy.Whereas Biden had cast 6 January 2021 as a dark day for US democracy, Trump used his first day to issuesweeping pardons to more than 1,500 rioters, installed 2020 election deniers in senior posts and used state machinery to reframe the assault as an episode of patriotic protest.While Biden signed the biggest climate spending bill in history, Trump has mounted an unrestrainedassault on clean-energy initiativesand championed fossil fuels as the engine of cheaper energy and the burgeoning AI sector.Trump has rejected Biden’s faith in professionalism and expertise, dismissing thousands of career officials, imposing loyalty tests and hollowing out agencies previously insulated from political interference. He elevatedRobert F Kennedy Jrand other fringe voices to influential positions in healthcare.The president has purgeddiversity, equity and inclusion frameworksfrom government and mounted a broad offensive on universities and public bodies he blames for the Biden-era “woke” agenda. It comes alongside an aggressive hardening of immigration policy, both illegal and legal.And on the global stage, Trump issketching a new world orderbased on power, strength and self-interest, straining relations with allies through threats of seizing land and imposing tariffs and economic coercion. It is a far cry from Biden’s commitment to postwar structures such as Nato and support for Ukraine.In the face of such an onslaught it is Barack Obama, 64, who has been more politically active, taking part in dozens of public engagementsincluding campaign ralliesduring last November’s elections.Biden’s forays into public life, by contrast, have been few and far between. In May his post-presidential office announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, which had spread to his bones.In July he spoke at the Society for Human Resource Management’s convention in San Diego, California, andsaid he was receiving calls“from a number of European leaders asking me to get engaged”. Biden also revealed he was “working like hell” to write a 500-page memoir, which hereportedly soldfor $10m to Little, Brown & Co, an imprint within Hachette.However,NBC News reportedthat Biden was struggling to raise money for a presidential library from donors who feel fatigued and let down. Obama’s presidential library is due to open in Chicago this spring.In October, Biden addressed an audience in Boston afterreceiving a lifetime achievement awardfrom the Edward M Kennedy Institute. “Friends, I can’t sugar-coat any of this. These are dark days,” Biden said. He then predicted the country would “find our true compass again” and “emerge as we always have – stronger, wiser and more resilient, more just, so long as we keep the faith”.But Democrats have shown little appetite for such interventions. Many still blame Biden for stubbornly clinging on to the 2024 presidential nomination until it was too late, giving Harris only 107 days to forge a campaign of her own. His failure to prevent Trump’s return to the Oval Office is seen asan indelible stain on his legacy.‘Who will stand up and oppose it?’: Trump’s relentless campaign of retribution in his second termRead moreFrank Luntz, a political consultant and pollster, said: “He left office on a low and even Democrats feel like they were misled, so it’s gonna take a while for his reputation to return. He had a good one for the first couple of years but that’s not what people remember of his presidency. They remember how he went out, not how he came in.”Now regarded as yesterday’s news, Biden is fading more quickly from the collective consciousness than most ex-presidents. But if anyone is keeping his memory alive, it is Trump and his fellow Republicans. The 79-year-old incumbent constantly references his predecessor in speeches and at press conferences, often with insults such as “Crooked Joe” and “Sleepy Joe”.Trump installed a “presidential walk of fame” along the White House’s west colonnade, featuring portraits of past presidents, replacing Biden’s portrait with an autopen image to mock his age and legitimacy. An accompanying plaque calls him “by far, the worst President in American History”.Luntz added: “It feels like the election isn’t over. It feels like it’s being rerun. It’s Groundhog Day. The election’s being run again and again and again.”The White House hasopened an investigationinto the Biden administration’s use of thepresidential autopen, which Trump has called “one of the biggest scandals in the history of our country”. Republicans in the House of Representatives launchedinvestigationsasserting that Biden’s closest advisers covered up aphysical and mental declineduring his presidency. The Senate starteda series of hearingsfocused on his mental fitness.But political commentators are sceptical that, more than a year into Trump’s presidency, efforts to make the electorate look back in anger at the 46th president will have much purchase.Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said:“Based on survey evidence, Trump’s effort to blame Biden for the current state of the economy is falling flat with the American people. By a margin of better than two to one, they say it’s Trump’s economy, not Biden’s, so from that standpoint rattling on about Biden on the most important issue facing the country is manifestly not helping him.”Explore more on these topicsJoe BidenThe first year of Trump 2.0Donald TrumpDemocratsUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It will cost too much to fight the Manchester mayoralty and there is no guarantee we would win it.”The fight over Labour’s future crystallised on Saturday evening, when Burnham submitted his application to run in the seat alongside a letter to the party’s ruling national executive committee (NEC).He wrote in the letter: “I see this byelection as the frontline of that fight for the Manchester Way and I feel I owe it to a city which has given me so much to lead it from the front, despite the risks involved.”He said he wanted to run a “hopeful and unifying” campaign. If selected, he would face strong challenges from Reform UK and the Green party.The NEC could meet as soon as Sunday morning to decide whether to let Burnham resign from the mayoralty and to put himself forward to the local party for selection as their candidate.While NEC members are free to cast their votes however they wish, the prime minister’s allies have a majority on the committee and are expected to vote against Burnham should those around Downing Street make it clear that’s what they want.One person with knowledge of the committee’s processes said: “There are significant cost implications to having a mayoral selection and byelection, it’s reasonable to expect mayors to serve their term.”Starmer faces pressure not to block Andy Burnham’s return to parliamentRead moreThe byelection was called this week afterthe resignation of the former minister Gwynne, who announced he was standing down because of ill health. Gwynne sat as an independent after being suspended from Labour over offensive WhatsApp messages.It has long been rumoured that Burnham would mount a bid to replace Gwynne. Days before the party’s conference in Liverpool last year, Burnham told the Telegraph that Labour MPshad contacted him over the summer, asking him to stand, after becoming concerned at Starmer’s growing unpopularity.Polling suggests Starmer is one of the least popular Labour prime ministers ever and Labour MPs are increasingly concerned about how his leadership will impact May’s local elections.View image in fullscreenBurnham’s application could still be blocked by Labour’s national executive committee, the party’s ruling body which is dominated by Starmer allies.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesIn his letter, Burnham said Greater Manchester faced a “direct threat” to “everything [it] has always been about from a brand of politics which seeks to pit people against each other”, perceived as a reference to the growth of the populist right.Some polling has suggested Burnham is the only Labour candidate who could see off a challenge from Nigel Farage’s party.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, and Labour’s deputy leader, Lucy Powell, both told the Fabian Society’s conference on Saturday that Burnham should be allowed to stand.Khan told the event in central London: “I’m a firm believer in the best team having all the talent playing for them, and if Andy wants to return to parliament, I will try and make some time between now and the byelection to knock on some doors for him.”Meanwhile Powell, who represents the neighbouring Manchester Central constituency, said the NEC should be wary of blocking Burnham from standing.She said it should be up to Burnham and party members in the constituency whether he is allowed to be the Labour candidate. She praised Burnham as “incredibly popular” and as having changed Manchester “for the better”.She said: “It should be up to Andy and the local members who will select their candidate, and our members are very discerning.”Powell also acknowledged Labour could easily lose to either Reform or the Green party if the wrong candidate was selected.“In that context, I always want to see the very best candidate, the person who can most help Labour win in that very difficult byelection,” she said. “I want to see the best candidates come forward and be able to come forward and help us win.”Can Andy Burnham calm the anger in a Manchester seat Labour fears losing?Read moreHealth secretary Wes Streeting, perceived as Burnham’s biggest rival for the leadership should Starmer be deposed, refused to say whether he would support Burnham’s candidacy.“This is a decision for the party, not for the cabinet,” he said. “I have been told in no uncertain terms that is my answer to the question. This is a really critical byelection. We have to work hard to earn people’s trust and to earn every vote. We want the best possible candidate for that byelection.”However, he added: “In the last day or so, without having indicated whether he wants to run, I’ve seen some pretty unkind things said about Andy, as usual from people who don’t put their names on this sort of briefing.“I think that is a disgraceful way to treat someone who is a Labour mayor, part of our team and part of our movement.”Two members of the government have now said they think Burnham should be allowed to run. Energy secretary Ed Miliband, who led the party between 2010 and 2015, said: “I very much hope the local party will have the option of selectingAndy Burnhamas the candidate.”Miatta Fahnbulleh, parliamentary undersecretary of state in the housing, communities and local government, said: “We’ve got the fight of our lives on our hands to beat Reform, which we have a moral duty to the country to do, and we need our best team on the pitch.“So if he wants to put his hat in the ring and if he can persuade his members and persuade the electorate to bring him in then I think he would be an asset.”View image in fullscreenMiatta Fahnbulleh MP speaks during the Co-operative party conference last year. She said Burnham ‘would be an asset’ if he could persuade members and the electorate to vote him in.Photograph: Jeff Moore/PAOther ministers believe it would be a mistake to allow Burnham to run.“I know No 10 is inept but surely they are not inept enough to allow a man to enter parliament for the sole purpose of challenging the prime minister,” one said.Another said that it would be a “big decision” for the national executive committee, who will have to consider the prospect of a costly mayoral byelection.“If he stands, it will be to go on the backbenches until the prime minister decides to give him a role,” one Starmer ally added.“These are the facts he needs to consider. There is no vacancy for leader if that is where his ambition lies. Very few in the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] would welcome the distraction of any talk of a leadership challenge.”Another backbench MP added: “We are gearing up for crucial elections across the country. We really don’t need a Burnham circus taking resources away – he needs to put the party before personal ambition for a change.“Besides, a mayoral byelection would cost around £5m. It simply wouldn’t be right to cut short his term in this way.”Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamLabourKeir StarmerGreater ManchesterManchesterByelectionsLabour party leadershipnewsShareReuse this content"

The UK military, with tremendous heart and soul, is second to none (except for the USA). We love you all, and always will!”The post came a day after Trump was criticised for his remarks thatNatoallied troops “stayed a little off the frontlines” in Afghanistan.Keir Starmer raised the comments directly with the US president in a conversation on Saturday, No 10 said.A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The prime minister spoke to the president of the United States, Donald Trump, this afternoon.“The prime minister raised the brave and heroic British and American soldiers who fought side by side in Afghanistan, many of whom never returned home. We must never forget their sacrifice, he said.“As Ukraine approaches the fourth year of war since Russia’s full-scale invasion, the leaders agreed on the need to see progress towards a sustainable ceasefire.“Whilst diplomatic efforts continue, the prime minister reiterated that international partners must continue to support Ukraine in its defence against [Vladimir] Putin’s barbaric attacks.“The leaders also discussed the need for bolstered security in the Arctic, and the prime minister said it was an absolute priority for his government.“The leaders discussed the importance of the UK-US relationship, which continues to stand the test of time. They agreed to speak soon.”Also on Saturday, Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, joined criticism of Trump’s comments on the role of non-US Nato troops in Afghanistan, defending the memory of Italian soldiers killed and wounded there.“The Italian government was astonished to hear President Trump’s statement claiming that Nato allies ‘fell behind’ during operations in Afghanistan,” Meloni posted on X.During the nearly 20 years of Nato operations in Afghanistan, she said, “our nation paid a cost that is beyond dispute: 53 Italian soldiers killed and more than 700 wounded”.“For this reason, statements that downplay the contribution of Nato countries in Afghanistan are unacceptable, especially when they come from an allied Nation,” she added.Meloni noted that the US had invoked article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the country that killed 3,000 people, in effect launching the Afghanistan campaign.Article 5 requires Nato member states to defend any of their number who come under attack.Meloni acknowledged the strong ties between Italy and the US.“But friendship requires respect, a fundamental condition for continuing to ensure the solidarity at the core of the Atlantic Alliance,” she added.Earlier on Saturday, Italy’s foreign minister also paid tribute to Italy’s dead and wounded in Afghanistan in an online post.AFP contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS newsDonald TrumpNatoKeir StarmerAfghanistannewsShareReuse this content"

It will set standards and training for police forces and acquire new technology such as facial recognition cameras – acontroversial movethat has provokedfierce criticismover its impact on privacy and human rights – on behalf of all police forces.A joint statement from the Met, counter-terrorism policing and the National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “Modern crime requires a modern policing response. We support and have been calling for this ambitious step to bring together some of the most capable policing teams in the country into a single National Police Service.“This builds on the high international regard that already exists among partners for counter-terrorism policing, whose capabilities and professionalism are recognised globally.“This transformation, however, must be delivered with care. Its success depends on maintaining strong connections with local policing and the communities we serve.“Neighbourhood officers remain indispensable in disrupting organised crime and countering terrorism. Their relationships, insights and presence on the ground are foundational to public safety.“As we implement this reform programme, protecting those vital local links will be essential to ensuring the new National Police Service strengthens – not separates – the bond between policing and the public.”The NPS will be created in stages, working alongside existing agencies and regional organised crime units for the transition.Backing the plans, Neil Basu, former head of counter-terrorism policing, said NPS will be “far more capable as one national security system dealing more effectively with major crime, organised crime and terrorism in all its forms”.Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Crime Agency, which would be merged into the new organisation, is also supporting the proposals.“I am proud of the brilliant work NCA officers do to protect the public from serious and organised crime and new and emerging threats,” he said. “But the overall policing system is out of date. Crime has changed, technology has changed, and how we respond needs to change.“As part of reform, we need a single, stronger national law enforcement body, building on the NCA and others, to more coherently tackle organised crime, fraud, terrorism and the new international and online threats we face.”Biggar added: “These are threats that affect us all locally, but need a national and international response. Such a body would enable us to improve how we protect the public, our communities and the country.”Sir Mark Rowley, the head of the Metropolitan police, has also previously supported the idea of the national responsibility for counter-terrorism being removed from his force.But the plans were met with concern on the part of Graham Wettone, a policing analyst.Wettone is a former frontline operational officer of 30 years’ experience who specialised in public order, policing protests and demonstrations.Poorly performing police forces to be named and shamed under new plansRead moreHe said: “Hopefully they have consulted with those people actually doing the job: operational frontline officers and frontline detectives, the detectives actually going out investigating crime, police officers in uniform answering calls.“I don’t believe they have. From what I’m hearing, it seems to me it’s largely come from the Home Office, from people that have advised or guided the Home Office as to what policing needs, having never actually done the job at all – possibly from police leaders who haven’t actually done the job for some period of time.”But, he added: “Fraud investigations are complex, so probably do need a national overview. Because there’s now a huge amount of online fraud, it covers many areas of the country, so having one force managing it is very, very difficult when your offenders and your victims can be in Lancashire, Yorkshire and Devon and Cornwall.“So it makes sense. It makes sense to nationalise some aspects as organised crime groups don’t stick to county boundaries. They literally work across the country, and will move people across the country from force to force area.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceShabana MahmoodPolice and crime commissionersnewsShareReuse this content"

The video-sharing platform is the world’s second most visited website, after Google itself, and is owned by Google.Researchers at SE Ranking, a search engine optimisation platform, found YouTube made up 4.43% of all AI Overview citations. No hospital network, government health portal, medical association or academic institution came close to that number, they said.“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,”the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches, and creators with no medical training at all).”Google told the Guardian that AI Overviews was designed to surface high-quality content from reputable sources, regardless of format, and a variety of credible health authorities and licensed medical professionals created content on YouTube. The study’s findings could not be extrapolated to other regions as it was conducted using German-language queries in Germany, it said.The research comes aftera Guardian investigationfound people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews responses.In one case that experts said was “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could have left people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. The company laterremoved AI Overviewsfor some but not all medical searches.The SE Ranking study analysed 50,807 healthcare-related prompts and keywords to see which sources AI Overviews relied on when generating answers.They chose Germany because its healthcare system is strictly regulated by a mix of German and EU directives, standards and safety regulations. “If AI systems rely heavily on non-medical or non-authoritative sources even in such an environment, it suggests the issue may extend beyond any single country,”they wrote.AI Overviews surfaced on more than 82% of health searches, the researchers said. When they looked at which sources AI Overviews relied on most often for health-related answers, one result stood out immediately, they said. The single most cited domain was YouTube with 20,621 citations out of a total of 465,823.View image in fullscreenResearchers at SE Ranking found YouTube made up 4.43% of all AI Overview citations.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAThe next most cited source wasNDR.de, with 14,158 citations (3.04%). The German public broadcaster produces health-related content alongside news, documentaries and entertainment. In third place was a medical reference site,Msdmanuals.comwith 9,711 citations (2.08%).The fourth most cited source was Germany’s largest consumer health portal,Netdoktor.de, with 7,519 citations (1.61%). The fifth most cited source was a career platform for doctors,Praktischarzt.de, with 7,145 citations (1.53%).The researchers acknowledged limitations to their study. It was conducted as a one-time snapshot in December 2025, using German-language queries that reflected how users in Germany typically search for health information.Results could vary over time, by region, and by the phrasing of questions. However, even with those caveats, the findings still prompted alarm.Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher specialising in AI, health and law at the University of Basel who was not involved with the research, said: “This study provides empirical evidence that the risks posed by AI Overviews for health are structural, not anecdotal. It becomes difficult for Google to argue that misleading or harmful health outputs are rare cases.“Instead, the findings show that these risks are embedded in the way AI Overviews are designed. In particular, the heavy reliance on YouTube rather than on public health authorities or medical institutions suggests that visibility and popularity, rather than medical reliability, is the central driver for health knowledge.”A Google spokesperson said: “The implication that AI Overviews provide unreliable information is refuted by the report’s own data, which shows that the most cited domains in AI Overviews are reputable websites. And from what we’ve seen in the published findings, AI Overviews cite expert YouTube content from hospitals and clinics.”Google said the study showed that of the 25 most cited YouTube videos, 96% were from medical channels. However, the researchers cautioned that these videos represented fewer than 1% of all the YouTube links cited by AI Overviews on health.“Most of them (24 out of 25) come from medical-related channels like hospitals, clinics and health organisations,”the researchers wrote. “On top of that, 21 of the 25 videos clearly note that the content was created by a licensed or trusted source.“So at first glance it looks pretty reassuring. But it’s important to remember that these 25 videos are just a tiny slice (less than 1% of all YouTube links AI Overviews actually cite). With the rest of the videos, the situation could be very different.”Explore more on these topicsGoogleAI (artificial intelligence)YouTubeHealthAlphabetInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump claimed he had reached “the framework of a future deal” on Greenland.In a New York Post interviewpublishedon Saturday, Trump boasted that the US will gain sovereignty and take ownership over land in Greenland where American bases are located.“We’ll have everything we want,” Trump reportedly told the Post. “We have some interesting talks going on.”Meanwhile, in the same Post interview published on Saturday, TrumpsaidUS refineries will process the oil his administration had taken from seized Venezuelan tankers.“Let’s put it this way – they don’t have any oil,” Trump told the Post. “We take the oil.”The oil is being refined in “various places” including Houston, he said.The US military hasseizedseven Venezuela-linked tankers since the start of Trump’s month-long campaign to control Venezuela’s oil flows. Trump said on Tuesday that his administration had taken 50m barrels of oil out of Venezuela and was selling some of it in the open market.The intercepted vessels either were under US sanctions or said to be part of a “shadow fleet” ofships that disguisetheir origins to move oil from major sanctioned producers: Iran, Russia or Venezuela.Trump’s Latin American foreign policy has homed in on Venezuela, initially aiming to push the Venezuelan president,Nicolás Maduro, from power. After failing to accomplish that aim through diplomacy, Trump ordered US forces to fly into the country to grab Maduro and his wife in an overnight raid on 3 January, bringing them to New York to face criminal drug-related charges anddetaining themthere.In Saturday’s interview with the Post, Trump bragged that a new weapon he called “the discombobulator” played a central role in that raid.Those remarks came after the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,sharedon social media a purported eyewitness account of the US military using some sort of “very intense sound wave” to incapacitate Maduro’s bodyguards.Trump has said the US plans to control Venezuela’s oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country’s dilapidated oil industry in a $100bn plan thatis promptingmany raised eyebrows, not least fromenvironmentalistsand the US oil giants.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpCanadaChinaTrump tariffsTariffsOilnewsShareReuse this content"

Local officials immediately cast doubt on the federal statements, citing videos of the scene, and have insisted local law enforcement need to be involved in an investigation.At the scene, people poured into the street as dozens of federal agents repeatedly shot chemicals into the air and at people who were yelling at them. Some were arrested. “What are you doing?” one woman yelled, captured on a livestream. “You just shot someone and now you’re terrorizing us. What more can we take?”The city, and suburbs and some rural areas are under siege by thousands of federal agents. Some people, including US citizens, have barely left home in weeks, fearing agents will detain them regardless of immigration status.Neighbors have come together to bring food and needed items to their homes, distributing mutual aid far and wide so people can stay inside if it’s safest to do so. Parents have joined patrols outside schools before and after the school day to make sure children can get home safely. Children have been detained, including atwo-year-oldand afive-year-old.Rachel Sayre, the director of Minneapolis’s emergency management department, compared it to conflict zones she has seen in other countries.“My background is in international humanitarian response in conflict zones in Yemen, Haiti, Syria, Iraq and Ukraine,” she said. “What I’ve seen here is what I’ve seen there – a powerful entity violently and intentionally terrorizing people.”A network of observers monitors immigration enforcement activity around the clock, following officers and alerting residents when they’re around. Agents have grown increasingly hostile and violent toward observers – pulling them from cars, showering them with chemical irritants, arresting and detaining them.They have not backed down – and they won’t after another killing. The palpable anger and sadness at the ongoing occupation, and a desire to protect each other, continues to fuel the rapid response. One GoFundMe for rapid responders is seeking funds for people to get protective equipment, including goggles, gas masks and bulletproof vests, so they can continue to observe ICE.There’s a sense that the situation in the state is untenable and unsteady, and that it’s unlikely the federal government will deescalate the situation.“This will end when enough Americans say this will end,” Walz said. “Do I have any confidence Donald Trump will do the right thing? No, I don’t have a lot of confidence Donald Trump will do the right thing. I do have a lot of confidence that the majority of the American people will do the right thing.”Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisMinnesotaICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Tim WalzUS immigrationProtest (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Here’s what experts say.What do we know about the shark attacks?The shark attacks happened on 18, 19 and 20 January at Vaucluse, Dee Why and Manly in Sydney, and on the mid-north coast. The NSW minister for primary industries and regional development, Tara Moriarty, has described this month’s shark attacks as “unprecedented”.Dr Amy Smoothey at the NSW Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development analysed images of the bites from the recent attacks, and concluded bull sharks were probably involved. Bull sharks prefer water temperatures above 19C, and tend to arrive in Sydney in October, with their numbers peaking in January and February.2:16‘Perfect storm’: why have there been so many shark attacks in Sydney? – videoExperts have said the attacks were the result of a“perfect storm”of factors, including more people in the water during summer, a rise in ocean temperatures caused by global heating, and murky waters after weekend storms.Many expertshave pointed to the intense rainfallseen in Sydney last weekend, where some areas received more than 50mm in the space of a few hours, as a key factor behind the attacks.They say the rainfall flushed out brackish water from estuaries into the ocean, which suits bull sharks because they can hunt in low visibility.The murky waters also attract “bait” fish, who feed on microorganisms such as plankton, which themselves thrive on nutrients and bacteria flushed from river, storm water and sewage overflows.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“After heavy rain, [bull sharks] move into foraging mode, so they are actively feeding more,” Robert Harcourt, emeritus professor of marine ecology at Macquarie University, said. A paper which analysedtagged bull sharksaround Sydney found they followed fish to areas with turbid waters after heavy rains – within a day in the case of male sharks.So could Sydney’s unique sewerage system have played a part?For Prof Ian Wright, a water scientist at Western Sydney University who worked for Sydney Water between 1989 and 2006, “the answer is yes”.“There’s a lot more than just that, but that has a role,” Wright said.After four attacks in close order, Wright said he had been “racking my brain, [asking] ‘why did this happen?’“Well, we had extraordinary rain, warm water, very poor water quality,” Wright said.Sydney’s sewage management system is unique among Australian cities in that itonly uses “primary treatment”, a process which removes solids – or sludge – before releasing the remaining effluent directly into the ocean.Other cities use secondary treatment, which involves biological processes such as using bacteria to break down organic material, or more sophisticated forms that remove nitrogen and nutrients from effluent.Sydney’s system is also very old, with many ageing pipes, plants and sewers – some from the 19th century – unable to keep up with a growing population. During extreme rain events, storm and wastewater overflows can increase the risk of drinking water and the environment being contaminated.Twice as effective as nets: shark-spotting drones to become ‘permanent fixture’ on Queensland beachesRead moreWright said storm water could have flushed Sydney’s diffuse pollution and “sewage from overflows from a sewerage system that does need to be upgraded” into the ocean, ultimately driving shark activity.“A lot of our urban runoff, especially in the heavily developed areas, becomes dilute sewage. Bacterial levels rise.”Shark Ethology Australia consultant and academic Victoria Camilieri-Asch said the link between storm, agricultural and wastewater runoff following heavy rain and increased shark activity was “indirect”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Three treatment plants, at Malabar, Bondi and North Head, now pump 80% of the city’s effluent through pipes which extend between 2 to 4km out to sea.ASydney Water reportfrom August 2025 pointed to a combination of heavy rain and a buildup of fats, oils and grease at the Malabar plant as thecause of poo ballsbeing ejected from its deep ocean outfall. They washed up on Sydney beaches last summer andagain after last weekend’s storms.View image in fullscreenWater scientist Prof Ian Wright says the warnings for swimming water quality and shark safety were now effectively the same.Photograph: TOM VIERUS,  livingdreams.tv/Tom VierusHarcourt said it was a “long bow” to link the deepwater ocean outfalls to recent shark attacks near beaches, saying that the “nutrification” process that attracts microorganisms and ultimately shark life had been pushed offshore after the outfalls were built.Wright also said he did not believe the ocean outfalls were directly responsible.But Dr Colette Kerry, a physical oceanographer at the University of NSW, said current coastal conditions could mean the ocean outfalls were having an impact. Climate change means the eastern Australian current, which normally veers away north of Sydney, was “about three degrees warmer” than usual for this time of year, and staying close to the coast, she said.Kerry said that meant it was trapping the nutrient-rich, brackish water washed into the ocean from rivers and estuaries by last week’s storms, but also potentially the effluent discharged from the outfalls.“The conditions that we have at the moment are more conducive to those [sewage] plumes being trapped close to the coast rather than dispersing,” she said.What don’t we know?Guardian Australia put questions to Sydney Water about the potential impact of its wastewater management practices on shark activity. The water utility referred questions to the NSW minister for water, Rose Jackson, who put out a statement after the attacks.“I can absolutely understand why people are looking for answers as to why there’s been this cluster of attacks, but I would caution against over-simplifying the issue as directly linked to our wastewater network,” she said.“It’s also important to keep in perspective that whilst heavy rainfall is a common occurrence, shark attacks in Sydney and NSW waters are very rare.”Jackson said “Sydney Water takes water quality very seriously” and the utility was undertaking a $34bn network upgrade and expansion over the next 10 years, including to the Malabar, Bondi and North Head systems.The Sydney Water chief executive, Darren Cleary, recently defended the use of the three outfalls at Malabar, Bondi and North Head.“Deep ocean outfalls have been meeting environmental standards for nearly three decades,” he said.Cleary said Sydney Water conducted regular testing around the site where diffusers release sewage offshore and Sydney beaches generally had very good water quality.Camilieri-Asch said this week’s attacks showed wastewater systems and the way they are being managed raised good questions for new research.Wright said the warnings for swimming water quality and shark safety were now effectively the same.“If it’s poor water, if it looks dodgy, if it smells a bit off, don’t go in, because it’s not good. You could pick up a waterborne disease, but you could also become prey for a shark.”Do you know more?

How would I survive their sudden loss?I was 16 when the course of my life changed, and for years I was unable to speak about about what had happenedFiona CollierSat 24 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareIam lying in bed listening to the radio at my boarding school as my roommate is getting dressed. As she walks out of the door she says, “See you at breakfast – don’t be late.” I’m about to get up when the early morning news comes on the radio, and I hear the announcer saying my parents’ names.By the time my roommate arrives at breakfast, everyone has heard. My friends run to be with me. The housemaster and his wife stand in the corridor outside my bedroom, not allowing anyone in. All they can hear are my screams and the smashing of furniture. It is beyond comprehension, but then everything from now on is beyond comprehension.On this sunny May bank holiday in 1978, my mother, father and sister had flown to Le Touquet in France for lunch, a journey my father had made many times, piloting his helicopter. On their return, air traffic control lost contact with them over the Channel. They never arrived back in UK airspace and were all presumed dead.A few weeks before it happened, a girlfriend and I had tied our sheets together and used them to shimmy out of our bedroom window, meet our boyfriends and go up to London for the night. The head girl reported us, but the teachers had no proof of what we had done, so we denied it and avoided being expelled.If I had been, I would have been with my parents and I would not be here today.My memory after hearing the news becomes like a comic strip, frames of events with little speech. My bedroom door opens and my aunt Bunny, my father’s sister, walks in. I get into my father’s car and his driver, Isaac, whom I adore and have known all my life, sits immaculate in a suit and tie, sobbing uncontrollably; my friends are standing by the car crying and hugging each other. The car drives away, everything is in slow motion, and I stare out of the window looking at all the faces staring back at me, not knowing what is happening.The drive back to my family home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, takes just under an hour. I sit alone in the back seat – my aunt never touching or speaking to me. The only recollection of the journey that I have is the smell of leather, Isaac sobbing and his aftershave.When we arrive, my other sisters are there – Louise, 19, and Sophie, six. Emma, who was in the helicopter, was 14 and I am 16. The house is full of strangers and the phone is ringing constantly; people arriving; rushing; staring; crying; asking, “Where are the girls – is the doctor coming to give them something?” I feel like I am on a tightrope high above them – I dare not move or talk, I just have to keep still so I can stop myself from falling.At one stage two policemen arrive. I stare at them, wondering why they are here. Their shiny shoes and tight-fitting uniforms seem out of place in the chaos.The rest of the day is a blank. I don’t know what I did or who I spoke to. I don’t recall anyone telling me what had happened; I only know because of hearing the news.That night, Louise and I sleep in our parents’ bed. I still used to get in with my mother when my father was away – I would creep in and she’d say, “Oh no, you’re not sleeping in here.” I would reply, “OK, I’ll watch telly with you, then go to my bed.” I always fell asleep.Now, I lie on my father’s side of the bed but don’t sleep. I stare at his shoes all lined up in his dressing room and go through every pair, imagining him in each one, wondering what socks he would wear. His shoes were beautifully looked after, containing shoe trees to keep the shape of the leather, and I imagine my body shrinking and sleeping in one.View image in fullscreenCollier’s parents in London in the 1960s, ‘probably at a rugby dinner’.Photograph: courtesy of Fiona CollierMy father ran a plant-hire and earth-moving business which was involved in the construction of a section of the M5 near Bristol. He sold the business and invested in various projects. Like my mother, he was always immaculately dressed. I would watch him polishing his shoes, placing a hand inside to turn them as he massaged in the polish, then buffed the leather until it shone.Over the next few days, there is a massive air and sea search by both the French and English military. To this day, no one knows what happened. It had been a beautifully clear day, with no fog, according to local fishermen who had been out that day.My father’s last call before he left the house had been to check the floats on the helicopter – which allowed you to land on water – were working. They were. This makes me believe the helicopter is floating in the Channel and it is only a matter of time before they find them. Louise and I joke about how my mother will be complaining about her hair being flat if it has got wet. They will soon be home, my father in his shoes, my mother with a new hairdo, and Emma and I back playing together.A few days after the accident, I am in my father’s study and I open a drawer. I find a gold necklace of his with a fish on that he used to wear in the summer and thought he had lost. We would spend the summers in Portugal, and he would wear bell bottom jeans and a denim jacket, bare chested, and his goldfish necklace. In the 70s, this was a cool look. I pick it up and run into the hall, shouting, “Daddy, I’ve found your necklace.” The au pair, who is looking after Sophie, who has special needs, appears and stares at me in horror.We had a “pool room” at home – it looked out over the kidney-shaped pool, had a great music system and was decorated with low, orange corduroy sofas, cork walls and frosted mirrors. In the summer, the music was turned up – usually the Beach Boys or David Bowie on full volume. Sliding glass doors opened on to the pool – full of our friends; my mother, in her pale pink floral bikini, cork wedges and large straw hat, often sitting among them. Sophie would also be there, jumping off the side of the pool into the arms of one of my friends.After two weeks, it becomes real. My father’s body is found on a beach in France. Another two weeks and my mother’s body is found, another two and Emma is found, still strapped into her seat. My understanding of the delay is that it has something to do with the tides.When my father is found, I am alone at my family home. The phone goes and Bunny says, “They have found your father.” I scream, “Where is he?” She replies, “No, Fiona, he is dead.”Iremember very little of the next four months before I moved out. There were three separate funerals and a memorial service in Harpenden. The local shops closed, and I wore an outfit of my mother’s. I remember thinking she would be cross if she found out. She was very fashionable and her clothes were haute couture, stylish and extremely beautiful, as was she. During the service, I started to laugh uncontrollably, and I couldn’t stop. This was the first time I felt out of control. There were some young girls there from the local prep school Louise, Emma and I had gone to, wearing cream straw hats with a red ribbon and bright red wool blazers.With no warning, people came to pack up our home. I walked into our kitchen and women from a removal company were emptying cupboards. There were no men: it was all elderly women. One, in a thick industrial apron, looked at me and said, “We will be very careful.” She was holding my father’s crystal tumbler.When I was about five years old, it was a ritual that when my father arrived back from work, I would push a chair up to the drinks cabinet, reach up for the bottles and make him a whisky and water. He would take my thumb and show me how much whisky to put in the tumbler by marking to just above the joint in my thumb. After handing the glass to him, I would climb on to his lap, lay my head against his chest and listen to the whisky travelling inside him, like a tiny wave.I think people fear me. I stare at them and barely talk. My senses have become heightened. I feel more animal than humanA few days after the accident, Bunny had come to our family home, opened a safe and taken the contents. Some of my mother’s jewellery was in it. My mother adored jewellery and my father loved buying it for her. You could hear her before she entered a room by the tinkling of her charm bracelet – gold, with 26 charms, each given to her by my father to remember a moment in their life. A gondola when they honeymooned in Venice; a rabbit on skis from their first skiing holiday; a wishbone for luck; a charm each for their four daughters; and Pegasus, representing freedom and the soul’s ability to rise above ordinary limits.My father had a substantial wine collection. My aunt told me she would look after it, so, along with two of my friends, we spent a day transporting case after case to her house. One evening I was there and she took two bottles out of the rack. When I said, “Auntie Bunny, those are Daddy’s,” she replied, “Your parents are dead” and walked out. I stood looking at the door wishing she had hit me with the bottles rather than said those words.My grandparents had a house in Praia da Luz in Portugal. My paternal grandmother was Australian and this area of Portugal reminded her of home. In the 60s, it was a quiet fishing village with very few tourists. Most of the buildings were simple whitewashed houses and locals travelled by donkeys and wooden carts pulled by mules. The gentle daily rhythm of life was set by the fishermen, who were the backbone of the community. Sardines, mackerel and octopus would be cooked for lunch on an open fire, and we regularly ate with them. Sardines were charged by the number of tails left on our plates. Emma and I would eat the whole fish, making marks in the sand to count how many we had eaten.My parents fell in love with the area and bought a house next to my grandparents, where we spent the summer holidays.Louise and I and two friends flew there a few weeks after the accident. It was a mistake. My mother had a large lockable cupboard in her bedroom containing all her personal belongings, along with sun creams, sun hats, Calamine lotion and a medicine chest. She had treatments for everything, brought out from England – there were few doctors locally and antibiotics were extremely hard to get hold of. When we arrived, the cupboard was empty.View image in fullscreenCollier (far left) with her father, sisters Emma (front) and Louise, her mother and paternal grandmother in Portugal in 1967.View image in fullscreenThe sisters that same summer …View image in fullscreen… and with their mother the following year (from left, Louise, Emma, Fiona). Photographs: courtesy of Fiona CollierAll my parents’ clothes were gone and an outside building that contained our fishing, waterskiing and boating equipment had been emptied. My father, Emma and I spent hours in here – it was like our cave. We would come back from fishing, rinse the salt water off our rods and lean them against the wall.I ran across to my grandparents’ old house, which Bunny now owned. They were no longer alive but a wonderful local couple, Maria and Jao, had looked after them and the house and garden. Maria would teach us Portuguese and cook local dishes for us. She opened the door crying and hugged me tight. I said, “Everything has gone, Maria.” Bunny had taken it all and told Maria that if she let me into the house, she would fire her.Four months later, I am on a one-year residential secretarial course in Cambridge. My family home has been sold. Bunny had said I must go back to school, but I couldn’t contemplate ever seeing it again; it held unbearable memories now. No one knew what to do with me, so secretarial college seemed the only option.The house I am staying in is large, Victorian, run by an elderly lady and her husband, who is a doctor. Twelve girls are staying here – all of them sharing bedrooms. As the 13th, I have an attic room on my own. It has no curtains and bare floorboards. I have no home comforts, but I don’t want any – I want to be lying alone, naked, in the Himalayas. This would be a comfort to me.I think people fear me. I stare at them intently and barely talk. My senses have become heightened and I feel more animal than human.I can read people just by their body language. I want to close my eyes and put my hands over my ears when someone talks to me – the only voices I want to hear are my parents’ and Emma’s.At weekends, I go to London to be with my friends. I feel more able to understand the world around me when I am with them, although I am unable to speak to them about what has happened or how I feel. I said to one recently, “I must have been so weird, and you were all so unbelievably kind to me.” She said with great tenderness, “Oh Fiona, you weren’t weird, you just never spoke.” If my parents’ or sister’s names are mentioned, I walk out of the room.We party and hang out. One of my closest friends is a punk rocker. I help her to dress up – egg white to make her hair stand on end; leopard-print bodysuit; dark lipstick; loads of makeup – and we walk down Kings Road. Tina demands attention and is very beautiful. I never dress up; I want no attention.The year at Cambridge went. The only connection I made was to my typewriter. I loved everything about the heavy lump of metal on my desk. The paddle slapped on to the paper when you pressed a key, making a loud “clack” noise. I didn’t have to speak – I could clack.After Cambridge, I moved to a two-bedroom house, with five girls, off the Kings Road. It was a fun time. There was always a party and inevitably there were drugs and alcohol. If I touched either, there would be a sudden, uncontrolled release of pain. I felt like a piece of blotting paper – one small drop seeped into every cell.I worked as a secretary and it suited me. I could hide behind my typewriter and was out of the door at 5.30pm. I started to have what were referred to as “fits” – “Fiona is having one of her fits.” There were warning signs – I could feel the hackles on my neck rise and my scalp become numb. Then I’d scream, smash things and run away. The trigger was often someone saying something like, “Where do your parents live?” or, “How many sisters do you have?” In these moments, I felt I could kill.View image in fullscreen‘The fear of losing someone is deep-rooted in every cell of my body.’Photograph: Mark Chilvers/The GuardianMy husband says when we first met it would happen often, and he would regularly be driving around London trying to find me. Once, he found me running barefoot down Earl’s Court Road. When he caught up, he said, “Fiona, your feet.” I had run over glass but felt nothing.My way of dealing with the fits was to chuck in my job, jump on a plane and disappear. The first time, I flew to Bangkok and met a friend, Cara, who I had lived with on the Kings Road, and was travelling around the far east. We travelled together for three months, going to Thailand, the Philippines, Nepal, Burma and India. I studied Buddhism, and met people who had found enlightenment while staying at ashrams, but I always left them feeling more isolated, heightened by others having discovered what they were looking for.I have never been able to talk about what happened, not even to my husband. He says that, after 35 years of marriage, it is only through my writing about it that he has truly been able to understand me.My daughter, Emma – whom I named after my sister – used to be a journalist. When she read that I had heard about the deaths on the radio, she pointed out that today this would never have been allowed to happen. There are strict regulations in place, preventing any media outlet reporting on someone’s death without the next of kin being informed. In 1978, these laws didn’t exist.Bunny died quite a few years ago, and I heard before she died, she had wanted to see me. I would have met with her, but it was too late. She was a tall, handsome woman, with high cheekbones and piercing blue-green eyes. My father’s relationship with her was complex. He was adored and dearly loved by his mother, and Bunny had a difficult relationship with her. I don’t feel she was shown a lot of love. Their father was a big presence in their life but not a “hands on” parent. My grandmother – her mother – also adored me, and we were very close. It must have been difficult for Bunny to see this.I always believed my funny, kind father was killed by a murderous teenage gang. Three decades on, I discovered the truthRead moreI also wonder if she lived a life that was expected of a woman in the 70s, where you largely had to prioritise marriage, motherhood and domestic work, and was never able to live the life she wanted. She was also suffering immense grief, losing the younger brother who had looked after her financially and emotionally. I think my father understood her and gave her a lot of love. I was a child who was feisty, outspoken, and who challenged her behaviour. Was taking everything of ours she could a way of trying to hold on to my father?She became Sophie’s guardian, and although Sophie had been sent to a residential school in Wales for children with special needs, it was a huge responsibility. But this raised more complicated behaviour – if Sophie misbehaved, Bunny often stopped me seeing her. On one occasion, a few months after the accident, Bunny went for me, and we ended up rolling on the floor having a physical fight, like two wild animals. I ran upstairs and locked myself in a room, calling the police, but when they arrived she had gone.Sophie still has severe special needs and lives in a residential care home. Louise and I are both in London and see each other regularly. There is no doubt the shared trauma has affected our relationship. We dealt with it in very different ways, and I was never able to talk about it. I wonder if we both know we only kept our heads above water for the first few days and weeks because of each other. All I wanted was to join my parents and Emma, but I couldn’t have contemplated putting Louise and Sophie through any more loss.People say time is a healer, and I am not sure that this is true. I believe love is a healer. I have desperately wanted to bring love back into my life and it has been an enormous challenge to both love and be loved again. The fear of losing someone is deep-rooted in every cell of my body. Over the years, I have questioned if I should live alone in some wild place away from civilisation and not expect to have any happiness in my life again.As I write this, my husband is sitting in the kitchen, I have two children, two grandchildren and a daughter-in-law. And I am studying for an MA in children’s literature and creative writing at Goldsmiths. When I leave college, I stand on the platform at New Cross station and look up at the Amersham Arms which towers over the station on the bridge above it. Huge red neon lights shine with two words: “Take Courage.”Explore more on these topicsFamilyBereavementMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’d spent the Covid years locked down in Victoria, Canada. I had quit my day job at the end of 2019 to write full-time and travel, only for the world to shut down.During those long, lonely years, I kept myself distracted by playing an online game. Nothing fancy, just a phone game about surviving a zombie apocalypse. It was a bit of fun and a way to connect with people from around the world. One of those people was a fellow named Craig.The moment I knew: I said ‘marry me or never see me again’ – and he went straight down on one kneeRead moreHis witty way with words first caught my attention. We started chatting and our interactions quickly became the highlight of my day. I thought we had chemistry, but we kept things light and friendly. After all, we were internet strangers living many time zones apart. There was no chance we’d ever cross paths.Then, I learned that Craig lived somewhere in Australia, and I realised there might be a chance for us to meet after all. I was already scheduled to attend a romance book signing in Melbourne, Australia, in April. It took me a while to screw up my courage to ask where he lived. The answer changed our lives. Craig lived in Melbourne, and my tentative query about possibly meeting for coffee turned into plans for a full day of exploring the city together.I was still jet-lagged when we met for the first time. We explored the city centre with a focus on coffee, chocolate and bookshops. We ended our day with a train ride out to a wonderful shop that sold replica swords, armour and other geeky items.We enjoyed an amazing day, but I still wasn’t sure if it was a date. After more than a decade of being single and two years of Covid isolation, my instincts were so rusty they squeaked.As far as I was concerned, Craig was a real-life romance hero. He was the whole package: tall, handsome and charming, with a great sense of humour and a geeky side that matched my own. Did he feel the same way? I hoped so.View image in fullscreenCraig’s photograph of the Melbourne Gasworks from the night of their first kiss.Photograph: Black Hat PhotographyWe ended our day back at my hotel. After a leisurely dinner, neither of us wanted to say goodbye. Craig is a photographer, and he offered to take some pictures of the Melbourne gas brigade from my hotel window. I’d seen the towers of flames the night before and wanted photos, but I hadn’t managed to take one that did the view justice.He took those pictures. Then he put down the camera and asked permission to kiss me. It was a scene straight out of a romance novel, only this time it was happening to me. I said yes. As we kissed, I knew Craig was someone I wanted to keep in my life.View image in fullscreenSusan and Craig at their wedding in 2025After that, we spent as much time together as we could. Craig even agreed to be my assistant during a book signing. He was sweet and supportive despite the chaos as nearly a thousand readers descended on the convention centre.The day before I had to leave, we talked about our future. It was a short conversation, because we both knew what we wanted. We were in love and determined not to let this chance at happiness slip through our fingers.A few months later, Craig came to see me in Canada. Our connection was stronger than ever, fed by daily video chats and “date nights” spent gaming together.I showed him my world, just as he’d shown me his. We went whale watching, took nature walks, and I introduced him to my parents and friends. By the time he returned to Australia, we were even more committed to each other.In 2024, I visited Australia again, and during the trip, I asked Craig to marry me. This time, it was his turn to say yes.Our happily ever after didn’t come quickly. It took thousands of hours of online conversations and video calls, personal challenges and the loneliness that comes with a long-distance relationship. But we found a way. In March 2025, I said “I do” to the love of my life.I’ve moved to Melbourne, one of the many new immigrants to arrive in this beautiful country. We’re building our life together one day at a time – with laughter, occasional moments of geekiness, and a heartfelt belief that our love story has only just begun.Susan Hayesis an author of more than 70 books.Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

I find that quite fascinating.”I Want Your Sex review – vampy Olivia Wilde almost saves Gregg Araki’s tame dom-sub rompRead moreThe frank, informal admission fit with Brat, a pop culture-shifting album that channeled, with stunning immediacy, the imperious ego and bristling insecurity of an artistkeenly aware of her own precarious level of fame. Her ambivalence was understandable – Brat rapidly turned Charli, who spent over a decade as a fixture ofpop’s so-called middle class, into a main pop girl, an artist played at midwest sorority weddings andused by a US presidential campaign. But her interest in “the tension of staying too long” also felt a little trite, the type of smart-sounding musing that dead-ends in self-awareness. Brat summer was heady, hedonistic, fun – a meme, an aesthetic, a vibe, a moment. That said moment passes? Well … yeah.I felt a similar vacantness while watching The Moment, the visually hypnotic yet curiously shallow meta-mockumentary of the Brat era, which spends 113 hyper-stylish minutes circling her ambivalence over winning the zeitgeist without moving beyond that initial assessment. Conceived by Charli and written by close collaborator Aidan Zamiri and Bertie Brandes, The Moment, which premiered at Sundance, assumes a high level of fan literacy – Zamiri, the zeitgeist savant behindTimothée Chalamet’s genius Marty Supreme marketing campaignamong other viral moments, ties the proceedings to the real Brat social media timeline with freak fluency – that has little patience for, and I suspect little reward for, those not in the know. But even for a longtime fan, The Moment feels uncharacteristically inert (though this being Charli and Zamiri, it looks very cool). Perhaps that’s because it attempts to satirize the music industry from the top, by proposing a somewhat listless counter-factual: what if, riding high on Brat summer, Charli succumbed to the pressure and compromised her artistic vision?Though billed as a mockumentary, The Moment, also directed by Zamiri, is less Spinal Tap and more Black Swan, a ragged, borderline horror film of cracking under the pressure of getting what you want. In this funhouse mirror version, the singer plays a more pitched, volatile and transparently insecure version of herself in preparation for the Brat tour. Her world is filled with cuttingly demeaning promo (“what’s in my bag?”) and a coterie of flat music-industry stock characters: the access-coveting assistants (Trew Mullen and Isaac Powell), the feckless middle manager (Jamie Demetriou), the money-chasing record label people (Rish Shah), the tyrannical record label boss (Rosanna Arquette). Ever hip to the locus of attention, Charli recruits internet It girls (Rachel Sennott, gamely playing herself), cult-beloved alt-comics (Kate Berlant, criminally underused) and the colossal mass culture baggage of a Kardashian (Kylie Jenner, whose cameo is indistinguishable from a KUWTK confessional) to a populate her mildly self-skewering celebrity milieu.The only person looking out for Charli’s artistic soul is her creative head Celeste (Hailey Benton Gates), who capably plays the straight man against sharkish, toothlessly vampiric label folks – and, especially, against Johannes Godwin (Alexander Skarsgård), the cartoonishly self-important director brought in by the label to get a lucrative Amazon concert film. Black Swan Charli knows, as we do, that his motives are suspect and his taste horrific. But the pressures of staying relevant – of keeping “brat summer forever” – are such that she must entertain his glittery, anti-club rat vision (that looks suspiciously like the Eras tour … ).I have no doubt that these characters have real-life corollaries, nor that the pressure to capitalize on one’s fame rocket must be immense. I admire the effort, against conventional logic, to make a period piece about a moment too long ago to feel fresh and not long enough to be nostalgic. The Moment is, in fact, filled with nobly against-the-grain elements: a warm, over-saturated palette that invites us into the frazzled psyche of a star; dynamic, verite-style cinematography by Sean Price Williams, which conveys the jittery reality of high-wire fame; a jagged, pulsating score by frequent Charli collaborator AG Cook that fits seamlessly into the chaos of a celebrity willing to play herself as a monster boss, and to toy with the expectations of a tour film.View image in fullscreen‘How do you maintain your humanity when everyone wants you? What is sacrificed when you get what you want?’Photograph: A24In other words, smart concepts, talented people, solid blueprint. But there is too little risk – in the defanged satire, in the muddled thematic sprawl, even in a late-stage satirical swing that, for this fan, jumped the shark – to rise above its sharp-eyed construction. As comedies go, The Moment evinces the difference between structurally funny, such as a self-aware joke about a credit card for Charli to market to her young queer fans (“Do you have to prove that you’re gay?” she asks flatly), and actually funny; it’s a problem when Skarsgård, a consummate on-screen weirdo, draws more laughs by simply appearing in a beanie than any of the written lines. Against him and more seasoned performers like Gates, Charli, stuttering and flustered, comes off as mechanical, a student still struggling to push outside her well-worn persona.She’s strongest – as is the film – in moments of quieter vulnerability, when Charli is stuck alone with her feelings, caught off guard by a facialist’s assessment of her ageing skin, spinning the collapse of her artistic integrity as liberation, of sorts, in a voice note. Sure. There’s a suggestion here of the real tension of staying too long: How do you maintain your humanity when everyone wants you? What is sacrificed when you get what you want? Who are you without it? There are answers, but The Moment seems satisfied just asking.The Moment is screening at theSundance film festivaland will be released in cinemas on 30 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewCharli xcxAlexander SkarsgårdKate BerlantSundance film festivalComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

A guy from the British Beekeeping Association, who worked at the local church, would come over and help me open up my hives and harvest the honey. It was crazy how much honey we got – up to 150 jars a season. It was the best honey I’ve ever tasted.View image in fullscreenMark Hoppus with Banksy’s ‘Crude Oil (Vettriano)’ at Sotheby’s in London in March 2025, where it was auctioned for £4.3m.Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for Sotheby’sDid you really have to sell your Banksy because you were worried someone might steal it?It was more that we worried it would get damaged. People would come over, lean in way too close with a glass of red wine and say: “Is that really a Banksy?” The more money it was worth, the more precious we got with it. Eventually, it was so much stress, we sold it and gave some of the money to charity. My charity is haematology oncology research. My wife volunteers at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. It was right after the fires in LA, so we wanted to donate to the Firefighters Association. I also wanted to take some of the money and invest in new up-and-coming artists.Are you surprised you’re not dead?I amverysurprised I’m not dead.When I was diagnosed, my doctor said the good news was there was only one treatment for the type of cancer, so I didn’t have to agonise over whether to choose radiation or surgery or try an experimental drug. The only treatment was R-CHOP chemotherapy, but it was still the worst chemotherapy you can undergo, and my doctor said: “You only have a 60% chance of living through this and never having to deal with it again.” Chemotherapy feels like you’re being crushed. They give you a massive dose of steroids – the same steroids they give me when I lose my voice on tour – but instead of one or two pills, I was on a packet a day, which would send me hyper-crazy. Then, when they give you the actual drugs, you can feel them burning the cancer cells out of your body, like you’re on fire from the inside.‘I thought I was going to die – and it was so freeing’: Blink-182’s Mark Hoppus on stardom, breakups and surviving cancerRead moreDo you believe in UFOs as much as yourBlink-182 bandmate Tom Delonge?Ever since I met Tom, when we’d be touring in a van and we were taking turns driving, Tom would sit up all night looking at the skies, just hoping to see a UFO.

That was the first time I felt like I found my people and my community. All the outsiders, all the losers and all the unpopular people were welcomed into the skateboarding community. At first, I got into alternative goth music. I was a big fan of the Cure and would dress up as Robert Smith and walk into school in all black, with my hair all up, black eyeliner and red lipstick, which wasn’t really the look for the middle of the desert.

A lot can go wrongRead more summer essentialsBianca NogradySat 24 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 19.21 ESTShareIt’s a bad time of year for wrists. Parents – and sometimes grandparents – full of enthusiasm and holiday cheer hop on their child’s new scooter or bike, keen to show said child how great the new toy is, and forget that gravity isn’t as kind to the body when we’re older. Falls happen, and wrists often take the brunt.“It’s got its own name: ‘fall on an outstretched hand’,” saysBrigette Evans, an occupational therapist at Bathurst Hand Therapy. As we fall, our instinct is to put our arms out in front of us to protect our body, face and head, and the wrist takes a lot of that force.Understand the complexity of wrists“The wrist is such a complex little area,” Evans says, as they have evolved to allow an extraordinary range of movement while also supporting a high level of fine motor control – the wrists mean we have the capacity to do both handstands and neurosurgery.‘Do not ignore your body’s signals’: how to really look after your neckRead more“It’s got eight little carpal bones – they’re the axis of the wrist – and then you’ve got your radius and your ulna, which are your two forearm bones, and then that joins in with your hand bones, your metacarpals,” Evans says. And all those smaller and larger bones are held together by ligaments, and interwoven throughout the whole complex are the tendons that connect the muscles of the hand and arm with the bones of the hand, wrist and arm. There is a lot that can go wrong.Repetitive movements are the enemyOne common wrist condition that therapists see a lot of is calledDe Quervain tenosynovitis, which is sometimes called “mother’s thumb”, says physiotherapistNicola Wheelerfrom Bondi Junction Hand Therapy. “It’s common in new parents, new grandparents, because of this position in lifting up under the arm, as well as feeding postures,” Wheeler says.That new repetitive movement or position-holding is inevitable with a new baby – although it’s also seen with lots of scrolling or computer use – and it can irritate and inflame the two tendons that connect the arm muscles to the bones of the thumb. “Once they’re inflamed and thick, as they’re gliding through a tunnel, they get caught, lots of friction, and then that can be a cycle of that friction causing more inflammation,” Wheeler says.The solution is to modify your movement to reduce the load on those tendons, using different lifting techniques – which Evans says are now taught by midwives and nurses to new parents and propping the baby up on pillows while feeding so the wrist doesn’t hold the entire weight at an unusual angle.Don’t lift from the wristBecause the wrist is a relatively delicate instrument, keeping it healthy is less about making it stronger and more about using it carefully, Wheeler says. “In a lot of situations, we’re trying to minimise wrist movement and actually train people to keep it very straight and stable, particularly when it’s with load,” she says.That means not lifting from the wrist, but rather keep the wrist stable and instead using the larger load-bearing joints and muscles like the arm and shoulder. Wheeler likens it to the advice about lifting safely to avoid back injury: “Instead of that quick grab, really you should be setting ourselves using our muscles, and then using all these arm muscles to do the lifting.”Limber upAnother common wrist complaint that most have heard of iscarpal tunnel syndrome, which presents as tingling, numbness or weakness in the thumb and first two fingers. It’s caused by the median nerve, which extends from the neck to the hand, getting compressed as it passes through a passage in the wrist called the carpal tunnel. That compression can happen if the wrist is bent forward for a long time, like if we sleep with our hand tucked around against ourselves.“If it’s been like that all night, then it’s common either to wake up through the night or in the morning with numbness and tingling,” Wheeler says. But it can also happen with poor position during computer use, or resting the wrist on a desk or hard surface for a long period of time.So it’s also important to keep the wrist limber by breaking up periods of computer work with little stretches and rotations, Evans says. “Just getting up and moving your wrists in all the different directions that they that comfortably go in, and not holding them in a prolonged position.” For a stiff wrist in the morning, a gentle heat pack can go a long way to easing things up.And stay off the kid’s scooter.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe way you moveHealth & wellbeingFitnessAustralian lifestylenewsShareReuse this content"

Those preventive measures taken in the intense early stages of his third-round tussle with Lorenzo Musetti proved to be sensible, for the pair would spend a brutal four hours, 25 minutes on court.Four hours of that took place inside an open John Cain Arena, a furnace in suffocating heat. “We knew today was going to be really, really hot,” Musetti said. “I think I managed well to finish the match without cramping.”Maddison Inglis has it easy as clique of champions struggle in Melbourne heatRead moreThose early stages of Musetti’s five-set win over Machac set the tone for an unusual day at the Australian Open asthe heat arrived in force, inserting itself into the outcome of matches and wreaking havoc on the schedule. A cursory glimpse around the grounds on Saturday underscored what was to come. Anticipation of the heat convinced the organisers to start play half an hour earlier than usual at 10.30am.The first sight was St John Ambulance workers standing around. Stations offering free SPF50+ sunscreen were dotted across the grounds. From the start of play, long lines of spectators waited by the many water dispensers to refill their bottles.TheAustralian Openwas well prepared for 39C, but the most pertinent question was which players would not be so ready. Jessica Pegula, who reported for the morning shift, beat the worst of the heat by reaching the fourth round with an easy 6-3, 6-2 win over Oksana Selekhmeteva.She stressed the importance of using ice towels and hydration. “The fact we haven’t been playing that much in the hot temperatures is what gets people. You have no tolerance to it and then it comes out of nowhere. We’re used to it happening here, but it’s hard to prepare for that.”View image in fullscreenKaren Khachanov wraps an ice towel around his neck during a break against Luciano Darderi.Photograph: Dar Yasin/APThat preparation begins overnight with increased hydration and electrolytes. Higher temperatures also mean faster playing conditions since the balls fly more quickly through warmer air. Players also have the option of making changes to their equipment.Madison Keys notes the importance of stringing rackets at a higher tension to counteract the ball flying. “I typically go up in my tension a little bit,” she said. “Not today. Only went up a pound, because I was playing earlier. Depending on what the weather changes would be like, there’s been times where I’ve gone up even three, four pounds.”Heat is a common subject in tennis, a sport that chases the sun around the world. Last month,after numerous heat-related retirementsat the Shanghai Masters, the ATP announced its own heat rules, ending years of debate over whether the tour should prioritise the welfare of its players or continue to enable antiquated attitudes. There are still some who view the sport as a gladiatorial pursuit where athletes should be able to handle all conditions, regardless of how dangerous they are.In the media centre, one of the screens showing the matches, statistics and practice court schedules changed to display the Australian Open Heat Stress Scale, the tournament’s extreme heat protocol. The chart measures heat stress on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 signifying “temperate playing conditions” and 5 leading to the immediate suspension of play on outdoor courts. By 2pm the temperature had reached 34C and the chart had risen to 4, which mandated extended breaks between sets.The scale shifted to 5 at the most significant moment of the day. Jannik Sinner, the defending champion, had been struggling with the conditions on Rod Laver Arena since the early stages of his match against Eliot Spizzirri and by the third set No 2 seed was in deep trouble.Sinner began to suffer from full body cramps, limping badly between points and unable to run properly. At one point, he hobbled to the side of the court and offered his blunt assessment of his chances to his team: “I don’t know what to do. I’m fucked.”At the exact moment Sinner lost his serve to trail Spizzirri 1-3 in the third set, the Australian Open Heat Stress Scale reached 5. The roof was immediately closed on Rod Laver Arena and Sinner recovered his strength to win.As Margaret Court Arena and John Cain Arena followed suit, play was suspended on the remaining courts. Spizzirri could not help but smile as he was informed of the move: “It was just funny that right when I broke and he was wobbling it happened to happen that way,” he said.Sinnerrecognised his good fortune: “Got lucky today,” he said. “At the point when they closed the roof, it takes a little bit time. Tried to loosen up a little bit. It helped.”View image in fullscreenCasper Ruud pours water over his head during his third round match against Marin Cilic.Photograph: Aaron Favila/APSinner’s lack of durability in the heat remains one of his few weaknesses. Others, however, almost enjoy the extreme conditions. Many of the 14 Americans in the third round are used to training in Florida’s heat and humidity. They respond to heat-related questions with a shrug.Even as Spizzirri competed in one of the biggest matches of his career, he viewed the heat as an opportunity: “When I saw how hot it was, I was not disappointed or not, like, ‘this is unlucky I have to play on this day.’ I tried to relish that and look at it more as an opportunity to showcase my physicality and see if I could outlast him,” he said.The absence of play left the grounds in an interesting state. Thousands of spectators congregated in the air-conditioned hallways inside Rod Laver Arena, while others chose to sit in the shaded areas of Kia Arena, which showed matches from the top courts on its big screen. One of the many weather-related conversations included the comment: “I just feel like I’m never going to be cold again.”The player balcony, which overlooks the grounds, is usually a popular space for players, coaches, agents and families to relax. For once, it was empty, with players escaping to the air-conditioned surrounds of the their lounge underneath the stadium.Around 7pm, 90 minutes later than initially anticipated, the heat stress reading fell to 4.7. Play swiftly restarted on the outside courts and normal service resumed. The three roofs meant there was minimal disruption to the singles.On Tuesday, when the temperature here is forecast to be 41C, similar scenes will unfold. Those in the other half of the draws will be charged with enduring the full force of the Melbourne summer.Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Australian OpenAustralia sportTennisanalysisShareReuse this content"

There are misty eyes over the loss of founder Robert Redford along with host state Utah and also for the many films that have premiered here over the years. Alongside more retrospective screenings than one usually expects, even the new films have a touch of old Sundance to them.Extra Geography review – a sweet and spiky coming-of-age debutRead moreOn opening day, Rachel Lambert’s small-town dramaCarouselconjured up memories of quiet character-driven indies of the late 90s and early 00s and then, on a Friday full of packed-out premieres, I Want Your Sex took us back to the era’s more in-your-face acts of provocation, made by renegade outsiders who would have otherwise struggled to find a place in the industry. It’s the new film from Gregg Araki, a film-maker who was at the forefront of this particular wave, one of Sundance’s most loved enfants terribles. He’s premiered most of his films here, from “heterosexual movie” The Doom Generation to magnum opus Mysterious Skin to all-time stoner comedy Smiley Face to 2014’s misbegotten drama White Bird in a Blizzard, his last film until now.Introducing his much-anticipated return to the audience, and briefly detailing the decade it’s taken to make it, Araki was as excitable as one would hope the director of a film called I Want Your Sex to be, a film dubbed a “return to form” by the pre-introduction introduction. It’s certainly a return to what many know him for – vibrant colours, unfettered sex, madcap plotting – but it’s also missing that same sense of infectiously boisterous energy. The parts are here but there’s nothing to truly animate them, just the vague hope that maybe nostalgia might be enough.For a while it almost is. Araki hasn’t taken us to this fun, kitschy territory since 2010’s scrappy college cult caper Kaboom, and as we watch Cooper Hoffman and a mincing Mason Gooding help create a vagina made of chewed up gum, it’s hard not to feel excited for what someone like Araki might have to say about this current moment. Before we realise that the answer is “not that much”, our hopes are lifted by the electric presence ofOlivia Wilde, an often misused or misunderstood actor whom Araki has compared to an “old-time star” like Ingrid Bergman or Greta Garbo. While it might be hard to imagine either woman lubing a dildo to place up her assistant’s ass, there is a magnetically old school femme fatale pull to how she plays provocative artist Erika Tracy, every eye immediately drawn to her whenever she enters a room.One of her many admirers is new assistant Elliot (Hoffman), a sexually inexperienced rube she can easily sniff out and one she quickly takes under her wing, a student to be taught. He becomes her sub, a toy to be blindfolded, pegged and spanked whenever she pleases, a thrilling new world for him, stuck with a bored, sexless girlfriend (Charli xcx, a little flat). Araki, who wisely gender-swapped the pair after #MeToo, uses their different ages and sexual histories to comment on an ongoing tussle based on widely believed stereotypes about horny millennials and prudish gen Z-ers, laid out quite obviously in an early discussion between the pair (Erika bemoans the “retro sex negativity” of Elliott’s generation). Erika is also exhausted by political correctness, rolling her eyes at the “woke police” and gets a kick out of degrading a younger man to remind him of his base impulses.But even though Araki delivers his didactic thesis upfront, he doesn’t really have much more to add or really expand upon. The sexual relationship between the pair is surprisingly tame even if they both bare almost everything, played-for-laughs scenes involving dildos, handcuffs and ball gags doing very little to raise an eyebrow (maybe Araki is once again poking fun at a straight idea of perversion). It goes from kinky to conventional too soon and while Wilde is more than game and acutely aware of exactly the right tone for an Araki romp (Gooding, playing gay and slutty ever so believably, is also on the same page), Hoffman is seriously miscast, acting as if he were in a different, far less heightened movie (it plays more like he’s auditioning for a Woody Allen comedy). The pair have no form of chemistry, sexual or comedic, and while we might see them in many, many semi-naked situations, it remains hard to actually believe that any sex is being had and that anyone is getting any enjoyment out of it.It’s a film that’s ultimately more suggestively cheeky than actually raunchy and while Araki choosing to position sex as harmless and silly at a time when it might be demonised by some is certainly admirable, shouldn’t we be having a little bit more fun with it? It’s a 90-minute romp that feels longer than that, with increasingly unexciting hijinks (a threesome that fizzles, a murder plot that flames out, more dildos) that are never as amusing or as propulsive as they should be. I Want Your Sex wants our shock, our arousal and our debate but it barely gets our attention.I Want Your Sex is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewGregg ArakiOlivia WildeComedy filmsSundance film festivalComedyFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Throughout the centuries, Aleppo prospered as a trade hub and manufacturing centre. It endured its share of invasions, plagues, civil strife and natural disasters, yet somehow managed to preserve a distinctive character evident.”After the Syrian civil war, nearly two-thirds of the city is in ruins. The destruction is so vast that it will take years just to clear the rubble, let alone start rebuilding. Can Aleppo return to the city it was before the war?Read more3.‘I’d come back to the UK – but I’m not playing a cop’: Oscar nominee Wunmi Mosaku on sensational vampire smash SinnersView image in fullscreenMosaku.Photograph: Gianna DorseyThe actor grew up on a Manchester council estate.

Now a city where most people squeeze on to buses and trains has a new symbol of the gulf between rich and poor: a high-speed, eight-lane motorway on its western coast, which critics say serves only the wealthy despite being built with taxpayers’ money. Amrit Dhillon examined a road that “represents a massive transfer of wealth to the rich and imposes costs on the rest”.Read more6.My analogue month: would ditching my smartphone make me healthier, happier – or more stressed?View image in fullscreenEmma Russell.Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian“Is it possible, asked Emma Russell, “to live lo-fi in a hi-tech world?” For a month, she tried: swapping her iPhone for a Nokia, picking up physical copies of books, newspapers and magazines; and using a London A-Z for directions.Read moreExplore more on these topicsLife and styleSix great readsnewsShareReuse this content"

Liverpool pulled level from 2-0 down late on courtesy of Dominik Szoboszlai’s sensational free-kick, but Bournemouth responded impressively and Adli struck a winner from a long throw with almost the last kick.The Liverpool head coach felt the referee, Michael Salisbury, should have played more second-half stoppage time taking in substitutions and video assistant referee checks but admitted he feared aBournemouthwinner. “I think it is safe to say they could have scored 3-2 a little bit earlier,” Slot said, alluding to chances for the Bournemouth pair Evanilson and Ryan Christie. “A few of our players ran out of energy and I cannot even criticise them for that because two days ago [three] we had to play an away game. We’re the only team that played in the Champions League that has two games in between.Adli scrambles last-gasp winner as Bournemouth take down LiverpoolRead more“This time after an away game [a3-0 win in Marseille], another away game against one of the most intense teams in the league and I mainly played the same players because of the players we have available. Conceding a goal is always frustrating, but especially if there is no time left to come back into the game.”At full time Slot told the officials he was unhappy that only four minutes of stoppage time were allocated. “For me, four minutes of added time was not enough but in the end that didn’t matter because they scored,” he said. “Although then we could’ve maybe had two or three [more] minutes but this game shouldn’t have had four minutes of extra time. There was a free-kick that took two or three minutes, there were VAR moments, there were substitutions. That’s what I said to them.”Slot refused to criticise his captain, Virgil van Dijk, for his defensive error in the buildup to Evanilson’s opener and would not be drawn when asked whether Andy Robertson would remain at the club. Tottenhamare pursuing a dealto sign the Scotland captain, who replaced Milos Kerkez at half-time. The left-back, a £40m buy from Bournemouth last summer, was at fault for the hosts’ second goal, scored while Liverpool had only 10 men on the pitch after Joe Gomez was forced off injured.Bournemouth’s head coach, Andoni Iraola, expressed his delight that his side were rewarded for shifting their mentality and gameplan. “Normally we go full gas from the beginning, we keep our energy until the end,” he said. “But now, probably because we don’t have the numbers and need to adapt a little bit, we are choosing our moments a little bit more and knowing we might need to save a little bit of energy.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolBournemouthArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

The draw leaves Tottenham with two wins in 14 and mired in mid-table.Romero’s late strike rescues point for troubled Tottenham at BurnleyRead more“You can’t say we didn’t do everything to win,” Frank said. “We just need to keep improving. The only way it can be is calm heads, carry on and keep doing what we think is the right thing.“We do more than enough to win the game, we just need to defend better in two situations. And, of course, score another goal that could make the difference at 1-0.”Poor defending assisted Burnley’s comeback. “We can never, ever, ever concede that goal, because it just changes the momentum going into half-time,” Frank said of Tuanzebe’s header.“In the second half we are coming out, we are not as dominant, but I still think we are OK on top. We got a big chance to Dominic Solanke, 2-1 up. And then we concede another goal that we can never, ever, ever concede.”The Tottenham supporters chanted regularly for Frank’s exit during the match. Talks were held last weekend over the head coach’s position, but no definitive action was taken.View image in fullscreenMicky van de Ven put Tottenham in front at Turf Moor but the visitors fell behind before Cristian Romero’s late leveller.Photograph: Peter Powell/Reuters“The message to the fans, as I said the whole time, is that we’re working very hard on making sure everything is going in the right direction and that we’ll keep doing that,” Frank said.“First and foremost, I want to thank them for travelling and supporting the team throughout the game. We could, should have been out of sight. But also they acknowledge the willpower and character of the team that keep running, keep fighting to the end. We just need to keep going.”A point away to Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday should guarantee a top-eight spot in the Champions League and progression to the round of 16, which would help Frank’s cause. The club are also in negotiations with Liverpool overthe signing of the defender Andy Robertson, who would become the second new arrival this month afterConor Gallagher.There were more points dropped late on by Burnley, which has become a regular occurrence this season. “It was only four or five weeks ago I was hugely critical of this team in terms of usat Brighton away, we’ve reacted in an incredible way,” Scott Parker said.“There’s no denying that we need to now turn draws into wins and today, for being so close, you’d hope that would have been the case. We just fell a little bit short.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankBurnleyScott ParkernewsShareReuse this content"

It handed Wolves a first defeat in six and was notable for the referee, Farai Hallam, on his top-flight debut, daring to stick with his decision not to award a penalty after being sent by his video assistant for a pitchside review.That was for a Yerson Mosquera handball and it infuriated Guardiola, though after City’s dire recent form a first three points since 27 December is what matters. The manager reiterated a long-held belief that City can receive unfair officiating and pointed to his 11 injured players as being needed to mitigate against this.Romero’s late strike rescues point for troubled Tottenham at BurnleyRead moreHe said: “I would love to have the players to fight against that – despite these decisions, in nine years it is six Premier Leagues that we have won. It is the first time when a referee goes to the TV and does not overrule the position of the arms.“I am pretty sure tomorrow Howard Webb [PGMO’s chief refereeing operator] is going to appear in the media and explain. The referee makes his debut now everyone will know him.”Guardiola offered the example of Diogo Dalot’s stamp on Jérémy Doku inlast Saturday’s 2-0 loss at Manchester Unitedas another poor decision. While the defender was booked at Old Trafford, Guardiola believed he should have been sent off and cited the leg injury the Belgian suffered. “That’s why Jérémy could not play in Norway against Bodø [where City lost 3-1],” he said.The disputed penalty shout came when Abdukodir Khusanov’s flighted pass was controlled by Omar Marmoush who, turning Mosquera, flicked the ball on to the defender’s left elbow. Marmoush’s subsequent shot hit José Sá’s left post and then VAR ordered Hallam to the screen. While Mosquera’s arm was away from his body he was running so the referee may have ruled this to be a natural position.This was Rob Edwards’s view. “His arm was in a natural position and it was really close,” said the Wolves head coach. “Fair play to Farai in his first game to make that call.”Of Guardiola’s changes, five from the Bodø/Glimt loss, Edwards said: “A few rumours came out he might be making a few and even when the teamsheet came out you don’t know where they are all going to play.”View image in fullscreenFarai Hallam makes an announcement of no penalty, much to the chagrin of Bernardo Silva.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAEdwards is definitely turning his team around, their second-half display sparked by his changes at the break, but the first-half goals from Marmoush and the excellent Antoine Semenyo sealed the win.Pre-kick-off the news was the dropping of Haaland, for a first time due to form, and Foden, the playmaker having started the past 19 league games. Haaland had been in the XI for all 22 league games, but had not scored from open play in his past seven outings. Marmoush and Bernardo Silva were Haaland and Foden’s replacements respectively, and Max Alleyne, Rico Lewis and Rayan Aït-Nouri were also demoted. In came Marc Guéhi at centre-back and Matheus Nunes at right-back, with Semenyo reinstated after not being eligible for the Champions League.City’s opener came when Nunes whipped the ball in from the right and Marmoush stabbed home for a first league goal since his last league start on 31 August.In their unbeaten sequence Wolves scored five goals in four league games, after nine in the preceding 19. The 18-year-old Mateus Mané was a key factor in the uplift and his curled shot was ttheir sole effort before the penalty claim on 33 minutes. After this came City’s second: Silva slipped through Semenyo who jinked inside Ladislav Krejci and finished for a third goal in four matches sincejoining from Bournemouth.Now came Edwards’s substitutions for the second period: Jørgen Strand Larsen entered for Jhon Arias and Rodrigo Gomes for Jackson Tchatchoua. This meant Larsen joined Hwang Hee-chan in attack, Gomes became the right wing-back and Mané was pushed back into midfield, where he troubled City.Two of Mané’s crosses – defended by Silva, then Nunes – turned City, the second forcing a corner. The youngster took this, João Gomes headed skywards and Gianluigi Donnarumma tipped over, the City goalkeeper’s first save.Wolves remain 14 points from safety, but Edwards’s mid-season appointment appears shrewd.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Eng win by five wktsRoot hits 75 but says pitch not ‘great wicket for ODI cricket’Taha Hashimat the R Premadasa StadiumSat 24 Jan 2026 11.25 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 16.50 ESTShareIt’s been a rough few years for England’s 50-over side but the glow of their World Cup victory has not completely disappeared.Joe Rootand Adil Rashid, both part of the 2019 class, were the headliners of the second one-day international against Sri Lanka, setting up a five-wicket victory to level the series.Rashid led the England attack on a serious turner, taking two for 34 as Harry Brook used 40.3 overs of spin, limiting Sri Lanka to a total of 219. It was still a proper challenge, particularly in a must-win game for the tourists, their winless run away from home in ODIs having stretched to 11 on Thursday.England beat Sri Lanka by five wickets in second men’s cricket ODI – live reactionRead moreRoot’s calming qualities were desperately required. He advanced to 75 before Asitha Fernando’s tailing yorker had him lbw, and it wasn’t the smoothest finish as Brook followed soon after. But Jos Buttler took the baton and was at the other end as Will Jacks ended the losing streak. Brendon McCullum, finally, has his first ODI victory abroad as England’s white-ball coach.“I don’t think that’s a great wicket for ODI cricket, if I’m being brutally honest,” Root said at the post-match presentation. “But we found a way today, adapted and learned from the mistakes we made in the first game with bat and ball.” Brook was less diplomatic. “The pitch is probably the worst pitch I’ve ever played on,” he said.Jacks returned in place of Zak Crawley – out with a knee injury – leading to an eye-catching promotion. Rehan Ahmed, at No 8 on Thursday, was carded at the top of the order for the first time in his international career. It was a funky call but not entirely unfamiliar to the 21-year-old, who has opened in the County Championship and batted at three in the Big Bash this month.The change meant Brook had an extra bowler in his side, and he wanted to play with all his toys after losing the toss. The arrival of Root’s off-breaks in the 30th over made him England’s eighth bowler of the innings, the sixth spinner, as England tied the hosts down on a surface that was ragging for the part-timers as well.Rashid made great use of it. He did not concede a single boundary across his 10 overs, masterfully floating the ball above the eyeline, inviting Pathum Nissanka and Charith Asalanka to provide catches in the deep. The 37-year-old also pulled off England’s finest moment in the field, a tumbling grab at deep fine leg to remove Janith Liyanage and hand Jamie Overton his second wicket.View image in fullscreenAdil Rashid celebrates the wicket of Sri Lanka’s captain, Charith Asalanka.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/APOverton and Sam Curran were tight with the new ball but Brook stuck to spin at the death, leading to the unlikely sight of Root bowling the final over. It lasted just three deliveries, Root inviting fatal slogs from Dunith Wellalage and Fernando to close an innings which never found any real thrust.Asalanka top-scored with a 64-ball 45, but the real blow was the dismissal of Kusal Mendis, who had battled for an unbeaten 93 earlier in the week. The No 3 cut hard while on 26 and set off before turning back as Jacks’ throw from point beat him to the striker’s end.Out came Ahmed alongside Ben Duckett, but the partnership was brief. Ahmed’s only boundary was courtesy of overthrows before he was met by Dhananjaya de Silva’s deception, the off-spinner getting the ball toswingin to the right-hander and knock back the stumps.The other opener began slowly, going scoreless off his first 10 deliveries, the drought packing in a successful review after he was given out lbw. But Duckett eventually settled as Root took command. England’s all-time leading run-scorer brought an assuredness to the crease that hadn’t been seen all game, whipping off his pads and scoring at a decent click.Duckett advanced to 39 before Jeffrey Vandersay ripped a leg-break hard to bowl him, but Root and Brook dug in for an 81-run stand. Brook was some way off his usual rate, his 42 taking 75 balls before he fell to Vandersay with a missed sweep. “You just couldn’t really time the ball,” said Brook. “It was just a matter of trying to get off strike and take it as deep as possible.”With 31 required off 44 balls and two new men in the middle, Sri Lanka still had a shout. Buttler narrowly escaped twice with a couple of aerial strokes against the dangerous Fernando, but his power game shone through. A decider awaits on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamSri Lanka cricket teamJoe RootCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Keep Michael Carrick on, and it’s just another Ole Gunnar Solskjær situation. But replace him and, for almost whoever they appoint – be it a Premier League veteran, foreign maestro, renowned past-his-best winner, Red Bull-adjacentgegenpresser, austere Dutchman or Portuguese ideologue – they have done it before and it hasn’t worked. It’s almost like the biggest problem at the club isn’t the manager.Carrick’s startwas undeniably impressive. There was pace and zip and creativity. The relief of players being released from the 3-4-2-1 was akin to one of those videos of cows being allowed back into the pasture after being kept in a barn over the winter. Who could possibly have predicted that Amad Diallo would excel as a right-sided forward, or that Bruno Fernandes might thrive as a No 10? United didn’t just beat Manchester City 2-0; they hammered them.‘I respect him an awful lot’: Carrick reveals Solskjær backing for Manchester United roleRead moreA crushing victory in the derby? A display full of attacking flair? Unpicking Pep Guardiola’s tactical schema? Give him the job now! Where do you want your statue, Michael? But Solskjær’s first game after replacing José Mourinho in December 2018, it may be remembered, wasa 5-1 demolition of Cardiff. He proceeded to win 13 of the following 16 games, the only defeat coming at home against Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League, a setback that was turned around in the second leg at the Parc des Princes, which turned out to be the high point of his reign.Out of both cup competitions and not in Europe, United have only 16 games left this season. Which is to say that by the time a final decision has to be made on his future, Carrick will be only at the point Solskjær was in Paris. Solskjær lost the two games that followed, to Arsenal in the league and Wolves in the FA Cup, and was then appointed permanent manager. In total, United won only two of their final 12 games that season; by the summer, it already seemed clear they had erred in their appointment.Of all the mistakes United made during Ed Woodward’s time as chief executive, even bringing a superannuated Cristiano Ronaldo back to the club, that was the least excusable. They had no need to make a decision that March. Solskjær had a contract until June; he, of all people, was never going to walk out on United. There was absolutely no reason not to wait until they had as much evidence as possible of his capabilities and suitability. But they acted to satisfy public clamour; doing something because Rio Ferdinand has said it would be a good idea is rarely indicative of sound governance.But just because Solskjær failed – and in the end, for all his shortcomings, what undid him wasthe imposition of Ronaldo– does that automatically rule Carrick out of contention? This is the problem with looking at precedent and drawing direct conclusions. A logic persists at United that because Sir Alex Ferguson eventually succeeded after years of frustration, every manager is due similar patience. But every case is different.What of Carrick? His past record is reasonable. Although he didn’t lead Middlesbrough to promotion in almost three seasons, he does have the second-best win percentage of any manager who has been at the club for six months or more. He was unbeaten in a previous three-game stint as caretaker. Does that necessarily mean he is ready to take the United job full-time? Of course not. But equally, it doesn’t mean he is not ready.View image in fullscreenManchester United should be fresher than most teams they face for the rest of the season.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APVictory over City has to be placed into context. This is an injury-ravaged City. They haven’t won in four in the Premier League. They werebeaten comfortably in the Champions League by Bodø/Glimtthree days later. But equally, United did play with the sort of verve and freedom that used to characterise their play. If that goes on, if Carrick’s United can produce that sort of performance against a range of opponents, and not just those vulnerable to balls played in behind them as they struggle to implement an unfamiliar offside trap, then why not him?The problem is that United should be fresher than every side they have left to play this season. Of the opponents in their remaining 16 games of the season, only West Ham and Bournemouth will not have played more games than United (and West Ham may have the upcoming FA Cup tie against Burton on their mind); United’s squad is deeper than either. If they look quicker and more dynamic than opponents over the next four months, that may be a result of Carrick’s tactical approach but, equally, theyshouldbe quicker and more dynamic.How, then, can United assess him? But how can they assess anybody? How can any upper Premier League club assess a manager? Thriving in its mid-reaches does not mean a manager can step up to the different challenge of a bigger club, as Thomas Frank’s struggles at Tottenham are demonstrating.But United have discovered that thriving in a mid-ranking league, such as the Netherlands or Portugal, is no guarantee of success either. The truth is that there’s no real preparation for a top Premier League job other than a top Premier League job. (United remain for now a top Premier League job but their status is waning:down to eighth in the Deloitte Money League, even before this Europe-less season. And, leaving financial issues aside, any aspiring manager has reason to be cautious of joining a club who have such a habit of chewing up talent.)So how do United make a decision? It can’t just be results. It can’t even just be performances. It has to be rooted in some complicated assessment of leadership and potential, of tactical acuity but also the capacity to inspire players and fans at a massive club. It’s not easy; by definition such judgments are nebulous, based in feel as much as fact. And the huge worry is that at no point in the past 13 years has anybody in the United hierarchy done anything to suggest that have the insight to recognise such a candidate.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedInside footballMichael CarrickcommentShareReuse this content"

The decision means Trump will not repeat his appearance at last year’s Super Bowl in New Orleans, where he became the first sitting US president to attend the NFL’s showcase event.Trump loomed over sport like never before in 2025. Next year he will take even moreRead moreThe president has made high-profile appearances at sporting eventsa regular feature of his second term, including last year’s Daytona 500, the recent college football national championship andSeptember’s Ryder Cup at Bethpage, New York. Many of those events were held near Florida or the US east coast, within short travel distance of the White House or Trump’s Mar-a-Lago compound.Trump also criticized the NFL’s entertainment lineup for the Super Bowl, which includes Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny as the half-time headliner and punk rock bandGreen Dayas a pregame act.“I’m anti-them,” Trump said. “I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible.”In interviews, Trump had previously called the selection ofBad Bunny“absolutely ridiculous” and said he was unfamiliar with the artist. Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, has been a vocal critic of Trump and last year performed a month-long concert residency in Puerto Rico rather than touring the mainland United States.NFL commissionerRoger Goodellsaid in October the league would not reconsider its decision. Speaking after the league’s owners meetings, Goodell said Bad Bunny was chosen because of his global popularity and dismissed the backlash as typical for Super Bowl entertainment. “We’re confident it’s going to be a great show,” Goodell said.Trump said the presence of Bad Bunny and Green Day had nothing to do with his decision not to attend the game. Green Day has a long history of politically charged lyrics, and lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong has publicly criticized Trump and voiced support for protests against the administration’s immigration policies.The Super Bowl is the most-watched annual television event in the United States. Last year’s game averaged nearly 130m US viewers, according to NFL figures, with an additional 62.5m watching internationally. The teams competing will be determined afterSunday’s conference championship gamesbetween the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos, followed by the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks.Explore more on these topicsSuper Bowl LXDonald TrumpBad BunnyGreen DayRoger GoodellShareReuse this content"

Add in more heavy downpours, a tricky wind and a horribly slippery ball and there was never any chance of a free-flowing, fast-paced spectacle between two of the league’s more fluent attacking sides. This was a sodden slog, pure and simple, with only a rainbow or two to add a splash of colour.Not that the Bears will care much about the trench warfare nature of a victory that consolidates them in third position and above their opponents in the playoff race going into the Prem’s two-month hiatus. On an afternoon demanding character, perseverance and effort the visitors displayed all three, a first-half try from the appropriately named Noah Heward ultimately edging an old-school wrestling match.Bullish Borthwick tells England to target Six Nations triumph in ParisRead moreExeter’s tactical kicking was frequently not good enough and they completely failed to get their potential match-winner Manny Feyi-Waboso into the game. Another of their England call-ups, Greg Fisilau, worked tirelessly without too much reward in an increasingly tense, error-strewn contest. Bristol’s defence, though, was excellent with their director of rugby, Pat Lam, highlighting a tackle count of 155 with just nine missed.As was the caseat home to Bordeaux last Sunday, Bristol would have ideally preferred a dry ball and a hard track. These kind of conditions seriously dilute their slick handling game and in the past they have not always found it easy to switch to more pragmatic mode. On this occasion, however, they dug in stoutly and were significantly rewarded. They have won eight of their past nine games in all competitions and Lam believes there is more to come. “Winning today was another final because they hadn’t previously lost here this season,” he said. “I’m very proud of that effort.”The local faithful will have to wait a long time for their team to make amends. The Prem is about to vanish off the radar during the Six Nations and the Chiefs’ next league game is against Sale on 21 March. The desire not to clash with the international period is all very well, but it really does kill the flow of the league season stone dead.View image in fullscreenDriving rain prevented both sides from playing the attacking rugby that has brought them success in the first half of the season.Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty ImagesAt least there is a chance it could be drier by then. At times in the first-half the rain hammered down so hard it was all but impossible for either side to hang on to the ball for more than a couple of phases. The loss of their Wallaby flanker Tom Hooper, who limped off with a knee injury after eight minutes, also disrupted Exeter’s plans to thunder into the Bears around the fringes.Having opted to play with the elements at their backs in the opening 40 minutes, the onus was on Bristol to build up as big a lead as they could. However, they were kept scoreless until the 36th minute when a defensive error gave the visitors a rare attacking field position and Louis Rees-Zammit’s long pass gave Heward the chance to leave his ark and slide over on the right.Tom Jordan missed a penalty attempt from slap in front of the posts and the only other points of the half came from Henry Slade, who steered a left-foot penalty through the uprights like a scratch golfer drilling a three-iron into the teeth of the elements.With the rain temporarily easing, the conditions were not quite as bad after the break. Rees-Zammit dropped a high ball that threatened to be costly but a prolonged siege close to the Bears’ line produced no home reward.Quick GuidePrem roundup: Caluori inspires Saracens' 73-14 rout of NewcastleShowSaracensended a turbulent week by overwhelmingNewcastle73-14 with Noah Caluori taking star billing at Stone X Stadium.The day after Saracens announced their director of rugby, Mark McCall, would be stepping down after 15 seasons in charge, they amassed 10 tries against the  Prem's bottom-placed side.It was the response needed after Sunday's crushing 28-3 defeat by Glasgow, the most recent setback in a disappointing season with consistency proving elusive in the league and Europe.Jack van Poortvliet  inspiredLeicesterto a 36-7 win over a sufferingHarlequinsside. The scrum-half was on his electrifying, dynamic best form, constantly driving his side forward and involved in most of their decisive attacks in a one-sided affair at Twickenham Stoop.Northamptonclaimed a thrilling 43-29 bonus-point win which lifted them to the Prem summit and put a major dent inSale's play-off hopes.With a host of England stars on display for both sides, the fare served up was of the highest quality but it was Saints who deservedly took the spoils to underline their title credentials.Phil Dowson's men outscored their hosts by seven tries to four, touching down through Tommy Freeman, Rory Hutchinson, Robbie Smith, Edoardo Todaro, Josh Kemeny, Alex Coles and Henry Pollock.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There was soon to be another reprieve, Slade narrowly missing a 50-metre effort with his kicking range now significantly assisted. Exeter were growing steadily more frustrated with Ellis Genge earning one particularly morale-boosting scrum penalty to ease the pressure once more. With stress levels rising, a 79th-minute penalty from James Williams made sure of a hard-earned win that had previously looked unlikely.Rob Baxter, Exeter’s director of rugby, still believes his side will be in decent shape when the Prem restarts. “Those were really tough conditions … a West Country game of rugby. Bristol have shaded the areas that ended up being really important.“Our mistakes hurt us more than their mistakes hurt them. If Sladey’s kick goes over and we’re 6-5 up, we could be sitting here going ‘What a result.’ Ultimately, it’s just flipped the other way.”Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyExeterBristolRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The most exciting prospect in the sport was pulled up with a suspected pelvic injury in the International Hurdle.Sir Gino went into Saturday’s Grade Two contest as the clear favourite for the Champion Hurdle in March, having gone unbeaten in seven starts includinga brilliant novice chase win at Kemptonin December 2024. He was held up last of the four runners as Nemean Lion cut out the running and pulled up by Nico de Boinville shortly after jumping the third-last flight.The British are coming! Will the tide turn at the 2026 Cheltenham festival?Read more“They were able to put him into the ambulance,” Henderson said. “It’s his right-hind, and it appears to be high up, so there’s no lower limb fracture. It would appear to be a pelvic injury.“He has loaded and I’d rather they take him to Three Counties veterinary hospital [in Tewkesbury] without unloading here. Then they can assess and scan and just see where we are.“Pelvic injuries can be little or big, so we’ve just got to keep everything crossed. We won’t know any more tonight. They need a chance to assess him so it will be late on, I expect.”In a statement on X, Henderson later added: “Sir Gino was transferred fromCheltenhamto the Three Counties Veterinary Clinic and following scans and x-rays he does have a fractured pelvis but having spoken to the great team that are caring for him they are hopeful that although this is obviously significant they have reported that he is comfortable and stable.“This is great news to us all. The prognosis is guarded and further examinations over the next few days while he is there will be able to determine the extent of the injury and any prognosis for the future. Thank you to everyone for their messages and concerns which are much appreciated and we will keep everyone up-to-date with any further news but the fact that he’s comfortable tonight is the most important thing. Thank you.”The New Lion, the second-favourite for Saturday’s race and the Champion Hurdle beforehand, stayed on well up the hill to beat Nemean Lion by a length and a half, but he returned to a subdued winner’s enclosure as fans waited for news about Sir Gino.“I’m a big fan of this sport,” said Dan Skelton, The New Lion’s trainer. “ Sir Gino could be the best horse in training and we just didn’t need that. The team at Seven Barrows have been through hell and back to get him back on track and hopefully he is OK.”View image in fullscreenNicky Henderson, Sir Gino’s trainer, said: ‘We’ve just got to keep everything crossed.’Photograph: Steven Paston/PAThe New Lion was cut to around 5-2 for the Champion Hurdle after his win and Skelton said: “We needed to get a clear round after [falling in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at] Newcastle and Harry [Skelton, The New Lion’s jockey] did exactly what I wanted him to do and held him into the bottom of all the jumps.“The unanswered question with this horse is the speed angle and he showed a lot of speed at Newcastle despite ending up on the floor. He showed a lot of speed there as well from turning in to the last, and then from the last to the line.”Skelton, the clear leader in the race for the 2025-26 National Hunt trainers’ championship, had seen his main Gold Cup prospect, Grey Dawning, finish third of the four runners behind Spillane’s Tower in the Grade Two Cotswold Chase.Jack Kennedy was aboard Spillane’s Tower for the first time since Jimmy Mangan’s gelding split Fact To File and Galopin Des Champs in a memorable running of the John Durkan Memorial Chase in 2024. He oozed confidence throughout on the eight-year-old before quickening past L’Homme Presse on the run up the hill.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowSedgefield1.40 Dixie Cowboy 2.10 Rosie Baloo 2.40 Kazar Forez 3.10 Indian River (nap) 3.40 Tom Creen 4.10 Kaviar Wood (nb)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.This was a significant and impressive return to form for Spillane’s Tower after two lacklustre runs over hurdles this season. He was cut from 50-1 to 10-1 for the Cheltenham Gold Cup by Paddy Power, in a market still looking for a clear favourite.“It’s my first [winner in Britain] sinceMonty’s Pass [in the 2003 Grand National],” Mangan said. “I would have gone back to Ireland a disappointed man if he had put up a poor show today. I suppose you do have to start dreaming of the Gold Cup and he’s in that grade now.”The Trials Day card concluded in near-darkness after the final race was delayed for around 30 minutes following the discovery of a hole in the turf, prompting an inspection and a reconfiguration of the course.Nicky Henderson withdrew the likely favourite, Act Of Innocence, and the eventual result – a narrow win for Joe Tizzard’s Kripticjim over Taurus Bay – was announced only after prolonged examination of a photo-finish image taken in the very last of the light and then further reference to video footage.“Basically from what I can work out, the photo you can’t see because it’s too dark,” Ben Pauling, the trainer of Taurus Bay, said, “so they have to use video footage and in my eyes that is conclusive [that] Joe’s horse wins by a head.”Harry Redknapp, the owner of Taurus Bay, was similarly philosophical. “It was strange wasn’t it, it’s been a strange old day,” Redknapp said. “I thought he got beat there at the finish, but I won a King George by a nose [with The Jukebox Man in December] and I can’t have it all my way I suppose.”Jon Pullin, Cheltenham’s clerk of the course, later told Racing TV that the issue had been “a single hole” in the course. “It was a single hole, there weren’t any other holes,” Pullin said. “It was about a foot deep, there’s a gap underneath it, we moved off the area, checked the area we were due to race on and all participants were happy to carry on.“It could be [a drainage hole], it’s too early to say at this stage. We need to do further work to understand exactly what has caused it.“We need time to understand what has caused this incident and that is what we will start with straight away.”Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsCheltenham festivalCheltenhamNicky HendersonnewsShareReuse this content"

I was lucky there, and I’m sorry for causing any distress to the ball kid or anybody.”Djokovic opened theevening session on a steamy daywhen play continued under the main show court roofs and eased to a 5-3 lead before firing a sublime backhand crosscourt winner and celebrating with his arms out to mimic a plane. He endured minor turbulence after that point, but had no trouble taking full flight again as he broke in the opening game of the second set when a deflated Van de Zandschulp fired his backhand long.Australian Open 2026: Djokovic loses cool in hard-fought win, Osaka withdraws – liveRead moreUp two sets, Djokovic had treatment for a blister on his foot after a tumble and rallied from a break down before holding his nerve in the tie-break to set up a match with the 16th seed, Jakub Mensik, or Ethan Quinn.

You have to build your character so you understand what kind of people you want around.

If you won’t listen to me, then listen to Zohran Mamdani – and get your straddle onSat 24 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 12.23 ESTShareThe first time I heard a bidet mentioned in the US – or at least what it’s used for – was at the start of an off-Broadway play I saw in 2015 called Threesome. An Egyptian-American couple are in bed waiting for a white man they’ve invited to join them for the tryst of the title. He bounds on to the stage after using the bathroom, and the couple yell at him, “Go back and wash your ass!”Like that couple, and Threesome’s playwright,Yussef El Guindi, I’m Egyptian. In Egypt, bathrooms in every home, as well as those in public buildings, are fitted with some kind of contraption for washing after using the toilet: a bidet, a standalone low oval basin next to the toilet that one straddles – or, more popularly, a shattaf, a fixture in the toilet itself through which water streams out. Sometimes, the shattaf is a small showerhead attached to the wall next to the toilet. I’ve recently learned that its name in English is a bum gun. It’s my favourite kind of shattaf, because you can control the water pressure.But in Egypt, bidet or shattaf, everyone washes their ass.And now, washing after you use the toilet might finally take off in the US thanks to the New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, and his wife, Rama Duwaji, who recently moved into their official residence, Gracie Mansion, where theyplan to install bidets. So you see, it’s not just Egypt where we wash after using the toilet. Zohran is of Indian descent.The word “bidet” comes from aFrench term for a small horse, hence the straddling. In Arabic, “shattaf” comes from the word to clean. Variations of bothcan be foundin many parts of Europe, the Middle East, east Asia and some South American countries. I am currently visiting my sister and her family in California, where every toilet in the house has been installed with a shattaf – bought from online stores. “Zohran and Rama are going to make bidets cool! Finally!” I have told everyone I know.The couple straddle many firsts between them, besides just bidets. Mamdani, 34, is New York City’syoungest mayor since 1892, its first Muslim mayor and its first south Asian mayor, as well as its first born on the African continent. Duwaji, a 28-year-old Syrian-American artist, is New York City’s youngest first lady, and both its first gen Z and first Muslim first lady. Howhe eats, whatshe wearsand whatthey say– or don’t – is parsed, scrutinised andoften idolisedby supporters. And demonised by opponents – such as the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who hascalled Mamdani a communistas if it were an insult. I can imagine a typically rabid take from Leavitt accusing Mamdani of imposing “Islamist” culture on US bathroom habits, or vice-president JD Vance whining that only “soy boys” wash after using the toilet. I won’t care – I love that they’re making clean asses cool.I was seven when my family moved to London from Cairo in 1975. Perhaps the biggest culture shock for us was that toilets had neither a bidet nor a shattaf. We were horrified that anyone would use the toilet and not wash afterwards. At home, we learned to use a watering can that we kept by the side of the toilet. Wettened toilet paper became a poor substitute for the shattaf for my brother and me at school, and at work for my parents. If this TMI is too uncomfortable, good. Not being able to wash after using the toilet was a greater discomfort, believe me. When we moved from the UK to Saudi Arabia in 1982, it came with another set of culture shocks – but at least all the bathrooms had either a bidet or shattaf.There was a moment during thetoilet paper shortageof the Covid-19 lockdown when I thought, “This is it! People will finally understand how absolutely necessary a bidet is.” Even thoughsales did indeed increase, the US remains stubbornly shattaf-free.So here I am. Not inviting you to a threesome, but I am demanding, pleading, urging you: wash your ass! Install that bidet, bum gun or shattaf. You’ll thank me later.Then perhaps I’ll consider a tryst.Mona Eltahawy writes theFEMINIST GIANTnewsletter.

But this useless cruelty is shamelessSat 24 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 09.02 ESTShareLiam Ramos is five. In photographs of his arrest on Tuesday, released by the school district where he is enrolled as a preschooler, he iswearing a large blue hatwith a bunny face and ears. According to the superintendent, Liam had justarrived home from schoolwith his father when ICE agents apprehended the two and arrested them. Allegedly, one of Liam’s relatives, who was outside at the time, begged for the little boy to be allowed to stay there in their care; instead, both father and son were captured by the federal agents and quickly transported to a detention camp in Dilley, Texas. Liam’s father hasno apparent criminal record; he has a pending asylum case. Does it need to be said that the child does not have a criminal record, either? In one picture, a white man’s hand clutches, claw-like, on to the back of Liam’s Spider-Man backpack. In another, a masked man stands behind Liam, stooping slightly to reach the small child, as the boy stands at the front door of his home. According toschool officials,the agent instructed Liam to knock on the door and ask to be let into the house “in order to see if anyone else was home – essentially using a five-year-old as bait”.Liam is the fourth child from his Minneapolis-area school district to be seized by ICE agents since the surge of federal immigration forces in the city. According to school officials, two 17-year olds were also taken – one snatched alone from their car, another captured at home with her mother. Another child,a 10-year-old girlin the fourth grade, was allegedly also taken by the federal forces – while on her way to school with her mother.A knock at the door: fear of ICE is transforming daily life in America | Abdul Wahid GulraniRead moreLiam was bundled up for school against the frigidMinnesotawinter. Someone – was it his father, who was captured along with him, or his mother, who must now be wondering when she will see her child again – pulled him into his plaid jacket, and packed a lunch into the Spider-Man backpack that is nearly as big as he is. In a school picture released by his school district, Liam has the fat cheeks of a baby, and a smile that reveals a row of square milk teeth. It is unclear whether, at the detention camp in Texas he was quickly spirited away to, he has been allowed to stay with his father, or whether the boy is imprisoned alone.But it is likely that he is not being treated well there. A report on detention camps holding children – including the one in Dilley, Texas – from the non-profit newsroomthe Marshall Project, reveals claims of dirty conditions, overcrowding and inadequate food. Detained families said “the food was contaminated with mold and worms”. Children suffered “so much psychological stress that parents said they were hitting their own faces or wetting themselves despite being potty-trained”. It is due to the sadism and capriciousness of ICE that Liam, a child, must now face conditions like these, instead of returning home after school to the family that loves him. “He is so kind and loving,” Liam’s preschool teacher said of the boyin a statement. “His classmates miss him.” Whatever Liam is experiencing now, in an ICE detention camp, it is likely that he is very scared.There is a certain cynical worldliness that you have to develop to write about theTrump administration. Over the past decade, those of us who cover or monitor Trump and his movement have been disabused – repeatedly, if need be – of the notion that there is a limit to their cruelty, a point at which their appetite for sadism or displays of domination will be satiated. Weary explanations of the movement’s conduct have acquired the wan familiarity of cliché: the cruelty is the point. Shock, surprise – these are not things we feel anymore.Still, I confess that I am shocked now. Liam’s plain blamelessness, his innocence, the useless cruelty of his capture, the bald, shameless cynicism of his use as “bait” to capture the adults who love him – these evidence an evil I was naive enough not to know about. I am not so naive anymore.It need not detract from the specificity of Liam and his suffering to say that his arrest and the photos of it that were released by the school that wants him back, are a potent symbol of what Trump’s ICE raids are doing, both toMinneapolisand to the country as a whole. The images of the shocked, small Liam – bundled up by loving parents against the cold – flanked by armed, masked men give the lie to the administration’s claim, long transparent and cynical, that the raids are targeting criminals. But they also make plain the sheer sadism of ICE and their agenda, the smallness, cowardice and moral degeneracy of people who would arm themselves to the teeth and cover their faces in order to attack a child not yet big enough to tie his own shoes. ICE is the worst of America, indeed perhaps the worst of humanity – a window into the corruption that is possible in the human soul. They are animals with the gall to call themselves men.But what the images of Liam also do is show the reality of the immigrants that ICE is spiriting off to faraway prisons, where the detained have few rights. In the pleading tone of the officials at Liam’s school – who had to tell an ICE vehicle to leave them alone while they were giving their press conference about his arrest – I can hear the reality that so many native-born Americans are now confronting: that the immigrants that ICE is stealing belong to us. Liam belongs to us the way that every child belongs to us – the way that their innocence and vulnerability make them our responsibility. But the adult immigrants who are being stolen belong to us, too – they belong to us in the sense that proximity, and familiarity, and regular interaction bring us all into a community of principle and mutual care, make us all our brother’s keeper, and calls on us to love our neighbors.Liam’s loved ones miss him as their friend, their son, and their student; we are enraged and scared for him as a child and as a fellow human being. It is the guiding philosophy of the white supremacists shaping immigration policy in the Trump administration that mankind is not one community, that we must not care for all of our fellows equally. The wrongness and evil of this idea is evident in Liam’s face.On Friday, just days after Liam’s capture, thousands of his neighbors in Minneapolis took to the streets to protest ICE’s presence in their city. In them we can see a noble, even heroic counterexample, the other side of America: they hate ICE in proportion to how much they love their fellow man.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionMinnesotaMinneapolisTrump administrationChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

As European leaders huddled together over dinner for apost-crisis debriefin Brussels on 22 January, they congratulated themselves on their unity and appreciated the intervention of Rutte, or “Daddy diplomacy”. If these really were the conclusions of the latest debacle in transatlantic relations, they are missing important parts of the story.Rutte is well versed in dealing with Trump. It is likely that their conversation pushed the right buttons, offering him an offramp for his “psychologically important” need for Greenland. Earlier diplomatic talks between American, Danish and Greenlandic representatives addressing the reasons behind the US wish to annex Greenland – national security, the mineral resources under its land mass and its quick access to space – had not made the breakthrough. Further Nato and European assurances on these questions seem to be part of the “framework” that Rutte and Trump discussed to end the crisis, such as banning China from mining exploration and offering a base for the USGolden Domeproject.But what really changed the calculus was dangling the possibility of retaliatory measures to thetune of $93bn,making the markets jittery and Trump fold. Europe, too, can use economic leverage to its advantage.Paradoxically, Europeans were far from united in resorting to retaliatory measures. Had Trump not U-turned on his tariff threats, it is far from certain that the EU would have found the qualified majority needed to activate its new and never used tool called theanti-coercion instrument(ACI), whereby the European Commission can establish whether a foreign power is using economic coercion to undermine the EU and, if it is, carry out proportionate deterrence and retaliatory measures. Measures can range from tariffs and blocking foreign access to public procurement, all the way to sanctions, which otherwise require unanimity. It was ultimately the reaction of the markets, which responded to the EU’s trade bazooka rather than its diplomatic manoeuvring, that was decisive in Trump’s climbdown.The Greenland debacle showed thatEuropecan flip the table on its dependence on the US. This can be done through its economic leverage and smart diplomacy in Washington, by reaching out to institutional counterparts such as members of Congress and Republican representatives who might have some influence and can play a role in restraining the US executive. Europe can also use security cooperation in a productive way to counter concocted justifications for US action, and sharpen its economic toolbox for political ends. But it equally exposed, yet again, two glaring but familiar struggles.The first is how to equip the EU with the power to use economic leverage in a political way – just as the US and China are able to weaponise their economic power to coerce other countries. As a community of law, the EU obviously differs from authoritarian states or executives that flout their domestic law to overreach abroad. But appropriateeconomic statecraftand strategy could still make Europe as a whole punch to its weight.At Davos, European leaders made the connection between economic strength and global heft. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, reminded her audience of the opportunities that the collapse of theBretton Woods systemgave to Europe to grow. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, talked about Europe’s need to strengthen its economy. But they have consistently failed to tie these grand visions to practical steps, as the underwhelming implementation of theDraghiandLettareports show.Trump’s Greenland U-turn was spectacular. The lesson for Europe: strongmen understand only strength | Nathalie TocciRead moreThe reluctance to activate the ACI was less about making economic and political tools work in tandem and more about unwillingness to use EU scale at the expense of its much smaller national wriggle room. Political leaders are keener to keep the power to block bank mergers and make phone calls to Trump than to work towards a Europe that has an economic and political role to play in tomorrow’s world, despite the growing public support for the EU.The second and related issue is that the divisions within Europe about how to handle the US go beyond tactical questions of using the EU’s carrots and sticks. A cognitive dependence on the US is the result of generations of diplomats steeped in the transatlantic mindset. When Europeans have delivered strategy, such as in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it was in lockstep with Washington. In parts of eastern Europe, the US is core to the post-Soviet identity. Keeping the US involved in Europe in the face of the Russian threat is seen as a priority. Add to the mix the pro-Trumpians, and the cacophony is loud. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, left the informal summit without commenting. It is unclear how long she can keep up her double gamebetween Brussels and Washington. Viktor Orbán has long stopped working with his fellow EU members and now has agreed to join the autocratic crowd on Trump’s “board of peace”.Europe’s cacophony is seen as a sign of weakness at home and abroad, and some of these differences may never be bridged. European leaders have preferred flattery and appeasement to tough talk, losing their credibility with the US but not with the markets, which took the possibility of EU retaliation seriously. The Greenland lesson suggests there are ways to turn the cacophony into “strategic ambiguity”, by keeping antagonistic powers uncertain about the full scale of the EU’s response, and through a purposeful use of Brussels’s sophisticated and multi-use toolbox.Rosa Balfour is director of Carnegie EuropeExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionGreenlandDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Just don’t expect it to save democracyAlexander HurstIn the US, comedy has long filled the space vacated by partisan news media. Now France is following its leadSat 24 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 10.45 ESTShareSometimes the freedom and openness of comedy means it is better able to respond to world events than news media. Take South Park’s raucous, unhinged and visually disturbing depictions of Donald Trump – most recently, cheating on Satan (who iscarrying his spawn) with JD Vance in the White House. Fair enough: Trey Parker and Matt Stone very much own this terrain.But there’s no reason why satirical TV programmes such as The Daily Show should have to take onthe role of news provider, investigative journalist and critic. And yet, over the past three decades, the failings of the US corporate media to adequately cover the country’s dilapidated politics has pushed people such as Jon Stewart into filling the void.The problem was identified as long ago as 2000 by the US economist Paul Krugman. Hecastigatedthe press for being “fanatically determined to seem even-handed”, to the point they were unwilling to call out outrageous untruths. “If a presidential candidate were to declare that the Earth is flat,” Krugman wrote, “you would be sure to see a news analysis under the headline Shape of the Planet: Both Sides Have a Point.”It was this context that provided American satire’s cathartic triumph in the first years of the 21st century. The Daily Show began conducting harder-hitting interviews than most primetime TV shows. Stephen Colbert rose to prominence by playing a fake conservative talkshow host, in an open parody of Bill O’Reilly’s mid-2000s show on Fox. And then John Oliver pioneered “investigative comedy”, frequently doing a better job of breaking scandalous stories than the news programmes he was satirising.As two researchers from the universities of Innsbruck and Groningenargue in a paperpublished last summer, “affective shifts” among the public enable late-night comedians to build trust with their audience, “which ultimately allows political comedy to act as a form of opinionated journalism”.A new generation of stand-ups seem to understand this power instinctively. “Comedians don’t have to play by the same rules, so they can point out the glaringly obvious – so obvious it feels subjective,” Parisian journalist and standup comedian Charles Pellegrin told me. Meanwhile, Safia Benyahia, who runs a Paris-based comedy production company, said that standup has grown in popularity “because everything is more political and divisive. People are walking on eggshells and they trust comedy to engage difficult topics in a safe way.”But the lines have become ever more blurred. From the absurd official statements issued by the White House to comedy writers straining to satirise serious and horrific events, political news has come close to breaking comedy.“Trump gave us so much fodder that you could only approach it at a superficial level, and a lot of viewers, I think, went: you’re just recounting the day,” millennial American standup star Gianmarco Soresi told me.Comedyat its best, he continued, “is trying to blow things up. Comedy should question power, and the second that comedy becomes power, it’s lost its efficacy, and that’s why it was so offensive when comedians kind of saddled up to Trump.”However, Soresi was also quick to say that comedy cannot replace politics: there are limits to its powers. “Do I think we can create a space for relief? Yes. Do I think it can create a space for reflection? Yes. Do I think – as an American Jew – it can poke holes in Israel’s geopolitical agenda? Yes,” says Soresi. “Do I think it can build a political movement that takes down Netanyahu? No.”I go to a fair amount of standup comedy in Parisian basement bars, where the scene Pellegrin and Benyahia are part of is thriving. I’ve had my fair share of laughs at the latest season of South Park, and I know the likes of Stewart, Oliver and Colbert regularly help save the sanity of my American friends. But there is a danger in what we’re asking comedy to do: to take on journalism’s responsibility to inform the public, and to act as a public forum – but without any of journalism’s institutional safeguards.When I first moved to France, in 2012, I wondered why there didn’t seem to be the same prevalence of satirical political comedy shows on French TV as there was in the US. I slowly realised that this was because the news media were doing their job properly. The evening politics show Des Paroles et Des Actes on France 2 included live factchecking of claims made by its guests. Presidential debates were more than just a collection of 30-second soundbites: moderators followed up with candidates, sometimes multiple times, and fairness was ensured by tracking overall speaking time.Over the past decade and a half though, things have been declining in the French media sphere too. Two right-wing billionairesin particularhave gobbled up television stations, radio stations and newspapers. CNews has positioned itself as a French version of Fox, trust in news mediahas fallenanddisinformationhas taken a stronger hold. At the same time, French society feels more polarised and the far right has increased its electoral performance.I worry that France is headed down the same path as the US, whereby the traditional news media become weaker and more partisan, politics becomes a farce and comedy steps in to fill the void: see, for example, satire site Le Gorafibusting Sarkozyover his absurd prison memoir, after justthree weeks in jail.Anti-politics thrives where anti-media have taken root, leaving comedy to be both catharsis and cause. I don’t know if this can be reversed, but I do know that we have to try. Whatever the cost, the long-term return will be far greater. Without it, we risk turning the comedian’s stage into our most important public forum. That’s dangerous for society, and also the opposite of what comedy should be.Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnist.

So why is Starmer courting them?Adam AlmeidaTo win votes, Trump can afford to face up to corporate power – to deliver his promised 1.5m homes, Starmer can’tSat 24 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 12.48 ESTShareIn an incredibly polarised society, there are fewer and fewer things that seem to unite both sides of the aisle in the US political system. Yet it turns out that an objection to Wall Street’s grand heist of single-family homes has done just that.We might expectAlexandria Ocasio-CortezandElizabeth Warrento rail against the incursion of institutional investors into residential real estate markets, causingrent prices to jumpand effectively locking millions of households out of home ownership. However, I admit I was surprised to seeJD VanceandMarjorie Taylor Greenestriking a similar note. But I was completely dumbfounded to see the real estate tycoon and Wall Street darling Donald Trump sing from the same hymn sheet.Earlier this month, Trumpannounced his intentionto ban large institutional investors, such as asset managers and pension funds, from acquiring single-family homes. On Tuesday, hesigned an executive orderdoing just that and called on Congress to pass it into law. “Homes are built for people, not for corporations,” hetold the audienceat Davos the next day.Although this stance against the corporate takeover of housing might seem sensible to readers, it places Trump far to the left of Britain’s Labour party. In fact, Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves have spent much of their time in powerattempting to win overfirms such as Blackstone, once thelargest owner of single-family rentalsin the US. They are now one of many financial companies about tohave their wings clippedby the Trump administration’s most recent policy shake-up.Starmer is staking his reputation on hispipe dream of building1.5m homes over the course of parliament and inaugurating thenext generation of new towns. Steve Reed, the UK’s latest housing secretary, announced his ambitious plans for the sector at Labour’s party conference in Liverpool in September while sporting a red cap with the slogan “Build Baby Build!”. Manyfound his performance evocativeof Maga’s knack for spectacle, with its abrasive rhetoric and sartorial choices.View image in fullscreenThe housing secretary, Steve Reed, at the Labour party conference in Liverpool, 28 September 2025.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PAReal-estate industry insiders expect large institutional investors to play a critical role in delivering new housing in Britain. They point out that the new towns plan is implausible without such investment. Corporate landlords are set to deliverup to a quarterof these new homes through build-to-rent schemes, including developments with single-family rental homes.Single-family rentals, whether in the US or UK, can comprise detached homes or low-rise blocks of flats owned and managed by a single investor or consortium. In the UK, investment is pouring into wealthy commuter towns in Cambridgeshire and Hampshire. In the US, it’s the suburbs of affluent cities in the sunbelt region – sprawling places such as Atlanta, Georgia, Jacksonville, Florida and Charlotte, North Carolina. Institutional investors now ownone in every four or fivesingle-family homes in these rental markets.The UK’s single-family rental market remains small in comparison, even in localised areas with high levels of investment. This might change quickly, as Trump’s announcement has already prompted analysts to forecast a shift in activitytowards the UK. According to real estate consultancy Knight Frank, single-family rentalsnow account for 40%of all investment in the booming build-to-rent sector. This represents remarkable growth for an asset class that essentially did not exist prior to 2020.As for Trump, it remains uncertain why he decided to tread this path. Taking an educated guess, I believe he is responding to his lack of progress on the affordability agenda he campaigned hard on(and won)in 2024.The most recent figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showrents and foodto be the main drivers of US consumer inflation. Trump’s desperation to slash costs and bring back a sense of prosperity to the electorate is seen most plainly in hisunprecedented threatsand criminal investigation into Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. He knows he’s in hot water if he doesn’t turn the macroeconomic picture around before the November midterm elections.The issue, however, is that Trump draws immense support and millions in donations from a real estate industry that benefits hugely from persistent rent-price inflation. But desperate times call for desperate measures – and the president seems to be willing to bite the hand that feeds him in order to try to remain in power.The Trump administration likely realises that19 of the 20 largestsingle-family rental markets are located in states Trump won in 2024. He also knows that his electoral heartlands lie in the middle-class suburbs that arerapidly shiftingaway from home ownership and towards renting. There is a clear political necessity here that must override allegiances to the donor base.In stark contrast, Starmer hasn’t a clue where his vanishing base lies. Communities across the country are alreadymobilising a frontagainst his new towns plan. Social housing-led developments could help overcome this aversion, giventwo-thirds of votersare supportive of the expansion of council housing stock. But Reeves’s self-imposed fiscal rules make direct public investment in housing a nonstarter, leaving the government without any other option but to knock on Wall Street’s door with a begging bowl in hand.In the UK’s fractious political system, there is still one thing that unites renters and homeowners, the working class and the aristocracy, racists and anti-racists. It is our deep and unshakeable distaste for the government of the day.Housingpolicy seems to be yet another area where no one is particularly happy.Adam Almeida is a writer and researcher living in LondonExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionLabourHousingConstruction industryRenting propertyReal estateTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Martin has been with the Guardian for decades; Ella has been contributing since 2022. This week, we challenged the pair to draw on the same subject (Trump and a world in turmoil), on the same day, to see what each – with their different styles, tools and perspectives – would come up with. Martin landed on a Shakespearean scene, with a warped “King Leer” flanked by snickering world leaders. Ella proposed him squatting in a dystopian nest, surrounded by his spoils.Below, each reflects on their process, the challenges and joys of political cartoons, and what they have learned from one another.Martin RowsonMartin Rowson at work at his home in south-east London – videoI’m old school. In the same way humans have forat least 67,800 years, I make marks with something runny on a flattish surface. Despite the growth of digital imaging over the past 40 years, I can’t even do Photoshop. That’s why I wanted to see what would happen if my friend and colleague Ella Baron and I had a “cartoon-off”, drawing the same topic to the same deadline, because she works exclusively digitally.My ludditism lies in my love of the tactility of the pencils, pens and brushes I use caressing and snagging on the paper. I also like the jeopardy, dancing with deadlines or not knowing if doing that wash in that way at this point is going to work or completely ruin the image. This lack of certainty is what makes my job fun (it’s standard seat-of-your-pants journalism). And I can’t be arsed to learn how to do it any other way.My hope is that all this makes the cartoon look good while implying there’s been a bit of a scrap between me and the piece of paper. It’s something I learned from the genius ofRonald SearleandRalph Steadman, who miraculously reveal the soul through the chaotic messiness.Martin Rowson's work in progress – videoThus equipped, I approach each cartoon the same way, never thinking about it until the day I’m filing (Guardian political cartoons are pitched, drawn and published within a single day), nor immersing myself too deeply in the surrounding analyses. I haven’t listened to the Today programme for more than 30 years; what the paper and its readers want is my analysis, not theirs.After listening to the 7am news headlines (on BBC Radio 3), within about 20 minutes, in ways I really don’t understand, I’ll have collided images and scenarios together in my mind’s eye enough to have created a clear image, which I then describe via email to my editors. So the most gruelling part of my day’s work is over by 7.30am.Next is the tricky bit, getting what’s in my head on to paper. I sketch it in pencil, ink over the outlines and then start painting, using a mixture of gouache and watercolour. This is specifically painting, in layers, washes and tones. Apart from anything else, and considering the perpetual state of the news, four or five hours doing watercolours is awfully restful.I work in the great English tradition of James Gillray and William Hogarth, filling the canvas. The image is drawn 50% larger than it appears when printed, allowing for lots of detail and space to add things if the story I’m covering develops during the day. Very occasionally a bigger, better story breaks. Then I’ll start again and just work quicker.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Martin Rowson/The GuardianFrom blank sheet of paper to completion, it takes around six hours for each cartoon.How Ella produces her extraordinary work is a total mystery to me. I’ve long appreciated she’s special, with seriously mad shit in her head she can get out on to a screen to share with us. But if she spent for ever telling us how she does it, it would still be like someone screaming Sanskrit into a pillow for all the sense it made to me.She and most of my other colleagues are, I know, the way forward. This won’t make much difference to the content of visual satire, which has been around for as long as we’ve had elites that require satirising. I’ll regret the loss of the messiness of my method, because I feel mess should be our natural habitat, but so what?President Trump shows why we’re still needed, to enrage his cultists but comfort and empower the rest of us, the victims of his increasing, capricious madness. My Trump No 2 is older, flappier, fleshier and madder than the first iteration 10 years ago. I’m still using just as much orange paint though.Ella BaronElla Baron at work in her studio in east London – videoI draw with a Wacom Cintiq tablet and stylus. It’s frustrating when people say this isn’t drawing by hand: I have hands and my stylus is more sensitive to pressure and barrel rotation than an ordinary pen. I don’t have any formal art training, but grew up drawing digitally as part of the first generation with easy access to that technology. It’s intrinsic to my style, but it’s hard to pin down how because I’ve never known anything different.You don’t make smudges when you draw on a screen, but you do make mistakes. The outlines of previous forms are a record of your hand movements and lend dynamism to the figures they represent. I think it’s good to leave them in. Politics is messy and political cartoons should be too. I’m very jealous of the evocative (in his own words) mess of Martin’s work – I don’t think it’s something I could ever achieve with my tools. What I can do with them is refine: zoom in on individual lines and tweak them to such an extent that if you’d be working on paper you’d have made a hole in it and in the desk below. It’s helpful when you’re trying to pin down the expression of a caricature, where the thickness and angle of an eyebrow can be the difference between a smile and a frown.The juxtaposition of these pared-down, fragile lines and bold, confident ones can be helpful in evoking the power dynamics which are important to political cartoons. Cartoons offer a rare opportunityto put the powerful into close proximity on the page with the people whose lives they dictate – it’s a way of holding that power to account.A cartoon can’t encapsulate the news, but I think it can cut through it. It is hypothetical: a twist on reality that makes you look back at it from a different perspective. That twist is what I’m looking for when I’m surfing through the news for cartoon ideas in the morning. I find symbols and idioms really helpful here – and feathered nests and their figurative ilk are much more fun to draw than men in suits.Ella Baron's work in progress – videoOnce I have several visuals I shuffle them like a deck of cards in my head until they form a composition that makes a point. The pointyness of that point is important to me. Frustrating as tight deadlines are, they force you to streamline the image around your message, because there’s rarely time for anything else. If you need to draw a crowd scene in 20 minutes then you have to distill it into the few lines that evoke “essence of crowd”. This distillation is also key to caricatures: of all the many lines that make up Trump, which are yours? I’m interested in the ways in which the image he projects of himself slips. The orange tan that doesn’t extend beyond the neckline or wrists; the pale bald patches showing through his yellow comb-over. It’s a way to undermine his ego, like plucking the feathers off. I think the best caricatures capture not just a politician’s face but their whole body and its movement. I hoped that the finger motion of plucking feathers would evoke Trump’s pincer-like hand gestures.When I’m drawing a political cartoon I’m always slightly in awe of the fact I’m working from and into a tradition. I’ve admired Martin’s work all my life and his caricatures have deeply shaped how I see politicians and inspired how I’ve gone on to draw them. I now have the more complicated task of working out how my cartoons could and should be different. At the beginning it felt necessary to prove that I could do the job of the (almost exclusively) men who came before me, even when it wasn’t International Women’s Day, by rinsing most of the femininity out of my cartoons; both in concept and in style. Gradually, with a bit more confidence and experience, I’ve been trying to bring it back.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The Guardian"

A 67-year-old man was found on a sidewalk at about 7.45am on Third Avenue in Manhattan, according to police. An additional two bodies – a man in his 30s and a woman in her 60s – were found separately in Brooklyn about two hours after the first discovery. All three died as a result of “weather-related circumstances”, according to sources who spoke withNBC NewsNew York.Ice and sleet hit northern Texas overnight and moved toward the central part of the state on Saturday. Ice formed on roads and bridges in a third of Mississippi’s counties. Dominion Energy said it is preparing for widespread power outages in Virginia andNorth Carolinacaused by the storm.View image in fullscreenA de-icing crew works during Winter Storm Fern on a Southwest Airlines flight at Nashville international airport in Nashville, Tennessee.Photograph: Andrew Nelles/ReutersAs of Saturday afternoon, nearly 14,000 flights through Monday into, within or out of the US had been canceled as the storm began its track, according to FlightAware.com. The storm brought severe cold and ice to regions unaccustomed to such severe conditions. About 140 million people, or more than 40% of the US population, were under winter storm warnings from New Mexico to New England.By midday Saturday, a quarter of an inch of ice was reported in parts of south-easternOklahoma, eastern Texas and portions of Louisiana.The X account of Chicago & Midwest Storm Chasersreported“many cars are off the road or stuck along the [south-west] side of [interstate] 30 near Little Rock” amid significant ice and snow.And Arkansas meteorologist Zachary HallwroteSaturday on X that interstate 40 was “at a standstill … due to accidents”.“These conditions will *NOT* improve with more snow, sleet and freezing rain likely tonight and tomorrow too,” Hall wrote.View image in fullscreenAn unhoused woman uses a blanket to try to stay warm in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.Photograph: Nick Oxford/Reuters“What really makes this storm unique is, just following this storm, it’s just going to get so cold,” said Allison Santorelli, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “The snow and the ice will be very, very slow to melt and won’t be going away anytime soon, and that’s going to hinder any recovery efforts.”The weather agencywarnedon Saturday morning that the powerful winter storm was “underway” with “precipitation already impacting” south-central regions of the country.Forecasters have said that more than160 million Americansare expected to be affected by the winter storm. Weather officials warn that widespread, extended power outages were possible – along with major travel disruptions, extensive tree damage and dangerous conditions.Heavy snow is expected across a large area from the southern Rockies and plains through the mid-Atlantic and into the north-east through the weekend, the NWS said. The NWS added that snowfall totals were likely to exceed 12in across the Ohio valley, mid-Atlantic and north-east.View image in fullscreenA shopper walks through a snow-covered parking lot in Brentwood, Tennessee.Photograph: Camden Hall/NurPhoto/ShutterstockWidespread freezing rain and sleet are forecast for the southern plains, the lower Mississippi valley, theTennesseevalley and the south-east.The NWS warned of “catastrophic ice accumulation” from the southern plains to the mid-Atlantic and the south-east. It added that the catastrophic impacts are expected where freezing rain amounts exceed a half inch, with totals of more than 1in possible in parts of northern Louisiana, central and northern Mississippi, southern Tennessee and the southern Appalachians.In the wake of the storm, the agency said, communities from the southern plains to the north-east can expect to contend with “bitterly cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills”.On Friday, the agencysaidthat power outages “are certain for some, especially in areas where the heaviest ice will accumulate on trees and powerlines”.The service urged Americans on Friday to “take this storm seriously”.As of Saturday afternoon, more than 130,000 customers, including about 61,600 inTexas, were without power nationwide, according to PowerOutage.us.Donald Trump on Friday nightsaidon his Truth Social platform that he had been “briefed on the Record Cold Wave and Historic Winter Storm that will be hitting much of the United States this weekend”.View image in fullscreenA snow-covered street in St Louis, Missouri.Photograph: Jeff Roberson/AP“The Trump Administration is coordinating with State and Local Officials,” the president said. He declared the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) “fully prepared to respond” less than a month after reports that his administration had drafted plans toeliminate thousandsof the entity’s staff.“Stay Safe and Stay Warm!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Before the storm,at least 16 stateshad declared states of emergency, along with Washington DC.Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear,warnedon Saturday morning that the winter storm was “moving through” the state “with areas expecting up to 15 inches of snow, ice accumulation and dangerously cold temperatures”.He urged residents to avoid travel and to prepare.New York City’s mayor, Zohran Mamdani, meanwhile,saidthat the city was forecast to get from 3in to 16in of snow this weekend.Explore more on these topicsUS weatherExtreme weatherDonald TrumpNew YorkOklahomaIowaTennesseenewsShareReuse this content"

Over blood-red steak and chips,Nigel Farageand Liz Truss came together on Monday for a discreet lunch at a swish Mayfair club, organised by a climate-denying US thinktank.Lois Perry, a former leader of the far-right Ukip party who is now Europe director of the Heartland Institute, posted photographs, now deleted, on X of Farage addressing others, including Truss, at the meal.WhileReform UKappears to be keeping the former prime minster at arm’s length publicly, despite welcoming other former Tories, the gathering at Mark’s Club organised by the Heartland Institute raises potentially fresh awkward questions for the party.“Liz Truss would not be welcome in Reform UK,” the party’s press team replied within seven minutes of being asked by the Guardian if the party would ever allow the UK’s shortest-serving prime minister into its ranks.View image in fullscreenThe former Conservative housing secretary Robert Jenrick, centre, defected to Reform UK on 15 January.Photograph: Jacob King/PAYet speculation has persisted about the next moves of Truss, whose mini-budget was described by Farage as “the best Conservative budget since 1986”.“She is very comfortable in that group, a lot whom hang out together, and both she and Nigel are clearly close to a lot of the same people, including some of Reform’s biggest backers,” said one of the other 20 or so people who attended.The thinktank they were lunching in aid of has made some extreme and incorrect comments on the climate. In the past, it has compared people who believe in global heating to the Unabomber, the US terrorist jailed for killing three people and injuring many others.Those present included David Starkey,the historian dropped by his university and publisher in 2020 over racist remarks, who has become a favoured guest at Reform’s annual conference, and Mike Graham, the broadcastersacked from Rupert Murdoch’s TalkTVafter it said he had failed to cooperate with an investigation into a racist post that appeared on one of his social media accounts.Others included Alan Mendoza, a founder and executive director of the right-leaning Henry Jackson Society thinktank, and Lance Forman, the smoked salmon mogul and former Brexit party MEP who gave financial backing to Truss’s Tory leadership campaign.View image in fullscreenLance Forman, seen here in 2016, said he spoke to Liz Truss at the lunch about Robert Jenrick’s criticism of her mini-budget and she was ‘not upset at all’.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian“It was basically about climate change,” Forman told the Guardian when asked about the lunch, which happened to take place on the same day that one of Reform’s newest recruits,Robert Jenrick, had claimed he toldKemi Badenoch to kick Truss out of the Conservative party because of her “cackhanded” mini-budget.Areport in the New Statesmanhas suggested Truss spent the lunch visibly annoyed about Jenrick’s attack on her and her record in a piece for the Times and, after Farage’s departure, she complained to other guests that “dark forces” were behind the article.However, Forman said: “The timing of it was quite funny because of what Robert Jenrick had said that very morning. I was talking to Liz Truss and we mentioned it – she was not upset at all. She is very cheerful and robust.“It was a ridiculous thing for Jenrick to have said, actually. He said it on the back of her budget and Nigel Farage was one of those who congratulated her on her budget.” He said the food on offer was an “unmemorable” set menu featuring a chocolate mousse for dessert.Labour seized on the presence of both Truss and Farage, with a spokesperson claiming that Farage is “hellbent on reassembling Boris Johnson’s cabinet of failed Tories who broke our public services and hammered family finances”.They added: “On the same day Robert Jenrick said his old boss Liz Truss should be thrown out of the Tory party because of the damage she did to families, his new boss Nigel Farage was quaffing champagne and enjoying a lavish lunch with her.”Hard copies outlining the views of the Heartland Institute were also passed around at the lunch, where one diner said Farage gave a short speech that endorsed the institute’s ideas.“I think it’s likely that some of the things they are calling for will end up in a Reform programme for government,” they added.Once owned by the entrepreneur Mark Birley, Mark’s Club was sold in 2007 to Richard Caring, who also owns The Ivy and Sexy Fish restaurant chains, and is seen by the rightwing elite as a new money establishment with a less exclusive membership list than in its storied past.The Liz Truss Show review – hapless ravings from a cupboardRead moreThe club recently had a migraine-inducing makeover, stuffed with chintzy furnishings, gigantic oil paintings of dogs and brightly patterned wallpaper. Membership of Mark’s is £2,750 each year plus a £1,250 joining fee.The home of the Tory right is now unanimously understood to be 5 Hertford Street, which is owned by the late Mark Birley’s son, Robin. Truss may have struggled to secure a booking at this club; she is understood to haveirritated its ownersby wandering the premises in search of members to poach for her own rival club just one street away, which asks “founding members” for an eye-watering £500,000.While a much more fringe figure, Perry too has increasingly been working to establish herself as a major player on Britain’s new right. She spentmuch of this weekin Zurich at a “Davos alternative”, run by the Heartland Institute, where Truss was billed as a keynote speaker, opining on “a vision for the UK and the democratic west”.The lunch was not the first time Perry has brought Truss and Farage together. Both graced the launch of the Heartland’s UK chapter at a glitzy party last year, held at Brooks’s private members club – one of the few remaining London gentlemen’s clubs that does not admit women.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsNigel FarageLiz TrussReform UKConservativesKemi BadenochRobert JenricknewsShareReuse this content"

Step outside and you will encounter a patchwork of writhing, buzzing, bubbling urban microclimates.Sam Davenport, the director of nature recovery at the LondonWildlifeTrust, emphasises the sheer variation in habitats that you find in UK cities, which creates an amazing “mosaic” of wildlife.“If you think of going out into the countryside where you have arable fields, it’s really homogeneous. But if you walk a mile in each direction of a city you’re going to get allotments, gardens, railway lines, bits of ancient woodland.”Animals also thrive in cities because urban winters are milder than in the countryside. “It’s not uncommon in cities to see queen bumblebees foraging over Christmas,” Davenport said. “When it’s cold, the city is warmer. We have a microclimate that invertebrates can make use of.”Beyond bees, species such as otters and herons benefit from waterways that are less likely to freeze, keeping food supplies more stable through the winter months.Many species also adapt their behaviour to urban life, altering where and how they hunt, the habitats they use, or the ways they move through the landscape. “Cities show that nature’s really good at being adaptable and finding a niche,” Davenport said.Here are some of the species that have found a way to thrive in the big smoke:LandView image in fullscreenA disused London Underground station, home to the eponymous mosquitoes that migrated from the Middle East.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesAs it turns out, the “London Underground mosquito” (Culex pipiens f. molestus) is not aptly named. The insects became notorious during the second world war, when they would dine on Londoners seeking shelter from bombing in tube tunnels. But despite popular belief, they did not evolve underground. Their origins lie in the Middle East several thousand years ago, though they have since happily adapted to the temperate climate of the capital’s transport network.Mosquitoes are not the only emigres to have found a home in Britain’s urban jungle. More than 10,000 yellow-tailed scorpions (Tetratrichobothrius flavicaudis) are thought to live in the crevices of walls at Sheerness dockyard, Kent, and are believed to have spawned a second colony in the east London docklands. They arrived in the UK in the 1800s, nestled in shipments of Italian masonry.Meanwhile, Regent’s Park provides perfect woodland conditions for the UK’s main population of Aesculapian snakes (Zamenis longissimus). One of Europe’s largest snake species, these olive-coloured constrictors are thought to be escapers from a former research facility, surviving in the wild by preying on rodents and birds.WaterwaysView image in fullscreenOtters can be spotted playing in the water near Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PAIn 1957, the Natural History Museum declared the Thames biologically dead. Since then, improvements to sewage systems and industrial waste disposal have transformed the river into a habitable ecosystem. The wildlife now found in the Thames and its network of waterways is a striking environmental success story.Otters, once endangered, can be seen playing in the water near Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Downstream in the Thames estuary,hundreds of harbour sealssometimes wander inland to hunt fish that have returned to cleaner urban rivers.London’s waterways have also attracted more unexpected residents. These include the demon shrimp (Dikerogammarus haemobaphes),a worrisome speciesof aggressive omnivore from the Black Sea, and short-snouted seahorses (Hippocampus hippocampus), thought to have drifted in on the Gulf Stream – perhaps a more hopeful sign of the Thames’s biological recovery.Two aquatic creatures vie for the strangest origin story in the Thames. First are red-eared terrapins (Trachemys scripta elegans), imported to the UK from Mississippi and Mexico during the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle craze of the 1980s. Bought as pets and later abandoned, they have since thrived in urban ponds and canals. Some of the terrapins seen today are likely to be the same 1980s pets – just significantly older.Then there is the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), which has one of the strangest life cycles of any animal. After spawning in the Sargasso Sea near the Bahamas, the eels drift on Atlantic currents to rivers such as the Thames, where they can live for decades before making the long journey back to the Bahamas to die.SkyView image in fullscreenPeregrine falcon chicks in a nest atop a London tower block.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyPeregrine falcons(Falco peregrinus)are the fastest animals in the world – and they thrive in central London. Some of the city’s roughly 40 breeding pairs roost on the Barbican’s tower blocks, where residents report watching adults give flying lessons to their young.Swooping from the Barbican, the falcons often spend the day at Tate Modern, just across the river. Although they would not usually hunt at night, they have adapted to city life, preying on nocturnal migratory birds drawn to the glow of streetlights.Peregrine falcons loopBats, too, live comfortably alongside people. They are commonly found along canals, disused industrial buildings, in people’s homes – and even flying down Regent Street. Wildlife experts believe they navigate much like human commuters, using linear railway embankments as guides through the city.Other birds are legacies of Britain’s aristocratic past. Peacocks, for example, are known to strut through the Kyoto Garden in Holland Park, feral descendants of birds once kept by the gentry.Meanwhile, the ancestors of the pelicans that live in St James’s Park were a gift presented to King Charles II by the Russian ambassador in 1664.Explore more on these topicsLondonWildlifeAnimalsBirdsInsectsConservationLondon UndergroundnewsShareReuse this content"

The 54-year-old herder releases his animals into the wilderness on the 830-mile Finnish-Russian border each spring to grow fat on lichens, grass and mushrooms, just as his ancestors have done for generations.But since 2022, grisly discoveries of reindeer skeletons on the forest floor have disrupted this ancient way of life. The culprits, according to Kujala: wolves from Russia.Oblivious to the tensions between the two countries sparked by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, large animals such as wolves and bears move freely across the heavily forested frontier. Most go unnoticed, but on the Finnish side, a record level of wolf attacks on reindeer last year has sparked concern among some herders.View image in fullscreenA Finnish reindeer killed by wolves. ‘They go for the throat and legs.’Photograph: Juha KujalaThey suspect that Russian wolf numbers have exploded after hunters were sent to the frontline in Ukraine, driving the predators to search for new territory inFinland.“The last year has been the worst ever for wolf attacks in this area. The reindeer are an easy catch for them,” says Kujala, whose reindeer are spending the winter at his farm near Kuusamo.“You can see the signs that it is wolves: they go for the throat and the legs. When you’ve seen enough dead ones, you can tell.“My home is 38km from the Russian border. When it snows, you can see the tracks coming from their side,” he adds.A record 2,124 reindeer were killed by wolves in 2025, according to the Reindeer Herders’ Association of Finland, which says those found are likely to be a fraction of the true total. Many share photos of the skeletons they find in the forests, which have often been chewed clean to the bone.Despite the herders’ suspicions about Russian wolves being to blame, the authorities say it is hard to be definitive about the reasons behind the jump in predation.There is almost no contact across the border between Finland and Russia, and it is impossible to get answers to basic questions from the Russians about what might be behind the rise in attacks. Finnish herders say they are no longer able to collect reindeer that have crossed the border, which was commonplace before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.View image in fullscreenReindeer roam widely but Finnish herders say they can no longer collect reindeer that have crossed the border, as they did before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Photograph: T Mendoza/AlamyUntil last June, the wolf was a strictly protected species in the EU after it was nearly hunted to extinction in many countries. But itsconservation level was downgradedafter numbers almost doubled across Europe from 11,193 to 20,300 between 2012 and 2023. Roughly 65,500 livestock a year are thought to be killed by the predators, prompting some EU states toincrease culling.In the hills of Italy, wolves returned from the brink. Then the poisonings beganRead moreFinlandlifted its ban on wolf huntingat the start of 2026, instead implementing a hunting quota system to limit population growth.Ilpo Kojola, a wolf specialist with Finland’s Natural Resources Institute, says: “The wolf is a species that can increase rapidly. They are usually pretty limited by hunting in Russia so that’s why it is possible that the war in Ukraine has had some role in the change.“But it’s impossible to be conclusive because, of course, there could be some other reason that we do not have solid evidence for.”The increase in attacks is close timing with the war in UkraineIlpo KojolaThe Finnishwolf population was about 430in spring last year, according to official statistics, and is part of the same subspecies as those in Russia, which is home to an estimated 60,000.Kojola says there is a precedent for the rapid increase in Russia’s wolf population when, during the second world war, numbers doubled after millions of men were sent to fight against Nazi Germany on the Soviet Union’s western front. There wasanother spikewhen the USSR collapsed.View image in fullscreenA reindeer killed by wolves near the border.Photograph: J Kujala“We don’t know how big a role the soldiers stationed at garrisons on the border played in wolf hunting in the area. But the increase in attacks is close timing with the war in Ukraine,” he says.Mia Valtonen, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Institute, is responsible for the genetic testing of wolves shot to control populations. She says a majority of the wolves shot in Finland in recent years do not appear to be from the country, but researchers cannot be certain as a genetic record of their entire wolf population has not yet been completed.“We cannot say for sure that most of these wolves come from Russia. It’s likely, but we cannot say it for sure,” she says.Kujala and other herders who regularly find dead reindeer in the forest dismiss the scientific caution, calling for greater protection from attacks.“We do not hate the wolves but we need balance,” Kujala says. “The reindeer spend most of their time out in nature. Around my farm, there is a big 50km section for them to roam in. It’s impossible to protect them all the time.“We need them healthy and strong. This is our life, it’s our job, it’s how we live.

In addition, it will explore using more grey-water – cleaner wastewater from baths, showers, sinks and washing machines.The plans mark a wider shift in the RHS’s approach to the climate crisis as it focuses on adapting to the growing impacts of planet-warming emissions in the atmosphere.Tim Upson, the RHS’s director of horticulture, said: “Water is the lifeblood of any garden – important not only to human health and wellbeing but the broader environment and wildlife – and we, like the UK’s 34 million gardeners, are having to adapt to the new normal; prioritising collection, storage and management of rainwater as well as relocating and reassessing our collections to future-proof them.”Upson said the charity’s updated water management plan “gets into the nitty-gritty” of where a last bucket of water might be used in each garden. “That’s the reality of the situation we need to prepare for and we would be foolish not to,” he said.To understand what grows in its own gardens and advise British gardeners, the RHS is also recording the use of water in different garden landscapes, such as trees, herbaceous perennial borders, turf lawns and vegetable gardens.The RHS said it was using this knowledge to predict water use patterns by these plants and prepare for future planting and water resources management as the climate crisis accelerates.Upson said: “There’s a sweet spot between building plants’ resilience to withstand drier periods by providing less water, but then there’s the potential of stressing a plant and leaving them susceptible to plant health issues, not to mention reduced floriferousness, which has a knock-on effect for wildlife and humans.”Explore more on these topicsWaterClimate crisisGardensDroughtPlantsTrees and forestsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

As crime evolves, we expect police to evolve more quickly.View image in fullscreenSarah Jones says the licence reforms will ‘equip every officer with the skills and capabilities’ to do the job.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian“The licence to practise will equip every officer with the skills and capabilities to do the job – whether new to the force or a policing veteran.”But thePolice Federationof England and Wales criticised the plans, saying: “Everyone wants professional policing, but that requires pay, training, time and support.“Officers are routinely pulled off mandatory training to plug gaps, work rest days to stay afloat, and carry workloads no one would call safe.“We will await the detail of the white paper but these issues need to be fixed.”Former Bedfordshire police and crime commissioner Festus Akinbusoye said the plan was unnecessary.Akinbusoye, a former Conservative party candidate, told the Daily Mail: “I am genuinely astonished that, of all the crises facing British policing such as collapsing recruitment, appalling retention, failure to get the basics right, deep-rooted cultural problems, and a serious leadership deficit – the Home Office has decided that the answer lies in forcing police officers to hold a licence to practise.”The changes will form part of what the government has said will be the largest shake-up of the police service since it was founded 200 years ago. Other changes announced include targets for crime fighting, responding to emergency calls and satisfying the victims of crimes, with those performing poorly to be named and shamed.One police chief said national targets, with forces potentially ranked in league tables, could lead to perverse incentives. “People worry about their position in league tables as opposed to the quality of service,” they said. “What gets measured gets done, and what does not get measured does not get done.”Another chief said: “You can hit the target and miss the point.”The government has also announced a graduate recruitment drive, with £7m promised to attract students into graduate neighbourhood police officer roles.The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, will unveil the reforms in the white paper on Monday.Explore more on these topicsPolicePolice FederationHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

But Labour faces an uphill struggle, withpolls suggestingthe Senedd race could end its decades of dominance in Wales.With Starmer facing renewed leadership pressure from thepotential returnto Westminster of Andy Burnham, she said she was confident the prime minister would “get a grip” on running the country after a turbulent first 18 months in power.But she declined to answer whether Starmer should lead the party into the next general election, saying it was in the gift of MPs. “There is no doubt, though, that if Labour performed badly inWalesin May, the heat will be put up on Keir,” she said.“I do hope that people in this election will recognise that this is not a time to send a protest vote towards Keir Starmer. This is a time where people have to work out what is best for their communities and delivery of services.”Reform UK and Plaid are on course to win more seats than Labour, reflecting pressure for change among the public after 26 years of Labour control.Morgan, however, argued that 14 of those were under Tory austerity from which Wales was only just emerging. “We’re coming out of it now. We’ve got decent budgets that allow us to look to the future with hope,” she said.“When you’ve been in power for 26 years, you gain a pretty good idea of how to govern. The UK government are still relatively new in that position, so I’m confident that they will get a better grip on setting out a clearer strategic vision for the country.”Morgan welcomed Starmer’stougher tonetowards Donald Trump this week after the US president threatened to impose tariffs. “You have got to stand up to people when they threaten the international legal world order,” she said. “But also to recognise that you need to keep a cool head in these circumstances.”But she would like Starmer to go further with theEU reset, saying it was “critical” for Wales to have the closest possible trading relationship as 59% of its exports were goods based, compared with 32% for the UK overall.“Since we’ve left, proportionately, Wales is impacted more than England, because our economy is one based on goods rather than services. The irony is, of course, that it was those communities that voted for Brexit that have paid the price in terms of jobs because of that reduction in trade.”On rejoining the EU, she said: “Now is not the time to rejoin, but I do think that that should not be off the table in the long term.“I want to see the closest possible relationship with the EU. But I don’t think all of that is within our gift. This is about what the EU would be willing to offer us.”Morgan said she was focusing on the “bread and butter” issues in Wales – such as growing the economy and improving public services.Despite criticism of her government’s handling of NHS waiting lists, which remain higher than in England, she said they were down 90% since their peak, and that contrasting with England was like “comparing apples with pears” because the two countries counted differently.Welsh voters should “wake up” to the prospect that two pro-independence parties could end up in power in Cardiff, suggesting it would be a “massive distraction” from the day-to-day business of running government.Even though Plaid’s leader, Rhun ap Iorweth, has said a vote for his party would not be taken as an endorsement of independence, Morgan suggested it would be “too tempting” for him not to pursue it.The implications for prosperity and public services in Wales were “dire”, she said, because of the £14bn funding gap. “You can’t have it both ways. The nationalists are trying to say, ‘Give us more money England’, while we head for the door.”Turning her sights on Reform UK, which polls suggest is on course to take second place, she warned against the “politics of anger and division”, suggesting that Nigel Farage “doesn’t know the first thing” about Wales.She suggested that Reform, in Wales as in the rest of the UK, was on course to be Conservatives 2.0 after so many defections. “I hope the people of Wales won’t be fooled by any suggestion that what you’ve got here is a fresh new party. What you’ve got here is recycled Tories who are on the road to oblivion.”Explore more on these topicsWelsh politicsEluned MorganLabourDevolutionReform UKPlaid CymruGreen partynewsShareReuse this content"

Britain, experts warnBetter regulation and enforcement urged before launch of oral treatments, which criminals are likely to try to exploitNicola DavisScience correspondentSat 24 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTShareExperts are warning that fake weight-loss treatments could become more prevalent as tablet forms of the medications, currently available only via injections in the UK, are launched.They say stronger regulation and enforcement are needed to prevent fraudsters from cashing in on tablets which will be easier to counterfeit.While pill forms of weight-loss medications are expectedto be much cheaper, and hence more accessible than injectable versions, experts have warned they are also an easier target for fraudsters.“Pills are much easier prey for scammers than injectables as they require relatively accessible equipment to manufacture the pill – something to mix the powders and a pill press – and can provide the scope for vast production,” said Bhavik Patel, a professor of clinical and bioanalytical chemistry at the University of Brighton.In the UK, the demand forweight-loss jabs such as Wegovy and Mounjarohas grown, with trials suggesting they can help people lose on averageabout 14% and 20%of their body weight respectively after 72 weeks.However, the jabs are expensive, require an injection pen and needles, and must be refrigerated.Now pharmaceutical companies are working on oral versions of the medications, creating tablets containing drugs that mimic the hormone GLP-1.A pill form of Wegovy, produced by Novo Nordisk, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month and is under assessment by the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), while Orforglipron from Eli Lillyhas completed phase-three clinical trialsand has beensubmitted to the FDAfor review.How weight-loss wonder drugs are redefining the way our bodies workRead moreDr Bernard Naughton, an associate professor and researcher in pharmaceutical regulation and innovation at Trinity College Dublin, said counterfeit pills could include medications taken out of the legitimate supply chain – and potentially stored incorrectly – while they could also be contaminated, or contain an incorrect dose, incorrect active ingredient or no active ingredient at all.“We can see already that there have been some examples of the injections being falsified,” said Naughton. “It’s relatively easy to just create a pill and, if you’ve got good packaging, to falsely put it forward as the legitimate product.”Naughton saidhis own researchof patient behaviour with other medications has suggested people seemed more likely and more willing to take a risk online with tablets than injections.“So even when they think there might be something wrong, I have seen examples of people still going ahead and actually buying it and taking it,” he said.Novo Nordisk said its Wegovy pill not only contained the active ingredient semaglutide, but also a substance called SNAC (salcaprozate sodium) that enhances the absorption of the drug.“Only Novo Nordisk manufactures FDA-approved semaglutide medicines with this SNAC technology,” a spokesperson said. “Compounded semaglutide is not approved by the FDA and may contain impurities, unnecessary additives, and untested doses.”There is a precedent for fake weight-loss medications, with the MHRA havingrepeatedly issued warningsof the importance of buying jabs only from registered pharmacies or legitimate retailers.Oksana Pyzik, an associate professor at the UCL school of pharmacy, said demand for medications such as Wegovy and Mounjaro had outpaced regulated supply, whileprice rises for some productshave also been linked to people seeking cheaper alternatives online via unlicensed routes.“While oral weight-loss drugs may improve access, it will also widen opportunity for criminals to falsify GLP-1s,” she said.In October last yearthe MHRA revealedit had carried out a raid on a factory in Northampton, seizing more than £250,000 worth of counterfeit weight-loss jabs, including injection pens for the experimental drug retatrutide, which is not licensed in the UK.At present it is unclear whether any arrests or prosecutions have been made in connection with the raid, with the MHRA saying it is unable to disclose information regarding ongoing investigations.However, aGuardian investigationrevealed the company whose name featured on the packaging of the jabs, Alluvi, has continued to advertise its branded retatrutide pens on the social media platform Telegram.Patel said the recent raid showed the MHRA was highly proactive in protecting the public from counterfeit medicines. “However, the use of social media and online marketplaces provides a widespread access to consumers who wish to access the medicines, and this does pose a risk,” he said.“With the huge demand there will be [for] the pills, this will really stretch the UK Border Force and MHRA, as the scale is likely to be greater than injectables and we may not be able to completely eradicate these counterfeit products entering our market.”Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk said they were taking action to combat counterfeits, with the latter noting that for the pill form of Wegovy this included online monitoring and removing, for example, websites or posts; sharing information about the pill’s supply chain flow and characteristics with authorities; and providing sample pills to the FDA’s Forensic Chemistry Center for testing and further investigations if needed.Andy Morling, deputy director of enforcement at the MHRA, said medicines for weight management must meet rigorous standards of safety, quality and effectiveness before they could be authorised for use in the UK.“We are working tirelessly through robust regulatory and enforcement processes to identify and take action against the illegal supply of unauthorised and falsified medicines, ensuring the UK legal supply chain remains strong, responsive and effective as new treatment formats become available,” he said.“Authorised medicines are subject to robust regulatory processes and ongoing oversight, including controls on how they are manufactured, supplied and monitored once on the market. Any medicine supplied illegally or without authorisation poses a risk to public health and patent safety, regardless of its format.”Pyzik, who is academic chair of theFight the Fakes Alliance, said that the UK was beginning to use AI tools to detect falsified online adverts, but stronger regulation and enforcement were needed“Patients need to know that they should only access these products with a prescription, under medical supervision and to avoid purchasing any pharmaceuticals on social media,” she said.Pyzik added there had been a shift from falsified medical products being imported into the UK to increasingly sophisticated domestic operations.“When an illicit counterfeit factory can be raided, shut down, and then reappear online shortly afterwards apparently with no arrests or prosecutions as of yet, that is not a functioning deterrent and exposes real regulatory gaps,” she said.“Not only does it signal to criminal groups that the risk of prosecution is low and the rewards are high, but emboldens them to break further laws and take even more drastic measures to sell falsified pharmaceuticals.”Naughton said that, among other actions, the UK should ensure it was easy for patients to verify that they were buying medications from a legitimate online pharmacy – and develop public health campaigns targetting groups with different motivations and attitudes to risk when it comes to buying medications online.“I think that’s really important because there is value in buying medicines online, and it provides access to lots of people who wouldn’t have access otherwise,” he said.Explore more on these topicsWeight-loss drugsPharmaceuticals industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Perhaps too easy, as the sudden shriek of its proximity sensor suggests the Guardian was a whisker away from a bill for some new paintwork.The van in question belongs to Openreach, BT’s fibre broadband subsidiary. It is one of 6,000 electric vans out of 23,400 in Britain’s second-largest commercial fleet – and a further 1,000 are expected to be added by March.The shift away from polluting diesel engines to electric will play a crucial role in the UK’s efforts to cut carbon emissions from vans – which werelast recordedat 18m tonnes or 12% of all transport emissions in 2023.Yet while the transition is moving forward for some of the biggest fleets, on a UK-wide level electric van sales have lagged behind expectations. For the white van, it has not been so easy being green.On the face of it, electric van sales are behind government sales targets, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate –echoing the situation for car sales. In 2025, the headline target was for 16% of new vans sold in Great Britain to be electric. Manufacturers only managed 9.5%, while struggling with an overall van market that slumped by 10%, according to figures published this week. That has led to a battle between manufacturers and some of the biggest buyers over how quickly Britain should make the switch.For some fleets it makes sense. Royal Mail has theUK’s biggest commercial fleet, with about 43,000 vehicles. Posties drive pretty much the same route every day, before bringing their vehicles to a depot overnight. This pattern – with predictable mileage and a base to recharge – makes it easy to choose a van with the right size of battery, saving costs.As well as 8,000 mid-sized electric vans, in the last month the company has also started using micro-electric vehicles – essentially rugged golf carts – and heavy electric lorries. Together those could cover the entire parcel journey with zero direct emissions.View image in fullscreenA Paxster micro-electric vehicle in Royal Mail livery. The vehicles will be used for Royal Mail deliveries and collections in some urban areas.Photograph: James Linsell Clark/SWNSCost savings are the driving force for those companies which have switched. European sole traders – the white-vanman, or woman– would save about €14,000 (£12,200) over three years relative to a diesel equivalent, according to a2024 studyby the Centre for Economics and Business Research (which was commissioned byFord, seller of many more diesel Transitsthan electric models).Upfront costs are still markedly more expensive – an E-Transit Custom starts at £43,630, compared with £33,750 for the cheapest diesel. Most of the savings from going electric come from charging being more cost-effective than diesel. Large fleets are also in a strong position to negotiate steep discounts – large-scale fleet buyers can get as much as a quarter off the list price when committing to a big order.However, charging is difficult for some drivers, particularly if they have to rely on public chargers. Openreach installs home chargers for employees where it can, and also has deals to use other companies’ connections when their depots are empty during the day. Bulk charging deals mean it can get cheaper rates at public chargers when engineers are out and about.EV graphicSitting in the converted telephone exchange building in Bishop’s Stortford, Judy O’Keefe, director of fleet at Openreach, said she valued the reliability of electric vehicles, avoiding roadside rescues which can cost £500 a pop.“They are way more reliable,” she said. “Breakdowns, being left on the side of the road at night, are significantly down. Long term, the EV is the right way to go in terms of maintenance and servicing alone.”Butrange anxietyis perhaps the main reason people are holding back. O’Keefe said that some engineers have been concerned about not having enough charge, but looking at fleet data, “I can see that engineer’s data and say, it is enough”.Nevertheless, there is still clearly some way to go to persuade the majority of buyers to consider a green van. Yet as with the ZEV mandate for cars, the missed headline targets are not quite what they seem. The mandate has “flexibilities” – handy loopholes that allow manufacturers to gain “credits” that allow them to sell more vehicles with petrol and diesel engines. They can earn credits by cutting the emissions of the petrol and diesel vehicles they sell (a strong incentive to sell more plug-in hybrids), and they can sell more electric vehicles in later years to catch up. To complicate matters further, manufacturers can swap credits between their cars and vans.The thinktank New Automotive has estimated that the actual target for last year was not 16%, but closer to 9.35%. If the estimates are correct it would suggest manufacturers are on track to avoid costly fines if they fail to comply. However, Mikes Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders lobby group, disputes that, saying the numbers are “significantly adrift of ambition”.Whatever the flexibilities, the headline targets do increase quickly. For 2026, the headline target is 24%, and it will reach 70% in 2030, before sales of petrol and diesel vans are banned in 2035.The big van makers in the UK are Ford, Stellantis (owner of the Peugeot, Citroën, Fiat and Vauxhall brands, among others) and Volkswagen – although,as in the car market, Chinese rivals are ruffling feathers, with Maxus recording fast growth.View image in fullscreenOpenreach, BT’s fibre broadband subsidiary, has 6,000 electric vans, Britain’s second-largest commercial fleet.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianStellantis is the only company that still makes vans in Britain, at a plant in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. However, Stellantis also exemplifies the difficulties facing European van manufacturers: in April itclosed a factory in Lutonthat previously made Vauxhall Vivaro vans. It partly blamed the mandate, although some industry experts believed that Stellantis had too much capacity across Europe to meet lower demand.Eurig Druce, UK group managing director for Stellantis, said the company is “more than compliant” with the rules once flexibilities are accounted for, but the complexity of the regulatory calculation “almost makes running the business a game”.“We are as an industry considerably short of where the mandate sets out,” he said. “The reality for the majority of manufacturers in the UK is they’re struggling to comply. The take-up has been slower than any of us would have liked.”Druce argued that the government should remove a cap on the number of electric van grants each buyer can use, but also that it should “review the trajectory” of targets as soon as possible. Otherwise the UK would “put in danger the investment in manufacturing in this country”.“The market is not willing to follow,” said Druce. “The consumers do not follow at the rate of the trajectory.”However, some companies – including energy companies Ovo andSSE,as well as Openreach,have argued the opposite: they want electric vans as soon as possible. Abby Chicken, Openreach’s head of sustainability, said an end to the “government oscillations over the last five years” would be helpful. However, she added that “the business case looks good” for switching to electric – alongside the “moral imperative” to cut carbon emissions.View image in fullscreenAbby Chicken, Openreach’s head of sustainability, said the business case looks good for switching to electric – alongside the ‘moral imperative’ to cut carbon emissions.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianDominic Phinn, head of transport at the Climate Group, which runs the EV100 campaign to get big fleets to switch, said that its members – which include Tesco, British Gas owner Centrica, Lloyds Banking Group, and Next – “can’t get enough” of electric vans.“It feels like another attempt by the automotive sector to slow things down,” said Phinn. “They’ll all snap into line. We’ve seen this time and time again.”Ben Nelmes, chief executive of New Automotive, said that van makers of all stripes are under pressure because there is too little demand to use all their factory capacity.“Most van makers still are making less profit on their electric van sales than they are on their diesel van sales,” said Nelmes. “They are doing everything they can to boost their margins.”The vans used for a few years by the big fleets will eventually hit the secondhand market, giving sole traders electric options. For those who actually drive the vans, there is little appetite to switch back once they have had a go.“This is so much easier to drive,” said Jordane Roach, an Openreach engineer demonstrating how to wire up a broadband connection. “It’s so much better. I’d never go back to a diesel.”Explore more on these topicsElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsAutomotive industryGreenhouse gas emissionsMotoring (Technology)Motoring (Money)featuresShareReuse this content"

The announcement quelled concerns the offensive would restart on Saturday and gave more space for diplomacy, but did not solve the root cause of the conflict between the two sides.Fighting over three contested neighbourhoods inAleppoin early January led to a sweeping government offensive in which the SDF lost the majority of its territory in the country in a matter of days.The ceasefire was meant to give time for the SDF to implement a 14-point plan with the Syrian government under which the Kurdish militia would disband and its soldiers integrate into the Syrian army.If the SDF did not implement the agreement, Damascus would resume its offensive and push toward the last strongholds of the SDF in Hasakeh, and the Kurdish-majority areas of Qamishli and Kobane.The two sides spent the ceasefire preparing for the eventuality of a full-scale war.SDF forces built up in Kurdish-majority areas while its leaders called for a general mobilisation among residents there, distributing weapons to those willing to take up arms.View image in fullscreenA protester at a demonstration in the northern Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaimaniyah to oppose the deployment of Syrian government forces in formerly Kurdish-led areas in Syria.Photograph: Shwan Mohammed/AFP/Getty ImagesSyrian government soldiers and tanks streamed towards the frontline, hoping to bring the north-east under the control of Damascus. “Soon we will be in Hasakeh and then Qamishli, God willing,” a soldier said on Thursday while standing guard as logistics convoys moved towards the Hasakeh front.As soldiers waited on the battlefield, Syrian officials and regional powers were engaged in a bout of diplomacy to avoid resuming the war. The SDF leader, Mazloum Abdi, went to Iraqi Kurdistan for the second time, where he met the US envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, who has been mediating talks between the SDF and Damascus.Abdi also spoke on the phone to the Syrian foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani, which was followed by an agreement allowing the safe transfer of SDF fighters from a besieged prison in Syrian government-controlled territory.“Ideally, the transfer of Daesh [Islamic State] prisoners from Syria should take place. While this is happening, the existing non-conflict environment needs to be maintained,” the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said on Friday, referring to the US-facilitated transfer of more than 7,000 suspected IS members and fighters from Syria to Iraq.Disputes between the two sides remain even with the ceasefire extension. The 14-point plan would bring an end to the autonomous Syrian Kurdish project, and Kurdish leaders seemed to struggle to come to terms with their losses over the last two weeks, which has left them with little leverage.The SDF went from controlling nearly a third of the country, including its oil fields, breadbasket and key infrastructure, to just a few cities. The deal on the table would turn the Kurdish force, which not so long ago boasted of being 100,000 strong, into essentially a municipality overseeing a local police force running a few Kurdish cities in the north-east of the country.Abdi, long known as a pragmatic figure among the SDF, has signalled he would be willing to implement the deal.He is struggling, however, to gain consensus within the SDF.If he is unable to unify the SDF and implement the agreement with the government, then the alternative would be war. Damascus has made it clear it would no longer tolerate non-state armed groups and is determined to unify the country under its flag, either through negotiations or force.The US, which has backed the Kurdish force for the past decade, has made its support for Damascus clear, with Barrack saying the SDF’s role as the anti-IS force in Syria had now been filled by the Syrian government.View image in fullscreenThe president of Iraqi Kurdistan, Nechirvan Barzani (right), meets the head of the SDF), Mazloum Abdi, in Erbil.Photograph: Iraqi Kurdistan Presidency/AFP/Getty ImagesThe US military has already began transferring IS prisoners from Kurdish territories to prevent any escapes ahead of a renewed war with Damascus. Once IS prisoners are secured, there will be little strategic interests left for a US military presence in north-east Syria.Even if Damascus has the military advantage and regional backing, it is still hoping to prevent a war. Its offensive so far has led to relatively few casualties, as the SDF has opted to withdraw from Arab-majority areas such as Raqqa and Deir el-Zour rather than confront the Syrian government.Fighting in Kurdish-majority areas is likely to be more bloody.There is fear among Kurdish civilians of the Syrian government fighters, after government-backedmassacres in Druze-majority Suweida province and in the Alawite-majority Syrian coastlast year.Many residents in Kurdish-majority areas have armed themselves. Kurdish forces have dug in, having prepared for this fight for years, creating a vast subterranean tunnel network to facilitate guerrilla fighting against a better armed force.Damascus is aware that even if it wins the war, it could drive away the Kurds, push the SDF underground and create a insurgency similar to that of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Turkey for years to come.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaIslamic StateAlepponewsShareReuse this content"

Months earlier, doctors had diagnosed him with a rare blood cancer, one that, if untreated, is often a death sentence.In the weeks before the war, Ismail’s family had arranged for him to be transferred to Al-Makassed hospital in Jerusalem, a charitable institution for Palestinians, for specialised care. But the blockade Israel imposed on Gaza after Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack that triggered the conflict meant Ismail could not leave the territory.He is now one ofthousands of cancer patients in Gazawho the UN says require medical evacuation for urgent treatment.The Guardian has spoken to dozens of Palestinian cancer patients trapped in Gaza, where doctors say cancer-related deaths have tripled since the war began, as Israel continues to hinder patients from leaving and restricts the entry of chemotherapy drugs. While some patients have left, they are far outnumbered by those deemed in medical need who have not. The Israeli NGO Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) says evacuation routes to third countries have become “near impossible” to operate, especially since the closure of the Rafah crossing in May 2024, and that Israel is failing to meet its obligation to provide medical care to populations under its control. The crossing between Gaza and Egypt is due to open for traffic next week, the Palestinian technocratic committee leader, Ali Shaath, said on Thursday, although Israel did not immediately confirm that would be the case.View image in fullscreenIsmail Abu Naji is covered in painful swollen, bleeding lesions caused by a rare blood cancer.Photograph: Family handout/The GuardianWith even basic painkillers having become unattainable under the blockade, there is little else Ismail’s mother, Aya Mohammed Abu Hani, who is living in a tent in a school,can do but try to ease his pain, gently dabbing the wounds with a cloth soaked in salt water.“Ismail’s life before the war was already difficult, and it has become even harsher since. He cannot sleep due to severe pain, high fever and cries constantly,” she told the Guardian. “We were displaced many times from one place to another, which worsened his condition. I could not even provide him with enough clothing. Before the war, hospitals were able to offer antibiotics and painkillers. But now, they can’t even provide a single painkiller.”Israeli airstrikes on hospitals have reduced the Palestinian healthcare system to ruins. In March 2025,Israel destroyed Gaza’s only specialised cancer treatment hospital, the territory’s sole provider of oncology care. Since then, doctors have been pushed into makeshift clinics, operating with almost no resources, including the tools needed for diagnosis.“As for cancer diagnosis, we have reached an extremely critical stage,” said Dr Saleh Sheikh al-Eid, a specialist physician in haematology and oncology at Nasser medical complex in Khan Younis. “Basic diagnostic tools, such as biopsy needles, are unavailable. Patients come to us with obvious cancerous masses, yet we lack the means to take samples and examine them. As a result, we have lost many patients without even being able to properly diagnose or treat them.”Despite recent ceasefire agreements intended to facilitate the entry of aid, essential medical supplies remain restricted.“We receive repeated warnings from the pharmacy that essential chemotherapy drugs are close to running out,” al-Eid says. “The resources available to us do not exceed 5% of those available in hospitals in the West Bank, and in many cases they are almost nonexistent.”Living with a cancer diagnosis and the uncertainty of survival is, in itself, a traumatic experience. Going through such an ordeal while trapped in a war zone, cut off from essential medication and under constant Israeli bombardment, can be unbearable. While airstrikes have slowed since the US-brokered ceasefire in October,they have not stopped. Israeli forces have killed at least 466 Palestinians in the last three months.All the while, friends and family members of cancer patients have died during the bombardments.The pain of losing her granddaughter, killed in an Israeli bombardment, accompanies Fathiya Abu Frieh, 65, every day. Abu Frieh, who has been living in a tent in the city of Deir al-Balah since the start of the war, was diagnosed with uterine cancer last year.“A short while ago, I lost consciousness because I had nothing to eat for breakfast,’’ she says. ‘‘The treatment I am currently receiving is nothing more than an anaesthetic injection – just enough to keep me alive.”View image in fullscreenFathiya Abu Frieh receiving basic treatment for her uterine cancer.Photograph: Amjed Tantesh/The GuardianIslam Al-Naour, a 40-year-old with testicular cancer, is living displaced in Gaza City. “Due to my weakened immune system, even minor illnesses had a severe impact on my health.“Life became difficult even for a healthy person, so imagine what it is like for a cancer patient like me, forced to carry water, set up tents, and secure them during harsh weather conditions.”Before the war, hundreds of Palestinian cancer patients had been authorised to receive medical care outside Gaza because of the territory’s inadequate facilities. Dozens of patients who had been in Jerusalem for chemotherapy were then left in a state of limbo,as Israeli authorities threatened to send them backto Gaza.In March 2024, the Guardian visited the Augusta Victoria hospital in Jerusalem where at least five children from Gaza were receiving cancer treatment. Today, all those children are dead.The World Health Organization saysabout 10,700 Palestinians have been evacuated to 30 countries for specialised care since October 2023, nearly a quarter of them cancer patients. But according to UN figures, there are more than 11,000 cancer patients in Gaza requiring treatment outside the territory. Aid agencies say Israel continues to obstruct their evacuation, in breach of obligations that Israel’s high court has previously recognised.According to health officials in Gaza,there are about 4,000 peoplewith official referrals for treatment to third countries who are unable to cross the border. The WHO says 900 people, including children and cancer patients,have already died while waiting for evacuation.PHRI and partner organisations filed a petition in November to the Israeli high court of justice, demanding the immediate reinstatement of medical evacuations for critically ill patients from Gaza to hospitals in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.“Since the closure of Rafah crossing in May 2024, evacuation routes to third countries have become nearly impossible to operate,” the NGO said. “Under the Israeli and international law, and according to the high court of justice, Israel is legally obligated to ensure access to medical care for populations under its effective control. Current restrictions on patient movement violate this duty to protect the health and prevent avoidable death, given its full control over the movement of patients out of Gaza.“This is not a political or security decision – it is a basic obligation to save human life.”Cogat, the Israeli agency charged with the administration of Gaza, denies restricting medical evacuations from Gaza.“Whenever a country submits a request to evacuate a patient, regardless of the patient’s underlying medical condition, the request is examined and approved subject to security screening,” it said, adding that “dozens and even hundreds of residents have been evacuated each week”.View image in fullscreenAya Mohammed Abu Hani applying a saline solution to Ismail’s sores.

I don’t know if I am going to go back or not. I fought very hard through the Israeli court to get permission to receive treatment in Jerusalem or the West Bank. I was denied the permit five times, but at the end, the Israeli judge was fair to me and he insisted that I should be allowed to travel and to receive treatment in the West Bank.“I hope I will be the first of thousands of cancer patients in Gaza who will be allowed to travel and receive proper treatment. I hope I am the one who opened the door for many to be treated as a human being.”Until the last moment, the Israeli state sought to prevent Abu Ajwa’s evacuation, submitting a last-minute request to delay the implementation of the judge’s decision while he was already en route to the West Bank; a request the court rejected.“The attempt to delay implementation of the court’s judgment illustrates the state’s insistence on maintaining a sweeping and unlawful policy at the expense of the most vulnerable,’’ Gisha states.‘‘This case,” Gisha adds, “constitutes, in practice, an initial and important crack in this cruel policy, which must be abolished immediately.”Inside one of the hundreds of tents at al-Shati Martyrs school, as cold weather anda storm rage outside, Ismail’s mother prepares another saline compress to treat Ismail’s lesions, while trying to distract him from the pain by handing him a notebook and coloured pencils.“As a mother, it is unbearable to see my young child suffer without being able to help,” she says.“I wish I had the power to ease his suffering,” she adds, “to give him the right to live without pain.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineCancerHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tying traditional cotton threads around their wrists, they promise to guard the land beneath them – and then they ask for protection.“Our culture has been preserved for thousands of years,” says Ati Quigua, an Indigenous leader. “We are a peaceful community, but now violence is coming to our land.”The Arhuaco are profoundly spiritual, with a belief system centred on worshipping and defending the Earth. They descend from the Tayrona, an ancient civilisation brutally subjugated by Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century. The survivors retreated to the upper valleys ofColombia’s Sierra Nevada, the world’s highest coastal mountain range, but in the centuries since they have endured waves of intrusion – from settlers carving up their lands to Catholic missionaries who tried to quash their traditions.Now another force has reached their mountain, and the Arhuaco fear it could lead to their final erasure.View image in fullscreenAti Quigua says local people have been put under curfew by violent groups who want to use their land as a drug-trafficking corridor.Photograph: Harriet Barber“All of the actors have arrived: the paramilitaries, the guerrillas, the drug traffickers,” says Quigua. “They are taking control of our areas and interfering in our local assemblies. They set curfews, telling us when we can and cannot walk in the territory. They want to use it as drug-trafficking corridors.”‘Cocaine, gold and meat’: how Colombia’s Amazon became big business for crime networksRead moreAcross Colombia,violence is surging. Illegal groups are battling for control of the country’s illicit economies, including key drug-trafficking routes and coca-growing regions. The2016 peace dealwith the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) has also begun to unravel, allowing splinter factions to move into the vacuum it left behind. The scramble for gold and other illicit minerals has only deepened the bloodshed.In the first three months of 2025, the number of violent incidents in Colombiaincreased by 45%compared with the same period last year.Recent attackshave seen scores killed and injured by car bombs and drone strikes across the country. The government has struggled to quell the violence, particularly in remote rural areas.Few places illustrate this vulnerability more clearly than the Sierra Nevada. Despite its UnescoBiosphere Reserve of Man and Humanitystatus and recognition as themost irreplaceable ecosystemon Earth in the journal Science, the mountain range has become a strategic prize for traffickers, who exploit its limited state presence, porous borders and routes leading directly to the Caribbean Sea.For the Arhuaco, the consequences have been immediate and devastating. Quigua says non-state armed groups have attacked their sacred capital, and in other territories “burned all our traditional work, our sacred objects”. “It is a spiritual violence, a violence to gain a foothold in our territory,” she says.Dwiarinmacku Alfaro Kwimi, a 22-year-old spiritual leader, describes the escalating violence as a war against nature. “The territory gives us the nourishment we need to survive,” he says. “We are connected to every living being – plants, animals, the sun – in the land. We must defend it.”View image in fullscreenDwiarinmacku Alfaro Kwimi, left, and Ati Quigua. They say armed groups have burned sacred objects and threaten their connection to the land.Photograph: Harriet BarberThese warnings have been heard by international rights groups, with the UN reporting that the five Indigenous groups living in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta – the Kogui, Wiwa, Kankuamo, Arhuaco and Ette Naka – face “physical and cultural extinction”. Their combined population is approximately 54,700 people.Scott Campbell, Colombia’s representative for the UN high commissioner for human rights, says this risk is “an ongoing tragedy that we can and must prevent”.“Violent actions of non-state armed groups against theIndigenous peoplesin the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mean they cannot travel within their territory, hunt or carry out their ancestral practices in their sacred places,” he says.Campbell says armed groups are using unconventional explosive devices and installing anti-personnel mines in the Sierra Nevada, posing an additional risk. Members of the Wiwa community have been injured by these devices in recent months, he adds.View image in fullscreenArhuaco people in Nabusimake, in Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Armed groups have started kidnapping children to use as informants or fighters.Photograph: Raúl Arboleda/AFP/Getty ImagesHundreds have been forcibly displaced in the past two years, and hundreds more confined to their homes. Indigenous leaders say assassination attempts have increased, whileCinep/Programme for Peace, a Colombian research organisation, reports that some victims have beentortured, dismemberedand displayed in public spaces in a bid to instil collective terror. Cinep also reportedclashes between two armed groupsin June last year, which involved hundreds of fighters and led to the confinement of at least 400 Wiwa families, the killing of a 16-year-old and the kidnapping of a 15-year-old.Quigua says that when 200 people were recently displaced, those who spoke out were targeted. “One man was given hours to leave. The armed group said they would kill him if he said anything more,” she says.Luz Helena Izquierdo, an Arhuaco elder, says paramilitary groups have warned community leaders “to be careful because they are clearing the territory”. “They are killing people who are not welcome,” she says.Another tactic is also now being deployed: as tensions escalate, armed groups are turning tochildren to fill their ranks. TheColombian ombudsman’s office reported43 alerts of recruitment registered in 2021, 384 cases of forced recruitment in 2023, and651 cases in 2024.View image in fullscreenA ceremonial hut in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The Arhuaco are a profoundly spiritual people.Photograph: Harriet BarberIt is a figure experts say vastly underestimates the real toll: many families stay silent, afraid of the consequences if they speak out. And Indigenous groups have been the hardest hit, accounting for almost half of the UN’s verified cases.“They have started taking our children, recruiting them,” says Quigua. “Our people have seen some who left in the mountains in camouflage, with rifles. It’s a cultural invasion.”The children are used as informants, tasked with surveillance, intimidation and upholding the group’s laws in her community, or fighters – often as frontline soldiers to protect the more experienced members.Sexual violenceis also rife.“The groups have learned how effective children can be in consolidating their control over territory,” Campbell says. “Especially the Indigenous kids, they’re excellent scouts, intelligence-gatherers, they know the turf really well.”The battle for survival is not just being fought against the armed trafficking groups – mining interests are also at play.View image in fullscreenIndigenous people say their water sources, such as this lagoon, considered sacred, have become contaminated due to mining in the region.Photograph: Harriet Barber“There are constantly new projects: copper mining, farming palm oil, building hydroelectric dams. They even want to mine gold on our sacred sites,” says Quigua. “The landscape deterioration has already begun – they have wounded our mountain.”That wound is borne out in the data. According to the National Mining Agency, there are 124 active mining titles and 88 overlapping mining applications within the Sierra Nevada’s ancestral territory boundary, known as the Black Line. The agency says it “fully recognises that mining activities in ancestral territories represent a challenge requiring a careful balance between the country’s economic development and comprehensive protection of the fundamental rights of ethnic communities” and follows Colombian law.View image in fullscreenTwo Wayuu women, Luz Mila Uriana, 26, and Maria Elena Aguilar Uriana, 56, who say their lands have been destroyed by mining projects.Photograph: Harriet BarberIndigenous leaders say they have faced death threats for speaking out against environmental destruction, and at least three have survived recent assassination attempts.Colombia has suffered the highest number of murders of environmental defenders for three years in a row, according toa Global Witness report. “People are afraid. We live in constant fear,” says Quigua. “Colombia is a very dangerous place for those who defend it.”But the communities of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta say that if they do not speak out now, they could soon cease to exist. Quigua says: “We are convinced that, if not, within two generations, our future is over.”Explore more on these topicsColombiaSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanIndigenous peoplesConflict and armsConservation and indigenous peopleSexual violenceAmericasLand rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

UK law says that there is no safe limit for exposure to the mineral.The parent said: “The bottles of coloured sand looked extremely similar to ones I had seen on a news report of play sand recalled in Australia.“I was concerned enough to buy a set at Hobbycraft and send it to an accredited lab for testing. Three of the five colours came back positive for fibrous tremolite asbestos.”She alerted Hobbycraft, which withdrew the product from sale but declined to issue a recall notice. “I am getting increasingly upset thinking that kids are being exposed unnecessarily,” she said.Hobbycraft said that no UK authority had warned of a risk and that there was no evidence of harm to customers.However, a spokesperson said: “As a precaution, we have voluntarily removed the product from sale while we carry out independent testing … We will update customers as soon as we are in a position to do so.”A government source criticised Hobbycraft’s response. “Parents are right to be concerned by this,” the source said. “Officials are investigating, but there’s no good reason why Hobbycraft shouldn’t recall this themselves, given the evidence.”The issue highlights post-Brexit gaps in health and safety law, which leave authorities unable to issue recalls without hard evidence of harm to health.The so-called “precautionary principle”, abolished when product safety legislation was redrafted after Brexit, allowed the government to restrict products thought to pose a serious threat to health, without having to acquire scientific evidence.Campaigners, including the British Occupational Hygiene Society, have criticised the government for refusing to reinstate powers to withdraw potentially hazardous goods when product safety laws were redrafted last year. Current rules rely on exporting countries toalert authorities to problem products.“We know that there is no way that every product landing on British doorsteps can be tested individually for safety and the labels can’t be made to tell the truth, so, it was a missed opportunity for the government,” said Prof Kevin Bampton, CEO of the British Occupational Hygiene Society.“We do have the precautionary principle for the environment, which means that bats and newts in some ways have better protection than people working in Britain and, potentially, our children.”The Department for Business and Trade rejected the claims.“We have some of the most robust product safety laws in the world and any product being put on the UK market by businesses must meet our strict criteria,” said a spokesperson.According to the British Occupational Hygiene Society, the health risk to children who played with the contaminated sand is likely to be low, as there were only small quantities in the bottles.However, Bampton warned that the long-term risks of exposure to asbestos remain little understood. He said: “This issue should be a wake-up call for regulatory change, so governments can be proactive, act fast and protect human health from risks before they protect profit.”Explore more on these topicsRetail industryAsbestosChildrenToysnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the extent of the outrage increased sharply last year when water companies were allowed to increase bills to pay for upgrades after decades of underinvestment.Ofwat, the regulator in England and Wales, saidwater companies could increase bills by 36%between 2025 and 2030. Most of that increase came last April – prompting the surge of complaints.Water companies are braced for a further backlash this week when the next bill increases – including extra to account for inflation – are announced as part of that five-year plan.Complaints increased about every large water provider, according to the CCW, which handles issues that have not been resolved by the companies themselves. Southern Water had the most per customer, followed by Severn Trent and Thames Water, according to analysis of utilities with more than 1 million customers.Mike Keil, the CCW’s chief executive, said: “The sustained rise in complaints to CCW reflects not only people’s worries about being able to afford increases in their water bill, but also confusion and concern around what they are getting in return for their money. Customers need to see evidence their money is improving services in the here and now, as well as dealing with the longer-term challenges.”graphBy far the biggest reason for complaints during 2025 was the lack of affordability of bills, according to the CCW’s data. The body said such concerns added to the evidence in favour ofintroducing a lower “social tariff”across England and Wales to help poorer customers.“The postcode lottery created by existing water company social tariff schemes needs to be replaced by fairer and better targeted support,” Keil said.A spokesperson for the industry body Water UK said: “We understand that bill increases are never welcome and recognise they are difficult for many households. That’s why water companies are more than doubling the help available, with £4.1bn in financial support available over the next five years for those customers that need it.”Public anger over bill increase has also been fuelled by the perception that water companies have paid out billions of pounds in dividends to investors, while also awarding large pay packets to bosses despitebans on bonuses at some firms.MPs on the public accounts committee on Thursday grilled executives from Ofwat and the government’s environment department about pay for water bosses, after the Guardian revealed thatbosses at Yorkshire WaterandWessex Waterhad received previously undisclosed pay from other companies in the same group.Anna Dixon, the Labour MP for Shipley, said the regulators should “crack down” on what she described as “water companies evading the bonus ban”. Lloyd Hatton, the Labour MP for South Dorset, criticised Ofwat and other water regulators for not policing water companies’ pay disclosures.Hatton asked the Ofwat bosses: “Why is it we wait for a report in the Guardian newspaper to understand exactly how water companies are operating and how they use those complex corporate structures to put extra pay behind their bosses?”England is the only country in the world with a fully privatised water system. The government controls water supply in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while much ofWalesis supplied by the not-for-profit Dŵr Cymru.Explore more on these topicsWater industryWater billsUtilitiesConsumer affairsConsumer rightsCorporate governanceRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content"

Looking back, he asks what it means to lose parents who never showed you loveMark HaddonSat 24 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTShareWhen I see washed-out photographs of English life in the 60s and 70s – cardiganed grandmothers eating roadside picnics beside Morris Minors, pale men sunbathing in shoes and socks on stripy deckchairs, Raleigh Choppers and caged budgerigars and faux leather pouffes – I feel a wave of what can’t properly be called nostalgia, because the last thing I’d want is to return to that age and those places where I was often profoundly unhappy and from which I’d have been desperate to escape if escape had been a possibility. Why then this longing, this echo of some remembered comfort?Is it that, as children, we live inside a bubble of focused attention that gives everything inside a memorable fierceness? The way one could lie, for example, on a lawn and look down into the jungle of the grass to see earwigs and woodlice lumbering between the pale green trunks like brontosauri lumbering between the ferns and gingkos of the Late Jurassic. The way a rucked bedspread could become a mountain range stretched below the wings of a badly painted Airfix Spitfire. Or do objects, in their constancy, provide consolation in a world where adults are unpredictable and distant and unloving?I lived, for the first 15 years of my life, with my parents and Fiona, my younger sister, at 288a Main Road, New Duston, on the outskirts of Northampton. Dad didn’t design it but it was an architect’s house nevertheless, a hint of Scandinavian modernism in the external wood panelling, the semi-open-plan ground floor and the boxy glass lobby. Hinged, teak double doors separated the dining room and a living room dominated by an uncarpeted staircase with open risers. The chimney breast was a broad, floor-to-ceiling stack of chunky sandstone blocks straight out of The Flintstones.Under the stairs stood a Philips radiogram. If I listen carefully I can still hear King Size! by André Previn’s jazz trio, Paul Simon, and Play Bach No 2by the Jacques Loussier Trio. What I can’t hear, beyond the occasional outburst – “Jesus wept!”, “Wait till your father gets home” – are conversations. It wasn’t so much that no one spoke, it was that no onetalked. I never heard an adult tell or ask another adult something that really mattered. Maybe I wasn’t listening very hard but I don’t think anything was being said that was worth listening to, certainly nothing as interesting as the story of the Apollo space programme or the lyrics of “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard”. The most important things happened inside my head and these were not things that one shared with other people. Did similar things go on in other people’s heads? How was it possible to know?View image in fullscreen‘Mum on a beach’ in 1960.I have a vivid childhood memory of being woken up by the sound of screaming on the other side of the wall. My sister was having a nightmare. I got out of bed and walked into her room. Mum was standing there at a loss for what to do. Fiona had stopped screaming by now. She opened her eyes, sat and shuffled herself up the bed so that she could lean against the padded, plastic headboard. I assumed she was awake. We heard footsteps outside. Mum said, “That’s Daddy coming to see how you are.” My sister screamed at the top of her voice, “No! He’s got the knife!” Fiona would carry on having this dream – Dad chasing her with a knife – for the next 45 years, and it would only stop when his Alzheimer’s became unmanageable and he went into a care home.Like Fiona, I had recurrent nightmares as a child. In one I was standing at a crossroads on a ruined, post-apocalyptic plain in falling light while giant insects walked relentlessly towards me from all four points of the compass. In another I had been flushed down a toilet wearing an antique diving suit – waxed canvas, lead boots, a spherical brass helmet with hinged, circular portholes – and was drowning after becoming jammed in a narrow bend of piping.There is a photo of Mum on a beach in either Devon or Cornwall, taken by Dad. They were either just married or about to be married. She looks stunning: fuchsia lipstick, freckles, simple white earrings like peppermint Mentos rhyming with a simple white shoulderless dress or swimming costume. She radiates something I never saw her radiate in real life, nor in any later photos, even those in which she is smiling and appears happy. It’s partly those freckles, which she came to hate, which she covered in foundation and which rarely came out in summer because she avoided the sun for fear it would trigger a migraine. But the real difference is internal. The woman on the beach seems confident about her own beauty and at ease in the world.Maybe the picture’s deceptive, but I think that soon after it was taken some kind of light died in her. She had a bawdy side. She enjoyed salacious gossip and a Benny Hill double entendre. She sometimes wore a fun wig to go to dinner dances and could kick back in the right company with a Cinzano Rosso in one hand and a Consulate in the other. But these felt like distractions. Was it postnatal depression? Was it some pre-existing sadness temporarily held in abeyance by romance? Was there, from early on, some uncrossable gulf between them?My sister once asked Mum, ‘Why does Dad hate me so much?’‘You have to remember,’ said Mum, ‘that he only wanted one child’Shortly after my first adult novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, was published I said in an interview that I’d been an anxious and depressed child. It seemed an unremarkable comment. I knew many people who could say the same. Consequently I forgot having said it until I rang my parents a couple of weeks later and, to my surprise, it was Dad who answered the phone. He said that my mother was “crying herself to sleep and waking up crying in the morning” as a result of something I’d said in an interview. I pressed him for more details then told him to put Mum on the phone so we could talk about it. Dad disappeared for a few moments then said, “I’m afraid she’s weeping too much to come to the phone right now.”Mum voted Tory all her life. She was an ardent Brexiteravant la lettre, detested the idea of being connected to France by the Channel tunnel and swore she would never use it. She believed that working women were the cause of unemployment and was happy to tell anyone this, including a female friend and neighbour who had a full-time job. People with strong Northampton accents, anyone overweight, people with tattoos all evoked either mocking laughter or a shudder of theatrical disgust. She couldn’t abide men with beards, or the Welsh. She had a “golliwog” fridge magnet and referred to gay men as “lovely boys”. When an old friend of theirs started to suffer from Alzheimer’s she bemoaned the fact that his sister wasn’t helping out because “she’s too busy having chemotherapy”.She was frightened, of change and difference, of pain and discomfort, of decay and disease. One of the reasons her health was so poor in her final years was that she refused to listen to medical advice. She never did the exercises recommended by physios. She continued smoking and drinking. I was with her when she was being clerked in after one of her many ambulance rides to hospital. The young doctor asked if she took any exercise. She thought for a moment before saying, “It was a long walk to school”.She liked cleanness and tidiness and predictability. Until she was forced to move into the assisted living apartment she maintained a garden that was as clean and tidy as the interior of the house. When we had a cat she would put folded cloths in its favourite sitting spots to protect the furniture and would sometimes sneak up on it from behind and spray its back end with Marks & Spencer vaginal deodorant, something the cat did not enjoy. She didn’t read books. She didn’t listen to music.Mum had no interest in my writing. With a couple of minor exceptions she never spoke about it and certainly never asked questions about it. The one book of mine she read was Curious Incident while on holiday with Dad shortly after it came out. Her review in its entirety: “I thought there was too much swearing in it. Then I had to drive around Menorca in a car with your father and it seemed quite realistic.”In the years before Curious, and for quite a few years after, she made it clear that she would prefer me to have a “proper job”. I pressed her once to be specific and say what kind of job I could do that would make her happy. She thought for a while, trying hard to combine our two very different world views, then suggested that I could perhaps “design tools to help disabled people”.View image in fullscreenThe family house at 288a Main Road, New Duston. Illustration by Mark Haddon.Dad was an academic failure, proud of the fact that he earned one point for an English paper because he managed to write his name at least. 18 Cranbrook Road, where he grew up, was not a bookish household. There was a Bible, a prayer book and eight volumes of the Newnes’ Pictorial Knowledge presumably bought in instalments from a door-to-door salesman. Other than that it was the Sun and the Radio Times. He was, however, a prodigious sportsman. He learned to swim by watching Johnny Weissmuller in the Tarzan films. He played water polo, he sprinted, he hurdled, he swam, he boxed, he played rugby. He was also a fine draughtsman. After national service he went on to set up his own architectural partnership, designing buildings for the Open University, Carlsberg and Ikea, riding out the building slump of the 70s by designing abattoirs. In consequence we ate a lot of free pork pies as children and Dad took my subsequent vegetarianism, I suspect, as something of a personal insult.He was a big man with a short fuse.My sister once asked Mum, “Why does Dad hate me so much?”“You have to remember,” said Mum, “that he only wanted one child.”She would later say to Donna, one of her favourite care assistants, during one of the daily visits in which they shared gossip, Silk Cut and honey-roasted cashews from Waitrose, that she, too, only wanted one child. In truth, I don’t think she wanted children at all, but she had a lifelong fear of being different, of standing out, and while a woman who was unable to have children of her own would have been an object of sympathetic pity in their circles in Northampton in the early 60s, a woman who chose not to have children would have been eccentric at best and a pariah at worst.We were, I think, too much hard work. “I don’t know how you cope with three children,” she once admitted to Fiona. “I couldn’t cope with two.” I walked my sister the mile to school every day from the ages of six (me) and five (her). Dad made us breakfast and Mum stayed in bed until we had left the house. Mum also had a weekly cleaner, something unheard of among our friends. Dad would take us both to church on Sundays and then to his parents afterwards, leaving Mum at home on her own. On Saturdays and during school holidays he would regularly take Fiona to the golf club and the rugby club while he trained or played and she was looked after by Snowy the groundsman so that Mum had only one child to look after at home. That didn’t mean she was parenting as such. I would usually be in the garden, alone in my room or at a friend’s house. Often she would have cluster headaches, take Solpadeine and spend long periods lying down in a darkened bedroom.I think Mum and Dad embraced the idea of me as a freakishly clever child because it lessened their need to understand meBefore Dad died and Mum had the stroke that would put her in a nursing home I would regularly drive to Northampton to visit both of them. Dad spent the greater part of his time sitting in the armchair in his room. On one occasion the only other male resident of the memory unit picked up a sewing box from a sideboard and, for reasons known only to himself, walked into Dad’s room and tried to brain him with it. Dad floored him with a single punch, telling his favourite care assistant Judith afterwards, “I’ve still got it”. It was Judith who told me that the digital picture frame I’d brought, far from entertaining him or aiding his memory, was confusing him. He found it difficult to distinguish between people who had really come into his room and people whose pictures appeared on the little screen. In particular he kept thinking that a younger version of Mum had been visiting. “That woman’s been in again, coming on to me,” he said to Judith on one occasion. “She doesn’t stand a fucking chance.”The visits to Mum were harder work. She would often greet me by pointing out that I was losing more hair, and pay me barbed compliments about being unexpectedly smart if I was wearing a collared shirt. She asked what my children were up to and this would occupy us for a few minutes. Mostly we talked about her life. It was not a life she was enjoying. News and politics we avoided where possible. I was glad when there was some financial, practical or bureaucratic problem I could help her sort out. I think she found me boring mostly. Sometimes she would say, “Don’t look so glum”, or, “Entertain me”. She cried every time I left and clung on to me when I gave her a brief hug. I was embarrassed by how uncomfortable I found this and how difficult it was to respond in kind. I’m sure, deep down, it was because I had no memory of being hugged by her, no memory of Mum saying she loved us, no memory of her showing us real affection as children, and because there was a good deal of self-pity in her sadness. But this is just post-rationalisation. What I felt at the time was disgust, of a kind I’ve never felt about anyone else.To say that I was the favourite would imply actual liking. I certainly got preferential treatment on account of the double blessing of being both the older child and a boy. Dad allowed Mum to hit Fiona, for example, but not me. She did so regularly, once taking down Fiona’s pants at a bus stop to smack her when she was seven years old.View image in fullscreen‘I had recurrent nightmares as a child.’ Illustration by Mark Haddon.I think Mum and Dad embraced the idea of me as a freakishly clever child because it lessened their need to understand me. I was off in my own world of encyclopaedias and star charts, a world whose language was alien to them and in which I would know best how to look after myself. In contrast they treated Fiona as an encumbrance, and because she wasn’t as academic as me she was unable, in those early years, to earn the affirmation at school that she was missing at home.When, many years later, Fiona was taken into Kingston hospital with meningitis and was awaiting the results of a lumbar puncture to find out whether it was viral or bacterial (the latter can be rapidly fatal) she rang home, but Mum said they couldn’t visit because “Your father has golf in the morning”. They carried on finding reasons not to visit for the entire week she was in hospital.Neither Mum nor Dad went to her degree show when Fiona got a distinction in her MA in production design for film and television, and when she later got a job at the BBC Mum’s reaction to the news was, “You’ve already got a job looking after three children.”The last words Mum spoke to Fiona in person were, “I’ve never believed a word you’ve said.”We assume it’s hard when a loved and loving parent dies, but it can be just as hard when you lose a parent whom you don’t love and who never loved you. When Mum and Dad died it was a relief for me. For my sister it was the moment when she knew for certain that she would never hear them say sorry.What does it mean, the injunction not to speak ill of the dead? Which dead? For how long after their passing are we meant to hold our tongues? And doesspeaking illmean telling lies or telling the truth?Mum was obsessed with what other people might think of her. Someone in their village was knighted and I addressed my next letter home to “Lord and Lady Haddon”, not realising how upset she would be in case someone would think they were mocking their newly elevated neighbours. Fit in, don’t make a fuss, don’t complain or rebel or seem unnecessarily different. Propriety was everything. They bought a large antique 18th-century oil painting of an anonymous local gentleman in a heavy gold frame. To some people Mum joked that it was one of her ancestors. To others she said nothing and let them assume precisely that. Like Dad, she’d risen a long way and found herself in a place that never quite felt like solid ground. She assumed other people would judge her in the way that she judged them, by the way she spoke, the way she dressed, the cream carpets, the framed maps of the county.I don’t think it ever occurred to her that people might look at her and ask, “Was she kind? Did she care about other people? Did she love her children?”This is an edited extract from Leaving Home: A Memoir in Full Colour by Mark Haddon (Chatto & Windus).

Sign up hereGwilym MumfordSat 24 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 02.02 ESTShareFew directors currently working merit the title of ‘cult hero’ more thanBen Wheatley. Over a 15-year-plus career, the British film-maker has dabbled in just about every cinematic genre and style imaginable: psychedelic horror (A Field in England, In the Earth), grimy video nasty (Kill List), stylish, gun-toting thrillers (Free Fire), murderous Mike Leigh homages (Down Terrace, Sightseers), literary adaptations (Rebecca, High-Rise), and even a whopping great studio monster movie (Meg 2: The Trench).Wheatley’s latest film further cements that cult status. Bulk is a defiantly DIY sci-fi-noir-paranoid-thriller hybrid, starring Sam Riley as an investigative journo tasked with rescuing a scientist from his own malfunctioning multi-dimensional creation. With its handwritten title cards, overdubbed dialogue, sticky-back-plastic special effects and general vibe of formal experimentation, Bulk exists a world away from most modern film-making. Even it’s delivery method feels far from the churn of the mainstream: instead of a standard release, the film is in the middle of a tour of independent cinemas across the UK and Ireland – tonight in Liverpool, tomorrow Lewes, with Dublin and Cork on the horizon (you can seek out your nearest screeninghere).So who better than Wheatley to programme that arthouse-cinema staple, a movie marathon, for the Guide? We tasked him with putting together a 12-hour, backside-numbing, brain-melting series on a single loose theme. He has responded by selecting eight films that inspired Bulk in their paranoid/sci-fi/noir stylings and general ability to work magic with limited resources. Though, says Ben, “I’d lead with the paranoid, sci-fi, noir angle rather than the limited resources. ‘Come to the limited-resources all-nighter’ doesn’t sound appealing!”Not that it needs to be an all-nighter. “Don’t start at midnight – everyone would be knackered,” Ben cautions. Instead his preference would be to make a start bright and early at 7am – “the best part of the day”.The marathon beginsView image in fullscreenBe scared …  clockwise from top left: Scanners, Tetsuo, Le Samourai, and Alphaville.Composite: MGM/Ronald Grant/Alamy7.00 am–Alphaville(1965)Secret agent Lemmy Caution navigates a technocratic dictatorship in Jean-Luc Godard’s pioneering New Wave sci-fi noir“It’s been a big influence on me for many years. I first saw it on Moviedrome, Alex Cox’s Sunday night BBC show that aired double bills of movies, which is where a lot of my early esoteric influences come from. Conceptually it’s very bold – it’s set in the future but shot in the then-present day of Paris in the 60s. It’s a confidence trick, with Godard looking the audience in the eye and going: ‘This is the future, don’t worry about it’. It’s a noir film, a Bogarde film, a French comic book movie and high science fiction at the same time. Very clever.”Currently streaming onStudioCanal Presents (subscription), andavailable to digitally rent or buy8.40am– Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989)Landmark Japanese body horror in which a salaryman starts sprouting chunks of metal, becoming half man, half machine“You NEED to see this. For me, apart from Kurosawa, this was the big introduction to Japanese cinema. Even though it’s very skilfully made, you could make it yourself, effectively, if you had the chops. And it didn’t seem to compromise the look of it. It had a heavy influence on me, and Bulk, by saying that film-making doesn’t have to be sanctioned by money and studios: you can exist on the fringes of stuff and then explode out into mainstream culture.”Currently streaming on Arrow Video (subscription), andavailable to digitally rent or buy9.48am– Quatermass 2 (1957)Mysterious meteorites strike the earth in the second of Hammer’s 50s sci-fi series“Quatermass 3: The Pit would be the obvious choice here. It is the best one, but I really like Quatermass 2. It’s set in a gloomy Britain. There’s a conspiracy around a gas plant and then there’s this huge blob that consumes organic matter ... it’s quite wild! There’s a paranoid feeling to it that I quite enjoy. And it’s black and white, which all of the films so far have been.”Currently streaming on Amazon Prime (subscription) and Plex (free), andavailable to digitally rent or buy11.14am– Journey to the Beginning of Time (1955)Classic fantasy adventure from the Czech animation wizard Karel Zeman“It’s like a proto Jurassic Park. These kids go down a river on a boat and the further down they travel, the further back in time they go. They see cavemen and dinosaurs and have adventures along the way. All the creatures in it are stop-motion but it’s very, very well done, and you don’t even think about them being stop-motion after a while. It’s just a great adventure movie.”Available on DVD and Blu-ray12.40pm–The Third Man(1949)American writer Holly Martins investigates the death of old pal Harry Lime in postwar Vienna, in perhaps the definitive film noir“It’s a unique movie. There can never be another one like it because of the way it was shot on location in Vienna just after the war. The city had been shot to pieces. It’s beautifully framed, the script is fantastic, it’s got one of the best scores, and the performances are great. An almost perfect movie.”Currently streaming on BBC iPlayer (free), andavailable to digitally rent or buy2.24pm– Primer (2004)Two engineers accidentally discover time travel, and a whole load of trouble, in a mind-bending indie sci-fi“It’s completely befuddling, but that’s not a bad thing. I’ve watched it a dozen times, I’ve seen the diagrams of what it means, and I’m still not quite there with it, but that’s part of the fun. You know it’s slipping away from you but you can’t stop it. I think it’s a masterful film, and a movie that could not have been made inside the system.”Currently streaming on Amazon Prime (subscription), PlutoTV (free) and Arrow Video (subscription), andavailable to digitally rent or buy3.42pm– Scanners (1981)Telekinetic misfits run amok, and explode a head or two, in David Cronenberg’s horror breakthrough“I think I first saw it as a kid on VHS from the local store. It’s a wild film that takes no prisoners. It’s a genre movie that also comes out of the arthouse scene but it’s science fiction, too. It covers a lot of bases.”Currently streaming on Amazon Prime (subscription) and Shudder (subscription), andavailable to digitally rent or buy4.27pm– Le Samourai (1967)Jean Pierre Melville’s effortlessly cool neo-noir, starring Alain Delon as a hunterturnedhunted hitman“I’ve picked this mainly because I always joke with Bulk star Sam Riley that he looks like Alain Delon. It’s genre but also arthouse; low and high culture can exist at the same time. If you’re not already asleep by this point in the marathon, a slow contemplative film about a man walking into quiet rooms might finish you off. Maybe end on Scanners instead!”Currently streaming on Amazon Prime (subscription), andavailable to digitally rent or buy6.13pmFINTo read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletterBen WheatleyAlphavilleThe Third MannewslettersShareReuse this content"

For Naim, it’s a new world opening up, a reason to believe there might be something to be happy about in an otherwise dull new town with his warm yet clueless single mother (Mia Wasikowska). But when Naim sees Ryan engaging in a similar tryst with Hunter (Jeremy Blewitt), the son of the local preacher, he allows his heart to overrule his head and does something he’ll live to regret.Once their secret is out in the open, Ryan and Hunter are forced into a conversion-therapy ritual, led by a mysterious outsider. The boys initially laugh it off, rolling their eyes at his hokum, but something takes ahold of them and once it’s over they realise they’ve been cursed. In the world of Leviticus, the threat looks exactly like the person you desire the most, your No 1 crush wanting to crush your head in. No one else can see it and it only comes to you when you’re alone but it will keep coming until you’re dead.It’s a crafty spin on an often lazily derivative sub-genre – what if your queer desire had a demonic manifestation – and speaks to a familiar deep-rooted fear. It’s not only about the self-destruction such feelings might bring, but also what horrors you might inflict on someone else as well. If the feeling is mutual, you know you’ll be the last face they’ll see before they die, a cruel tragedy warping love to hate. Like It Follows, which it owes a heavy debt to, it can also be viewed as a story about HIV/Aids and the devastation that can come from desire. This feeling might kill us both, but how can we deny it?It lends the film not only a piercing sadness but also a swell of giddy, against-all-odds romance (love might actually tear us apart, but what if it’s worth the risk?). It would be too easy and too of the moment to dwell in the grim trauma of the story but, when ears aren’t being sliced and heads aren’t being decapitated, Chiarella leans into the epic star-crossed swoon of the story. Visually, he’s as adept at capturing the chilly horror of isolation as he is at capturing the soft-hued buzz of togetherness. Bird and Clausen have a sweet first-love chemistry in their scenes together, eyes darting around to check for safety followed by the warm rush of relief when they realise they just might be OK (an illicit bus handjob is as terrifying as any of the nasty attacks). It also makes us root for their survival even if we fear that might not be possible.While Chiarella sets up a formula we know well, he also tries to subvert it. So yes, there might be a scene where the characters try and track down the conversion therapy “healer” but no, it doesn’t go how you expect. He also avoids obvious Bible-thumping horror stereotypes with his portrayal of the town’s religious community, realising there’s something far scarier about vile homophobia emerging from warmer, seemingly well-meaning folk such as Naim’s loving mother – a reliably excellent, if underused, Wasikowska – who is painted as more than just a Carrie’s mother in Carrie-level zealot. Even at a wonderfully concise 86 minutes, the last act runs out of steam a little (as a longtime fan of The Thing, even I got a tad tired of the familiar “No, it’s me!” repetition), but then Chiarella manages to stick the landing quite perfectly. It’s a bold and bittersweet endnote sold with the help of a soaring song choice from Frank Ocean, the kind of punchy last scene that has you insisting others make the next screening (at a festival where so many film-makers don’t know how or when to cut to credits, this counts for a lot). In many increasingly overcrowded fields – trauma horror, curse horror, gay horror,Sundance horror– Leviticus stands tall.Leviticus is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewSundance film festivalFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The siblings, a brother and sister, believed themselves to be descended from the gulls that peppered the island’s scenic cliffs; they also believed, on some level, that they too were gulls – or, at least, they acted like it, flapping and squawking about.Extra Geography review – a sweet and spiky coming-of-age debutRead moreDebauched fairytales like these loom large over The Incomer, Scottish writer-director Louis Paxton’s odd and aggressively quaint first feature, which asks a high conceptual buy-in of its audience. From the first shots of Isla (Gayle Rankin) and Sandy (Grant O’Rourke) caw-caw-ing like birds and beating sacks labeled “incomer” with clubs, Paxton commits to an askew, often alienating angle of humor – quirky, at times juvenile, a touch dark, altogether difficult to settle into for anyone with an aversion to twee.It does not help that Isla and Sandy, left on the island by their deceased parents years earlier, act more like children than adults, brutish and blunt and stunted in ways more off-putting than endearing. With no other human contact, the two believably live on the border of reality and myth, entertaining themselves with stories – relayed to us in animated pencil sketches, as narrated by Isla – of the gull ancestors and evil selkie-esque creatures that demand human sacrifice. (In a cringy flourish, said selkie also appears as a man in an obvious wetsuit and black contacts, beckoning Isla into the sea).Equally mythical is the idea that these two siblings have managed entirely on their own on a remote northern island for decades, and have had no human contact nor curiosity to ever visit the mainland, let alone learn of the existence of the internet – which, of course, must be cutely explained to them by Daniel (Domhnall Gleeson), a local councilor sent to evict them by his transparently machiavellian boss (Michelle Gomez). Able to subdue the siblings with his “wizard powers” (a smartphone that freaks them out) and lightly adapted tales like The Lord of the Local Authority, Daniel slowly ingratiates himself into their tiny circle of trust and, like many a mainland conquerer before him, develops some sympathies.Gleeson, fresh off his starring turn in The Office spin-offThe Paper, has honed his milquetoast middle manager shtick to a sharp point; he’s an admirably game foil to the siblings’ rock-pelting insanity. And the collision of feral subsistence living and white-collar apathy does generate some sparks – Sandy, whom O’Rourke plays as a lovably doltish puppy eager for love, takes quickly to Daniel, who handles the schoolboy crush with amusing playfulness. (Tasked with the most off-kilter and absurd gags – hitting his own head with a rock, for one – O’Rourke manages to keep us rooting for the manchild.) Daniel takes to Isla, and their moments of disarmament – when Rankin allows Isla’s overdone defenses and cartoonish scowl to drop – are genuinely sweet. The isle, at times lushly and patiently captured by cinematographer Pat Golan, offers some small wonders.Unfortunately, those reprieves are too frustratingly few, and too often shoehorned into jarringly sincere revelations on trauma, abandonment, empowerment. Instead The Incomer returns, again and again, to the joke of the islanders’ ignorance, to the point where it almost feels insulting to their intelligence. A generous reading would be that their bewilderment of, say, electric toothbrushes puts the deadening idiocy and disconnections of modern life – Where does our food actually come from? How does the internet work? What about the phones? – in stark relief. But whatever insight there is gets buried in a deluge of quirky bits of self-satisfied weirdness, including a climactic swing toward violence and “revenge of the nerds” territory (complete with a “maybe I AM weird” speech).Still, one person’s washed-up dildo joke is another’s uproarious gag – this specific concoction of absurdism, sentimentality, childish humor and dark punchlines may have stayed off-key for me, but seemed to strike a chord with others, at least judging from the many guffaws at the screening I attended. Where I was put off by The Incomer’s cutesy hijinks, others may find winsome messages on the fickle magic of human connection and the risks of snap judgment. To those people, I wish a pleasant stay on the isle.The Incomer is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewDomhnall GleesonComedy filmsSundance film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

In April 2024, the value of all the dollar bills in circulation reached an all-time high of $2.345tn, and may well be even more than that by now. The total value of dollars in the world has doubled every decade since the 1970s. Similarly, there are 1.552tn euro notes in circulation, while most other currencies – the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and so on – are all at something like their highest levels in history. This at a time when so many of us have pretty much stopped using cash altogether, and even the people who sell the Big Issue in our streets are equipped with card readers.When I talk about “us”, I mean those who don’t have to worry about hiding huge cash profits from drug dealing, people-smuggling and so on. And that of course provides the answer to the question: while law-abiding citizens like you and I have to jump through hoops when we move even relatively small sums around for entirely legitimate reasons – buying a fridge or a secondhand car, say – drug dealers just shove bundles of the stuff into their coat pockets or suitcases and whisk them round the world in order to keep their business going. The number of dogs trained to sniff out cash at international airports is growing, but nothing like as fast as the rate at which big-denomination notes are being pumped out by the world’s central banks. And the ways in which money is laundered are growing in complexity and sophistication.“Money laundering”, by the way, is an expression that started in 1920s Chicago, when Al Capone and his friends had to cope with this same problem: what to do with their vast bundles of greenbacks. They created or co-opted chains of laundries and other small shops to disguise the profits from bootlegging, then bought high-value items such as houses and entire companies (not to mention cops and politicians) with the cash that had been washed clean; “laundering” was a witty way of describing the process. Nowadays the number of men’s barber shops that have sprung up in Britain’s towns and cities may well hint at a new version of the process; though the salivating reporters from the Daily Mail and the Telegraph, hoping to link the Middle Eastern haircut with people-smuggling, drug dealing, immigration and the rise of “lawless” Britain, never quite managed to prove the case. That doesn’t necessarily mean there isn’t one, of course.In Mexico, which takes in something like $25bn in US banknotes per year, drugs violence kills about 150 people every dayOliver Bullough is one of Britain’s finest investigative reporters. He is thorough, his sources are impressive, and he has a lovely, easy style which takes us through some of the darkest features of the world’s economy. He also has a fine sense of moral purpose, which puts his reporting on to a different level from the show-and-tell paperbacks that fill airport bookshop shelves. As his excellent books from the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse (plus his reporting for Reuters from Chechnya, the scariest war of modern times) showed, he seems to be completely without fear. In the nasty, complex business of reporting international money-laundering, courage is perhaps the most important quality.Everybody Loves Our Dollars is a much-needed exposé. It starts off in the unlikeliest of settings: Bicester Village, the fashion outlet near Oxford which is built along the lines of a twee New England town; except that the shops bear the names of the world’s most famous fashion brands, from Jimmy Choo to Stella McCartney, Givenchy, Louis Vuitton and Gucci – and the prices are low, low, low. You get there by train from Marylebone in London, and the announcements en route show you who the target clientele is: “We are now approaching Bicester Village,” say recorded voices in Arabic and Mandarin Chinese. People get off with excited smiles, then others struggle on board carrying vast amounts of high-end shopping, often packed into one final purchase: an expensive suitcase that will take everything home to Bahrain or Chongqing.Bullough maintains that this display of shopaholicism is a major form of money laundering in its own right. You can move large amounts of money around by buying expensive things. As a senior police officer tells him: “Factories in China ship drugs to British gangsters, who then give the payments in cash to Chinese students studying at UK universities. The students either take the cash to Bicester Village, or first pay it into their bank accounts before going; then they buy Gucci handbags or whatever, and ship them back to China.”Bicester Village was perhaps the least exotic of the places Bullough visited for this book: others include the Marshall Islands, the Northern Marianas and Fort Worth, Texas, where the US Federal Reserve’s Western Currency Facility pumps out unthinkable amounts of $100 bills every day. Which of course leads us back to the question of why, when the demand for paper money is shrinking hugely in the west, are western central banks pumping out more? The answer is depressing. According to one estimate, 70% of all the $100 bills in existence circulateoutsidethe US. The monetary value of each banknote, which only costs a few pence to print, is in effect loaned to the people who take them out of their banks or ATMs. The US Federal Reserve, Bullough writes, earns tens of billions of dollars from this arrangement. It’s an enormous profit, and the big central banks of the world simply aren’t prepared to relinquish it – no matter what the results.And the results are, of course, appalling. In Mexico, which takes in something like $25bn in US banknotes per year, drug violence kills about 150 people every day. Since 2006, when the Mexican government started using the army to clamp down on the drug cartels, getting on for half a million people have been murdered. Among them was the husband of a woman I interviewed in Ciudad Juárez, a key drugs-trading city just across the border from El Paso. He had been an investigative journalist, like Bullough. After he revealed some of the local cartel’s secrets, he was murdered. The killers cut his head off and stuck it on the railings outside his front door; his young son found it when he came home from school.This is just one minuscule part of the price the world pays for the profits of the central banks. We have long since lost the war against drugs. Now we’re losing the war against money laundering; the profits for our governments are just too big. The price is paid by people such as the widow of the Mexican investigative journalist in Ciudad Juárez. “I wiped the blood off his dead face and kissed his lips,” she told me. “I’ve never had a proper night’s sleep since that moment.” It’s a very heavy price to pay for a designer handbag.John Simpson is the BBC’s world affairs editor.

The sense of being hemmed in, politically and personally, was hard to escape.I had been raised to believe in communism, and for a long time I did. I even applied twice to join the Young Communist League, only to be rejected for not being “combative” enough: code for not informing on others. Friends were expelled from university or jailed for speaking too freely and my family included people in the military and police, so I had to be careful not to endanger them. But amid that stifling conformity, something else had begun to take hold.When I was 13, my first girlfriend’s father, a sailor, brought back LPs from abroad. Through those records, I discovered rock’n’roll. In Cuba at the time, that was no small thing. Western music arrived years late, passed hand to hand through a black market of cassette tapes copied and recopied.It wasn’t without risk: I know people who went to jail just for listening to the Beatles or the Rolling StonesBy the time I reached my fourth year of secondary school, music had become an obsession. Four or five of us made an unspoken pact to seek it out wherever we could. We held listening sessions in each other’s homes and gathered at an arts centre every Saturday night, where local bands played or taped rock blared from speakers. It wasn’t without risk: I know people who went to jail just for listening to the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. Long hair, bracelets, necklaces – any hint of “western proclivities” – could land you in the back of a van for the night.I was 15 in 1986, living in a one-bed flat in Havana that I shared with my mother, grandmother, aunt and cousin, when I discovered The Prophet’s Song byQueen. I’d heard of the band, but I had never listened to them properly. A friend had sourced A Night at the Opera for me, photocopying the inlay with the lyrics included. I listened to it on a battered mono cassette player with a single speaker, hardly ideal for an album so carefully constructed.And yet, from the opening notes, it stopped me cold. The song begins gently, with soft guitar chords, before shifting into something more frenetic. Then Freddie Mercury’s voice arrives: possessed, prophetic, as if rallying an unseen crowd; his voice had this beautiful urgency, singing about a vision he had.Then came the moment that changed everything. Brian May’s delay effect multiplies Mercury’s voice – “Now I know, now I know” – so it echoes into itself, ghostlike and disembodied. Even through that tinny speaker, it was otherworldly. For eight minutes, the noise of Havana fell away. In that cramped flat, surrounded by family and surveillance, a crack opened.What moved me wasn’t just the sound, but what it represented. A Night at the Opera was Queen’s first album after falling out with their management. They were given creative freedom. Until then, my world had been bound by “socialism or death”, words still painted on Havana’s walls. Suddenly, I too felt the freedom to imagine something different. The inspiration for the song, written by Brian May, was a fever dream he had while recovering from an illness. In a way, the track became my own personal convalescence.My cultural awakening: Losing My Religion by REM helped me escape a doomsday cultRead moreI didn’t immediately become a dissident. But I kept that kernel of rebellion inside me. Rock music pulled me through the late 80s, through the fear of conscription, through the brutal 90s when friends drowned trying to leave Cuba on homemade boats. I went on to study English and ran a successful, but risky, black-market translation business (if caught, I would have ended up in jail unless I bribed my way out of it). This business also included city tours, not only in English but in French and German too. Eventually I made my way to the UK in 1997: I met my British (now ex-) wife in Havana and we were married for more than two decades. It was the early years of New Labour, and being in a relationship with a British citizen made moving here easier. I live in London now, a writer, teacher and cycling instructor, with grownup children of my own.I still listen to The Prophet’s Song. It opened my ears not only to rock, but genres such as jazz. Most importantly, it spurred my curiosity, and the idea that life could be lived in a way that didn’t conform. In the middle of all that noise, it was the one thing that cut through.Share your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

A cohort of 20 young artists and writers visitedAsean Heritage Parksin their own countries to tell stories of biodiversity, nature and culture.Aung first travelled toInlay Lake Wildlife Sanctuary, known for its floating gardens, in 2022. “The Intha people live around the lake and build floating houses: structures made from bamboo on stilts,” Aung says. “Fishing is a common occupation; they use their feet to paddle their boats. So is the production of colourful cloth.”‘The children were delighted to see themselves in such bright colours’: Moe Wai’s best phone pictureRead moreThe following year, ACB funded Aung to create the ConservationPhotographyWorkshop for Myanmar Youth. He has now travelled to Inlay Lake 10 times; it takes about a day on a bus from his home town of Hpa-an. He took this image there in 2023 using his mobile phone.“I staged it to focus on the importance of this traditional cultural occupation.

What are the secrets of the superagers?Why do some people age better than others? Five extraordinary individuals – who scientists are studying – share their tipsIsabelle AronSat 24 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 16.46 ESTShareLajuana Weathers is determined to be the healthiest version of herself. She starts each day with a celery juice, is always trying to increase her step count, and meditates daily. Weathers is also 89 years old. And she has no plans to slow down. “I wake up in the morning and feel blessed that I have another chance at a day of life,” says the grandmother of six, and great‑grandmother of six more, who lives in Illinois in an independent living facility for seniors. “I look at my life as a holistic entity, and in that life is my physical, social, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. I have to take care of all of those. That’s what I like about the ageing process. All the clutter of raising children is out and I can concentrate on the wellness of me.”Weathers is a superager. This isn’t a self-proclaimed label, but one backed up by science – she is part of theSuperAging Research Initiativeat the University of Chicago. To qualify for the study, you have to be over 80 years old and have memory performance that’s at least as good as the average 50- to 60-year-old. There are about 400 superagers enrolled across North America.As life expectancy increases, many of us are keen to know how to stay healthy in our older years. According tofigures from the Office for National Statistics(ONS), the average life expectancy in the UK is 79.1 years for men and 83 for women. Thelatest ONS projectionsshow that those born recently will live even longer – boys born in the UK in 2023 can expect to live, on average, to 86.7 years and girls to 90 years, while 11.5% of boys and 17.9% of girls born in 2023 are expected to live to at least 100. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in longevity and healthspan – the period of life spent in good health – rather than lifespan, which is the total number of years lived. So what can this growing area of research tell us about why some age better than others? What can we learn from the superagers?Enrolment in the SuperAging Research Initiative takes three to four days. It includes a paper‑and-pencil test that assesses memory, attention, language and different aspects of cognition, as well as sharing a detailed family history. An MRI brain scan and a blood test provide data on genetic factors, blood‑based biomarkers such as risk level for Alzheimer’s, and the immune system. “We integrate data across brain structure and function, molecular and genetic measures, lifestyle, medical history, psychosocial factors, family history and other factors to understand how these elements interact to support exceptional cognitive ageing,” explains Dr Emily Rogalski, director of the initiative.We set the bar high. We’re looking for people who are truly uniqueThe goal isn’t to study these people for the sake of it, but to use the findings to benefit everyone. “If this rare population has something in common, it could be translated to be beneficial to the general population,” says Rogalski. “If you find a protective factor, then you say, ‘How do we turn this protective factor on in the mainstream population to boost chances of living long and living well?’”There isn’t yet the data to say what percentage of the population are superagers. “What we can say is that of the people who think that they are superagers, less than 10% end up meeting the criteria. We set the bar high. We’re looking for people who are truly unique.”Weathers doesn’t seem like your average 89-year-old. With a short crop of white hair, red lipstick and a beaming smile, she is full of energy and positivity, and seems younger than her years. “I concentrate on how good it is to be alive,” she says. “I have a ‘count my blessings’ attitude. I intend to be happy and I have the power to orchestrate that.” She loves clothes and has no interest in what society says she “should” wear at her age. “I dress in what satisfies me,” she says. To boost her mood, she plays choral music in her apartment and sings along. The eldest of three sisters, she is often mistaken for the youngest (who is 85; the middle sister is 87). She proudly tells me that she takes only one pill – at her doctor’s insistence – for blood pressure and feels so well that she has plans to negotiate with her doctor about phasing that out. She talks passionately about enjoying this “season” of her life and constantly trying to better herself.After the researchers mentioned that colouring and word searches would be beneficial for her cognitive function, Weathers started doing both every day. “I’m trying to do anything I can do to enhance my cognitive ability – well, all abilities,” she says. She has been in the study for two years, after hearing about it at an event and reaching out to see if she would qualify. “I felt that they were in a good place to research what’s happening with the older generation so that they can help the younger generations and slow down debilitating diseases. My mother died at 33, my brothers died at 19 and 61, and my father at 62, so I wanted the opportunity to share what’s happening with me,” she says.Colouring is one of the many activities in Weathers’ packed schedule. She walks outside if the weather is nice – if not, she gets her steps in around the corridors of her building, starting with a 40-minute walk each morning and another walk after dinner. She does about 6,000 or 7,000 steps a day, but her goal is to get to 10,000. She does occupational therapy twice a week to work on her physical health, and goes to a weekly wellness class where she has learned about nutrition, preparing food and how to “stack” her foods. “The body uses fibre first, then protein, starches and sugar. I stack my food in that order, so my body can process it better,” she says. She doesn’t eat refined sugar or gluten, and follows a largely plant-based diet, with some fish and chicken. She is involved in her local church and, as a vocal technician, she loves music and still works with choirs in her area. “If they call me, I’m there. For my 90th, I’m going to conduct the choir at church,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘I never thought of myself as anything special’: Ralph Rehbock at his home in Northbrook, Illinois.Photograph: Lucy Hewett/The GuardianLike Weathers, Ralph Rehbock is a superager with a busy schedule. He keeps track of it on a paper calendar, where he writes down appointments, singing rehearsals and social visits. Aged 91, Rehbock lives in the Chicago suburbs with his wife. Born in Gotha, Germany, he fled the Nazis in 1938 when he was four – his parents found a sponsor so that they could move to the US. Today, Rehbock shares the story of his escape with others. He’s the first vice‑president at the Illinois Holocaust Museum, for which he does talks, in person and on Zoom.As well as his work with the museum, Rehbock is part of Men Enjoying Leisure (MEL), a social group for male retirees, which was set up 25 years ago by four men who met on a computer course. They gather on the first Friday morning of each month in the basement of a local synagogue. Rehbock also manages MEL’s singing group, the Meltones, which rehearses on Friday afternoons. “We sing songs from the 30s and 40s. We sing at senior residences, and hope that they will sing along, and they do,” he says. It was through MEL that Rehbock heard about theNorthwestern University SuperAging Program. He has been part of the study for the last 11 years.View image in fullscreenRehbock with the family tree he started at the age of 15.Photograph: Lucy Hewett/The GuardianWhen he’s at home, Rehbock rarely sits still. “I’m always needing things. My wife says, ‘You’ve been sitting for only one minute’ and I jump up to do something, sit back down again, and then I think of something and jump up again.” One of his big projects in recent years has been working on his family tree. It started with a school project he made aged 15. He still has the original and gets up to find it and show it to me. He has digitised it and added the new generations of children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren; the family tree now includes 600 members of his extended family and 400 members of his wife’s. It’s on the wall in his basement, where he continues to add details. “That took a lot of time. Some people might call it busywork, but it’s my kind of busywork,” he says.He drives himself and his wife to appointments, does Wordle every day, and always has a 1,000-piece jigsaw on the go. “I might do an hour a day, and it might take several weeks to complete,” he says. When he finishes a puzzle, he adds it to the ever-growing pile in his garage of ones he’s completed. When I ask him about his superager status, he’s modest. “I was booksmart in the sense of my grades, but I never thought of myself as anything special,” he says.Having discovered that the memory performance of superagers such as Rehbock and Weathers is as good as 50- to 60-year-olds, researchers wanted to look at the structure and functionality of their brains – known as brain integrity – to understand why. “What does their brain integrity look like? Does it look like a 50-year-old’s, with whom they share memory performance? Does it look like an 80-plus-year-old’s, with whom they share chronologic age?” says Rogalski. Her team looked at this on MRI scans, which allowed them to measure the thickness of the cortex, the outer layer of the brain. As we age, the cortex usually shrinks, which has a negative effect on cognition. Rogalski’s research found that in “average agers”, the outer layer of their brains had thinned, but in superagers there was no thinning. The superagers’ brains looked “indistinguishable” from 50- to 60-year-olds’, except in the anterior cingulate region, which is important for attention and memory. This part of the brain was thicker in superagers than in 50- to 60-year-olds.The research focuses on memory and cognitive function, but is looking at a broader picture by gathering data on physical activity, motor function, sleep and social engagement through wearable sensors. The aim is to understand “how physical, social and biological factors interact to support cognitive resilience”. They are still processing the data, but anecdotally. Rogalski says most superagers are active in some way. “We have some people who are doing high‑intensity water aerobics, yoga and hiking in mountains. Other people are skiing or cycling, and then we have people who may need a wheelchair or a walker, who might be doing chair stretching. But there is a consistent report of activity,” she says.View image in fullscreen‘I had no idea that my strength was exceptional’: Ina Koolhaas Revers, 78, at the gym in Amsterdam (above and below). Photographs: Jussi Puikkonen/The GuardianView image in fullscreenBeing active as you age is important, but some of the superagers push this to extremes, performing at a level you’d expect to see in much younger people. This is the case for Ina Koolhaas Revers, a 78-year-old powerlifting champion who lives in Amsterdam. At 64, Koolhaas Revers started doing CrossFit – a type of high-intensity training that combines weightlifting, gymnastic and cardio exercises. “Before that, I went to a regular gym, but I didn’t really know what I was doing. I had always been physically active, but never in an intense or competitive way,” she says. Her coach noticed that she was “unusually strong” and suggested she try powerlifting, a form of competitive weightlifting focused on three lifts with a barbell – a squat, bench press and deadlift. In 2018, she qualified for the Powerlifting World Championship in Canada and won gold in her age group.After that, experts from Maastricht University in the Netherlands studied her as an older athlete. The results were impressive – compared with the average for healthy women in her age group, Koolhaas Revers’s quadriceps muscles were 37% bigger, while her muscle cells were 46% bigger, and comparable to women in their 20s. She was also able to bench press 57.5kg, squat 90kg and deadlift 133.5kg, which is better than the average woman aged 25, where the maximum results are 49kg, 76kg and 89kg respectively. “I turned out to be extremely strong – much stronger than many young women aged 18 to 35 who went to the gym several times a week. I had no idea that the weights I lifted were considered so heavy or that my strength was exceptional,” she says. “To me, it was evidence that seniors can achieve far more than they imagine.”Koolhaas Revers continues to compete in powerlifting events. “I train four times a week for two hours per session, I follow a high-level athlete’s diet and I prioritise rest and sleep. I’m not experiencing any significant decline. I still deadlift 131 kilos.” She attributes some of her ability to genetics – her father was in the military and very fit, and both parents “remained relatively healthy for a long time”. Koolhaas Revers says exercising is good for her brain, too. “I strongly believe that being physically active helps keep the brain healthy.”View image in fullscreen‘I rarely eat meat and I never eat processed food’: Hans Smeets, 78, running near Gulpen in the Netherlands.Photograph: Jussi Puikkonen/The GuardianHans Smeets is another septuagenarian who has amazed researchers with his physical capabilities. A 78-year-old who lives in the Netherlands, Smeets ran as a teenager, but didn’t take it up again until he was 50, when he decided to run a marathon and achieved a time of two hours 50 minutes, placing 10th overall and first in his age group.Since then, he has won gold in his age category in 22 European championships and 25 world championships. When he was 75, Smeets was approached by sports scientist Bas van Hooren from Maastricht University about studying him in the laboratory. They discovered that he had a VO2max of 50.5, which Van Hooren describes as “remarkably high”. VO2max is the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during intense exercise. It’s a “central indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness and endurance potential”, says Van Hooren. Smeets’s VO2max of 50.5 at 75 years old would “place him roughly in the 75th percentile of 20‑ to 29-year-old men”, he says. “To our knowledge, this is the highest value reported for someone at 75 years old.”According to Van Hooren, the results “reinforced the concept that ageing does not impose an absolute ceiling” when it comes to fitness. Through his research he wants to understand “what it takes to remain healthy and fit in old age” and how to “extend your healthspan as much as possible”.In his training, Smeets focuses on endurance, rather than high intensity. “The study confirmed that my training method of mostly slow endurance runs has a positive effect on the wear and tear process. I have remained virtually injury-free as a result,” he says. “To stay fit at my age, it’s crucial to train consistently, avoid overestimating yourself and build up stamina. This reduces the risk of injury.”Currently, Smeets runs four or five times every week. He runs in the picturesque – and unusually hilly for the Netherlands – region of Heuvelland in South Limburg where he lives. He used to work at a rehabilitation centre for disabled children. Since retiring, he goes for a walk every Monday with his 84-year-old brother, and spends lots of time gardening. His parents weren’t endurance runners like he is, but they enjoyed cycling and walking.View image in fullscreen‘There’s nothing better than being able to whip the backside of a young whippersnapper’: Neil Hunter, 65, in Lancashire.Photograph: Jack Roe/The GuardianConsistency and a focus on endurance is Neil Hunter’s approach, too. He was 57 when he did his first triathlon. Now 65, he estimates that he has participated in between 100 and 150 events. “I have four racks for medals in my garage,” says Hunter, who lives in Lancashire. Most recently, he became an Ironman Age-Group world champion, after coming first in the men’s over-65s category at the 2025 event in Nice.Hunter ran marathons in his 30s and 40s, but after his first triathlon, he was hooked. Since 2019, he has been working with a coach, who sets him a monthly training plan. Every three months, they test his fitness on a stationary bike while he wears an oxygen mask. “Every 30 seconds, the resistance increases on the bike. You pedal to destruction,” he explains. His most recent test shows that he has a VO2max of 59.6, which iswell above the 90th centile for his age groupand more in line with the 90th centile of 20- to 29-year-olds, which is 62.2.View image in fullscreenHunter: ‘My mantra is: get fit, stay healthy, be happy.’Photograph: Jack Roe/The GuardianHunter trains for 15 to 20 hours every week, which includes running, cycling and swimming. He also walks his dog every day, and does stretching, yoga and pilates. He particularly enjoys overtaking younger people during triathlons. “Being a mature athlete, there’s nothing better than being able to whip the backside of a young whippersnapper.”While not everyone can compete in triathlons, Hunter sees exercise, in any form, as a crucial part of healthy ageing. “My mantra is: get fit, stay healthy, be happy. I’m convinced that there’s no prescription medicine that could provide the same wellbeing results, either physically or psychologically, as daily exercise,” he says. The importance of exercise is backed up by Van Hooren, who suggests doing strength and cardio training. “Ageing affects not only the heart and lungs, but also muscles, balance, coordination and joint integrity. A mix helps preserve functional capacity,” he says. Interestingly, many of the older people they have studied at Maastricht University didn’t exercise until later in life. “It’s never too late to start,” he says.The idea of what makes a superager is something that Eric Topol, professor and cardiologist, explores in his bookSuper Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity. He spent seven years researching a group of 1,400 people whom he calls the “wellderly”. “Most of the people were in their 90s, all the way up to 102. They took good care of themselves. There was a 99-year-old man who still smoked two packs a day, but that was the rare exception,” explains Topol. His findings showed that “lifestyle is fundamental” and that genetics played less of a role than they anticipated. “In their genome sequence, we found very little to account for their healthy ageing. A lot of it is related to non-genetic issues, especially the immune system. Lifestyle has a big influence on our immune system,” he says.Don’t let me sit on a pedestal and think I’m holier than thou. Do we have a takeaway on a Saturday night? Of course we doWhen thinking about healthy ageing, Topol says that preventing the major age-related diseases – cardiovascular, cancer and neurodegenerative – is crucial. There are new technological developments in this area, such as organ clocks, which assess individuals and predict which diseases they are likely to develop. “These organ clocks give us a pace of ageing of every organ. People generally don’t develop age-related diseases before 50. So at 50 people will get an organ clock assessment of their arteries, brain, heart and immune system. That way we’ll know if there’s something that warrants more attention. It’s exciting. The organ clocks will be out this year.”While he has advice for people – eat an anti‑inflammatory diet, avoid ultra-processed foods, do aerobic exercise and resistance training, work on your balance and prioritise quality sleep – he says many people don’t do these things. “When we are able to predict which of the three diseases you’re likely to get, the chances of you doing something are greatly improved,” says Topol.When it comes to what superagers eat, there’s no one‑size-fits-all approach. “We see a wide range of diets,” says Rogalski. “Diet is important for health, so I’m not endorsing having fish and chips every night, but some individuals may be able to tolerate it more, and that might be, in part, an interaction with their genes.” That said, the people I speak to are all relatively healthy. “I’ve eaten healthy my whole life,” says Smeets. “I rarely eat meat, I never eat processed food. I’ve been baking my own organic sourdough bread for 40 years and I drink buttermilk every day.” For lunch, he eats fruit from his garden with organic yoghurt and organic grains. Koolhaas Revers eats salads, greens, fish, nuts, chicken and legumes. Hunter has porridge with blueberries and honey for breakfast, and follows a reasonably healthy diet. “But don’t let me sit on a pedestal and think I’m holier than thou. Do we have a takeaway on a Saturday night? Of course we do,” he says. Hunter isn’t teetotal but mostly stopped drinking in 2019 when he started training more seriously.Evidence increasingly suggests that lifestyle factors and, critically, their timing matter for brain healthInterestingly, Rogalski says that the superagers in their study are “not uniformly ‘perfect’ in their lifestyle histories” and that approximately 40% report a history of smoking. “This variability is valuable – it allows us to ask why some individuals maintain exceptional cognitive health despite known risks.” But is it possible to reverse years of unhealthy habits? The superagers could be key to finding out. “Evidence increasingly suggests that lifestyle factors and, critically, their timing matter for brain health,” says Rogalski. One of the goals of her research is to understand if there are windows of opportunity for reducing cognitive decline.There is one thing that unites most superagers – social connection.Researchers at Northwestern Universityfound that superagers in their study tend to be highly social and have strong interpersonal relationships. They also discovered that superagers have more “von economo neurons” in their brains, which are thought to be linked to social behaviour.Rogalski is in the process of analysing more data on social activity but says that “strong social engagement does appear to be a common feature among many superagers” and that learning new things and social interactions are great for keeping your brain active. Even having conversations with friends is “good exercise for your brain”, she says. She also points toa studyin which they took two groups of people and taught one of them knitting and the other photography, and found that both had the same brain benefits because they were learning new skills. “If you’re in a routine and doing something you know how to do, that’s fine for enjoyment but you’re probably getting less brain benefit, as opposed to doing something challenging.”I live in a building of 200 units. I don’t see anybody as active as I am or as positive as I amView image in fullscreenWeathers at her home in Illinois.Photograph: Lucy Hewett/The GuardianThese are things Koolhaas Revers prioritises. “In the gym, I socialise with all generations. Don’t limit yourself to the company of older adults. A whole new world has opened up to me through young people,” she says. “Stay curious. Read the newspapers, try new foods, go to the theatre or museums. Live fully and try to remain optimistic, even when you lose people around you. Challenge yourself with new hobbies and interests. Don’t think, ‘I’m too old.’” For Weathers, social interactions are “essential”. She offers to drive people in her building to the shops if they need something, and leaves notes on people’s apartment doors to lift them up. “They say things like ‘Be encouraged today’ and ‘If you need anything, I’m here’,” she says.From speaking to superagers and experts, it seems there is always something you can do to keep your mind and body active. “My motto is: if all you can move is your little finger, then move it,” says Koolhaas Revers. This is true even if you have mobility or health issues. “Healthy ageing does not require perfection or the absence of illness. For individuals with health or mobility challenges, the focus should be on staying physically active within their abilities, remaining cognitively engaged and maintaining social connections. Even modest, consistent engagement – physical, cognitive or social – can be meaningful,” says Rogalski. This could be anything from phone calls with friends and family to doing gentle stretching in a chair.It’s hard to know what exactly makes a superager – genetics, lifestyle or a bit of both? Rogalski says they don’t have the full picture, but they are hoping to build it up through more research. On the physical side of things, Van Hooren says “it will always be a mix” but that you can “get far by adopting a healthy lifestyle even when genetics aren’t optimal”. The superagers I speak to generally think it’s a combination of genetics and lifestyle. “I live in a building of 200 units. I don’t see anybody as active as I am or as positive as I am,” says Weathers. “It must be something genetic, along with the influences of my environment, that got me to this place. My tip is to be grateful for what you have and use it for a purpose.”Explore more on these topicsAgeingNeuroscienceMedical researchOlder peopleMental healthHealthFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Made from fermented compressed soy beans, it’s an intelligent ingredient equivalent to meat in terms of protein, subtle and nutty in flavour and chewy in texture. Happily, it is also now widely available in most large UK supermarkets. Here, the tempeh is cooked in a typical Indonesian way – that is, fried until crisp, then coated in a sticky, spicy sweet soy sauce and liberally sprinkled with salted peanuts. In fact, the only anomaly is the leeks, making this dish mostly Indonesian but via a field in Lincolnshire.Leek and tempeh manisYou’ll probably need a trip to an online or local Asian supermarket to pick up the kecap manis, a sweet soy sauce; and sambal oelek, a zingy and magical Indonesian chilli sauce. While you’re there, you could also buy the makrut lime leaves, palm sugar and tempeh, but those are also available in most big supermarkets these days.Prep10 minCook30 minServes42 large leeks(330g)6 tbsp neutral oil, plus a little extra if need be400g tempeh, cut into 1cm cubes – I like theTofooandTibabrands4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced6cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated4 tbsp sambal oelek3 fresh or frozen makrut lime leaves, deveined and finely shredded1½ tbsp palm sugar, or light brown soft sugar1 tbsp kecap manis,plus extra for drizzlingFine sea salt60g roasted peanuts, finely choppedSteamed jasmine rice, to serveTop and tail the leeks, cut them in half lengthways, then finely slice the whites and greens. Put the shredded leeks in a colander, wash them well in cold water, then sit the colander in a bowl of fresh cold water and leave for five minutes, swishing them from time to time with your hands. Drain the leeks and set aside.Put two tablespoons of the oil in a wide pan over a medium-high heat. When hot, add the tempeh and fry for eight to 10 minutes, turning until the cubes are golden and crisp on all sides, then transfer to a plate.Pat the leeks dry. Pour three tablespoons of oil into the same pan and tip in half the sliced leeks. Cook on a medium-high heat for about eight minutes in all, leaving them undisturbed for a couple of minutes at a time before stirring, so they crisp up. Once the leeks are crisp, transfer them to a second plate. Repeat with the remaining leeks, adding more oil if need be.In the same pan, add the remaining tablespoon of oil and the garlic and ginger, and fry, stirring, for two minutes. Add the sambal oelek, shredded lime leaves, palm sugar, kecap manis, half a teaspoon of salt and two tablespoons of water, then mix in all the browned tempeh, three-quarters of the crisp leeks and all but a sprinkle of the peanuts until well combined.Put the tempeh and leek mixture on a platter, drizzle with a little extra kecap manis, then top first with the remaining leeks followed by the remaining peanuts.

He has been diagnosed himself, as have his two children, giving him a clear view of how the system works – and where it breaks down.While his own diagnosis was relatively straightforward, the experience with his daughter was very different. The diagnosis he obtained for his eldest child, after an assessment carried out privately by a “very senior ex-Camhs [child and adolescent mental health service] director, someone who knows the system and has seen a huge amount of this”, was later rejected by the NHS. He was told it was not compliant with guidelines from theNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence(Nice), which sets healthcare standards nationally.It is a common experience. TheNHSis increasingly referring patients to private providers, which the health service pays for, only for those assessments to be rejected. The result is an inefficient system that wastes public money and leaves patients without care and mental health trusts struggling to cope.One NHS trust has said this churn is clogging its ability to treat patients as people cycle back into services after private assessments stall. The NHS is overspending an estimated £164m a year on ADHD services.Modha had to have the diagnosis reconfirmed through the NHS – something that only happened after “constant hassling” – and even after that, he has struggled to get different parts of the system to work together. He describes being “caught between the private and state systems”, with GPs reluctant to engage in shared care.The ADHD system in the UK has broken down. Speaking to BBC Radio Oxford this week, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, was asked whether referrals for autism and ADHD amounted to an epidemic that the government was failing to manage. “Well, in a nutshell, yes,” he replied.Part of the problem is the way the private system and the NHS are working together, something Modha experienced first hand. Under “right to choose”, an NHS policy inEngland, patients with a GP referral can select a private provider for assessment and initial treatment funded by the NHS, rather than waiting for a local NHS service. In theory, care is then handed back to the NHS through shared-care arrangements, but often this does not happen.Although Modha’s daughter was diagnosed not through right to choose but independently via a private provider, the same structural problems emerged when care needed to be integrated back into the NHS.Trusts say patients assessed through private providers are being sent back into NHS services in growing numbers. In a lettershared with the Guardian, the Midlands partnership university NHS foundation trust acknowledged it was struggling to cope and the trend was contributing to long waiting lists and “reduced capacity for new and complex cases”.ADHD waiting lists ‘clogged by patients returning from private care to NHS’Read moreThe trust highlighted the structural weaknesses of right to choose itself. “There is limited regulation surrounding private ADHD providers,” it wrote, noting that providers could establish services and request to diagnose ADHD, but that “at times their assessments do not comply with Nice guidelines”.Rather than relieving pressure on NHS services, the scheme appears to be recycling it. The trust said the current model “highlights the challenges and limitations” of a system that can diagnose quickly but cannot always find “appropriately skilled staff to support prescribing.”Regulatory action has underlined the risks of the approach. ADHDNet, also known as Holistic ADHD Solutions, a private ADHD provider operating under right to choose, has been suspended from NHS work. The provider was registered with Norfolk and Waveney integrated care board (ICB), allowing patients across England to use its services. The ICB said the suspension was a precaution triggered by concerns about “service management, safety oversight and continuity of care arrangements”.In NHSGreater Manchester, adult ADHD services are under particularly severe strain. Referrals have risen by more than 400%, from about 2,700 in 2022 to more than 11,000 in 2024, with more than 25,000 adults now waiting for autism or ADHD assessments. Services were designed for far lower demand; without change, waiting times could exceed seven or in some cases 10 years.Demand continues to outpace capacity, worsened by workforce shortages. NHS Greater Manchester estimates it would cost at least £30m a year to fund current levels of right to choose diagnostic requests alone, without enough clinicians to deliver them. Waits already range from 18 months to more than seven years.A key problem identified is that diagnosis has become the gateway to support, even though many people need help that does not require a full specialist diagnostic assessment. In response, NHS Greater Manchester is introducing a central triage hub, with all adult ADHD referrals receiving an initial face-to-face assessment. Only those meeting agreed clinical thresholds will go on to full NHS-funded diagnosis.The model aims to reduce full diagnostic assessments by 70-80%, standardise decisions and reduce pressure on specialist services. Alongside this, NHS Greater Manchester says it will expand community-based and non-clinical support so people can access help earlier while waiting.Throughout all of this, it is patients who bear the cost. One father told the Guardian that after three years and without warning, his son’s GP practice announced it would stop working with a private provider. Although his son was referred back to NHS services, waiting times “exceed six months, guaranteeing a treatment gap”. His consultant warned of “predictable harms” if treatment stopped.Modha says: “You’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t – try to get help privately and integrate later, or try to do it all through the NHS and wait two years, by which time your child may be dead.”A spokesperson for the Independent Healthcare Providers Network (IHPN), said: “Independent providers are playing an essential role in supporting the provision of NHS ADHD services … Shared care is a significant challenge and there are real risks to patients when care is not coordinated effectively between providers, and it’s important that the government, NHS commissioners, relevant GP representative bodies and independent providers work collaboratively to find solutions.”“While any concerns about safety, quality or consistency of care should always be taken seriously and addressed through robust regulation and commissioning, the overriding challenge facing ADHD services is a longstanding lack of capacity and unacceptably long waiting times for diagnosis.”Explore more on these topicsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderNHSPrivate healthcareHealthNational Institute for Health and Care ExcellenceEnglandGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

Maybe it was a singular incident that triggered it, like that monster wave in Biarritz, France, almost 20 years ago that body-slammed me on to the seabed, taking all the skin off my chin.More likely is that my transition from fearless to frightened had been more of a slow creep, and a perfectly rational one when you consider the danger of riptides, hidden rocks, sharks and concussion. But for me, I feel it goes deeper. Almost inevitably my job will have had something to do with this. Nearly two decades of working as a journalist reporting on the very worst things that human beings can do to other human beings in a wide array of contexts has definitely eroded my sense that I can keep myself – and others – safe from harm in a dangerous world.View image in fullscreenIn recent years, I have found that any bit of sea with waves above waist-height makes it a no-go zone for me, even though I’m a good swimmer and love being in water. On holiday I’m often left fretting on the shoreline, while my family joyfully rides the waves without me.This makes me very sad. So when I recently found myself about to change jobs for the first time in 14 years, I decided that I needed a circuit break and that this circuit break should be a week-long trauma surfing retreat in Morocco. Here, I figured, I could process some of the emotionally shredding content I’d exposed myself to while, hopefully, finally facing up to my fear of waves.View image in fullscreenA post-surf meal at Riad dar Haven.Photograph: Chris WerretThe company behind the retreat I signed up to is Resurface. Founded by psychologist Josh Dickson, who specialises in trauma, recovery and personal growth, the idea is to provide a holistic experience by combining morning yoga and surf lessons with afternoon group therapy work.In a call before the retreat, Josh said his intention is to create a “flow” state, where the body and the mind are able to work together towards healing and renewal, bolstered by the sunshine, cold water and a disconnection from the rigours of our everyday lives.Surfing is not just excellent physical exercise, it requires the surfer to be immersed in nature, concentrating fully on what they’re doing moment to moment. It also triggers an array of helpful hormones –endorphins, dopamine and serotonin for mood boosts, andadrenalineand norepinephrine for thrills and focus. All of these help to create the perfect set up for therapeutic work.We travelled to beautiful beaches around Tamraght, where the waves were so tiny it was difficult for even me to be frightenedI had initially booked on to one of Resurface’s first Reset retreats, designed to promote resilience and prevent burnout. Yet for various complicated reasons, I instead ended up on its first EMDR (eye movement, desensitisation and reprocessing) group retreat.Developed in the 1980s by US psychologist Francine Shapiro, the basic aim of EMDR is to help reduce distressing emotions connected to particular memories or past traumas that the body might be holding on to.The theory is that traumatic events are not neurologically processed in the same way as healthy memories, and so they can resurface and intrude. EMDR therapy uses bilateral stimulation – for example, rapidly moving your eyes from one point to another or tapping your body left then right at the same time as concentrating on a traumatic event. This, the theory goes, allows the brain to process and store the memory normally.View image in fullscreenThe writer enjoyed the chilled atmosphere of Tamraght.Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyObviously doing this in a group setting, among strangers, feels pretty intimate and exposing, so it was with some trepidation that I arrived in the small surf town of Tamraght, just north of Agadir, one sunny October afternoon to begin the retreat.Tamraght is lovely. The quieter, more chilled sister of the flashier surf tourism hotspot Taghazout, a couple of miles to the north, its dusty streets are full of busy restaurants, ceramics and surf shops, and with a lovely seafront where you can hang out with the beach camels.Learning to catch a wave, nearly always failing and then paddling straight back out to try again, was a meditation in itselfThat night, at Riad dar Haven, our beautiful and welcoming home for the six days of the retreat, our cohort – an eclectic, multi-generational bunch – met for a dinner of chicken with green olives and lemons cooked by the resident chef.The next morning, after a short introductory session with Josh featuring some fairly excruciating but fun ice-breaking exercises, we piled into the mini van and headed down to the beach where we struggled into wetsuits and divided into groups. Some of us had never surfed (myself included), others were more experienced.Our teachers, led by local surf instructor Youness Arhbi, were excellent – patient, funny and obviously experienced at convincing first-timers with cement hips that we had a chance of standing up on our huge foam learner boards.Every morning we travelled to different, beautiful beaches around Tamraght, where the waves were so tiny it was difficult for even me to be frightened. I found the experience of being in the cold, salt water for three or four hours at a stretch exhausting yet exhilarating. And, although I was definitely not a natural, the process of learning to catch a wave, nearly always failing and then paddling straight back out to try again, was a meditation in itself.After the lessons, our group of 12 would all sit together on the beach, the sun on our faces, eating lunch and sharing the triumphs and frustrations of our surfing exploits. Then we would pile in the bus and head back to the riad where we would begin the afternoon’s therapy session.At the beginning of the week, this part of the day felt pretty exposing, but Josh was thoughtful, confident and knowledgable in leading us through the process.View image in fullscreenAnnie Kelly in Tamraght, MoroccoAt first, I didn’t find EMDR particularly transformational, although it was interesting that what came up during the sessions was often not the memory or event I had decided to focus on at the beginning. However, as the week progressed, I was surprised to discover that these sessions became the most transformational thing about the retreat for me.As for the surfing, I ended the week being almost as rubbish as when I started, but it didn’t really matterAfter years of slowly and corrosively losing faith in the world, I found real hope and connection in sharing with a group of people willing to face up to their own personal heartbreaks, traumas and pain. It was a balm that did more to restore my faith and hope in people than any amount of self-reflection could offer.As for the surfing, I ended the week being almost as rubbish as when I started, but it didn’t really matter. On my last day, the waves had changed, and although they could not credibly be described as big, they were big enough for me to feel scared. Yet with our instructor’s encouragement – and a bit of cathartic sobbing on the beach when it all got too much – I persevered.And just once, in the last half-hour of the lesson, I managed to clamber awkwardly to my feet and stand up. As I raised my arms in the air in triumph, I heard cheering from the beach and watched as the group rose to their feet and joined me in celebration.The trip was provided byResurface, which offers seven-night surf therapy retreats from£2,500pp, including accommodation, transfers, all meals, surf lessons, therapy sessions and activities; the next trips starts on11 AprilExplore more on these topicsSurfing holidaysMorocco holidaysHealth and fitness holidaysAfrica holidaysHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or to put it another way: I watched the dog and the cat fight for a while, until it became tiresome; the next time I looked up – possibly 15 minutes later – the tortoise was also there. That’s what I mean by suddenly. In real terms, the tortoise doesn’t do anything suddenly.“Where have you been?” I say, even though I know the answer. I haven’t seen the tortoise in six weeks, but I’m certain he’s been butted up against the left rear leg of the sofa for that whole period.“Are you trying to get in on this?” I say. That’s what it looks like. The tortoise is poised at the edge of the fray, head up, waiting to bite an unguarded appendage. For a moment the dog has the cat pinned to the floor, and the cat’s tail is waving slowly back and forth in front of the tortoise’s face. But he misses his chance: the cat rears up, sinks its claws into the dog’s neck and bites in the manner of a leopard trying to take down a wildebeest. The dog steps over the tortoise and drags the cat to the opposite corner of the room, where the fight continues.The tortoise angles its head so its eye meets mine.“Lettuce?” I say.“Look who’s up,” my wife says, walking into the kitchen with two dirty mugs in each hand.“Yeah,” I say, opening the fridge. “Spring is here.”Spring is not here. A cold rain is falling outside and the mid-morning light is sepulchral. But a rapid overnight thaw has jarred the tortoise out of suspended animation. He’ll stomp around the kitchen in a fury for a few days before he finds a new place to hide – under the dog’s bed perhaps, or in the gap between the dresser and the wall. Once he’s settled he’ll retract his legs and head and stay put for another month.There are two of them, dressed in flat caps, scarves and worn jackets, offering farmyard manure on spec off the back of a lorryBut his premature appearance isn’t the only sign of spring. Later, while my wife is at the supermarket, the manure men ring the doorbell.There are two of them, dressed in flat caps, scarves and worn jackets, offering farmyard manure on spec off the back of a lorry. They come round twice a year, generally in autumn and spring. I think of these dung-sellers as part of some lost and deeply English tradition, which is why I prefer it when my wife is on hand to deal with them.One of them says almost nothing; the other talks non-stop. He also prefers to deal with my wife, who likes listening to the biannual updates on his many ailments. On the other hand, she drives a harder bargain than I do. I ring her.“The manure men are here,” I say.“Oh God,” she says. “Just tell them we don’t want any.”“It’s already gone beyond that,” I say. “I’m making them tea.”“How much did you agree to pay?” she says.“I’m not ready to tell you that,” I say.When I’ve made the tea I take the two mugs out. The rain has stopped.“No sugar, two sugars,” I say, raising the mugs in turn. The one who talks all the time takes the two sugars one.“Leave his there,” he says, pointing to a windowsill.“This is early for you, isn’t it?” I say, thinking of spring.“Yeah,” says the one with two sugars. “We was here six weeks ago, but your missus said to come back in January.”“Did she?” I say.While the quiet one does all the work, we chat for a while, about illness, about life, about the ups and downs of the door-to-door manure game. Finally, I have to get back to work.Eventually they go, and my wife returns. Together we look out the window at the neatly mulched beds.“How was he?” she says.“In and out of hospital all summer,” I say. “Still having tests.”“Uh-huh,” she says.“And they got a new truck, exactly the same as the old one,” I say. “And his daughter converted to Islam.”“Really?” she says.“She lives in Dubai,” I say. “And I guess she married a fella out there.”“What else?” she says. “Did he go to the wedding?”“I think so,” I say. “I can’t remember.”“You’re useless,” she says.“You should have been here,” I say, shrugging. “Anyway, they did a good job.”“How much?” she says.“Still too soon,” I say.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump claimed he had reached “the framework of a future deal” on Greenland.In a New York Post interviewpublishedon Saturday, Trump boasted that the US will gain sovereignty and take ownership over land in Greenland where American bases are located.“We’ll have everything we want,” Trump reportedly told the Post. “We have some interesting talks going on.”Meanwhile, in the same Post interview published on Saturday, TrumpsaidUS refineries will process the oil his administration had taken from seized Venezuelan tankers.“Let’s put it this way – they don’t have any oil,” Trump told the Post. “We take the oil.”The oil is being refined in “various places” including Houston, he said.The US military hasseizedseven Venezuela-linked tankers since the start of Trump’s month-long campaign to control Venezuela’s oil flows. Trump said on Tuesday that his administration had taken 50m barrels of oil out of Venezuela and was selling some of it in the open market.The intercepted vessels either were under US sanctions or said to be part of a “shadow fleet” ofships that disguisetheir origins to move oil from major sanctioned producers: Iran, Russia or Venezuela.Trump’s Latin American foreign policy has homed in on Venezuela, initially aiming to push the Venezuelan president,Nicolás Maduro, from power. After failing to accomplish that aim through diplomacy, Trump ordered US forces to fly into the country to grab Maduro and his wife in an overnight raid on 3 January, bringing them to New York to face criminal drug-related charges anddetaining themthere.In Saturday’s interview with the Post, Trump bragged that a new weapon he called “the discombobulator” played a central role in that raid.Those remarks came after the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,sharedon social media a purported eyewitness account of the US military using some sort of “very intense sound wave” to incapacitate Maduro’s bodyguards.Trump has said the US plans to control Venezuela’s oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country’s dilapidated oil industry in a $100bn plan thatis promptingmany raised eyebrows, not least fromenvironmentalistsand the US oil giants.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpCanadaChinaTrump tariffsTariffsOilnewsShareReuse this content"

In recent years, some US officials have signalled a desire to make US forces in South Korea more flexible to operate outside the Korean peninsula in response to a broader range of threats, such asdefending Taiwanand checking China’s growing military reach.South Korea has resisted the idea of shifting the role of US troops, but has worked to grow its defence capabilities in the past 20 years, to take on a wartime command of the combined US-South Korean forces. South Korea has 450,000 troops.The shift is part of what Washington has called “alliance modernisation” under the Trump administration. South Korean president Lee Jae Myung has himself pushed for greater defence autonomy, criticising in Septemberwhat he called“the submissive mindset that self-reliant defence is impossible without foreign troops”.In a statement on Saturday, South Korea’s defence ministry said US Forces in Korea remained central to the alliance and would continue to deter North Korean aggression.The Pentagon document makes no mention of denuclearising the Korean peninsula, the secondmajor strategy paperto omit the language. The Biden administration in 2022explicitly stated“complete and verifiable denuclearisation” as a goal, suggesting Washington may be shifting towards managing North Korea’s nuclear arsenal rather than seeking its elimination.The wide-ranging document, which each new administration publishes, said the Pentagon’s priority was defending the homeland. In the Indo-Pacific region, the document said, the Pentagon was focused on ensuring China could not dominate the US or its allies.“This does not require regime change or some other existential struggle. Rather, a decent peace, on terms favourable to Americans but that China can also accept and live under, is possible,” the document said, without mentioning Taiwan by name in the roughly 25-page document.China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to take control of the island. Taiwan rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims and says only the people of Taiwan can decide their future.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsNorth KoreaUS militarySouth KoreaUS foreign policyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Chief coroner Anna Tutton warned that the identification process could be “painful” and “lengthy”.For the past two days, the holiday town in the northern part of the country has staged a series of vigils, holding out hope that the search and rescue personnel would be successful.Prime minister Christopher Luxon said on Saturday “every New Zealander has been hoping for a miracle” and that the switch to a recovery operation was “the news we have all been dreading”.“Police have confirmed fatalities at the campground and the reality that no one would have been able to survive, therefore the rescue operation taking place there is now moving to a recovery.“To the families who have lost loved ones – every New Zealander is grieving with you.”More poor weather is forecast for the area on Saturday with thunderstorms and hail possible, potentially hampering the recovery operation at the campsite.New Zealand authorities are facing questions over why people were not evacuated after reports of a landslip at the campsite and neighbouring areas earlier on Thursday.Two people died in a separate landslide on Thursday in the neighbouring harbourside city of Tauranga. One of the people killed was a Chinese national, officials said.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the Himalayas were formed by the “great flood”, and that juvenile vegetarian dinosaurs had been on the ark.View image in fullscreenA visitor looks into a cage containing a model dinosaur inside a replica Noah’s Ark built by Answers in Genesis in Kentucky in 2016.Photograph: John Minchillo/APTeachers say they were then encouraged to incorporate the material by Snelling into their science and humanities lessons.Those who raised concerns with Guardian Australia made clear they did not object to faith-based schools teaching religious doctrine; their concern was that schools had a responsibility to educate children based on the curriculum.Faith-based schools in Queensland are required to teach the approved syllabus.Prof David Geelan, the president of theScienceTeachers’ Association of Queensland, said the science curriculum explicitly introduces the theory of evolution to students from year 10.“The students need to understand evolution as an explanation for the diversity of life and talk about the scientific evidence that supports the theory.The Australian who ascended to the helm of a Republican-linked fundamentalist Christian groupRead more“A thoughtful and nuanced teacher [at a faith-based school] could say: ‘In our church we believe X, but for your assessments you should demonstrate your understanding of the scientific theory as currently developed.’ But I’m not sure that always happens.”A ‘distrust of science’Answers in Genesis is a “young earth creationist” group which disputes significant strands of consensus science, and claims instead that scientific evidence supports the biblical creation story.Last year Guardian Australia revealed the US-based group, now fronted by former Australian Christian Lobby head Martyn Iles, hadflagged a push into Australia.But Geelan said that in order to sustain the theory of creationism “you have to end up being sceptical about a whole heap of current scientific knowledge”.“Answers in Genesis say scientists are lying to you … [and] that very often then forms up with other forms of science denialism. That distrust of science is the main negative.”Geelan said while schools are required to teach the syllabus there “isn’t really a mechanism for checking this”.“They probably shouldn’t be teaching things that directly contradict the syllabus.“But there aren’t school inspectors going around. There’s less of that compliance, the school has some autonomy to teach as they wish.”The Queensland Curriculum and Assessment Authority said in a statement the state’s science syllabuses and resources “support the teaching of scientific theories, including the theory of evolution”.“Queensland schools develop courses of study and assessment based on the requirements in our syllabuses and other advice and guidelines.“We have several checkpoints during the year to ensure these requirements are being met.“Principals are ultimately responsible for the quality and content of teaching and learning in their schools.”The chief executive of Christian Community Ministries, John Lyndon, said the organisation’s schools teach “the full requirements of the Australian curriculum”, including the theory of evolution.“At the same time, as a Christian school, we also welcome insights from scientists and scholars who work from a biblical worldview. This enables students to engage thoughtfully and objectively in determining their own beliefs and to develop a well-rounded understanding of life.”Lyndon said Snelling was “a highly qualified and respected geologist” and said Guardian Australia had been given “inaccurate” and “absurd” information about the presentation.“CCM schools are highly respected by our parents and school communities, who have deliberately chosen us to educate their children, being fully aware that our schools offer a Christ-centred educational opportunity which is wholly compliant with the Australian Curriculum.”Snelling did not respond to a request for comment.Answers in Genesis is hosting a series of events in Australia, beginning later this month, including at Mueller College in north Brisbane, a school run by CCM.Explore more on these topicsAustralian educationReligionCreationismQueenslandScienceChristianitynewsShareReuse this content"

He urges the development of policy mechanisms, such as thenews media bargaining code, to help journalism thrive.‘Not regulated’: launch of ChatGPT Health in Australia causes concern among expertsRead moreSearching for information, including news, is now one of AI’s most widely used functions, according toReuters Institute surveys.When users receive AI summaries without clicking through to the original news website, they starve news outlets of web traffic and revenue, posing a threat toAustralian mediaoutlets’ financial viability.Koskie’s analysis of 434 AI-generated news summaries revealed non-Australian sources CNN, BBC and ABC America were introduced despite the user being located in Australia.Sign up to get Guardian Australia’s weekly media diary as a free newsletterThe technology “basically sidelined Australian news”, he said, and when Australian sources were used they were usually big players like Nine and the ABC and not smaller, independent media. No [local] journalist was ever mentioned,” Koskie told Guardian Australia.The technology is “just reproducing crises that we didn’t properly attend to before”, he said. “The Australian media ecosystem is already struggling with concentrated ownership, declining independent outlets, and news deserts in regional areas.”Koskie became interested in the impact of Copilot when it installed itself on his system without permission in 2023 and invited him to use seven globally focused prompts to get his news.Prompts included: “what are the major health or medical news updates for this week” and “what are the top global news stories today”.He decided to follow the prompts to see where it would take him.The majority of Copilot’s answers linked to US websites, and in three of the seven news prompts studied, no Australian sources appeared at all.“Even when Australia was mentioned, it was very often just Australia, rather than Ballarat or the Kimberley,” he said.“Australians are invisible in this. In international studies, what people trust is the local news. And so we have this issue of declining trust in media, and the media that they’re being exposed to through these new platforms is not the one that people trust, which is local.“Trust is also in people, and the people are invisible.”According to the Reuters Institute’spredictions for media, journalism and technology in 2026, generative AI “threatens to upend the news industry by offering more efficient ways of accessing and distilling information at scale”.“Meanwhile search engines are turning into AI-driven answer engines, where content is surfaced in chat windows, raising fears that referral traffic for publishers could dry up, undermining existing and future business models.”Koskie, a postdoctoral research associate in digital communication, suggests extending the news media bargaining incentive remit to consider AI tools and incentivising AI companies to embed geographical location in their coding design.“While Copilot may offer a sleek, automated gateway to news, this study highlights its tendencies to reinforce dominant international sources, sideline independent and regional media, and erase the human labour behind journalism itself,” the academic paper warns. “If left unchecked, such tools risk compounding Australia’s existing media pluralism challenges rather than alleviating them.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian mediaAI (artificial intelligence)MicrosoftnewsShareReuse this content"

Trilateral meeting in the UAE? Diplomacy? For Ukrainians, this was another night of Russian terror,” the country’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said after the latest Russian assault on critical infrastructure.“Cynically, Putin ordered a brutal massive missile strike againstUkraineright while delegations are meeting in Abu Dhabi to advance the America-led peace process.

A medical facility was among the buildings damaged.Kyiv has already endured two mass overnight attacks this year that have knocked out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings. Emergency workers were still engaged in restoring services to residents, with overnight temperatures dropping to -13C (9F).In Kharkiv, a frequent target 30km (18 miles) from the Russian border, the city’s mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said 25 drones had hit several districts over two and a half hours, with at least 14 people injured.Writing on Telegram, Terekhov said the drones had struck a dormitory for displaced people, a hospital and a maternity hospital.View image in fullscreenA Ukrainian emergency personnel works to extinguish a fire.Photograph: Oleksandr Magula/AFP/Getty ImagesThe first known direct contact between Ukrainian and Russian officials on the US-backed proposal also began on Friday.Ukraine’s chief negotiator, Rustem Umerov, said the discussions had focused “on the parameters for ending Russia’s war and the further logic of the negotiation process”.An initial US draft drew heavy criticism in Kyiv and westernEuropefor sticking too closely to Moscow’s line, while later iterations prompted pushback from Russia for floating the idea of European peacekeepers.Both sides say the fate of territory in the eastern Donbas region is one of the main sticking points in the search for a settlement to a war that has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and decimated parts of Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Swedish migration agency said it had made efforts to ensure the centres were appropriate for children.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The Guardian“I cannot sleep. I sleep just one or two hours. I throw up. I am so stressed. I don’t want to speak to the children because here,” she said, pointing to her head, “is occupied. I don’t know physically, mentally what I should do.”The centre, one of a growing number of reception and return facilities aimed at housing an estimated 11,000 asylum seekers in the coming years, is part of Sweden’s increasingly hostileasylum and immigration policy. The centre-right government, which depends on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats, says it wants to “redirect focus” away from receiving asylum seekers to instead becoming a “country for labour immigration”.The government recently celebrated data showing that Sweden had its lowest level of asylum seekers since 1985, claiming that lower numbers “create better conditions for successful integration”. Thousands of people like Sofiye – who have lived in Sweden for years and are well-established in society and the job market, with children who were born in Sweden – face deportation.Among the recent policy changes include asylum seekers being placed in reception centres instead of being provided with individual accommodation who are then offered “repatriation grants” to leave the country voluntarily.The government has also introduced stricter conditions for gaining citizenship and tightened family reunification rules. Applicants must prove their identity through an in-person visit and provide more documentation than was previously the case.Committing a crime can now result in losing the right to live in Sweden for anyone who is not a Swedish citizen. In 2025 a total of 440 people were subjected to criminal deportations, according to government figures.“If you do not want to become part of this community, you should not come to Sweden,” the government has stated.View image in fullscreenA ‘refugees welcome’ demonstration in Gothenburg in 2015. The attitude towards immigration in Sweden has hardened in the years since.Photograph: Scanpix Sweden/ReutersThe hostile environment is a far cry from Sweden’s immigration policies of the past. In 2014, at the start of a period when the number of people arriving to Europe from countries in the Middle East rose sharply, the then prime minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt, made a speech urging Swedes to“open your hearts”to newcomers.The direction of travel is unlikely to change even with a general election next year, say observers, as the main political parties, including the opposition centre-left Social Democrats, have embraced similar hardline policies.“Many people that we meet say to us: ‘We came to Sweden believing this was a country that respected human rights: where are they?’” said Nannie Sköld, a counsellor at Stockholm Stadsmission’s Who Am I Tomorrow? project, which provides legal and psychosocial support to individuals and families with deportation orders.The latest government figures show that 8,312 people returned to their home countries in 2025, the highest number in a decade, while the number of asylum seekers decreased by 30% on the previous year.“We meet people who came to Sweden for work or to study, and people who don’t have grounds for asylum,” said Sköld. “We also meet people who are fleeing from the Taliban or they are LGBTQ from Uganda, and who then see that their request for international protection is denied.”One of the changes that was having a particularly damaging impact is the decision to abolish “track changes”, she said. The new rule, which came into force at short notice last April, prevents people who have had their asylum applications rejected from applying for a residence permit, even if they have worked in Sweden. It also prevents those who had already obtained a work permit from extending it.The decision is estimated to have put 4,700 people who were established in Swedish society at risk of deportation.Sköld added: “People [who] are well integrated and established in Sweden … are asking: ‘What else could I have done? … How could I possibly prove my worth if even doing everything that is supposedly correct isn’t enough and will never be enough?’”Life in the return centres is tough. The facility near Arlanda, which also houses new arrivals, is an “open” centre, meaning people can come and go. But getting around from there is logistically difficult and many people are getting by on a few kronor a day. It was a difficult place to be in for children, said Sköld, who said her team heard from LGBTQ asylum seekers that the shared spaces could feel unsafe. Many there suffer from poor mental health as a result of their precarious circumstances.“There is a lot of fear, a lot of anxiety,” she said. “People who have received a deportation order fear being deported any day.”View image in fullscreenThamer says his sons are willing and able to work.Photograph: Josefine Stenersen/The GuardianThamer and Faten are a married couple who came to Sweden from Iraq on work visas with their two sons, who are now 20 and 16. Their third son was born in Sweden in 2021. But they now face deportation after their asylum applications were denied and work visas expired. Thamer said that a criminal organisation has threatened to harm their children if they return to Iraq.“There are people who have lived in Sweden for 30 years but they don’t talk Swedish like me,” said Thamer, 52. “I write as well, not just speak. What do they want more than that? I am not a criminal.”Thamer said he was offered a job as a car mechanic but was unable to take it because his work visa had expired. “Sweden wants men and I have three. Can they not make use of them?”The Swedish migration agency said it was unable to comment on individual cases. It was “working to ensure that the [reception and return centres] are safe for everyone staying there, with particular consideration given to children and other vulnerable groups, such as LGBTQ persons”, a spokesperson said.*Those interviewed requested their surnames not be published as their cases arein processExplore more on these topicsSwedenEuropeMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

One person was killed and four wounded in Russian drone attacks on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, according to Kyiv City Military Administration head Tymur Tkachenko.US-brokered talks betweenUkraineand Russia resumed on Saturday in Abu Dhabi, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.The rare trilateral talks to end the nearly four-year war began in the UAE on Friday.Ukraine’s foreign minister accused Russian president Vladimir Putin on Saturday of “cynically” ordering a massive missile strike while delegations fromUkraine, Russia and the US were in Abu Dhabi for Washington-brokered peace talks.Andrii Sybiha wrote on X: “Cynically, Putin ordered a brutal massive missile strike against Ukraine right while delegations are meeting in Abu Dhabi to advance the America-led peace process. His missiles hit not only our people, but also the negotiation table.”Before Saturday’s bombardment, Kyiv had already endured two mass overnight attacks since the New Year that knocked out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings.Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said on Saturday that 800,000 people in Kyiv - where temperatures were around -10 Celsius - had been left without power after the latest Russian assault.Russia’s large overnight strike on Ukrainian energy facilities showed that agreements on air defence made with US president Donald Trump in Davos this week must be “fully implemented,” president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday.Zelenskyy and Trump met at the World Economic Forum on Thursday and discussed air defence support forUkraine, although afterwards neither leader specified what was agreed.The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday its forces had completed the takeover of the village of Starytsya in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region.Moscow’s troops also carried out a massive strike overnight on Ukrainian long-range drone sites and energy facilities, the ministry said.Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen on Saturday slammed US president Donald Trump for saying Nato allies had shied away from the front line in Afghanistan.“I fully understand that Danish veterans have said no words can describe how much this hurts,” she said on Facebook.India andEuropehope to strike the “mother of all deals” when EU chiefs meet prime minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi next week, as the two economic behemoths seek to forge closer ties, AFP reports.Facing challenges from China and the United States, India and the European Union have been negotiating a massive free trade pact – and talks, first launched about two decades ago, are nearing the finishing line.Germany is facing calls to withdraw its billions of euros’ worth of gold from US vaults, spurred on by the shift in transatlantic relations and the unpredictability ofDonald Trump.Germany holds the world’s second biggest national gold reserves after the US, of which approximately €164bn (£122bn) worth – 1,236 tonnes – is stored in New York.ShareUpdated at08.05 EST"

That’s why our gold is no longer safe in the Fed’s vaults,” Jäger told theRheinische Post. “What happens if the Greenland provocation continues? … The risk is increasing that the German Bundesbank will no longer be able to access its gold. Therefore, it should repatriate its reserves.”Jäger said he had written last year to the Bundesbank and the finance ministry, urging them to “bring our gold home”.Until recently the gold issue has been the preserve mainly of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which has repeatedly urged the return of the gold for patriotic reasons. But it has increasingly crept into the mainstream discourse.Katharina Beck, the finance spokesperson for the opposition Greens in the Bundestag, has also spoken out in favour of relocating the gold bars, calling them an “important anchor of stability and trust”, which “must not become pawns in geopolitical disputes”.However, Clemens Fuest, the president of the Institute for Economic Research (Ifo) and one of the country’s most prominent economists, warned against such a move, saying it could lead to unintended consequences and would “only pour oil on the fire of the current situation”, he told the Rheinische Post.Germany’s total gold reserves are worth almost €450bn.Just over half are held at the Bundesbank in Frankfurt am Main, 37% in the vaults of the US Federal Reserve in New York and 12% at the Bank of England in London, the global centre of gold trading. The Bundesbank says it regularly undertakes an audit of the supplies of gold it holds in storage.Speaking last October at the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) autumn meetings in Washington DC, the Bundesbank president, Joachim Nagel, assured attenders there was “no cause for concern” over the German gold held at the US Federal Reserve.World is entering time of ‘great power politics’, warns German chancellorRead moreFrauke Heiligenstadt, the parliamentary group spokesperson on financial policy for the Social Democrats, junior partners in the government, said that while she understood concerns about the gold reserves, there was no need for panic.“Germany’s gold reserves are well diversified,” she said. Because half of them are located in Frankfurt, “our ability to act is guaranteed”. Having gold in New York made sense, she added, because “Germany, Europe and the US are closely linked in terms of financial policy”.But, amid Trump’s hardening rhetoric towards his western partners, an increasing number of Merz’s Christian Democrats have been speaking out in favour of relocation.“Due to the Trump administration, the US is no longer a reliable partner,” Ulrike Neyer, a professor of economics at the University of Düsseldorf, told the Rheinische Post.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEconomicsGoldDonald TrumpUS politicsEuropeCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The announcement quelled concerns the offensive would restart on Saturday and gave more space for diplomacy, but did not solve the root cause of the conflict between the two sides.Fighting over three contested neighbourhoods inAleppoin early January led to a sweeping government offensive in which the SDF lost the majority of its territory in the country in a matter of days.The ceasefire was meant to give time for the SDF to implement a 14-point plan with the Syrian government under which the Kurdish militia would disband and its soldiers integrate into the Syrian army.If the SDF did not implement the agreement, Damascus would resume its offensive and push toward the last strongholds of the SDF in Hasakeh, and the Kurdish-majority areas of Qamishli and Kobane.The two sides spent the ceasefire preparing for the eventuality of a full-scale war.SDF forces built up in Kurdish-majority areas while its leaders called for a general mobilisation among residents there, distributing weapons to those willing to take up arms.View image in fullscreenA protester at a demonstration in the northern Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaimaniyah to oppose the deployment of Syrian government forces in formerly Kurdish-led areas in Syria.Photograph: Shwan Mohammed/AFP/Getty ImagesSyrian government soldiers and tanks streamed towards the frontline, hoping to bring the north-east under the control of Damascus. “Soon we will be in Hasakeh and then Qamishli, God willing,” a soldier said on Thursday while standing guard as logistics convoys moved towards the Hasakeh front.As soldiers waited on the battlefield, Syrian officials and regional powers were engaged in a bout of diplomacy to avoid resuming the war. The SDF leader, Mazloum Abdi, went to Iraqi Kurdistan for the second time, where he met the US envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, who has been mediating talks between the SDF and Damascus.Abdi also spoke on the phone to the Syrian foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani, which was followed by an agreement allowing the safe transfer of SDF fighters from a besieged prison in Syrian government-controlled territory.“Ideally, the transfer of Daesh [Islamic State] prisoners from Syria should take place. While this is happening, the existing non-conflict environment needs to be maintained,” the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, said on Friday, referring to the US-facilitated transfer of more than 7,000 suspected IS members and fighters from Syria to Iraq.Disputes between the two sides remain even with the ceasefire extension. The 14-point plan would bring an end to the autonomous Syrian Kurdish project, and Kurdish leaders seemed to struggle to come to terms with their losses over the last two weeks, which has left them with little leverage.The SDF went from controlling nearly a third of the country, including its oil fields, breadbasket and key infrastructure, to just a few cities. The deal on the table would turn the Kurdish force, which not so long ago boasted of being 100,000 strong, into essentially a municipality overseeing a local police force running a few Kurdish cities in the north-east of the country.Abdi, long known as a pragmatic figure among the SDF, has signalled he would be willing to implement the deal.He is struggling, however, to gain consensus within the SDF.If he is unable to unify the SDF and implement the agreement with the government, then the alternative would be war. Damascus has made it clear it would no longer tolerate non-state armed groups and is determined to unify the country under its flag, either through negotiations or force.The US, which has backed the Kurdish force for the past decade, has made its support for Damascus clear, with Barrack saying the SDF’s role as the anti-IS force in Syria had now been filled by the Syrian government.View image in fullscreenThe president of Iraqi Kurdistan, Nechirvan Barzani (right), meets the head of the SDF), Mazloum Abdi, in Erbil.Photograph: Iraqi Kurdistan Presidency/AFP/Getty ImagesThe US military has already began transferring IS prisoners from Kurdish territories to prevent any escapes ahead of a renewed war with Damascus. Once IS prisoners are secured, there will be little strategic interests left for a US military presence in north-east Syria.Even if Damascus has the military advantage and regional backing, it is still hoping to prevent a war. Its offensive so far has led to relatively few casualties, as the SDF has opted to withdraw from Arab-majority areas such as Raqqa and Deir el-Zour rather than confront the Syrian government.Fighting in Kurdish-majority areas is likely to be more bloody.There is fear among Kurdish civilians of the Syrian government fighters, after government-backedmassacres in Druze-majority Suweida province and in the Alawite-majority Syrian coastlast year.Many residents in Kurdish-majority areas have armed themselves. Kurdish forces have dug in, having prepared for this fight for years, creating a vast subterranean tunnel network to facilitate guerrilla fighting against a better armed force.Damascus is aware that even if it wins the war, it could drive away the Kurds, push the SDF underground and create a insurgency similar to that of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Turkey for years to come.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaIslamic StateAlepponewsShareReuse this content"

I’d rather not see anything happen, but we’re watching them very closely … we have an armada … heading in that direction, and maybe we won’t have to use it.”The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers are due to arrive in the Middle East in the coming days. Additional air defence systems are being deployed, most likely around US and Israeli airbases. The UK said it would send RAF Eurofighter Typhoon jets from 12 Squadron to Qatar, at Doha’s request.Iran will treat any attack “as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible” a senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Friday ahead of the arrival of the US aircraft carrier strike group.The US president pulled back from attacking Iran two weeks ago, despitepromising “help is on its way”, largely because he felt he had been given no military option that would prove decisive in securing regime change in Tehran. He was also urged to hold back by the Gulf states.A map showing the location of USS Abraham LincolnIn an update on Friday, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said the death toll from the Iranian crackdown on protesters had reached 5,002 – comprising 4,716 demonstrators, 203 government-affiliated people, 43 children and 40 civilians not taking part in the protests.‘He hoped Trump’s help would arrive’: why protesters in Iran feel betrayedRead moreThe agency’s numbers have been accurate in previous unrest in Iran and rely on a network of activists there to verify deaths. HRANA said at least 26,541 people had been arrested.The protests started on 28 December when traders took to the streets in Tehran in response to a sudden dip in the value of the rial. As they spread, demands expanded to include calls for an end to the country’s government, creating the most serious and deadliest unrest in the country since the 1979 revolution.View image in fullscreenTrump speaks with reporters onboard Air Force One after leaving the World Economic Forum in Davos.Photograph: Evan Vucci/APSpeaking at an emergency session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Volker Türk, the UN commissioner for human rights, said thousands of people, including children, had been killed on the streets and in residential areas. He said video evidence showed there were hundreds in morgues with fatal injuries to their heads and chests, while hundreds of security personnel had also been killed.He urged Iran to “end their brutal repression”, including summary trials, and urged a complete moratorium on the use of the death penalty.Türk decried Iran’s judiciary chief this week saying there would be no leniency for the thousands detained, saying it was a “chilling development”. “I am deeply concerned by contradictory statements from the Iranian authorities about whether those detained in connection with the protests may be executed,” he said, pointing out that Iran “remains among the top executioner states in the world”, with at least 1,500 people reportedly put to death there last year.The Iranian authorities have sought to delegitimise the protests by claiming rioters infiltrated peaceful protests. “None of this would justify resorting to disproportionate use of force or coercing families,” Türk said. He claimed there had been 100 forced confessions and a lack of transparency about proceedings, with those arrested including lawyers, human rights activists, cafe owners, athletes and actors.The internet shutdown was the longest recorded in Iran and had severely restricted communications making it difficult for families to check on the welfare of their loved ones, he said.Mai Sato, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, demanded to be able to visit Iran for a thorough investigation. “The Iranian people have shown enormous courage by talking truth to power,” she said, and urged the international community to reciprocate.“Lethal force can only be used as a last resort to protect life and must be lawful, necessary and proportionate. I’ve received countless videos showing security forces using lethal force against unarmed protesters.”The protest movement has largely petered out in the face of the crackdown, which was accompanied by anunprecedented internet blackout, though chants of “death to the dictator” are taking place at bitter and often well-attended funerals.View image in fullscreenA burnt-out bus depot damaged during recent anti-government protests in Tehran.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAVideos are still trickling out from inside Iran showing how security forces were given licence to shoot to kill protesters, especially from 5-8 January.One of the main reformist newspapers, Ham-Mihan, has been shut down for printing two stories: one on the pursuit of protesters in a hospital and the other detailing the severity and brutality of the suppression more widely.Many leading reformists have not been able to express their views on the crackdown, and the few that have been allowed to address wider audiences seem to be blaming both sides for a collapse in social solidarity brought on by a crash in the exchange rate. The extent to which these problems are caused by sanctions or internal inefficiency is debated.Map showing location of US troops in the middle eastIn his longest reflection to date on the violence, the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist elected 18 months ago, claimed “the civil and just protest of the people was turned into a bloody and violent battle due to a conspiracy by those who wish Iran ill will”.Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, took credit while in Davos for the protests, saying US sanctions had led to the unrest and that maximum economic sanctions “worked because in December, their economy collapsed”.He added: “We saw a major bank go under. The central bank has started to print money. There is a dollar shortage. They are not able to get imports, and this is why the people took to the streets. This is economic statecraft, no shots fired, and things are moving in a very positive way here.”Trump has repeatedly left open the option of new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s12-day war in Juneaimed at degrading Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. But the prospect of immediate American action seemed to have receded in recent days, with both sides insisting on giving diplomacy a chance.Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi, who heads Iran’s Khatam-al Anbiya Central Headquarters, which coordinates the army and the Revolutionary Guards, warned the US on Thursday that any military strike on Iran would turn all US bases in the region into “legitimate targets”.Explore more on these topicsIranDonald TrumpUS militaryUS foreign policyProtestMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It will set standards and training for police forces and acquire new technology such as facial recognition cameras – acontroversial movethat has provokedfierce criticismover its impact on privacy and human rights – on behalf of all police forces.A joint statement from the Met, counter-terrorism policing and the National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “Modern crime requires a modern policing response. We support and have been calling for this ambitious step to bring together some of the most capable policing teams in the country into a single National Police Service.“This builds on the high international regard that already exists among partners for counter-terrorism policing, whose capabilities and professionalism are recognised globally.“This transformation, however, must be delivered with care. Its success depends on maintaining strong connections with local policing and the communities we serve.“Neighbourhood officers remain indispensable in disrupting organised crime and countering terrorism. Their relationships, insights and presence on the ground are foundational to public safety.“As we implement this reform programme, protecting those vital local links will be essential to ensuring the new National Police Service strengthens – not separates – the bond between policing and the public.”The NPS will be created in stages, working alongside existing agencies and regional organised crime units for the transition.Backing the plans, Neil Basu, former head of counter-terrorism policing, said NPS will be “far more capable as one national security system dealing more effectively with major crime, organised crime and terrorism in all its forms”.Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Crime Agency, which would be merged into the new organisation, is also supporting the proposals.“I am proud of the brilliant work NCA officers do to protect the public from serious and organised crime and new and emerging threats,” he said. “But the overall policing system is out of date. Crime has changed, technology has changed, and how we respond needs to change.“As part of reform, we need a single, stronger national law enforcement body, building on the NCA and others, to more coherently tackle organised crime, fraud, terrorism and the new international and online threats we face.”Biggar added: “These are threats that affect us all locally, but need a national and international response. Such a body would enable us to improve how we protect the public, our communities and the country.”Sir Mark Rowley, the head of the Metropolitan police, has also previously supported the idea of the national responsibility for counter-terrorism being removed from his force.But the plans were met with concern on the part of Graham Wettone, a policing analyst.Wettone is a former frontline operational officer of 30 years’ experience who specialised in public order, policing protests and demonstrations.Poorly performing police forces to be named and shamed under new plansRead moreHe said: “Hopefully they have consulted with those people actually doing the job: operational frontline officers and frontline detectives, the detectives actually going out investigating crime, police officers in uniform answering calls.“I don’t believe they have. From what I’m hearing, it seems to me it’s largely come from the Home Office, from people that have advised or guided the Home Office as to what policing needs, having never actually done the job at all – possibly from police leaders who haven’t actually done the job for some period of time.”But, he added: “Fraud investigations are complex, so probably do need a national overview. Because there’s now a huge amount of online fraud, it covers many areas of the country, so having one force managing it is very, very difficult when your offenders and your victims can be in Lancashire, Yorkshire and Devon and Cornwall.“So it makes sense. It makes sense to nationalise some aspects as organised crime groups don’t stick to county boundaries. They literally work across the country, and will move people across the country from force to force area.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceShabana MahmoodPolice and crime commissionersnewsShareReuse this content"

It will cost too much to fight the Manchester mayoralty and there is no guarantee we would win it.”The fight over Labour’s future crystallised on Saturday evening, when Burnham submitted his application to run in the seat alongside a letter to the party’s ruling national executive committee (NEC).He wrote in the letter: “I see this byelection as the frontline of that fight for the Manchester Way and I feel I owe it to a city which has given me so much to lead it from the front, despite the risks involved.”He said he wanted to run a “hopeful and unifying” campaign. If selected, he would face strong challenges from Reform UK and the Green party.The NEC could meet as soon as Sunday morning to decide whether to let Burnham resign from the mayoralty and to put himself forward to the local party for selection as their candidate.While NEC members are free to cast their votes however they wish, the prime minister’s allies have a majority on the committee and are expected to vote against Burnham should those around Downing Street make it clear that’s what they want.One person with knowledge of the committee’s processes said: “There are significant cost implications to having a mayoral selection and byelection, it’s reasonable to expect mayors to serve their term.”Starmer faces pressure not to block Andy Burnham’s return to parliamentRead moreThe byelection was called this week afterthe resignation of the former minister Gwynne, who announced he was standing down because of ill health. Gwynne sat as an independent after being suspended from Labour over offensive WhatsApp messages.It has long been rumoured that Burnham would mount a bid to replace Gwynne. Days before the party’s conference in Liverpool last year, Burnham told the Telegraph that Labour MPshad contacted him over the summer, asking him to stand, after becoming concerned at Starmer’s growing unpopularity.Polling suggests Starmer is one of the least popular Labour prime ministers ever and Labour MPs are increasingly concerned about how his leadership will impact May’s local elections.View image in fullscreenBurnham’s application could still be blocked by Labour’s national executive committee, the party’s ruling body which is dominated by Starmer allies.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesIn his letter, Burnham said Greater Manchester faced a “direct threat” to “everything [it] has always been about from a brand of politics which seeks to pit people against each other”, perceived as a reference to the growth of the populist right.Some polling has suggested Burnham is the only Labour candidate who could see off a challenge from Nigel Farage’s party.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, and Labour’s deputy leader, Lucy Powell, both told the Fabian Society’s conference on Saturday that Burnham should be allowed to stand.Khan told the event in central London: “I’m a firm believer in the best team having all the talent playing for them, and if Andy wants to return to parliament, I will try and make some time between now and the byelection to knock on some doors for him.”Meanwhile Powell, who represents the neighbouring Manchester Central constituency, said the NEC should be wary of blocking Burnham from standing.She said it should be up to Burnham and party members in the constituency whether he is allowed to be the Labour candidate. She praised Burnham as “incredibly popular” and as having changed Manchester “for the better”.She said: “It should be up to Andy and the local members who will select their candidate, and our members are very discerning.”Powell also acknowledged Labour could easily lose to either Reform or the Green party if the wrong candidate was selected.“In that context, I always want to see the very best candidate, the person who can most help Labour win in that very difficult byelection,” she said. “I want to see the best candidates come forward and be able to come forward and help us win.”Can Andy Burnham calm the anger in a Manchester seat Labour fears losing?Read moreHealth secretary Wes Streeting, perceived as Burnham’s biggest rival for the leadership should Starmer be deposed, refused to say whether he would support Burnham’s candidacy.“This is a decision for the party, not for the cabinet,” he said. “I have been told in no uncertain terms that is my answer to the question. This is a really critical byelection. We have to work hard to earn people’s trust and to earn every vote. We want the best possible candidate for that byelection.”However, he added: “In the last day or so, without having indicated whether he wants to run, I’ve seen some pretty unkind things said about Andy, as usual from people who don’t put their names on this sort of briefing.“I think that is a disgraceful way to treat someone who is a Labour mayor, part of our team and part of our movement.”Two members of the government have now said they think Burnham should be allowed to run. Energy secretary Ed Miliband, who led the party between 2010 and 2015, said: “I very much hope the local party will have the option of selectingAndy Burnhamas the candidate.”Miatta Fahnbulleh, parliamentary undersecretary of state in the housing, communities and local government, said: “We’ve got the fight of our lives on our hands to beat Reform, which we have a moral duty to the country to do, and we need our best team on the pitch.“So if he wants to put his hat in the ring and if he can persuade his members and persuade the electorate to bring him in then I think he would be an asset.”View image in fullscreenMiatta Fahnbulleh MP speaks during the Co-operative party conference last year. She said Burnham ‘would be an asset’ if he could persuade members and the electorate to vote him in.Photograph: Jeff Moore/PAOther ministers believe it would be a mistake to allow Burnham to run.“I know No 10 is inept but surely they are not inept enough to allow a man to enter parliament for the sole purpose of challenging the prime minister,” one said.Another said that it would be a “big decision” for the national executive committee, who will have to consider the prospect of a costly mayoral byelection.“If he stands, it will be to go on the backbenches until the prime minister decides to give him a role,” one Starmer ally added.“These are the facts he needs to consider. There is no vacancy for leader if that is where his ambition lies. Very few in the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] would welcome the distraction of any talk of a leadership challenge.”Another backbench MP added: “We are gearing up for crucial elections across the country. We really don’t need a Burnham circus taking resources away – he needs to put the party before personal ambition for a change.“Besides, a mayoral byelection would cost around £5m. It simply wouldn’t be right to cut short his term in this way.”Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamLabourKeir StarmerGreater ManchesterManchesterByelectionsLabour party leadershipnewsShareReuse this content"

I think we can do that.”With Labour flagging in the polls,Keir Starmerunder pressure and unpopular domestically, and dozens of MPs worried about hanging on to their seats at the next election, the view that the party should have its best players on the pitch is one widely shared.But the question pondered by many insideLabouron Saturday, as they whiled away the long hours until the 5pm deadline for Gorton and Denton byelection applications, was whether Andy Burnham sees himself as the star striker on the team, or its captain.‘The best interests of our party’: Andy Burnham’s letter to Labour NEC in fullRead moreBurnham is fully aware that many will see his return as just the first step in his plan to take over from Keir Starmer as leader. In his letter to Labour’s ruling national executive committee (NEC), posted on social media at 5pm on the dot, Burnham confronted that head on.“I would be there to support the work of the government, not undermine it, and I have passed on this assurance to the prime minister,” he wrote.But does anybody believe him? Within moments of the byelection being confirmed last Thursday, Starmer’s allies had alreadylaunched a “Stop Andy” campaignto prevent the Labour mayor from returning to parliament.With the party machinery tightly controlled by Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, it may look as though it would be an all but impossible task for Burnham to make it past the NEC to run.Party insiders point to the cost of a mayoral byelection campaign in Greater Manchester, which would mean that about £500,000 of party funding was diverted from other races across Britain. “That alone should be enough to say no,” said one NEC source.Burnham’s insistence that he would be a team player has, unsurprisingly, been meet with scepticism in some quarters.“If anyone believes he’s doing it to support rather than undermine the government, I have a bridge to sell them. The NEC should just make the argument that we all know what Andy is up to and they won’t stand for it,” one minister said.Several Labour MPs drew parallels to Boris Johnson, who re-entered parliament in a byelection while still London mayor, whiledenying it was the start of a campaignto get into Downing Street. Once elected, he spent years undermining subsequent prime ministers before he achieved his aim.Yet there is a powerful lineup of party figures on Burnham’s side. They include Lucy Powell, her predecessor Angela Rayner, the former leader Ed Miliband, the London mayor Sadiq Khan, the two biggest unions, numerous MPs and party members. There would be significant disquiet if he was blocked.The NEC is not, of course, his only hurdle. He would actually have to win the seat – potentially facing Reform UK and pro Gaza independents. Even the Green party leader, Zack Polanski, is considering running.Burnham’s regional approval ratings are high. He is not known as the King of the North for nothing. According to Ipsos, he’s on +25 among voters in the north-west – the only politician with a positive rating – while Nigel Farage is on -29 and Starmer is on -40.Andy Burnham applies to stand for Labour in Gorton and Denton byelectionRead moreBut even if he makes it back to Westminster, a leadership contest is by no means automatic. While many MPs are despairing of Starmer, fearing that he will be unable to turn things round, the No 10 operation has been trying to woo them since the autumn.Starmerites argue that trying to remove their man during a period of such global instability would be deeply unwise. They add that the experience of running a city region is a world away from that of running a country.But nobody denies the May elections present the next moment of great peril for the prime minister. And if Burnham were back in parliament, he would be in position to strike.Another concern among MPs that could yet save Starmer: that a coup less than two years after winning a huge majority would cast Labour in the same light as the Tories, with their five prime ministers in less than 10 years.Powell, one of Burnham’s closest allies, touched on this in her speech, perhaps inadvertently. Notably, it was the line that got the loudest applause from the audience.“I’ve been saying openly and publicly over the last few weeks that people have got to get behind Keir Starmer,” she told them. “We are one Labour team, and I don’t want to see this byelection … emerge into more infighting and talking about ourselves.” It may already be too late.Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerLabouranalysisShareReuse this content"

Most recently, the justice department instigated acriminal investigationagainst Powell for testimony he gave about renovations at the Fed’s headquarters. Even so, the Fed has not budged.Tactically, Trump’s assault on the Fed appears to be no different than his overhaul of the entire federal government. The president has learned if he pushes hard enough, he can get his way. And he has mostly been successful.But with the Fed, it seems that Trump may have met his match. At least as far as the supreme court is concerned. On Wednesday, the court’s justices, in oral arguments, appearedresoundingly skepticalof Trump’s firing of the Fed governor Lisa Cook.But while the justices’ skepticism could be interpreted as a sign that the court is checking executive authority, legal experts warn that any ruling against him may not be a harsh check on Trump’s power.Instead, the court appears to be carving out a special exception for the Fed at a time when the independence of other government agencies is still under threat.“The consequences are potentially very harmful,” said Michael Dorf, a law professor at Cornell University. “The supreme court is making war on independent agencies at the worst possible moment – which is to say at a moment when you have a president who wants to centralize power in himself and wants to appoint people who are there because of their loyalty to him and [who] have no particular expertise.”Trump fired Cook in August, alleging that she committed mortgage fraud by listing more than one property as her primary home, a move that would give her a better mortgage rate. The accusations were first posted on social media, and a few days later, Trump removed Cook. The White House made an appeal to the highest court after a lower federal courttemporarily reinstatedCook into her role.Because Cook’s firing was haphazard, with no investigation or formal hearing about the alleged mortgage fraud, Trump’s case against Cook has opened up a host of questions the court could answer in a ruling. Were Cook’s due-process rights violated because she didn’t receive a hearing? Even if the mortgage allegations are true (Cook’s lawyerssaythey have evidence it was an “inadvertent mistake”), does mortgage fraud that took place before she was appointed a Fed governor constitute grounds for her removal? Should the case have been decided on by a lower court before reaching the supreme court?Making matters even more complicated is the nature of the Fed. The US central bank was created to be a quasi-private, independent government agency that is supposed to be protected from politics. Fed officials can only be fired by the president “for cause”, though the law doesn’t specify what “cause” is.Running in the background of the case is a big question, one that could have repercussions for the global economy: how much power will the supreme court allow a president to have over the Fed?Typically, constitutional experts look to see how the supreme court has decided similar cases, and Cook’s firing was far from the first test of Trump’s executive powers.Last year, Trump fired independent officials, including two Democratic-appointed members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which oversees unions, and Rebecca Slaughter, the commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which regulates telecommunications and media.The supreme court allowed Trump’s firing of the officials to stand, and in Slaughter’s case, constitutional experts anticipate a landmark ruling that will strengthen executive power for decades to come.Some within the US conservative legal movement have beenadvocatingfor the “unitary executive” theory – the idea that the president should be able to fire any executive branch officers at will. At the heart of this belief is the idea that the votes of the American people should be the only check on the president.For conservative justices on the supreme court who support that theory, Trump’s second term has given them the perfect opportunity. Constitutional analysts say that Slaughter’s FTC firing, which is still pending, will allow the court to narrow or even overturn Humphrey’s Executor v United States, a landmark case from 1935 that limited the president’s power to fire executive officials of independent agencies.But while conservative justices appear keen to hand the president even more power, there seems to be a single exception: the Fed.The supreme court even mentioned the central bank when it allowed Trump’s NLRB firings to go through, a notable event given that the Fed had nothing to do with the case.“The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,” the court’s majority wrote at the time.Many took this as a signal from the court that, should Trump try to fire an executive within the Fed, the court would resist.Legal experts point out that, by law, the Fed’s structure within the federal government is no different than the other quasi-private, independent agencies.“The elephant in the room in this oral argument is how come, when it comes to Lisa Cook, suddenly the judges are interested in enforcing the statute [of independence]. Whereas with Rebecca Slaughter … and all these other people he improperly removed, they just conclude the status doesn’t matter. His constitutional authority allows him to remove anybody for any reason. Like, what’s going on here?” said Lev Menand, a professor at Columbia Law School.The justices’ rationale seems to be as much economic as legal. Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the 6-3 conservative majority on the court, brought up the fact that “we have amicus briefs from economists who tell us that if Governor Cook is [fired], that it could trigger a recession”.“How should we think about the public interest in a case like this?” she asked.Brett Kavanaugh, another conservative, asked Trump’s justice department direct questions about the “real-world” importance of Fed independence.“Let’s talk about the real-world downstream effects of this, because if this were set as a precedent, it just seems to me – just thinking big picture – what goes around comes around,” Kavanaugh said. “All of the current president’s appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029 if there’s Democratic president … so what are we doing here?”The power of the Fed comes largely from its ability to set interest rates. High interest rates make borrowing more expensive. It can slow inflation at the risk of increasing unemployment. That Trump wants lower interest rates is not surprising: lower interest rates can give the economy a short-term boost, but at the risk of rising prices later.It’s a balancing act that requires looking at the economic data and thinking about what’s best for the long-term stability of the economy, not the political fortunes of whoever is in power. Mess with that independence, and economic shocks such as a recession could be triggered.With Trump’s case against Cook, “an unstoppable force has met an immovable object”, Menand said. While a majority of the justices may be fine with cutting down, for example, the FTC’s independence, “it’s a totally different game when it comes to the Federal Reserve”.“Large business interests don’t want to see the Federal Reserve’s capacity degraded. They don’t want to see the Federal Reserve politicized,” Menand said.To many legal scholars, the supreme court has been very lenient with Trump’s executive power, even beyond the issue of independent agencies. Over the last year, the court has allowed the administration tocontinueaggressive immigration enforcement tactics and has blocked lower courts from issuing nationwide injunctions that, as in his first term, could block some of his executive actions.“One thing that concerns me a little bit is that if the court rules against Trump in the tariffs case, and in Cook, it will have gotten unearned prestige for being unbiased and standing up to Trump,” Dorf said. “You stand up to him at the most extreme edge of what he does, [but] you’re still allowing him to do all sorts of things that, in prior circumstances, we would have said the court ought to stand up to. But they’re not.”It’s unclear when the court will release its decision on Cook’s case, though it will probably issue a ruling by June.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyEconomicsDonald TrumpUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump claimed he had reached “the framework of a future deal” on Greenland.In a New York Post interviewpublishedon Saturday, Trump boasted that the US will gain sovereignty and take ownership over land in Greenland where American bases are located.“We’ll have everything we want,” Trump reportedly told the Post. “We have some interesting talks going on.”Meanwhile, in the same Post interview published on Saturday, TrumpsaidUS refineries will process the oil his administration had taken from seized Venezuelan tankers.“Let’s put it this way – they don’t have any oil,” Trump told the Post. “We take the oil.”The oil is being refined in “various places” including Houston, he said.The US military hasseizedseven Venezuela-linked tankers since the start of Trump’s month-long campaign to control Venezuela’s oil flows. Trump said on Tuesday that his administration had taken 50m barrels of oil out of Venezuela and was selling some of it in the open market.The intercepted vessels either were under US sanctions or said to be part of a “shadow fleet” ofships that disguisetheir origins to move oil from major sanctioned producers: Iran, Russia or Venezuela.Trump’s Latin American foreign policy has homed in on Venezuela, initially aiming to push the Venezuelan president,Nicolás Maduro, from power. After failing to accomplish that aim through diplomacy, Trump ordered US forces to fly into the country to grab Maduro and his wife in an overnight raid on 3 January, bringing them to New York to face criminal drug-related charges anddetaining themthere.In Saturday’s interview with the Post, Trump bragged that a new weapon he called “the discombobulator” played a central role in that raid.Those remarks came after the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,sharedon social media a purported eyewitness account of the US military using some sort of “very intense sound wave” to incapacitate Maduro’s bodyguards.Trump has said the US plans to control Venezuela’s oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country’s dilapidated oil industry in a $100bn plan thatis promptingmany raised eyebrows, not least fromenvironmentalistsand the US oil giants.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyDonald TrumpCanadaChinaTrump tariffsTariffsOilnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s why our gold is no longer safe in the Fed’s vaults,” Jäger told theRheinische Post. “What happens if the Greenland provocation continues? … The risk is increasing that the German Bundesbank will no longer be able to access its gold. Therefore, it should repatriate its reserves.”Jäger said he had written last year to the Bundesbank and the finance ministry, urging them to “bring our gold home”.Until recently the gold issue has been the preserve mainly of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), which has repeatedly urged the return of the gold for patriotic reasons. But it has increasingly crept into the mainstream discourse.Katharina Beck, the finance spokesperson for the opposition Greens in the Bundestag, has also spoken out in favour of relocating the gold bars, calling them an “important anchor of stability and trust”, which “must not become pawns in geopolitical disputes”.However, Clemens Fuest, the president of the Institute for Economic Research (Ifo) and one of the country’s most prominent economists, warned against such a move, saying it could lead to unintended consequences and would “only pour oil on the fire of the current situation”, he told the Rheinische Post.Germany’s total gold reserves are worth almost €450bn.Just over half are held at the Bundesbank in Frankfurt am Main, 37% in the vaults of the US Federal Reserve in New York and 12% at the Bank of England in London, the global centre of gold trading. The Bundesbank says it regularly undertakes an audit of the supplies of gold it holds in storage.Speaking last October at the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) autumn meetings in Washington DC, the Bundesbank president, Joachim Nagel, assured attenders there was “no cause for concern” over the German gold held at the US Federal Reserve.World is entering time of ‘great power politics’, warns German chancellorRead moreFrauke Heiligenstadt, the parliamentary group spokesperson on financial policy for the Social Democrats, junior partners in the government, said that while she understood concerns about the gold reserves, there was no need for panic.“Germany’s gold reserves are well diversified,” she said. Because half of them are located in Frankfurt, “our ability to act is guaranteed”. Having gold in New York made sense, she added, because “Germany, Europe and the US are closely linked in terms of financial policy”.But, amid Trump’s hardening rhetoric towards his western partners, an increasing number of Merz’s Christian Democrats have been speaking out in favour of relocation.“Due to the Trump administration, the US is no longer a reliable partner,” Ulrike Neyer, a professor of economics at the University of Düsseldorf, told the Rheinische Post.Explore more on these topicsGermanyEconomicsGoldDonald TrumpUS politicsEuropeCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

A person familiar with the discussions told the Associated Press the sides are moving toward an agreement, though a deal has not yet been finalized.For McCarthy, the move would represent a homecoming. The 62-year-old grew up in the Greenfield neighborhood, only a short drive from the Steelers’ South Side practice facility, and now stands poised to take over one of the NFL’s most tradition-bound franchises.He is expected to replace Mike Tomlin, whostepped away earlier this monthafter 19 seasons in charge. Tomlin leaves behind a résumé defined by consistency – 193 regular-season wins, a Super Bowl title and no losing seasons – but also lingering frustration over postseason stagnation. Pittsburgh have exited the playoffs at the first hurdle in each of their last six appearances, all by double-digit margins, including this season’s home defeat by the Houston Texans.McCarthy arrives with a profile unlike the men who preceded him. Since 1969, the Steelers have employed just three head coaches: Hall of Famers Chuck Noll and Bill Cowher, followed by Tomlin. All were relatively untested assistants when hired. McCarthy, by contrast, brings 18 seasons of head-coaching experience and a career record of 185–123–2, including playoff games.Thirteen of those seasons came in Green Bay, where he guided the Packers to a Super Bowl victory after the 2010 season – a win that came at the expense of Tomlin and the Steelers – before spending five years leading the Dallas Cowboys. His tenure in Dallas ended after the 2024 season when the sides failed to agree on a contract extension.The Steelers conducted a wide-ranging search after Tomlin’s departure, interviewing close to a dozen candidates across the league. That group included Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores and Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, whowas hired this week by the Baltimore Ravensto replace John Harbaugh. Ultimately, Pittsburgh landed on experience, entrusting McCarthy with a roster that has hovered in competitive but unspectacular territory for much of the past decade.In many ways, the Steelers’ struggles have centered on quarterback instability. Drafting consistently in the high teens or low 20s has made landing a long-term answer difficult, a problem compounded by the decision not to identify Ben Roethlisberger’s successor early and the failed gamble on first-round pick Kenny Pickett in 2022.IfAaron Rodgersdoes not return for another season, Pittsburgh would open the 2026 campaign with their sixth different Week 1 starting quarterback in six years. Rodgers, who will be a free agent in March, spent last season with the Steelers and won a Super Bowl under McCarthy in Green Bay, a connection that adds intrigue to the hire. The Steelers currently hold the 21st pick in a draft widely viewed as thin at quarterback.Pittsburgh could again prioritize other needs – including wide receiver and cornerback – rather than forcing a quarterback solution. Still, team president Art Rooney II has rejected the idea of a reset.“I don’t like that word that much,” Rooney said recently. “We’ll try to compete day one if we can.”McCarthy’s impending arrival suggests the Steelers intend to do exactly that.Explore more on these topicsPittsburgh SteelersNFLAaron RodgersUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Liverpool pulled level from 2-0 down late on courtesy of Dominik Szoboszlai’s sensational free-kick, but Bournemouth responded impressively and Adli struck a winner from a long throw with almost the last kick.The Liverpool head coach felt the referee, Michael Salisbury, should have played more second-half stoppage time taking in substitutions and video assistant referee checks but admitted he feared aBournemouthwinner. “I think it is safe to say they could have scored 3-2 a little bit earlier,” Slot said, alluding to chances for the Bournemouth pair Evanilson and Ryan Christie. “A few of our players ran out of energy and I cannot even criticise them for that because two days ago [three] we had to play an away game.

There was a free-kick that took two or three minutes, there were VAR moments, there were substitutions. That’s what I said to them.”Slot refused to criticise his captain, Virgil van Dijk, for his defensive error in the buildup to Evanilson’s opener and would not be drawn when asked whether Andy Robertson would remain at the club.

That’s a really cool feeling.”Shiffrin, the 2018 Olympic GS gold medalist, trailed Hector by 0.23 seconds and the American shared the podium with second-placed teammate Paula Moltzan, who was 0.18 off the pace.Shiffrin holds the women’s record for most career World Cup GS wins with 22 but hadn’t had a top-three result in the discipline in 11 events since coming runner-up at a race in Slovakia in January 2024.Six days later, she crashed in a downhill on the course that will be used for the Olympics next month and then didn’t compete in GS again until the start of the 2024-25 season.In November 2024, she sustained a puncture wound to the right side of her abdomen and severe damage to her oblique abdominal muscles in a crash at her home GS in Killington, Vermont, and subsequently suffered from lingering post-traumatic stress disorder.This season, Shiffrin racked up three fourth places before ultimately returning to the podium Saturday, three weeks before the Olympic race in Cortina d’Ampezzo.Moltzan, who’s chasing her maiden career win, got her third podium of the season, leading a strong showing by the US team, with Nina O’Brien in fifth and AJ Hurt in eighth.In the opening run, Hector edged out Camille Rast of Switzerland by 0.02 seconds, with GS rankings leader Julia Scheib of Austria 0.26 back in third.Rast dropped to fourth, while Scheib skied out in the final run.Overall World Cup champion Federica Brignone, who made a strong return to racing from a nine-month injury layoff on Tuesday, and her Italian teammate Sofia Goggia, the 2018 Olympic downhill champion, sat out the event in Czechia, with a weekend of speed racing coming up in Switzerland next week ahead of their home Olympics.A slalom on the same hill is scheduled for Sunday.Explore more on these topicsMikaela ShiffrinSkiingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Now, unexpectedly, it is having a cultural moment.The release ofMarty Supreme, a film steeped in obsession and myth, and loosely based on postwar American table tennis champion Marty Reisman, has pushed ping-pong into the pop-culture mainstream – just as US Major League Table Tennis sells out matches, clubs report growing interest, and younger players pick up paddles for the first time.“The movie has been a catalyst,” says David Silberman, cofounder ofPingPod, which operates table tennis venues across the US northeast. “We’re starting to see it in the data of our business.”In 2022, Silberman started playing table tennis regularly withMarty Supremedirector Josh Safdie – whom he describes as “a solid beginner player” by competitive standards – at Pingpod’s Midtown, New York location. “He’s fascinated by the sport … and how it’s always been considered a second-rate sport,” says Silberman.“When Christmas Day came along and the movie premiered we pretty much immediately saw a 20-40% spike in year-on-year new customer reservations, and existing customer utilisation went up 10-15%. Clearly a wave of new people are picking up the paddle.”Major League Table Tennis (MLTT), the first professional table tennis league in the US, established in 2023, just set an all-time regular season ticket sales record, according to founder Flint Lane. “No doubt some of that is Marty related.”View image in fullscreenLily Zhang is a six-time US national champion and four-time Olympian.Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty ImagesThe sport already had momentum, adds MLTT senior vice-president for marketing, Matt Parker, “but the film has helped reintroduce it to a younger, culture-driven audience that’s now showing up at matches and engaging with our content.”MLTT’s first event since the release of Marty Supreme sold out in Portland, Oregon, at the beginning of the month – markingthe first selloutand the highest regular-season attendance weekend in league history, with more than 2,000 tickets sold.“Table tennis is definitely having a moment right now, and I love to see it,” says Lily Zhang, a six-time US national champion in women’s singles who in Novemberbecame the first womanto rank No 1 on MLTT’s power rankings list. “It’s been a long time coming.Marty Supremehas definitely launched table tennis into the pop culture mainstream, but I would love to see more of that interest translate over to the professional side and in supporting current professional players, because we could really use it.”A 2024 Wall Street Journal profile on Zhang, a four-time Olympian who reached the round of 16 at the Paris Olympics,highlightedhow difficult it is for even the best table tennis players to make a living in the sport in the US. Estimateshave longplaced US participation in table tennis at about 16 million Americans per year, though it is a casual pursuit for most.“People are often surprised when they hear that I’m a professional player – ‘ping pong is an Olympic sport?’ – and a lot of them like to tell me they could ‘probably beat’ me in a match just because they’ve played a lot in their basement,” adds Zhang. “I laugh it off, but it’s really because there is such a lack of understanding of how intense, technical and challenging the professional game is.”The lack of appreciation of the skills of table tennis Olympians was perhaps on show in a recent BBC interview with Timothée Chalamet, who played the titular Marty in Marty Supreme,winning the Golden Globefor best actor ahead of the Oscars in March. The interviewerasked himif he may be able to make the team for the LA Olympics in 2028. Chalamet humbly responded there was less than a one-a-million chance despite having begun training for the role in 2018.View image in fullscreenFans look on as the Chicago Wind take on the Texas Smash during the Major League Tennis Championship last year in Philadelphia.Photograph: Isaiah Vazquez/Getty ImagesOn Instagram,a series of clipsfrom professional table tennis matches feature surreal replays of intense rallies of such a velocity which almost defy belief. It appears to be a matter of time before the American public gets hooked on the drama, and the MLTT says that “wagering is set to launch in the coming months, further expanding fan engagement opportunities.”But while the film has helped spark curiosity, it has also exposed a deeper tension between the chaotic fantasy on screen and the quieter reality of a sport that, for millions of players, is less about rage and lone-wolf genius than focus, discipline, longevity and mental health.“The film has created a cultural ripple,” says Luba Sadovska, co-owner of North Shore Table Tennis Club in Vancouver, Canada, and a former Czechoslovakian national representative player. “We’re seeing new people coming forward who want to join the club as members. A lot of them played years ago, so it really feels like they’re reconnecting with their younger selves.”Her club hosted ahardbat paddle doublestournament after the movie’s release, since part of the Marty Supreme tale is his frustration at being beaten by a Japanese player who was an early adopter of the spongier bat that helped foster the modern game. “It was an absolute blast – great energy, lots of laughter, and a really strong sense of community,” says Sadovska.But inside the sport, “it’s also prompted a kind of reckoning – about what gets mythologized, what gets left out, and what table tennis actually offers in real life.” Anger doesn’t have a place in real table tennis, she says, since it is considered a weakness “and professional players don’t show their weaknesses that easily.”At Vitality Pong Neuro Active Clinic, which Sadovska co-founded, table tennis is played as a neuroactive training tool for people with Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and following strokes. “They’re looking [to attune their] focus and resilience, without burning out or breaking down.”The rapidity of table tennis, with the required quick reflexes, the spin of the ball and the instantaneous processing and coordination demanded of even amateur players, underpins its “profound” set of mental health benefits, adds Silberman, whose company hit a $50m valuationin 2024. “It staves off neurodegenerative diseases,” he says. “It’s just unequivocally a good thing in our society.”Explore more on these topicsTable tennisMarty SupremeUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To do so when your family is watching in the stands and a reporter from your home town newspaper, the Philadelphia Inquirer, is in the press box makes it all the better. Aaronson did all of the above at Elland Road for Leeds United against Manchester United earlier this month.The 2026 World Cup may transform US soccer. The 2030 World Cup could be even betterRead moreBeyond this isolated, personal moment, there is the bigger picture of a player hopinh to catch the eye of the USMNT head coach, Mauricio Pochettino. Such a high-profile goal is certainly one way to do it, as is continuing that good form into subsequent weeks. Once again, Aaronson has done it all.Aaronson scored twice in a subsequent 4-3 defeat at Newcastle United, emerging as one of the best and most prominent players in one of the most dramatic games in the English league so far this season. (Though it should be noted he also conceded a penalty late on from a handball).“I turned off for a minute and I know I can’t lift my hand like this around the box,” he said. “It’sfootball at the end of the day.”The scoring run took the former Philadelphia Union player to four league goals for the season, level with suchPremier Leagueluminaries as Mohamed Salah and Bukayo Saka. Regardless of performance levels, achieving any kind of regular attacking output in the goals and assists columns in the Premier League isn’t easy. Just ask some of the league’s biggest summer signings Benjamin Šeško, Florian Wirtz, Viktor Gyökeres and Xavi Simons, none of whom have more goal contributions than Aaronson, who has three assists to go with his four goals.Being left out of the lineup for Leeds’ subsequent visit to Championship side Derby County in what was ahistoric weekend in the English FA Cupwas less a case of being dropped, more an indication of the American’s importance to his club. Premier League teams will often use the early rounds of cup competitions to rest players considered key to their league campaign. Leeds’ primary aim this year is to avoid relegation, so manager Daniel Farke clearly sees Aaronson’s availability in the league as crucial to achieving that aim. He returned for the club’s next Premier League match, earning a standing ovation at home for his performance against Fulham before being subbed off.Things have not always been this rosy for Aaronson at Leeds. His relationship with the club and its supporters has had its ups and downs, especially when, after Leeds was relegated in 2023, he left on loan for Bundesliga side Union Berlin. It’s the kind of move that can be seen as showing a lack of loyalty, abandoning a team when it needs you the most, but it’s also a fairly common occurrence and can be as much about a club balancing its wage bill as it is a player’s decision.Aaronson returned for the 2024-25 Championship season after an unspectacular spell in Berlin, and went on to be part of the Leeds team that topped the second tier with 100 points to secure a return to the Premier League. Plenty of minutes were logged in that Championship-winning campaign, and plenty of yards covered. It’s a built-in work rate that you get with Aaronson that can soon start to win fans over again, but the addition of goals, assists, and quality in key moments to complement the toil completes the job.Then and now: what has changed since the opening Premier League games?Read moreHis nine goals in the 2024-25 campaign were a career best, and the flurry of goals to begin 2026 has put him on track to better that number in 2025-26 and reach double figures. Christian Pulisic never reached double figures for goals in the Premier League, despite doing so in each of his seasons in Serie A for Milan.In some ways, it has been an unusual Premier League season so far, with the champions Liverpool dropping off despite a record summer transfer spend, Chelsea sacking their Club World Cup-winning manager Enzo Maresca, and Aston Villa and Sunderland making impressive starts.Leeds are in the bottom half of the table, but still eight points above the relegation places. Falling off rather than moving further up will always be the prediction for a newly promoted team, but in a strong and competitive Premier League, Leeds are holding their own, just four points off a congested mid-table gathering and 10 points from a European spot.Aaronson will be key to any further progress. His finishing and decision-making in the final third will need to remain at the new and improved 2026 level, especially since Facundo Buonanotte has just arrived on loan from Brighton as potential competition for his place in the lineup. It will also need to remain at this level to ensure he returns home for the World Cup this summer as a participant rather than an onlooker.“That one felt really good, to be honest with you,”Aaronson toldthe Philadelphia Inquirer’s Jonathan Tannenwald of his goal against Manchester United. “To score against your rival is huge, and I’m really proud of it. And keep going from here.”Keeping going is something Aaronson does better than most. The combination of work rate and quality he possesses can be an asset to any team, and is something Pochettino values. The quality aspect of this dynamic can be fleeting, but the 25-year-old has entered a good run of form at exactly the right time, both for his club’s hopes of remaining in the Premier League and for his USMNT chances in a World Cup year.Explore more on these topicsUSAUS sportsLeeds UnitedPremier LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

McIlroy declared he felt “unconscious” and “brain dead” while en route to a missed cut in East Lothian 13 years ago.The refusal of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers to admit women – a scenariothat changed in 2017– and thelow attendance at Muirfieldon that last visit played a part in the absence of the Open. Yet the venue is still rightly regarded as one of the finest in the world.Patrick Reed unfazed by fines as he hits the front in Dubai Desert ClassicRead moreThe R&A has yet to announce Open sites beyond St Andrews in 2027. Muirfield is at least part of that discussion and rightly so, according to McIlroy. “It would be wonderful if it was,” he said. “I’m not privy to those conversations, but Muirfield deserves to be back on the Open rota.“They rectified the issues they had. It’s a wonderful course. It’s one of the best courses on the rota and in the UK. As well, it has to commercially make sense. I think Mark Darbon [the chief executive] has been brought in to [the R&A] make the Open Championship commercially viable. I would say Muirfield, that area, North Berwick, that would probably be one of the more commercially viable opens.”Portmarnock in Dublin is expected to stage the first Open outside the United Kingdom in the near future. A further and logistical complication with Muirfield is the staging of the Scottish Open at the Renaissance Club, which is essentially next door, on the previous week.View image in fullscreenRory McIlroy suffered in the Open at Muirfield in 2013. Rounds of 79 and 75 meant he missed the cut.Photograph: Toby Melville/ReutersMcIlroy laughed when contemplating 2013. Rounds of 79 and 75 meant he exited at 12 over par. “Could have been my lowest point in my professional career,” said the Masters champion. “I’ve won an Open since then, I’ve played well in the Open. Yeah, 2013 feels like a lifetime ago.”Royal Lytham & St Annes has endured an even longer wait than Muirfield. The Lancashire links last staged the Open in 2012, when Ernie Els prevailed over Adam Scott in dramatic style. The 2029 Open will mark 50 years since Seve Ballesteros triumphed at Lytham.“With Birkdale this year, it would be very early to bring an Open back to that region in 2028,” McIlroy said. “The Women’s Open is at Lytham this year. Usually when the women’s is somewhere, then the men’s seems to follow pretty soon after. That could be the case.”McIlroy was in fine fettle despite missing a short par putt on the 18th hole of his third round at the Dubai Desert Classic. His 71 for a three under par aggregate almost certainly leaves too much to do going into round four. “It’s January,” he said when asked to assess the state of his game.“I am sort of working my way back into form a little bit. It is OK. It’s not exactly where I want it to be, but it is early. I just want to go out and play a good round tomorrow and end the week on a positive note.”Patrick Reed’s 67 means he will take a four-shot lead into the final day at the Emirates Club. Spain’s David Puig is the closest to Reed’s 14 under par aggregate. Andy Sullivan and Viktor Hovland are at minus nine.Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyThe OpenEuropean TourGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

The away end sang “You’re getting sacked in the morning” at full time, making their views clear to the hierarchy and head coach.Cristian Romero salvaged a late point for Tottenhamafter Axel Tuanzebe and Lyle Foster had turned things around to counter Micky van de Ven’s opening goal. The draw leaves Tottenham with two wins in 14 and mired in mid-table.Romero’s late strike rescues point for troubled Tottenham at BurnleyRead more“You can’t say we didn’t do everything to win,” Frank said. “We just need to keep improving. The only way it can be is calm heads, carry on and keep doing what we think is the right thing.“We do more than enough to win the game, we just need to defend better in two situations. And, of course, score another goal that could make the difference at 1-0.”Poor defending assisted Burnley’s comeback. “We can never, ever, ever concede that goal, because it just changes the momentum going into half-time,” Frank said of Tuanzebe’s header.“In the second half we are coming out, we are not as dominant, but I still think we are OK on top. We got a big chance to Dominic Solanke, 2-1 up. And then we concede another goal that we can never, ever, ever concede.”The Tottenham supporters chanted regularly for Frank’s exit during the match. Talks were held last weekend over the head coach’s position, but no definitive action was taken.View image in fullscreenMicky van de Ven put Tottenham in front at Turf Moor but the visitors fell behind before Cristian Romero’s late leveller.Photograph: Peter Powell/Reuters“The message to the fans, as I said the whole time, is that we’re working very hard on making sure everything is going in the right direction and that we’ll keep doing that,” Frank said.“First and foremost, I want to thank them for travelling and supporting the team throughout the game. We could, should have been out of sight. But also they acknowledge the willpower and character of the team that keep running, keep fighting to the end. We just need to keep going.”A point away to Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday should guarantee a top-eight spot in the Champions League and progression to the round of 16, which would help Frank’s cause. The club are also in negotiations with Liverpool overthe signing of the defender Andy Robertson, who would become the second new arrival this month afterConor Gallagher.There were more points dropped late on by Burnley, which has become a regular occurrence this season. “It was only four or five weeks ago I was hugely critical of this team in terms of usat Brighton away, we’ve reacted in an incredible way,” Scott Parker said.“There’s no denying that we need to now turn draws into wins and today, for being so close, you’d hope that would have been the case.

It handed Wolves a first defeat in six and was notable for the referee, Farai Hallam, on his top-flight debut, daring to stick with his decision not to award a penalty after being sent by his video assistant for a pitchside review.That was for a Yerson Mosquera handball and it infuriated Guardiola, though after City’s dire recent form a first three points since 27 December is what matters. The manager reiterated a long-held belief that City can receive unfair officiating and pointed to his 11 injured players as being needed to mitigate against this.Romero’s late strike rescues point for troubled Tottenham at BurnleyRead moreHe said: “I would love to have the players to fight against that – despite these decisions, in nine years it is six Premier Leagues that we have won. It is the first time when a referee goes to the TV and does not overrule the position of the arms.“I am pretty sure tomorrow Howard Webb [PGMO’s chief refereeing operator] is going to appear in the media and explain. The referee makes his debut now everyone will know him.”Guardiola offered the example of Diogo Dalot’s stamp on Jérémy Doku inlast Saturday’s 2-0 loss at Manchester Unitedas another poor decision. While the defender was booked at Old Trafford, Guardiola believed he should have been sent off and cited the leg injury the Belgian suffered. “That’s why Jérémy could not play in Norway against Bodø [where City lost 3-1],” he said.The disputed penalty shout came when Abdukodir Khusanov’s flighted pass was controlled by Omar Marmoush who, turning Mosquera, flicked the ball on to the defender’s left elbow. Marmoush’s subsequent shot hit José Sá’s left post and then VAR ordered Hallam to the screen. While Mosquera’s arm was away from his body he was running so the referee may have ruled this to be a natural position.This was Rob Edwards’s view. “His arm was in a natural position and it was really close,” said the Wolves head coach. “Fair play to Farai in his first game to make that call.”Of Guardiola’s changes, five from the Bodø/Glimt loss, Edwards said: “A few rumours came out he might be making a few and even when the teamsheet came out you don’t know where they are all going to play.”View image in fullscreenFarai Hallam makes an announcement of no penalty, much to the chagrin of Bernardo Silva.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAEdwards is definitely turning his team around, their second-half display sparked by his changes at the break, but the first-half goals from Marmoush and the excellent Antoine Semenyo sealed the win.Pre-kick-off the news was the dropping of Haaland, for a first time due to form, and Foden, the playmaker having started the past 19 league games. Haaland had been in the XI for all 22 league games, but had not scored from open play in his past seven outings. Marmoush and Bernardo Silva were Haaland and Foden’s replacements respectively, and Max Alleyne, Rico Lewis and Rayan Aït-Nouri were also demoted. In came Marc Guéhi at centre-back and Matheus Nunes at right-back, with Semenyo reinstated after not being eligible for the Champions League.City’s opener came when Nunes whipped the ball in from the right and Marmoush stabbed home for a first league goal since his last league start on 31 August.In their unbeaten sequence Wolves scored five goals in four league games, after nine in the preceding 19. The 18-year-old Mateus Mané was a key factor in the uplift and his curled shot was ttheir sole effort before the penalty claim on 33 minutes. After this came City’s second: Silva slipped through Semenyo who jinked inside Ladislav Krejci and finished for a third goal in four matches sincejoining from Bournemouth.Now came Edwards’s substitutions for the second period: Jørgen Strand Larsen entered for Jhon Arias and Rodrigo Gomes for Jackson Tchatchoua. This meant Larsen joined Hwang Hee-chan in attack, Gomes became the right wing-back and Mané was pushed back into midfield, where he troubled City.Two of Mané’s crosses – defended by Silva, then Nunes – turned City, the second forcing a corner. The youngster took this, João Gomes headed skywards and Gianluigi Donnarumma tipped over, the City goalkeeper’s first save.Wolves remain 14 points from safety, but Edwards’s mid-season appointment appears shrewd.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

A first victory for Arsenal at Stamford Bridge, and a first away win against Chelsea in eight years, pulled them within a point of their rivals. Thedefending championssit six points behind the leaders, Manchester City, who travel to London City Lionesses on Sunday.“We know the title race is probably gone, but our mentality is to fight until the very end,” Bompastor told the BBC. “They [City] are in control and if they perform at their best it will be a difficult gap to close. My job is to make sure I lift everyone up and we take the learnings and we go into the next game ready to perform.”Chelsea 0-2 Arsenal: Women’s Super League – as it happenedRead moreThere were some forced changes to Arsenal’s starting XI, with Olivia Smith’s suspension and Frida Maanum’s absence as a precaution after being hit by a ball to the head in training added to injuries to several key players, including the England duo Leah Williamson and Chloe Kelly.Despite their depleted number, Arsenal were dominant in possession, weaving together some lovely patterns of play. However, the end product was notably absent once again.As the game stretched, with Arsenal failing to capitalise on their dominance, it felt increasingly like it would be another game where they would be punished on the counter, as they had been against Manchester United in their 1-0 League Cup semi-final defeat on Wednesday.View image in fullscreenBeth Mead gives Arsenal the lead in the 55th minute.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersTheir best threat came from Mead on the right, the forward’s link-up with the full-back, Emily Fox, causing problems. It was no accident then that Arsenal’s breakthrough came from the England forward. Alyssa Thompson was caught out in the buildup in her own half, the stray ball falling to Alessia Russo who shifted to the edge of the area before sliding it to Mead on the right to fire in.Having weathered a flurry of Chelsea chances, Arsenal made the task that bit harder, Mead finding an unmarked Caldentey by the penalty spot and the Spaniard curled the ball into the bottom corner.“We’ve proven to ourselves how composed we can be, how we can set up really good chances which wins us the game. It’s so well deserved for the players because they’ve been so invested,” said Renée Slegers. “When the moment is there for this team, when it really has to happen, they do it every single time. There’s a lot of strength in this team in those moments.”Chelsea pushed for the goal that would ignite a comeback but could not find it. It was Arsenal’s day and they remain in the mix for a place in next season’s Champions League. City were the real winners, though, their gap at the top preserved before they kick a ball on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueChelsea WomenArsenal WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Keep Michael Carrick on, and it’s just another Ole Gunnar Solskjær situation. But replace him and, for almost whoever they appoint – be it a Premier League veteran, foreign maestro, renowned past-his-best winner, Red Bull-adjacentgegenpresser, austere Dutchman or Portuguese ideologue – they have done it before and it hasn’t worked. It’s almost like the biggest problem at the club isn’t the manager.Carrick’s startwas undeniably impressive. There was pace and zip and creativity. The relief of players being released from the 3-4-2-1 was akin to one of those videos of cows being allowed back into the pasture after being kept in a barn over the winter. Who could possibly have predicted that Amad Diallo would excel as a right-sided forward, or that Bruno Fernandes might thrive as a No 10? United didn’t just beat Manchester City 2-0; they hammered them.‘I respect him an awful lot’: Carrick reveals Solskjær backing for Manchester United roleRead moreA crushing victory in the derby? A display full of attacking flair? Unpicking Pep Guardiola’s tactical schema? Give him the job now! Where do you want your statue, Michael? But Solskjær’s first game after replacing José Mourinho in December 2018, it may be remembered, wasa 5-1 demolition of Cardiff. He proceeded to win 13 of the following 16 games, the only defeat coming at home against Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League, a setback that was turned around in the second leg at the Parc des Princes, which turned out to be the high point of his reign.Out of both cup competitions and not in Europe, United have only 16 games left this season. Which is to say that by the time a final decision has to be made on his future, Carrick will be only at the point Solskjær was in Paris. Solskjær lost the two games that followed, to Arsenal in the league and Wolves in the FA Cup, and was then appointed permanent manager. In total, United won only two of their final 12 games that season; by the summer, it already seemed clear they had erred in their appointment.Of all the mistakes United made during Ed Woodward’s time as chief executive, even bringing a superannuated Cristiano Ronaldo back to the club, that was the least excusable. They had no need to make a decision that March. Solskjær had a contract until June; he, of all people, was never going to walk out on United. There was absolutely no reason not to wait until they had as much evidence as possible of his capabilities and suitability. But they acted to satisfy public clamour; doing something because Rio Ferdinand has said it would be a good idea is rarely indicative of sound governance.But just because Solskjær failed – and in the end, for all his shortcomings, what undid him wasthe imposition of Ronaldo– does that automatically rule Carrick out of contention? This is the problem with looking at precedent and drawing direct conclusions. A logic persists at United that because Sir Alex Ferguson eventually succeeded after years of frustration, every manager is due similar patience. But every case is different.What of Carrick? His past record is reasonable. Although he didn’t lead Middlesbrough to promotion in almost three seasons, he does have the second-best win percentage of any manager who has been at the club for six months or more. He was unbeaten in a previous three-game stint as caretaker. Does that necessarily mean he is ready to take the United job full-time? Of course not. But equally, it doesn’t mean he is not ready.View image in fullscreenManchester United should be fresher than most teams they face for the rest of the season.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APVictory over City has to be placed into context. This is an injury-ravaged City. They haven’t won in four in the Premier League. They werebeaten comfortably in the Champions League by Bodø/Glimtthree days later. But equally, United did play with the sort of verve and freedom that used to characterise their play. If that goes on, if Carrick’s United can produce that sort of performance against a range of opponents, and not just those vulnerable to balls played in behind them as they struggle to implement an unfamiliar offside trap, then why not him?The problem is that United should be fresher than every side they have left to play this season. Of the opponents in their remaining 16 games of the season, only West Ham and Bournemouth will not have played more games than United (and West Ham may have the upcoming FA Cup tie against Burton on their mind); United’s squad is deeper than either. If they look quicker and more dynamic than opponents over the next four months, that may be a result of Carrick’s tactical approach but, equally, theyshouldbe quicker and more dynamic.How, then, can United assess him? But how can they assess anybody? How can any upper Premier League club assess a manager? Thriving in its mid-reaches does not mean a manager can step up to the different challenge of a bigger club, as Thomas Frank’s struggles at Tottenham are demonstrating.But United have discovered that thriving in a mid-ranking league, such as the Netherlands or Portugal, is no guarantee of success either. The truth is that there’s no real preparation for a top Premier League job other than a top Premier League job. (United remain for now a top Premier League job but their status is waning:down to eighth in the Deloitte Money League, even before this Europe-less season. And, leaving financial issues aside, any aspiring manager has reason to be cautious of joining a club who have such a habit of chewing up talent.)So how do United make a decision? It can’t just be results. It can’t even just be performances. It has to be rooted in some complicated assessment of leadership and potential, of tactical acuity but also the capacity to inspire players and fans at a massive club. It’s not easy; by definition such judgments are nebulous, based in feel as much as fact. And the huge worry is that at no point in the past 13 years has anybody in the United hierarchy done anything to suggest that have the insight to recognise such a candidate.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedInside footballMichael CarrickcommentShareReuse this content"

We have won a lot but now it is all about showing a reaction.”Bayern, unbeaten in their previous 27 league matches, a run stretching back to early March, never hit top speed but still dominated the first half, taking the lead through Ito’s header from a Michael Olise corner. It was Olise’s 14th assist in the league and his 22nd across all competitions this season.Bayern, who travel to PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday for their final Champions League match in the league phase, missed several more good chances through Harry Kane, Luis Díaz and Lennart Karl before the visitors carved out their own best chance with the last kick of the first half when Robin Fellhauer rattled the crossbar with a powerful shot.Augsburg found more and more space after the break as Bayern’s tempo dropped even further, and they tested the home keeper Jonas Urbig with a shot from Elvis Rexhbecaj and a fine free-kick from Alexis Claude-Maurice.They got their deserved equaliser when Chaves scored with the back of his head from a corner.

In added time, the Welshman’s free-kick whipped towards Bart Verbruggen, whose failure to keep the ball out completed a regrettable afternoon for goalkeepers.Fulhamhad snatched an unlikely win.When these teamsfought out a drawon August’s opening day, Brighton rued missed chances and Fulham took theirs. The song remains the same. Fabian Hürzeler’s team reprised the mistakes that have kept them landlocked in mid-table.“Sometimes football is brutal and the better team loses,” said Brighton’s manager. “We controlled the things we could control. Regarding the performance, it was one of the best we have played.”Burnley v Tottenham, Man City v Wolves, Championship and more: clockwatch – liveRead moreFor Fulham, Samuel Chukwueze continued to show his usefulness off the bench, his cool finish levelling out a Yasin Ayari strike with Bernd Leno, the Fulham goalkeeper, at fault. “Harsh for them to lose the game,” said Marco Silva of Brighton. He lavished praise on Wilson. “He’s been incredible for us. I am repeating every week that he is in the best moment of his career.”Until he tired and was subbed off, the Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, vastly improved for his time with Cameroon in Morocco, was the best player on show. Brighton fans have also been reassured by the return of Pascal Gross, the veteran lining up closest to Danny Welbeck. Brighton’s hard and high press had Fulham scrabbling for room from the early stages.Wilson’s stabbed pass for Raúl Jiménez gave Verbruggen his first save to make, the goalkeeper narrowing the angle, but it was Brighton who broke the deadlock. Leno was far less proficient at his near post; Ayari’s shot lacked venom, but still sneaked past an outstretched palm.View image in fullscreenHarry Wilson delivered another moment of inspiration for Fulham.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersBrighton had their lead just when Fulham had finally begun to find openings. “A goal can affect everything that you are doing well,” said Silva. The visitors might have scored a quick second when Lewis Dunk’s meaningful punt found Kaoru Mitoma in space. The first touch was gossamer, the second offered redemption to Leno, though he could only deflect the ball to Ferdi Kadioglu, whose header was scraped away by Timothy Castagne.Leno flapping at a scuffed Baleba shot was another bad look, though his teammates were also struggling. Brighton were disappointed with only a one-goal lead at the break. Baleba had dominated the central areas, always first to loose balls, next making driving runs forward once the ball came into his possession.Those few in the Riverside Stand’s executive facilities back in their seats in time for the second half will have caught a familiar direction of travel. Dunk twice had headed chances, Mitoma again fluffed a chance to lay up Welbeck; Baleba continued to dominate.Silva threw on Ryan Sessegnon and Chukwueze in search of spark. A Brighton second still looked likelier. Welbeck led the line expertly, with it requiring a bookable Sander Berge foul to stop a barreling solo run. The striker also laid up Ayari for another long-ranger. This one flew over.And yet: the losses in concentration that pockmark Brighton’s season came to pass, Joachim Andersen’s long ball found Chukwueze and his arrowing finish raised the roof of the Johnny Haynes Stand. “Sometimes, errors happen,” said a rueful Hürzeler.A bigger roar followed when Welbeck’s counterpunch goal was ruled out by the video assistant referee’s slide rule, offside given. “It depends on when they stop it,” said Hürzeler, dismissive of the technology’s protocols. “For me, it’s subjective.”Welbeck forced another Leno save with a powerful header before Baleba departed. There are doubts in Brighton’s £100m-rated jewel’s ability to last 90 minutes. James Milner, approachingGareth Barry’s Premier League appearance record, 40 this month, arrived.View image in fullscreenYasin Ayari scores in the first half for Brighton to steer them in front.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersHe could not prevent the Fulham win that came via Wilson’s moment of inspiration after Josh King, Fulham’s far more youthful sub, had won a free-kick. Wilson,scorer against Liverpooland Chelsea and four goals already in 2026, is out of contract this summer, a potential January target for other clubs, but is in the hearts of Fulham fans. “We are in the fight, we are trying to keep him,” said Silva, though he offered “nothing concrete”.Barely believable for Brighton, left shaking their heads at another game to get away.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFulhamBrighton & Hove Albionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Seemingly down and outafter losing to Nottingham Foresttwo and a half weeks ago, the prospect of Nuno Espírito Santo pulling off the unlikeliest of escape acts no longer feels that outlandish now. There is life yet in West Ham, even if they still have a mountain to climb after treating the London Stadium to the rare sensation of a performance full of craft, desire and tactical intelligence.Sunderland were blown away by three goals inside the first 43 minutes. It is rare for visitors to this ground to lose their composure but this was a day to forget for Régis Le Bris’ side. They were awful during the first half, folding as Jarrod Bowen and Crysencio Summerville ripped them apart on the flanks, and it summed up Sunderland’s afternoon when the closing stages of West Ham’s third consecutive win in all competitions were held up by the injured Granit Xhaka getting embroiled in a row with home fans sitting behind the away bench.West Ham v Sunderland: Premier League – liveRead moreWest Ham’s intensity had caused the damage during the first half. Bowen was irrepressible on the right and Summerville provided further inspiration with his third goal in as many games. As for Mateus Fernandes, his youthful brilliance in midfield suggested that it would not be that disastrous if West Ham allow Lucas Paquetá to join Flamengo.For all the positives, though, Nuno still has a huge job on his hands. West Ham remain in the bottom three, two points below Forest before they visit Brentford on Sunday, and the worry is that they have left themselves with too much to do. It is not impossible but the fixtures are not kind and West Ham have not kept a clean sheet since August.“The way we started was really accurate,” Nuno said. “It helps the confidence. Second half was an improvement in terms of managing the game. Sunderland scored but the boys stayed calm.”View image in fullscreenMateus Fernandes fires home West Ham’s third first-half goal.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PANuno argued that there has been a change in the mood since the defeat by Forest. “When you work with the smile everything is easier,” he said. “But we know football is day by day. We cannot stop believing.”West Ham, who are closing in on a deal for the Fulham winger Adama Traoré, built ontheir win over Tottenham. With Paquetá still nursing a sore back, Nuno named an unchanged side. West Ham were in an old-fashioned 4-4-2, with Pablo Felipe and Taty Castellanos leading the line, and looked to attack.Sunderland met the threat by putting Trai Hume on the right of midfield, where he was tasked with tracking Summerville’s movement. However, they failed to adapt to the absence of Xhaka for the first time this season. Le Bris said that the midfielder will be out with an ankle injury for a fortnight. Winless on the road since 25 October, Sunderland have to find a way to cope while their captain is out.Le Bris could not find solutions here. He matched West Ham’s system but Sunderland were overrun. West Ham committed numbers forward and led in the 14th minute. The hapless Reinildo Mandava showed Bowen down the outside, only for the winger to use his weaker right foot to cross for Summerville to charge in front of Nordi Mukiele, leap like Andy Carroll and head past Robin Roefs.The home fans, some of whom waited until the 15th minute to turn up as they continued protests against the club’s board, watched in disbelief. They liked Castellanos’s hustle. Summerville, who is shedding the flakiness, is also becoming a bit of a hero on the left wing.Mukiele and Hume could not contain the Dutchman. West Ham pushed again, Pablo missing a golden chance. Sunderland had chances at 0-0 and 1-0 but they were flimsy at the back. Bowen, who has now overtaken Michail Antonio’s record of 101 goal involvements for West Ham in thePremier League, made it 2-0 with a penalty awarded for Hume’s lazy trip on Ollie Scarles.View image in fullscreenCrysencio Summerville rises highest to score West Ham’s first goal.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersLe Bris admitted that Sunderland did not compete well enough. The third goal arrived when a poor clearance dropped to Fernandes, who bent a lovely shot past Roefs from 25 yards.West Ham had not led 3-0 at half-timesince beating Bournemouthin April 2023, when David Moyes was in charge. Three managers later, there is a sense of cautious optimism. A consolation goal from Brian Brobbey in the 66th minute was not enough to derail West Ham.Not that Nuno is getting carried away. He still wants to “rebalance” his squad before the window shuts. Guido Rodríguez is going, a deal for the midfielder to join Valencia agreed, and that meant there was space for James Ward-Prowse in a matchday squad for the first time under Nuno. West Ham are taking it one step at a time.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueWest Ham UnitedSunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Carrick was asked whether he had spoken to his former teammate since beginning his second interim tenure.“Yes, I spoke to him,” he said. “I’m close, we’ve been through a lot together, so he’s been fully supportive as you’d expect. He’s some man and I respect him an awful lot. He wished us all the best and he was happy that we got the right result against Manchester City.”Carrick was asked whether he might seek advice from Solskjær. “With friendships, you have conversations,” he said. “I’ve got a lot of friends in places that I can kind of pick on if I need to be. I’m not one that bothers a lot of people, to be honest. But he’s certainly there if I ever need him.”Saturday’s victory over City at Old Trafford derived from United being proactive in Carrick’s opening match. He takes the team to Arsenal for Sunday’s 4.30pm GMT kick-off and suggested the strategy might differ.Carrick said: “Every game’s different. Even if you come in half-time and you’ve had a good performance for 45 minutes, I’m never one that likes to say: ‘Same again.’ Because it’s never, ever the same again. You’ve kind of got to build on it.“So it won’t be a kind of copy and paste. There’s new elements that need to come into it. We need to be ready, be at our best. And if we are our best and we’re there, we feel we’ve got a good chance. It’s just about playing what we feel the game needs.”Patrick Dorgu scored United’s second against City when operating as a wide attacker, having played mostly as a wingback since signing last January. Carrick said: “He can do both. He was immense last week: his work rate and the way he played the position. I wouldn’t want to pin him down.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedMichael CarrickOle Gunnar SolskjaernewsShareReuse this content"

Add in more heavy downpours, a tricky wind and a horribly slippery ball and there was never any chance of a free-flowing, fast-paced spectacle between two of the league’s more fluent attacking sides. This was a sodden slog, pure and simple, with only a rainbow or two to add a splash of colour.Not that the Bears will care much about the trench warfare nature of a victory that consolidates them in third position and above their opponents in the playoff race going into the Prem’s two-month hiatus. On an afternoon demanding character, perseverance and effort the visitors displayed all three, a first-half try from the appropriately named Noah Heward ultimately edging an old-school wrestling match.Bullish Borthwick tells England to target Six Nations triumph in ParisRead moreExeter’s tactical kicking was frequently not good enough and they completely failed to get their potential match-winner Manny Feyi-Waboso into the game. Another of their England call-ups, Greg Fisilau, worked tirelessly without too much reward in an increasingly tense, error-strewn contest. Bristol’s defence, though, was excellent with their director of rugby, Pat Lam, highlighting a tackle count of 155 with just nine missed.As was the caseat home to Bordeaux last Sunday, Bristol would have ideally preferred a dry ball and a hard track. These kind of conditions seriously dilute their slick handling game and in the past they have not always found it easy to switch to more pragmatic mode. On this occasion, however, they dug in stoutly and were significantly rewarded. They have won eight of their past nine games in all competitions and Lam believes there is more to come. “Winning today was another final because they hadn’t previously lost here this season,” he said. “I’m very proud of that effort.”The local faithful will have to wait a long time for their team to make amends. The Prem is about to vanish off the radar during the Six Nations and the Chiefs’ next league game is against Sale on 21 March. The desire not to clash with the international period is all very well, but it really does kill the flow of the league season stone dead.View image in fullscreenDriving rain prevented both sides from playing the attacking rugby that has brought them success in the first half of the season.Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty ImagesAt least there is a chance it could be drier by then. At times in the first-half the rain hammered down so hard it was all but impossible for either side to hang on to the ball for more than a couple of phases. The loss of their Wallaby flanker Tom Hooper, who limped off with a knee injury after eight minutes, also disrupted Exeter’s plans to thunder into the Bears around the fringes.Having opted to play with the elements at their backs in the opening 40 minutes, the onus was on Bristol to build up as big a lead as they could. However, they were kept scoreless until the 36th minute when a defensive error gave the visitors a rare attacking field position and Louis Rees-Zammit’s long pass gave Heward the chance to leave his ark and slide over on the right.Tom Jordan missed a penalty attempt from slap in front of the posts and the only other points of the half came from Henry Slade, who steered a left-foot penalty through the uprights like a scratch golfer drilling a three-iron into the teeth of the elements.With the rain temporarily easing, the conditions were not quite as bad after the break. Rees-Zammit dropped a high ball that threatened to be costly but a prolonged siege close to the Bears’ line produced no home reward.Quick GuidePrem roundup: Caluori inspires Saracens' 73-14 rout of NewcastleShowSaracensended a turbulent week by overwhelmingNewcastle73-14 with Noah Caluori taking star billing at Stone X Stadium.The day after Saracens announced their director of rugby, Mark McCall, would be stepping down after 15 seasons in charge, they amassed 10 tries against the  Prem's bottom-placed side.It was the response needed after Sunday's crushing 28-3 defeat by Glasgow, the most recent setback in a disappointing season with consistency proving elusive in the league and Europe.Jack van Poortvliet  inspiredLeicesterto a 36-7 win over a sufferingHarlequinsside. The scrum-half was on his electrifying, dynamic best form, constantly driving his side forward and involved in most of their decisive attacks in a one-sided affair at Twickenham Stoop.Northamptonclaimed a thrilling 43-29 bonus-point win which lifted them to the Prem summit and put a major dent inSale's play-off hopes.With a host of England stars on display for both sides, the fare served up was of the highest quality but it was Saints who deservedly took the spoils to underline their title credentials.Phil Dowson's men outscored their hosts by seven tries to four, touching down through Tommy Freeman, Rory Hutchinson, Robbie Smith, Edoardo Todaro, Josh Kemeny, Alex Coles and Henry Pollock.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There was soon to be another reprieve, Slade narrowly missing a 50-metre effort with his kicking range now significantly assisted. Exeter were growing steadily more frustrated with Ellis Genge earning one particularly morale-boosting scrum penalty to ease the pressure once more. With stress levels rising, a 79th-minute penalty from James Williams made sure of a hard-earned win that had previously looked unlikely.Rob Baxter, Exeter’s director of rugby, still believes his side will be in decent shape when the Prem restarts. “Those were really tough conditions … a West Country game of rugby. Bristol have shaded the areas that ended up being really important.“Our mistakes hurt us more than their mistakes hurt them. If Sladey’s kick goes over and we’re 6-5 up, we could be sitting here going ‘What a result.’ Ultimately, it’s just flipped the other way.”Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyExeterBristolRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The most exciting prospect in the sport was pulled up with a suspected pelvic injury in the International Hurdle.Sir Gino went into Saturday’s Grade Two contest as the clear favourite for the Champion Hurdle in March, having gone unbeaten in seven starts includinga brilliant novice chase win at Kemptonin December 2024. He was held up last of the four runners as Nemean Lion cut out the running and pulled up by Nico de Boinville shortly after jumping the third-last flight.The British are coming! Will the tide turn at the 2026 Cheltenham festival?Read more“They were able to put him into the ambulance,” Henderson said. “It’s his right-hind, and it appears to be high up, so there’s no lower limb fracture. It would appear to be a pelvic injury.“He has loaded and I’d rather they take him to Three Counties veterinary hospital [in Tewkesbury] without unloading here. Then they can assess and scan and just see where we are.“Pelvic injuries can be little or big, so we’ve just got to keep everything crossed. We won’t know any more tonight. They need a chance to assess him so it will be late on, I expect.”In a statement on X, Henderson later added: “Sir Gino was transferred fromCheltenhamto the Three Counties Veterinary Clinic and following scans and x-rays he does have a fractured pelvis but having spoken to the great team that are caring for him they are hopeful that although this is obviously significant they have reported that he is comfortable and stable.“This is great news to us all. The prognosis is guarded and further examinations over the next few days while he is there will be able to determine the extent of the injury and any prognosis for the future. Thank you to everyone for their messages and concerns which are much appreciated and we will keep everyone up-to-date with any further news but the fact that he’s comfortable tonight is the most important thing. Thank you.”The New Lion, the second-favourite for Saturday’s race and the Champion Hurdle beforehand, stayed on well up the hill to beat Nemean Lion by a length and a half, but he returned to a subdued winner’s enclosure as fans waited for news about Sir Gino.“I’m a big fan of this sport,” said Dan Skelton, The New Lion’s trainer. “ Sir Gino could be the best horse in training and we just didn’t need that. The team at Seven Barrows have been through hell and back to get him back on track and hopefully he is OK.”View image in fullscreenNicky Henderson, Sir Gino’s trainer, said: ‘We’ve just got to keep everything crossed.’Photograph: Steven Paston/PAThe New Lion was cut to around 5-2 for the Champion Hurdle after his win and Skelton said: “We needed to get a clear round after [falling in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at] Newcastle and Harry [Skelton, The New Lion’s jockey] did exactly what I wanted him to do and held him into the bottom of all the jumps.“The unanswered question with this horse is the speed angle and he showed a lot of speed at Newcastle despite ending up on the floor. He showed a lot of speed there as well from turning in to the last, and then from the last to the line.”Skelton, the clear leader in the race for the 2025-26 National Hunt trainers’ championship, had seen his main Gold Cup prospect, Grey Dawning, finish third of the four runners behind Spillane’s Tower in the Grade Two Cotswold Chase.Jack Kennedy was aboard Spillane’s Tower for the first time since Jimmy Mangan’s gelding split Fact To File and Galopin Des Champs in a memorable running of the John Durkan Memorial Chase in 2024. He oozed confidence throughout on the eight-year-old before quickening past L’Homme Presse on the run up the hill.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowSedgefield1.40 Dixie Cowboy 2.10 Rosie Baloo 2.40 Kazar Forez 3.10 Indian River (nap) 3.40 Tom Creen 4.10 Kaviar Wood (nb)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.This was a significant and impressive return to form for Spillane’s Tower after two lacklustre runs over hurdles this season. He was cut from 50-1 to 10-1 for the Cheltenham Gold Cup by Paddy Power, in a market still looking for a clear favourite.“It’s my first [winner in Britain] sinceMonty’s Pass [in the 2003 Grand National],” Mangan said. “I would have gone back to Ireland a disappointed man if he had put up a poor show today. I suppose you do have to start dreaming of the Gold Cup and he’s in that grade now.”The Trials Day card concluded in near-darkness after the final race was delayed for around 30 minutes following the discovery of a hole in the turf, prompting an inspection and a reconfiguration of the course.Nicky Henderson withdrew the likely favourite, Act Of Innocence, and the eventual result – a narrow win for Joe Tizzard’s Kripticjim over Taurus Bay – was announced only after prolonged examination of a photo-finish image taken in the very last of the light and then further reference to video footage.“Basically from what I can work out, the photo you can’t see because it’s too dark,” Ben Pauling, the trainer of Taurus Bay, said, “so they have to use video footage and in my eyes that is conclusive [that] Joe’s horse wins by a head.”Harry Redknapp, the owner of Taurus Bay, was similarly philosophical. “It was strange wasn’t it, it’s been a strange old day,” Redknapp said. “I thought he got beat there at the finish, but I won a King George by a nose [with The Jukebox Man in December] and I can’t have it all my way I suppose.”Jon Pullin, Cheltenham’s clerk of the course, later told Racing TV that the issue had been “a single hole” in the course. “It was a single hole, there weren’t any other holes,” Pullin said. “It was about a foot deep, there’s a gap underneath it, we moved off the area, checked the area we were due to race on and all participants were happy to carry on.“It could be [a drainage hole], it’s too early to say at this stage. We need to do further work to understand exactly what has caused it.“We need time to understand what has caused this incident and that is what we will start with straight away.”Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsCheltenham festivalCheltenhamNicky HendersonnewsShareReuse this content"

The video-sharing platform is the world’s second most visited website, after Google itself, and is owned by Google.Researchers at SE Ranking, a search engine optimisation platform, found YouTube made up 4.43% of all AI Overview citations. No hospital network, government health portal, medical association or academic institution came close to that number, they said.“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,”the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches, and creators with no medical training at all).”Google told the Guardian that AI Overviews was designed to surface high-quality content from reputable sources, regardless of format, and a variety of credible health authorities and licensed medical professionals created content on YouTube. The study’s findings could not be extrapolated to other regions as it was conducted using German-language queries in Germany, it said.The research comes aftera Guardian investigationfound people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews responses.In one case that experts said was “dangerous” and “alarming”, Google provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests that could have left people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. The company laterremoved AI Overviewsfor some but not all medical searches.The SE Ranking study analysed 50,807 healthcare-related prompts and keywords to see which sources AI Overviews relied on when generating answers.They chose Germany because its healthcare system is strictly regulated by a mix of German and EU directives, standards and safety regulations. “If AI systems rely heavily on non-medical or non-authoritative sources even in such an environment, it suggests the issue may extend beyond any single country,”they wrote.AI Overviews surfaced on more than 82% of health searches, the researchers said. When they looked at which sources AI Overviews relied on most often for health-related answers, one result stood out immediately, they said. The single most cited domain was YouTube with 20,621 citations out of a total of 465,823.View image in fullscreenResearchers at SE Ranking found YouTube made up 4.43% of all AI Overview citations.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAThe next most cited source wasNDR.de, with 14,158 citations (3.04%).

In third place was a medical reference site,Msdmanuals.comwith 9,711 citations (2.08%).The fourth most cited source was Germany’s largest consumer health portal,Netdoktor.de, with 7,519 citations (1.61%). The fifth most cited source was a career platform for doctors,Praktischarzt.de, with 7,145 citations (1.53%).The researchers acknowledged limitations to their study. It was conducted as a one-time snapshot in December 2025, using German-language queries that reflected how users in Germany typically search for health information.Results could vary over time, by region, and by the phrasing of questions. However, even with those caveats, the findings still prompted alarm.Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher specialising in AI, health and law at the University of Basel who was not involved with the research, said: “This study provides empirical evidence that the risks posed by AI Overviews for health are structural, not anecdotal. It becomes difficult for Google to argue that misleading or harmful health outputs are rare cases.“Instead, the findings show that these risks are embedded in the way AI Overviews are designed. In particular, the heavy reliance on YouTube rather than on public health authorities or medical institutions suggests that visibility and popularity, rather than medical reliability, is the central driver for health knowledge.”A Google spokesperson said: “The implication that AI Overviews provide unreliable information is refuted by the report’s own data, which shows that the most cited domains in AI Overviews are reputable websites. And from what we’ve seen in the published findings, AI Overviews cite expert YouTube content from hospitals and clinics.”Google said the study showed that of the 25 most cited YouTube videos, 96% were from medical channels. However, the researchers cautioned that these videos represented fewer than 1% of all the YouTube links cited by AI Overviews on health.“Most of them (24 out of 25) come from medical-related channels like hospitals, clinics and health organisations,”the researchers wrote. “On top of that, 21 of the 25 videos clearly note that the content was created by a licensed or trusted source.“So at first glance it looks pretty reassuring. But it’s important to remember that these 25 videos are just a tiny slice (less than 1% of all YouTube links AI Overviews actually cite). With the rest of the videos, the situation could be very different.”Explore more on these topicsGoogleAI (artificial intelligence)YouTubeHealthAlphabetInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

These included queries on political structures in Iran, such as salaries of the Basij paramilitary force and the ownership of the Mostazafan Foundation, and questions on the biography of Sir Richard Evans, a British historian and expert witness against Holocaust denier David Irving in his libel trial.Grokipedia, launched inOctober, is an AI-generated online encyclopedia that aims to compete with Wikipedia, and which has been criticised for propagating rightwing narratives on topics includinggay marriageand the 6 January insurrection in the US. Unlike Wikipedia, it does not allow direct human editing, instead an AI model writes content and responds to requests for changes.ChatGPT did not cite Grokipedia when prompted directly to repeat misinformation about the insurrection, about media bias against Donald Trump, or about the HIV/Aids epidemic – areas where Grokipedia has been widely reported to promote falsehoods. Instead, Grokipedia’s information filtered into the model’s responses when it was prompted about more obscure topics.For instance, ChatGPT, citing Grokipedia, repeated stronger claims about the Iranian government’s links to MTN-Irancell than are found on Wikipedia – such as asserting that the company has links to the office of Iran’s supreme leader.ChatGPT also cited Grokipedia when repeating information that the Guardian has debunked, namely details about Sir Richard Evans’workas an expert witness in David Irving’s trial.Grok AI: what do limits on tool mean for X, its users and UK media watchdog?Read moreGPT-5.2 is not the only large language model (LLM) that appears to be citing Grokipedia; anecdotally, Anthropic’s Claude has also referenced Musk’s encyclopedia on topics from petroleumproductionto Scottishales.AnOpenAIspokesperson said the model’s web search “aims to draw from a broad range of publicly available sources and viewpoints”.“We apply safety filters to reduce the risk of surfacing links associated with high-severity harms, and ChatGPT clearly shows which sources informed a response through citations,” they said, adding that they had ongoing programs to filter out low-credibility information and influence campaigns.Anthropic did not respond to a request for comment.But the fact that Grokipedia’s information is filtering – at times very subtly – into LLM responses is a concern for disinformation researchers. Last spring, security expertsraisedconcerns that malign actors, including Russian propaganda networks, were churning out massive volumes of disinformation in an effort to seed AI models with lies, aprocesscalled “LLM grooming”.In June, concerns were raised in the US Congress that Google’s Gemini repeated the Chinese government’s position on human rights abuses in Xinjiang and China’s Covid-19 policies.Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher who has worked on LLM grooming, said ChatGPT’s citing Grokipedia raised similar concerns. While Musk may not have intended to influence LLMs, Grokipedia entries she and colleagues had reviewed were “relying on sources that are untrustworthy at best, poorly sourced and deliberate disinformation at worst”, she said.And the fact that LLMs cite sources such as Grokipedia or the Pravda network may, in turn, improve these sources’ credibility in the eyes of readers. “They might say, ‘oh, ChatGPT is citing it, these models are citing it, it must be a decent source, surely they’ve vetted it’ – and they might go there and look for news about Ukraine,” said Jankowicz.Bad information, once it has filtered into an AI chatbot, can be challenging to remove. Jankowicz recently found that a large news outlet had included amade-up quotefrom her in a story about disinformation. She wrote to the news outlet asking for the quote to be removed, andpostedabout the incident on social media.The news outlet removed the quote. However, AI models for some time continued to cite it as hers. “Most people won’t do the work necessary to figure out where the truth actually lies,” she said.When asked for comment, a spokesperson for xAI, the owner of Grokipedia, said: “Legacy media lies.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Why do I wake up feeling tired? What is causing the pain in my chest? For more than two decades, typing medical questions into the world’s most popular search engine has served up a list of links to websites with the answers.Googlethose health queries today and the response will likely be written by artificial intelligence.Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, first set out the company’s plans to enmesh AI into its search engine at its annual conference in Mountain View, California, in May 2024. Starting that month, he said, US users would see a new feature, AI Overviews, which would provide information summaries above traditional search results. The change marked the biggest shake-up of Google’s core product in a quarter of a century. By July 2025, the technology had expanded to more than 200 countries in 40 languages, with 2 billion people served AI Overviews each month.With the rapid rollout of AI Overviews, Google is racing to protect its traditional search business, which generates about $200bn (£147bn) a year, before upstart AI rivals can derail it. “We are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace,”Pichai said last July. AI Overviews in particular were “performing well”, he added.But overviews carry risks, experts say. They use generative AI to provide snapshots of information about a topic or question, adding conversational answers above the traditional search results in the blink of an eye. They can cite sources, but do not necessarily know when that source is incorrect.View image in fullscreenGoogle’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, hopes AI Overviews can help to maintain its online search revenues.Photograph: Kylie Cooper/ReutersWithin weeks of the feature launching in the US,users encountered untruthsacross a range of subjects. One AI Overview said Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president,graduated from college in 2005. Elizabeth Reid, Google’s head of search,responded to criticism in a blog post. She conceded that “in a small number of cases”, AI Overviews had misinterpreted language on web pages and presented inaccurate information. “At the scale of the web, with billions of queries coming in every day, there are bound to be some oddities and errors,” she wrote.But when those questions are about health, accuracy and context are essential and non-negotiable, experts say. Google is facing mounting scrutiny of its AI Overviews for medical queries aftera Guardian investigationfound people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information.The company says AI Overviews are “reliable”. Butthe Guardian foundsome medical summaries served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. In one case, which experts said was “really dangerous”, Google wrongly advised people with pancreatic cancer to avoid high-fat foods. Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.In another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people who had serious liver disease wrongly thinking they were healthy. What AI Overviews said was normal could vary drastically from what was actually considered normal, experts said. The summaries could lead to seriously ill patients wrongly thinking they had a normal test result and not bothering to attend follow-up appointments.AI Overviews about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.Google initiallysought to downplaythe Guardian’s findings. From what its own clinicians could assess, the company said, the AI Overviews that alarmed experts linked to reputable sources and recommended seeking expert advice. “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information,” a spokesperson said.Within days, however,the company removedsome of the AI Overviews for health queries flagged by the Guardian. “We do not comment on individual removals within search,” a spokesperson said. “In cases where AI Overviews miss some context, we work to make broad improvements, and we also take action under our policies where appropriate.”How thousands of ‘overworked, underpaid’ humans train Google’s AI to seem smartRead moreWhile experts welcomed the removal of some AI summaries for health queries, many remain worried. “Our bigger concern with all this is that it is nit-picking a single search result and Google can just shut off the AI Overviews for that but it’s not tackling the bigger issue of AI Overviews for health,” says Vanessa Hebditch, the director of communications and policy at the British Liver Trust, a liver health charity.“There are still too many examples out there of Google AI Overviews giving people inaccurate health information,” adds Sue Farrington, the chair of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals.Anew studyhas prompted more concerns. When researchers analysed the responses to more than 50,000 health-related searches in Germany to see which sources AI Overviews rely on most, one result stood out immediately.The single most cited domain was YouTube.“This matters because YouTube is not a medical publisher,”the researchers wrote. “It is a general-purpose video platform. Anyone can upload content there (eg, board-certified physicians, hospital channels, but also wellness influencers, life coaches and creators with no medical training at all).”In medicine, it is not only where answers come from that matter, or their level of accuracy, but how they are presented to users, experts say. “With AI Overviews, users no longer encounter a range of sources that they can compare and critically assess,” says Hannah van Kolfschooten, a researcher in AI, health and law at the University of Basel. “Instead, they are presented with a single, confident, AI-generated answer that exhibits medical authority.“This means that the system does not merely reflect health information online, but actively restructures it. When that response is built on sources never designed to meet medical standards, such asYouTubevideos, this creates a new form of unregulated medical authority online.”Google says AI Overviews are builtto surface information backed up by top web results, and include links to web content that supports the information presented in the summary. People can use these links to dig deeper on a topic, the company told the Guardian.But the single blocks of text in AI Overviews, combining health information from multiple sources, can cause confusion, says Nicole Gross, an associate professor in business and society at the National College of Ireland.“Once the AI summary appears, users are much less likely to research further, which means that they are deprived of the opportunity to critically evaluate and compare information, or even deploy their common sense when it comes to health-related issues.”Experts have raised other concerns with the Guardian. Even if and when AI Overviews do provide accurate facts about a specific medical topic, they may not distinguish between strong evidence from randomised trials and weaker evidence from observational studies, they say. Some also miss important caveats about that evidence, they add.Having such claims listed next to one another in an AI Overview may also give the impression that some are better established than they really are. Answers can also change as AI Overviews evolve, even when the science hasn’t shifted. “That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough,” says Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity.Google told the Guardian that links included in AI Overviews were dynamic and changed based on the information that was most relevant, helpful and timely for a given search. If AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed some context, the company would use these errors to improve its systems, and also take action when appropriate, it said.The biggest worry is that bogus and dangerous medical information or advice in AI Overviews “ends up getting translated into the everyday practices, routines and life of a patient, even in adapted forms”, says Gross. “In healthcare, this can turn into a matter of life and death.”"

In the past few weeks any number of initiatives have been announced or activated, from a data partnership with Opta to facilitate more betting, to the Fifa Pass for speeding up visa applications for the US this summer, to the unveiling of the official Lego World Cup trophy. Among the ever-expanding list is an intriguing deal with TikTok, a partnership that will give digital creators front-row seats at the 104-match tournament.In Fifa language its partnership with the short-form video platform will make “the most inclusive event in football history … even more accessible”. According to TikTok’s global head of content, James Stafford, it will bring fans “closer to the action in ways they can’t get anywhere else”. It plans to do so by granting an unspecified number of online personalities behind-the-scenes access, giving them archive and highlights footage to use in their content and, in return, requesting an avalanche of posts that will make the World Cup inescapable forTikTokusers.Infantino jokes about British fans’ behaviour at World Cups and defends ticket pricesRead moreIn choosing TikTok as its preferred platformFifais catching up with the times. The use of creators, also known as influencers, is increasingly essential for any consumer business. The NFL has integrated creators (quick definition: online personalities who make their living from posting on social media) into coverage of the Super Bowl since the turn of the decade. But the full possibilities of the creator economy are only beginning to be explored by sports organisations.Last summer the streaming company Dazn built its own creator network for Fifa’s Club World Cup. It enlisted as many as 50 creators to post videos that built excitement around the event, be they behind-the-scenes tours, interviews with players and coaches or stunts such as racing to see who could make it to theChelsea v Palmeiras gameon time.“It was a new tournament and we wanted to hit every lever we possibly could to generate awareness in as many places as possible, particularly with a younger audience,” says Joe Caporoso, the president of Team Whistle, a Dazn-owned company that specialises in digital strategy. “We searched through people who had strong organic followings on places like Instagram and TikTok, and who had a history of a high volume of posting consistency around not just the sport of soccer, but also the culture of it. We wanted to make sure we had people and creators who spoke authentically and were not shy about showing everything that goes on around the game.”From there, Caporoso’s team laid out a campaign that defined the amount of content creators were expected to generate. A group of editors and content programmers made sure each post was optimised for maximum exposure and liaised with creators to make sure no potential talking point or key moment was missed. Dazn and Whistle tracked the performance of each post, monitored the traffic that went back to Dazn’s coverage, and discussed the outcomes with TikTok.This is a degree of oversight materially higher than that of, say, the BBC over Gary Lineker at the last European Championship. It gives a clue to one reason why creators are coming to the fore in sports coverage. Not only are they generally younger, part of a demographic sports leaders are anxious to attract, not only are they trusted by their audience due to a perceived authenticity, but creators are comfortable working in a media environment where the demands of the client come first. Their productivity can be off the charts. They perform, they shoot, they edit, they strike promotional deals, they post regularly and often. They are, in Caporoso’s words, “one-person companies”.View image in fullscreenDazn built its own creator network for Fifa’s inaugural 32-team Club World Cup last year. They aimed to ensure no talking point or key moment was missed.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/APTikTok says the Club World Cup creator platform drove more than 500,000 fans to Dazn’s service and that 90% of fans take “at least one off-platform action” after viewing sports content on their app. Fifa says its creator platform is designed for similar purposes, such as directing new viewers to its match coverage, but it could perform other functions too. It could be a new revenue stream, for example, with Fifa taking a cut from the advertising revenue generated on TikTok through the deal. It could be a way of expanding the reach of sponsorship deals Fifa has elsewhere. It establishes a relationship with a tech giant who may yet be tempted into paying for broadcast rights more broadly. Finally, the new platform could also provide a means for shaping the way the World Cup is talked about.Instead of allowing the post-match debate or attention between matchdays to be channeled by media companies, a creator platform deal keeps sports organisers in the conversation. “It’s a way for them to become a partner and to have their say, a bit of their say, in how their material is presented on second screens,” says François Godard of the media research company Enders Analysis. Creators offer the possibility of drumming up enthusiasm should interest begin to wane, but also keeping discussion away from topics that might be problematic. When Dazn secured an interview with Donald Trump before the Club World Cup final, it asked Emily Austin, from its roster of creators, to conduct it. A Maga enthusiast and marketer of Trump Derangement Syndrome merchandise, she flattered the US president and Fifa while celebrating the success of the tournament.Creators present an efficient and effective way of reaching audiences with a defined message. Godard, however, is sceptical of how useful they might be in driving audience growth for sport. “In our data, we see that the viewership of traditional TV by the 16-to-34 age group has collapsed over the past 10 years, but not in sports,” he says. “That’s because sports is unique. It’s live, and there’s no alternative.”Reports in the US have suggested the picture is complicated somewhat by traditional broadcasters having acquired the rights Fifa wants to share with influencers.According to the publication Puck, TikTok would need a sublicensing deal with the broadcaster Fox, an arrangement yet to be struck. In the UK the BBC and ITV jointly hold rights to linear and digital broadcasts. The BBC said it would not comment on rights negotiations.Godard believes that instead the platform is a play to develop new places where Fifa may ultimately sell its rights, even as it extends the offering on its Fifa+ broadcast platform (thanks to a new deal with Dazn). Whatever the outcome, it may be just that creators have the power to disrupt the media environment that has made Fifa decide to embrace them.Explore more on these topicsFifaWorld Cup 2026TikTokSports rightsFootball politicsWorld CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We can no longer pretend otherwiseZoe DanielThe rules-based global order is rapidly disintegrating. It’s time for middle powers to stand togetherSat 24 Jan 2026 14.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 18.05 ESTShareThe French presidentEmmanuel Macronborrowed some lines from Hugh Grant about bullies at the World Economic Forum in Davos. His target was Donald Trump, who had leaked a conciliatory text message from Macron who, evidently, was trying to get the US president to the table to shore up the rapidly disintegrating global order.In the love-it-or-hate-it Christmas film, Love Actually, Grant – playing the foppish British prime minister of the day – confronts the US president, saying: “A friend who bullies us is no longer a friend, and since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward, I will be prepared to be much stronger.”We are now in an era where truth is stranger than fiction, if you can find the truth at all.Macron’s text message was aboutGreenland, which has been at the centre of a classic Trumpian play to use his position to provoke a reaction thereby illustrating his power. His threat to impose tariffs on Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland because of their opposition to American control of Greenland achieved its aim.Along comes Trump and our emperors have no clothes | John CraceRead moreEurope scrambled to respond, considering retaliatory tariffs, increased customs duties and limiting or blocking access to US goods, services or companies. Troops were sent to Greenland.Trump then cited a vague “deal” withNatoand dropped the tariffs.“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable,” Trump said, before adding: “But I won’t do that.”Right. As you were then.But let’s be honest: had he acted on his threats on Greenland – either economic or military – who could have stopped him?We can no longer pretend. The global order is built on trust. The United States, underDonald Trump, cannot be trusted. And removing that lynchpin from the global order is a catastrophe.As Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, said in hiswatershed speechat Davos, “the old order is not coming back”.It’s notable that this speech has received so much attention when all Carney did was state the obvious.Trump’s actions in the Northern Hemisphere are highly relevant to Australia, and they represent more than flexing.As Iwrote here last March, the Atlantic alliance, which has protected peace in western Europe for almost 80 years (albeit imperfectly) is evaporating before our eye. It’s deluded not to think this has profound and alarming implications for Australia.Arguably events in Ukraine and Gaza over the last few years have been part of the ruination of the rules-based order that has been in fragile existence since world war two. The rules of war and humanitarian and democratic principles have been variously ignored by Putin, Netanyahu and most recently the Trump administration in Venezuela. The boundaries are very frayed.In this, Trump has form.He’s been shifting boundaries inexorably since he first entered the presidential race in 2015, testing tolerances and controlling and rebuilding the information landscape in such a way that ever more unprecedented actions become accepted even if they had not been expected.It’s the new normal. From a values and principles point of view, this leaves Australia marooned.With our closest ally threatening other allies with no regard for rules, systems, protocol, ethics or consequences our defence, security, information, technology and economic systems are so intertwined that disentangling them appears at worst impossible, at best extraordinarily complicated.And what of our own alliance with America? What is the value of Aukus, which to date is making us a greater first-strike target while we shovel billions of dollars to Trump, just as he ditches article 5 of the Nato pact without so much as a flick of the wrist?Reports that Canada hasmodelled a hypothetical US invasionmay seem wild, but as Carney said, his nation was amongst “the first to hear the wake-up call” that historic alliances are no longer guaranteed.“Middle powers must act together because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu,” he said.Agree with it or not, he is walking the talk, cutting atrade deal with China– and saying in its defence: “We take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.”In other words, hope is not a strategy.Trump’s buddy Steve Bannon conducted an apparent strategic intervention on behalf of the Maga brigade,according to reports this week, saying Australia’s response to Covid meant our image was damaged among Trump supporters.“People in your country should understand you went from beloved to kind of shot,” he said, with breathtaking lack of self-awareness.It cuts both ways. And Australia can’t expect to fall back on mateship under Trump.Zoe Daniel is a three-time ABC foreign correspondent and the former independent member for Goldstein.

But a degree of separation is necessary and, crucially, achievable.‘At the table or on the menu’: a turbulent Davos week with Trump’s circus in townRead moreAs a tumultuous week in the Swiss Alps ends with a reprieve for Greenland and there is talk of a post-Davos peace deal for Ukraine, maybe some believe a mix of distraction and appeasement can placate the US president. Or that midterm elections in the US will lasso Trump and tame him permanently.If only that were likely. What we know is that the breakdown of a post-second world war order is set in train – let’s face it, the signs have been flashing red since the 2008 financial crisis – and Washington’s next incumbent is likely to be just as belligerent when international rules constrain them.There is some recognition in the shifting tectonic plates of international financeThere is some recognition in the shifting tectonic plates of international finance, which show a separation from the White House wrecking ball is on almost everyone’s mind.The S&P 500 might say the opposite, sucking in, as it does, so much international money that its rise seems unstoppable. In other financial markets, the reverse is true.For instance, China has spent the past year reducing its US government bond holdings. In other words, it has cut the amount it lends to the US government via the bond markets. Japanese pension funds have done the same.In part their policy is driven by the fear of a stock market crash now that US share prices are at highs not seen since the dotcom bubble at the turn of the century. What is fantastic today could bring tears tomorrow, so those who lend must take a more cautious view and hedge against disaster.China and Japan are also selling up because they have trouble at home, encouraging them to repatriate or redirect their foreign investments, but that is a different, if connected, story.The ongoing leaching away of bond investors means the cost of US government borrowing has begun to rise, little by little. IfEuropewere to begin instituting a financial divorce, it too would start selling the US bonds it holds.This week a fearless and spirited pension scheme – the main retirement fund for Danish academics – provided a glimpse of what could be the norm.The AkademikerPension said it would sell all remaining US government bonds in its multibillion-pound fund by the end of the month. The investment director Anders Schelde made the announcement as Trump was still threatening to invade Greenland.“The decision is rooted in the poor US government finances,” he said. “Thus, it is not ⁠directly related ⁠to ​the ongoing rift between the US and Europe, but of course that didn’t make it more ‍difficult to take the decision.”The holding is small, at $100m (£73m). Nevertheless, its impact as a beacon to others could be huge.European regulators could help by making it easier for other pension funds to sell their US bond holdingsEuropean regulators could help by making it easier for other pension funds to sell their US bond holdings. Some experts believe pension funds slavishly followed credit rating agency verdicts. And while most agencies downgraded the US last year, they still say it is a safe bet.It should be remembered that credit ratings agencies were at the heart of the 2008 crash. They said the financial products containing US sub-prime mortgages were safe. They weren’t.If pension funds can consider US debt to be more at risk, they can reduce their holdings. There is a cost, there always is, to a reduction rather than a Danish-style clear-out, which is that the bonds remaining in any portfolio are worth less. And the more pension funds sell, the lower the value goes.But there is a gain, just as there is to the Danish, of a less risky portfolio once the number and value of US bonds is reduced.Europeans could also lend to themselves, if Brussels created a market for bonds denominated in euros. This would create a rival market to US Treasury bonds, offering an alternative safe haven that would drain the US market even further.As a proposal it dates back to a 2010 document from the Bruegel thinktank,which it recently updated. Since then the EU has corralled its disparate members to agree one-off eurobonds, most recently the borrowing that underpinned its post-Covid €385bn (£334bn) NextGenerationEU recovery scheme.Like previous schemes it was a one-off. As Bruegel andmore recently the Peterson Institutehave argued, there needs to be a permanent market that could begin to rival the US and others. The opportunity is ripe. Funds across the world are looking for safe havens and Europe could be one of those places.Brussels could start with a coalition of the willing rather than all 28 countries. It could reluctantly admit that much of the money would be generated by banks in London, which hosts bond markets that run deeper and wider than anything on the continent.And why would that be a problem? Politicians in Berlin, Amsterdam, Dublin and maybe even Paris want the UK to be pulled closer to the EU. If there is more money to be made, then resistance on both sides of the Channel could ebb away.And if there is a degree of insulation from Trump’s threats of financial punishment from Europeans creating their own debt market, in their own currency, then all the better.Explore more on these topicsEconomicsViewpoint columnGlobal economyDavos 2026TariffsDonald TrumpTrump tariffsEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

But this useless cruelty is shamelessSat 24 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 09.02 ESTShareLiam Ramos is five. In photographs of his arrest on Tuesday, released by the school district where he is enrolled as a preschooler, he iswearing a large blue hatwith a bunny face and ears. According to the superintendent, Liam had justarrived home from schoolwith his father when ICE agents apprehended the two and arrested them. Allegedly, one of Liam’s relatives, who was outside at the time, begged for the little boy to be allowed to stay there in their care; instead, both father and son were captured by the federal agents and quickly transported to a detention camp in Dilley, Texas. Liam’s father hasno apparent criminal record; he has a pending asylum case. Does it need to be said that the child does not have a criminal record, either? In one picture, a white man’s hand clutches, claw-like, on to the back of Liam’s Spider-Man backpack. In another, a masked man stands behind Liam, stooping slightly to reach the small child, as the boy stands at the front door of his home. According toschool officials,the agent instructed Liam to knock on the door and ask to be let into the house “in order to see if anyone else was home – essentially using a five-year-old as bait”.Liam is the fourth child from his Minneapolis-area school district to be seized by ICE agents since the surge of federal immigration forces in the city. According to school officials, two 17-year olds were also taken – one snatched alone from their car, another captured at home with her mother. Another child,a 10-year-old girlin the fourth grade, was allegedly also taken by the federal forces – while on her way to school with her mother.A knock at the door: fear of ICE is transforming daily life in America | Abdul Wahid GulraniRead moreLiam was bundled up for school against the frigidMinnesotawinter. Someone – was it his father, who was captured along with him, or his mother, who must now be wondering when she will see her child again – pulled him into his plaid jacket, and packed a lunch into the Spider-Man backpack that is nearly as big as he is. In a school picture released by his school district, Liam has the fat cheeks of a baby, and a smile that reveals a row of square milk teeth. It is unclear whether, at the detention camp in Texas he was quickly spirited away to, he has been allowed to stay with his father, or whether the boy is imprisoned alone.But it is likely that he is not being treated well there. A report on detention camps holding children – including the one in Dilley, Texas – from the non-profit newsroomthe Marshall Project, reveals claims of dirty conditions, overcrowding and inadequate food. Detained families said “the food was contaminated with mold and worms”. Children suffered “so much psychological stress that parents said they were hitting their own faces or wetting themselves despite being potty-trained”. It is due to the sadism and capriciousness of ICE that Liam, a child, must now face conditions like these, instead of returning home after school to the family that loves him. “He is so kind and loving,” Liam’s preschool teacher said of the boyin a statement. “His classmates miss him.” Whatever Liam is experiencing now, in an ICE detention camp, it is likely that he is very scared.There is a certain cynical worldliness that you have to develop to write about theTrump administration. Over the past decade, those of us who cover or monitor Trump and his movement have been disabused – repeatedly, if need be – of the notion that there is a limit to their cruelty, a point at which their appetite for sadism or displays of domination will be satiated. Weary explanations of the movement’s conduct have acquired the wan familiarity of cliché: the cruelty is the point. Shock, surprise – these are not things we feel anymore.Still, I confess that I am shocked now. Liam’s plain blamelessness, his innocence, the useless cruelty of his capture, the bald, shameless cynicism of his use as “bait” to capture the adults who love him – these evidence an evil I was naive enough not to know about. I am not so naive anymore.It need not detract from the specificity of Liam and his suffering to say that his arrest and the photos of it that were released by the school that wants him back, are a potent symbol of what Trump’s ICE raids are doing, both toMinneapolisand to the country as a whole. The images of the shocked, small Liam – bundled up by loving parents against the cold – flanked by armed, masked men give the lie to the administration’s claim, long transparent and cynical, that the raids are targeting criminals. But they also make plain the sheer sadism of ICE and their agenda, the smallness, cowardice and moral degeneracy of people who would arm themselves to the teeth and cover their faces in order to attack a child not yet big enough to tie his own shoes. ICE is the worst of America, indeed perhaps the worst of humanity – a window into the corruption that is possible in the human soul. They are animals with the gall to call themselves men.But what the images of Liam also do is show the reality of the immigrants that ICE is spiriting off to faraway prisons, where the detained have few rights. In the pleading tone of the officials at Liam’s school – who had to tell an ICE vehicle to leave them alone while they were giving their press conference about his arrest – I can hear the reality that so many native-born Americans are now confronting: that the immigrants that ICE is stealing belong to us. Liam belongs to us the way that every child belongs to us – the way that their innocence and vulnerability make them our responsibility. But the adult immigrants who are being stolen belong to us, too – they belong to us in the sense that proximity, and familiarity, and regular interaction bring us all into a community of principle and mutual care, make us all our brother’s keeper, and calls on us to love our neighbors.Liam’s loved ones miss him as their friend, their son, and their student; we are enraged and scared for him as a child and as a fellow human being. It is the guiding philosophy of the white supremacists shaping immigration policy in the Trump administration that mankind is not one community, that we must not care for all of our fellows equally. The wrongness and evil of this idea is evident in Liam’s face.On Friday, just days after Liam’s capture, thousands of his neighbors in Minneapolis took to the streets to protest ICE’s presence in their city. In them we can see a noble, even heroic counterexample, the other side of America: they hate ICE in proportion to how much they love their fellow man.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)OpinionMinnesotaMinneapolisTrump administrationChildrencommentShareReuse this content"

But the markets forced his climbdownRosa BalfourWhile the threat of retaliatory measures to stop the annexation of Greenland worked, it remains to be seen if Europe has the unity to follow throughSat 24 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 12.47 ESTShareThe past couple of weeks have seen the most spectacular crisis escalation in the transatlantic relationship, over the US threat to annexGreenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark. It risked becoming a major conflict among the members of Nato, the most powerful security alliance in world history – until now.On Wednesday, after a meeting with Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, the US president, Donald Trump,backtracked on his threatsto slap tariffs on countries that got in the way of his annexation project. As European leaders huddled together over dinner for apost-crisis debriefin Brussels on 22 January, they congratulated themselves on their unity and appreciated the intervention of Rutte, or “Daddy diplomacy”. If these really were the conclusions of the latest debacle in transatlantic relations, they are missing important parts of the story.Rutte is well versed in dealing with Trump. It is likely that their conversation pushed the right buttons, offering him an offramp for his “psychologically important” need for Greenland. Earlier diplomatic talks between American, Danish and Greenlandic representatives addressing the reasons behind the US wish to annex Greenland – national security, the mineral resources under its land mass and its quick access to space – had not made the breakthrough. Further Nato and European assurances on these questions seem to be part of the “framework” that Rutte and Trump discussed to end the crisis, such as banning China from mining exploration and offering a base for the USGolden Domeproject.But what really changed the calculus was dangling the possibility of retaliatory measures to thetune of $93bn,making the markets jittery and Trump fold. Europe, too, can use economic leverage to its advantage.Paradoxically, Europeans were far from united in resorting to retaliatory measures. Had Trump not U-turned on his tariff threats, it is far from certain that the EU would have found the qualified majority needed to activate its new and never used tool called theanti-coercion instrument(ACI), whereby the European Commission can establish whether a foreign power is using economic coercion to undermine the EU and, if it is, carry out proportionate deterrence and retaliatory measures. Measures can range from tariffs and blocking foreign access to public procurement, all the way to sanctions, which otherwise require unanimity. It was ultimately the reaction of the markets, which responded to the EU’s trade bazooka rather than its diplomatic manoeuvring, that was decisive in Trump’s climbdown.The Greenland debacle showed thatEuropecan flip the table on its dependence on the US. This can be done through its economic leverage and smart diplomacy in Washington, by reaching out to institutional counterparts such as members of Congress and Republican representatives who might have some influence and can play a role in restraining the US executive. Europe can also use security cooperation in a productive way to counter concocted justifications for US action, and sharpen its economic toolbox for political ends. But it equally exposed, yet again, two glaring but familiar struggles.The first is how to equip the EU with the power to use economic leverage in a political way – just as the US and China are able to weaponise their economic power to coerce other countries. As a community of law, the EU obviously differs from authoritarian states or executives that flout their domestic law to overreach abroad. But appropriateeconomic statecraftand strategy could still make Europe as a whole punch to its weight.At Davos, European leaders made the connection between economic strength and global heft. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, reminded her audience of the opportunities that the collapse of theBretton Woods systemgave to Europe to grow. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, talked about Europe’s need to strengthen its economy. But they have consistently failed to tie these grand visions to practical steps, as the underwhelming implementation of theDraghiandLettareports show.Trump’s Greenland U-turn was spectacular. The lesson for Europe: strongmen understand only strength | Nathalie TocciRead moreThe reluctance to activate the ACI was less about making economic and political tools work in tandem and more about unwillingness to use EU scale at the expense of its much smaller national wriggle room. Political leaders are keener to keep the power to block bank mergers and make phone calls to Trump than to work towards a Europe that has an economic and political role to play in tomorrow’s world, despite the growing public support for the EU.The second and related issue is that the divisions within Europe about how to handle the US go beyond tactical questions of using the EU’s carrots and sticks. A cognitive dependence on the US is the result of generations of diplomats steeped in the transatlantic mindset. When Europeans have delivered strategy, such as in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it was in lockstep with Washington. In parts of eastern Europe, the US is core to the post-Soviet identity. Keeping the US involved in Europe in the face of the Russian threat is seen as a priority. Add to the mix the pro-Trumpians, and the cacophony is loud. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, left the informal summit without commenting. It is unclear how long she can keep up her double gamebetween Brussels and Washington. Viktor Orbán has long stopped working with his fellow EU members and now has agreed to join the autocratic crowd on Trump’s “board of peace”.Europe’s cacophony is seen as a sign of weakness at home and abroad, and some of these differences may never be bridged. European leaders have preferred flattery and appeasement to tough talk, losing their credibility with the US but not with the markets, which took the possibility of EU retaliation seriously. The Greenland lesson suggests there are ways to turn the cacophony into “strategic ambiguity”, by keeping antagonistic powers uncertain about the full scale of the EU’s response, and through a purposeful use of Brussels’s sophisticated and multi-use toolbox.Rosa Balfour is director of Carnegie EuropeExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionGreenlandDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Just don’t expect it to save democracyAlexander HurstIn the US, comedy has long filled the space vacated by partisan news media. Now France is following its leadSat 24 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 10.45 ESTShareSometimes the freedom and openness of comedy means it is better able to respond to world events than news media. Take South Park’s raucous, unhinged and visually disturbing depictions of Donald Trump – most recently, cheating on Satan (who iscarrying his spawn) with JD Vance in the White House. Fair enough: Trey Parker and Matt Stone very much own this terrain.But there’s no reason why satirical TV programmes such as The Daily Show should have to take onthe role of news provider, investigative journalist and critic. And yet, over the past three decades, the failings of the US corporate media to adequately cover the country’s dilapidated politics has pushed people such as Jon Stewart into filling the void.The problem was identified as long ago as 2000 by the US economist Paul Krugman. Hecastigatedthe press for being “fanatically determined to seem even-handed”, to the point they were unwilling to call out outrageous untruths. “If a presidential candidate were to declare that the Earth is flat,” Krugman wrote, “you would be sure to see a news analysis under the headline Shape of the Planet: Both Sides Have a Point.”It was this context that provided American satire’s cathartic triumph in the first years of the 21st century. The Daily Show began conducting harder-hitting interviews than most primetime TV shows. Stephen Colbert rose to prominence by playing a fake conservative talkshow host, in an open parody of Bill O’Reilly’s mid-2000s show on Fox. And then John Oliver pioneered “investigative comedy”, frequently doing a better job of breaking scandalous stories than the news programmes he was satirising.As two researchers from the universities of Innsbruck and Groningenargue in a paperpublished last summer, “affective shifts” among the public enable late-night comedians to build trust with their audience, “which ultimately allows political comedy to act as a form of opinionated journalism”.A new generation of stand-ups seem to understand this power instinctively. “Comedians don’t have to play by the same rules, so they can point out the glaringly obvious – so obvious it feels subjective,” Parisian journalist and standup comedian Charles Pellegrin told me. Meanwhile, Safia Benyahia, who runs a Paris-based comedy production company, said that standup has grown in popularity “because everything is more political and divisive. People are walking on eggshells and they trust comedy to engage difficult topics in a safe way.”But the lines have become ever more blurred. From the absurd official statements issued by the White House to comedy writers straining to satirise serious and horrific events, political news has come close to breaking comedy.“Trump gave us so much fodder that you could only approach it at a superficial level, and a lot of viewers, I think, went: you’re just recounting the day,” millennial American standup star Gianmarco Soresi told me.Comedyat its best, he continued, “is trying to blow things up. Comedy should question power, and the second that comedy becomes power, it’s lost its efficacy, and that’s why it was so offensive when comedians kind of saddled up to Trump.”However, Soresi was also quick to say that comedy cannot replace politics: there are limits to its powers. “Do I think we can create a space for relief? Yes. Do I think it can create a space for reflection? Yes. Do I think – as an American Jew – it can poke holes in Israel’s geopolitical agenda? Yes,” says Soresi. “Do I think it can build a political movement that takes down Netanyahu? No.”I go to a fair amount of standup comedy in Parisian basement bars, where the scene Pellegrin and Benyahia are part of is thriving. I’ve had my fair share of laughs at the latest season of South Park, and I know the likes of Stewart, Oliver and Colbert regularly help save the sanity of my American friends. But there is a danger in what we’re asking comedy to do: to take on journalism’s responsibility to inform the public, and to act as a public forum – but without any of journalism’s institutional safeguards.When I first moved to France, in 2012, I wondered why there didn’t seem to be the same prevalence of satirical political comedy shows on French TV as there was in the US. I slowly realised that this was because the news media were doing their job properly. The evening politics show Des Paroles et Des Actes on France 2 included live factchecking of claims made by its guests. Presidential debates were more than just a collection of 30-second soundbites: moderators followed up with candidates, sometimes multiple times, and fairness was ensured by tracking overall speaking time.Over the past decade and a half though, things have been declining in the French media sphere too. Two right-wing billionairesin particularhave gobbled up television stations, radio stations and newspapers. CNews has positioned itself as a French version of Fox, trust in news mediahas fallenanddisinformationhas taken a stronger hold. At the same time, French society feels more polarised and the far right has increased its electoral performance.I worry that France is headed down the same path as the US, whereby the traditional news media become weaker and more partisan, politics becomes a farce and comedy steps in to fill the void: see, for example, satire site Le Gorafibusting Sarkozyover his absurd prison memoir, after justthree weeks in jail.Anti-politics thrives where anti-media have taken root, leaving comedy to be both catharsis and cause. I don’t know if this can be reversed, but I do know that we have to try. Whatever the cost, the long-term return will be far greater. Without it, we risk turning the comedian’s stage into our most important public forum. That’s dangerous for society, and also the opposite of what comedy should be.Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnist.

Martin has been with the Guardian for decades; Ella has been contributing since 2022. This week, we challenged the pair to draw on the same subject (Trump and a world in turmoil), on the same day, to see what each – with their different styles, tools and perspectives – would come up with. Martin landed on a Shakespearean scene, with a warped “King Leer” flanked by snickering world leaders. Ella proposed him squatting in a dystopian nest, surrounded by his spoils.Below, each reflects on their process, the challenges and joys of political cartoons, and what they have learned from one another.Martin RowsonMartin Rowson at work at his home in south-east London – videoI’m old school. In the same way humans have forat least 67,800 years, I make marks with something runny on a flattish surface. Despite the growth of digital imaging over the past 40 years, I can’t even do Photoshop. That’s why I wanted to see what would happen if my friend and colleague Ella Baron and I had a “cartoon-off”, drawing the same topic to the same deadline, because she works exclusively digitally.My ludditism lies in my love of the tactility of the pencils, pens and brushes I use caressing and snagging on the paper. I also like the jeopardy, dancing with deadlines or not knowing if doing that wash in that way at this point is going to work or completely ruin the image. This lack of certainty is what makes my job fun (it’s standard seat-of-your-pants journalism). And I can’t be arsed to learn how to do it any other way.My hope is that all this makes the cartoon look good while implying there’s been a bit of a scrap between me and the piece of paper. It’s something I learned from the genius ofRonald SearleandRalph Steadman, who miraculously reveal the soul through the chaotic messiness.Martin Rowson's work in progress – videoThus equipped, I approach each cartoon the same way, never thinking about it until the day I’m filing (Guardian political cartoons are pitched, drawn and published within a single day), nor immersing myself too deeply in the surrounding analyses. I haven’t listened to the Today programme for more than 30 years; what the paper and its readers want is my analysis, not theirs.After listening to the 7am news headlines (on BBC Radio 3), within about 20 minutes, in ways I really don’t understand, I’ll have collided images and scenarios together in my mind’s eye enough to have created a clear image, which I then describe via email to my editors. So the most gruelling part of my day’s work is over by 7.30am.Next is the tricky bit, getting what’s in my head on to paper. I sketch it in pencil, ink over the outlines and then start painting, using a mixture of gouache and watercolour. This is specifically painting, in layers, washes and tones. Apart from anything else, and considering the perpetual state of the news, four or five hours doing watercolours is awfully restful.I work in the great English tradition of James Gillray and William Hogarth, filling the canvas. The image is drawn 50% larger than it appears when printed, allowing for lots of detail and space to add things if the story I’m covering develops during the day. Very occasionally a bigger, better story breaks. Then I’ll start again and just work quicker.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Martin Rowson/The GuardianFrom blank sheet of paper to completion, it takes around six hours for each cartoon.How Ella produces her extraordinary work is a total mystery to me. I’ve long appreciated she’s special, with seriously mad shit in her head she can get out on to a screen to share with us. But if she spent for ever telling us how she does it, it would still be like someone screaming Sanskrit into a pillow for all the sense it made to me.She and most of my other colleagues are, I know, the way forward. This won’t make much difference to the content of visual satire, which has been around for as long as we’ve had elites that require satirising. I’ll regret the loss of the messiness of my method, because I feel mess should be our natural habitat, but so what?President Trump shows why we’re still needed, to enrage his cultists but comfort and empower the rest of us, the victims of his increasing, capricious madness. My Trump No 2 is older, flappier, fleshier and madder than the first iteration 10 years ago. I’m still using just as much orange paint though.Ella BaronElla Baron at work in her studio in east London – videoI draw with a Wacom Cintiq tablet and stylus. It’s frustrating when people say this isn’t drawing by hand: I have hands and my stylus is more sensitive to pressure and barrel rotation than an ordinary pen. I don’t have any formal art training, but grew up drawing digitally as part of the first generation with easy access to that technology. It’s intrinsic to my style, but it’s hard to pin down how because I’ve never known anything different.You don’t make smudges when you draw on a screen, but you do make mistakes. The outlines of previous forms are a record of your hand movements and lend dynamism to the figures they represent. I think it’s good to leave them in. Politics is messy and political cartoons should be too. I’m very jealous of the evocative (in his own words) mess of Martin’s work – I don’t think it’s something I could ever achieve with my tools. What I can do with them is refine: zoom in on individual lines and tweak them to such an extent that if you’d be working on paper you’d have made a hole in it and in the desk below. It’s helpful when you’re trying to pin down the expression of a caricature, where the thickness and angle of an eyebrow can be the difference between a smile and a frown.The juxtaposition of these pared-down, fragile lines and bold, confident ones can be helpful in evoking the power dynamics which are important to political cartoons. Cartoons offer a rare opportunityto put the powerful into close proximity on the page with the people whose lives they dictate – it’s a way of holding that power to account.A cartoon can’t encapsulate the news, but I think it can cut through it. It is hypothetical: a twist on reality that makes you look back at it from a different perspective. That twist is what I’m looking for when I’m surfing through the news for cartoon ideas in the morning. I find symbols and idioms really helpful here – and feathered nests and their figurative ilk are much more fun to draw than men in suits.Ella Baron's work in progress – videoOnce I have several visuals I shuffle them like a deck of cards in my head until they form a composition that makes a point. The pointyness of that point is important to me. Frustrating as tight deadlines are, they force you to streamline the image around your message, because there’s rarely time for anything else. If you need to draw a crowd scene in 20 minutes then you have to distill it into the few lines that evoke “essence of crowd”. This distillation is also key to caricatures: of all the many lines that make up Trump, which are yours? I’m interested in the ways in which the image he projects of himself slips. The orange tan that doesn’t extend beyond the neckline or wrists; the pale bald patches showing through his yellow comb-over. It’s a way to undermine his ego, like plucking the feathers off. I think the best caricatures capture not just a politician’s face but their whole body and its movement. I hoped that the finger motion of plucking feathers would evoke Trump’s pincer-like hand gestures.When I’m drawing a political cartoon I’m always slightly in awe of the fact I’m working from and into a tradition. I’ve admired Martin’s work all my life and his caricatures have deeply shaped how I see politicians and inspired how I’ve gone on to draw them. I now have the more complicated task of working out how my cartoons could and should be different. At the beginning it felt necessary to prove that I could do the job of the (almost exclusively) men who came before me, even when it wasn’t International Women’s Day, by rinsing most of the femininity out of my cartoons; both in concept and in style. Gradually, with a bit more confidence and experience, I’ve been trying to bring it back.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Ella Baron/The Guardian"

First Nations people know it all too wellBridget CamaWe need sustained, honest discussions about why we are no closer to closing the gap and addressing our nation’s unfinished business. Instead we get delay dressed up as actionBridget Cama on Invasion Day and the political silence on First Nations rights – Full Story podcastSat 24 Jan 2026 18.00 ESTLast modified on Sat 24 Jan 2026 18.06 ESTShareAs Australians wind down over the January break and welcome in the new year, a familiar pattern begins. Media headlines start to surface, and social media feeds fill with polls from major outlets asking, “Should we change the date of Australia Day?”People are invited to react with an emoji to vote yes or no, and the comment sections quickly flood with strongly held opinions.This happens every year. Like clockwork.For a brief, intense period, the nation is consumed by divisive headlines and reactive debate about 26 January and whether the date should be changed. And then, just as predictably, comes the silence.While the annual “change the date” debate is an important conversation, it nonetheless risks overshadowing the broader and far more urgent systemic injustices experienced by First Nations peoples and the need for structural reform to address them. Once the frenzy surrounding 26 January subsides, we are left exactly where we were before: no closer to improving the lives of First Nations people, no closer to closing the gap, and no closer to addressing our nation’s unfinished business.That silence has been particularly deafening in the two years since the 2023 voice referendum.Full StoryBridget Cama on Invasion Day and the political silence on First Nations rights – Full Story podcastSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2026/01/20-29594-FS_BRIDGET_CAMA.mp300:00:0000:21:12Most Australians would agree that the level of disadvantage experienced by First Nations peoples in this country is unacceptable. Yet each year we are drawn into the same familiar cycle: the release of the Closing the Gap report, followed by a press conference confirming what we already know – that the gap remains and governments are not on track to meet the 19 socioeconomic targets and four priority reforms under the national agreement. In fact, on several key measures, outcomes are not merely stagnating but worsening.This ongoing failure is not the result of isolated policy missteps. It reflects entrenched systemic issues embedded within Australia’s institutions and decision-making structures. The Productivity Commission’s review of the Closing the Gap agenda makes clear that much of what governments are doing to implement the national agreement remains “business as usual” and that this is a key reason progress remains slow or is going backwards. Without structural reform that enables First Nations peoples to have a guaranteed and genuine say in the laws and policies that affect their lives, the same systems that created inequality will continue to reproduce it, year after year, report after report.Without structural reform, without a voice to parliament, governments will continue to consult without transparency, often engaging individuals who are not representative of communities and who are not grounded in the right of self-determination.We cannot continue doing what has already failed.We need sustained, honest discussions about why First Nations people die younger than other Australians; why our young people are over-incarcerated; and why our children continue to be removed from their families at unprecedented rates. These are the conversations that matter. And they must occur year-round.I believed Australia could not look away from Aboriginal deaths in custody. I was wrong | Lorena AllamRead moreYet instead, we are confronted with a more troubling reality: a sustained political silence on Indigenous affairs. This was laid bare in the most recent election, where neither major party leader articulated a clear, credible or comprehensive vision for Indigenous Affairs in this country. In the absence of leadership, substantive reform has been replaced with noise and distraction.Since the 2023 referendum, the government has announced it is adopting a “new direction” in Indigenous affairs, “economic empowerment”. But this agenda is not new. Economic development has been the centrepiece of Indigenous affairs policy since the Howard era, and it has not delivered meaningful improvements in the systemic disadvantage First Nations peoples continue to experience. Re-branding the status quo does not constitute reform. Talk of wealth creation and equity funds can sound impressive, but it’s largely speculative and tied to forces in the global economy beyond community control. The approach is led by bodies like Indigenous Business Australia, which are accountable to parliament, not to the communities affected.Alongside this, we have seen renewed calls for a national truth-telling process. While truth-telling was mentioned in the Uluru statement from the heart, the primary purpose was for constitutional power.We know truth-telling processes, particularly those that are state-led, do not shift power, change decision-making, or address the systemic drivers of inequality at the core of First Nations disadvantage because we’ve had truth-telling many times in Australia. Truth-telling cannot deliver justice nor is it required to claim rights.The risk is that truth-telling processes place the burden for change back on to First Nations peoples, rather than on the institutions responsible for historic and ongoing harm. There is no evidence that a national truth-telling commission, on its own, will improve the lives of our people. At best, it buys governments time. At worst, it delays the structural reform our communities are calling for.This is not progress. It is delay dressed up as action. We cannot allow the federal government to go down this path again. They can’t even deliver on closing the gap.Today, First Nations communities continue to call for a meaningful, national mechanism to be heard in decisions that affect our lives. If we are serious about justice, we must stay focused on the mandate of the Uluru statement from the heart: towards meaningful recognition and structural reform. The issues we face are systemic and structural in nature. That is where change must occur.Bridget Cama is the Uluru Dialogue youth co-chairExplore more on these topicsIndigenous AustraliansOpinionAustralian politicsIndigenous voice to parliamentIndigenous incarcerationcommentShareReuse this content"

The sense of being hemmed in, politically and personally, was hard to escape.I had been raised to believe in communism, and for a long time I did. I even applied twice to join the Young Communist League, only to be rejected for not being “combative” enough: code for not informing on others. Friends were expelled from university or jailed for speaking too freely and my family included people in the military and police, so I had to be careful not to endanger them. But amid that stifling conformity, something else had begun to take hold.When I was 13, my first girlfriend’s father, a sailor, brought back LPs from abroad. Through those records, I discovered rock’n’roll. In Cuba at the time, that was no small thing. Western music arrived years late, passed hand to hand through a black market of cassette tapes copied and recopied.It wasn’t without risk: I know people who went to jail just for listening to the Beatles or the Rolling StonesBy the time I reached my fourth year of secondary school, music had become an obsession. Four or five of us made an unspoken pact to seek it out wherever we could. We held listening sessions in each other’s homes and gathered at an arts centre every Saturday night, where local bands played or taped rock blared from speakers. It wasn’t without risk: I know people who went to jail just for listening to the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. Long hair, bracelets, necklaces – any hint of “western proclivities” – could land you in the back of a van for the night.I was 15 in 1986, living in a one-bed flat in Havana that I shared with my mother, grandmother, aunt and cousin, when I discovered The Prophet’s Song byQueen. I’d heard of the band, but I had never listened to them properly. A friend had sourced A Night at the Opera for me, photocopying the inlay with the lyrics included. I listened to it on a battered mono cassette player with a single speaker, hardly ideal for an album so carefully constructed.And yet, from the opening notes, it stopped me cold. The song begins gently, with soft guitar chords, before shifting into something more frenetic. Then Freddie Mercury’s voice arrives: possessed, prophetic, as if rallying an unseen crowd; his voice had this beautiful urgency, singing about a vision he had.Then came the moment that changed everything. Brian May’s delay effect multiplies Mercury’s voice – “Now I know, now I know” – so it echoes into itself, ghostlike and disembodied. Even through that tinny speaker, it was otherworldly. For eight minutes, the noise of Havana fell away. In that cramped flat, surrounded by family and surveillance, a crack opened.What moved me wasn’t just the sound, but what it represented. A Night at the Opera was Queen’s first album after falling out with their management. They were given creative freedom. Until then, my world had been bound by “socialism or death”, words still painted on Havana’s walls. Suddenly, I too felt the freedom to imagine something different. The inspiration for the song, written by Brian May, was a fever dream he had while recovering from an illness. In a way, the track became my own personal convalescence.My cultural awakening: Losing My Religion by REM helped me escape a doomsday cultRead moreI didn’t immediately become a dissident. But I kept that kernel of rebellion inside me. Rock music pulled me through the late 80s, through the fear of conscription, through the brutal 90s when friends drowned trying to leave Cuba on homemade boats. I went on to study English and ran a successful, but risky, black-market translation business (if caught, I would have ended up in jail unless I bribed my way out of it). This business also included city tours, not only in English but in French and German too. Eventually I made my way to the UK in 1997: I met my British (now ex-) wife in Havana and we were married for more than two decades. It was the early years of New Labour, and being in a relationship with a British citizen made moving here easier. I live in London now, a writer, teacher and cycling instructor, with grownup children of my own.I still listen to The Prophet’s Song. It opened my ears not only to rock, but genres such as jazz. Most importantly, it spurred my curiosity, and the idea that life could be lived in a way that didn’t conform. In the middle of all that noise, it was the one thing that cut through.Share your cultural awakeningsShare your experiencesYou can tell us how a cultural moment has prompted you to make a major life change by filling in the form below or emailing us on cultural.awakening@theguardian.com.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Looking back, he asks what it means to lose parents who never showed you loveMark HaddonSat 24 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTShareWhen I see washed-out photographs of English life in the 60s and 70s – cardiganed grandmothers eating roadside picnics beside Morris Minors, pale men sunbathing in shoes and socks on stripy deckchairs, Raleigh Choppers and caged budgerigars and faux leather pouffes – I feel a wave of what can’t properly be called nostalgia, because the last thing I’d want is to return to that age and those places where I was often profoundly unhappy and from which I’d have been desperate to escape if escape had been a possibility. Why then this longing, this echo of some remembered comfort?Is it that, as children, we live inside a bubble of focused attention that gives everything inside a memorable fierceness? The way one could lie, for example, on a lawn and look down into the jungle of the grass to see earwigs and woodlice lumbering between the pale green trunks like brontosauri lumbering between the ferns and gingkos of the Late Jurassic. The way a rucked bedspread could become a mountain range stretched below the wings of a badly painted Airfix Spitfire. Or do objects, in their constancy, provide consolation in a world where adults are unpredictable and distant and unloving?I lived, for the first 15 years of my life, with my parents and Fiona, my younger sister, at 288a Main Road, New Duston, on the outskirts of Northampton. Dad didn’t design it but it was an architect’s house nevertheless, a hint of Scandinavian modernism in the external wood panelling, the semi-open-plan ground floor and the boxy glass lobby. Hinged, teak double doors separated the dining room and a living room dominated by an uncarpeted staircase with open risers. The chimney breast was a broad, floor-to-ceiling stack of chunky sandstone blocks straight out of The Flintstones.Under the stairs stood a Philips radiogram. If I listen carefully I can still hear King Size! by André Previn’s jazz trio, Paul Simon, and Play Bach No 2by the Jacques Loussier Trio. What I can’t hear, beyond the occasional outburst – “Jesus wept!”, “Wait till your father gets home” – are conversations. It wasn’t so much that no one spoke, it was that no onetalked. I never heard an adult tell or ask another adult something that really mattered. Maybe I wasn’t listening very hard but I don’t think anything was being said that was worth listening to, certainly nothing as interesting as the story of the Apollo space programme or the lyrics of “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard”. The most important things happened inside my head and these were not things that one shared with other people. Did similar things go on in other people’s heads? How was it possible to know?View image in fullscreen‘Mum on a beach’ in 1960.I have a vivid childhood memory of being woken up by the sound of screaming on the other side of the wall. My sister was having a nightmare. I got out of bed and walked into her room. Mum was standing there at a loss for what to do. Fiona had stopped screaming by now. She opened her eyes, sat and shuffled herself up the bed so that she could lean against the padded, plastic headboard. I assumed she was awake. We heard footsteps outside. Mum said, “That’s Daddy coming to see how you are.” My sister screamed at the top of her voice, “No! He’s got the knife!” Fiona would carry on having this dream – Dad chasing her with a knife – for the next 45 years, and it would only stop when his Alzheimer’s became unmanageable and he went into a care home.Like Fiona, I had recurrent nightmares as a child. In one I was standing at a crossroads on a ruined, post-apocalyptic plain in falling light while giant insects walked relentlessly towards me from all four points of the compass. In another I had been flushed down a toilet wearing an antique diving suit – waxed canvas, lead boots, a spherical brass helmet with hinged, circular portholes – and was drowning after becoming jammed in a narrow bend of piping.There is a photo of Mum on a beach in either Devon or Cornwall, taken by Dad. They were either just married or about to be married. She looks stunning: fuchsia lipstick, freckles, simple white earrings like peppermint Mentos rhyming with a simple white shoulderless dress or swimming costume. She radiates something I never saw her radiate in real life, nor in any later photos, even those in which she is smiling and appears happy. It’s partly those freckles, which she came to hate, which she covered in foundation and which rarely came out in summer because she avoided the sun for fear it would trigger a migraine. But the real difference is internal. The woman on the beach seems confident about her own beauty and at ease in the world.Maybe the picture’s deceptive, but I think that soon after it was taken some kind of light died in her. She had a bawdy side. She enjoyed salacious gossip and a Benny Hill double entendre. She sometimes wore a fun wig to go to dinner dances and could kick back in the right company with a Cinzano Rosso in one hand and a Consulate in the other. But these felt like distractions. Was it postnatal depression? Was it some pre-existing sadness temporarily held in abeyance by romance? Was there, from early on, some uncrossable gulf between them?My sister once asked Mum, ‘Why does Dad hate me so much?’‘You have to remember,’ said Mum, ‘that he only wanted one child’Shortly after my first adult novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, was published I said in an interview that I’d been an anxious and depressed child. It seemed an unremarkable comment. I knew many people who could say the same. Consequently I forgot having said it until I rang my parents a couple of weeks later and, to my surprise, it was Dad who answered the phone. He said that my mother was “crying herself to sleep and waking up crying in the morning” as a result of something I’d said in an interview. I pressed him for more details then told him to put Mum on the phone so we could talk about it. Dad disappeared for a few moments then said, “I’m afraid she’s weeping too much to come to the phone right now.”Mum voted Tory all her life. She was an ardent Brexiteravant la lettre, detested the idea of being connected to France by the Channel tunnel and swore she would never use it. She believed that working women were the cause of unemployment and was happy to tell anyone this, including a female friend and neighbour who had a full-time job. People with strong Northampton accents, anyone overweight, people with tattoos all evoked either mocking laughter or a shudder of theatrical disgust. She couldn’t abide men with beards, or the Welsh. She had a “golliwog” fridge magnet and referred to gay men as “lovely boys”. When an old friend of theirs started to suffer from Alzheimer’s she bemoaned the fact that his sister wasn’t helping out because “she’s too busy having chemotherapy”.She was frightened, of change and difference, of pain and discomfort, of decay and disease. One of the reasons her health was so poor in her final years was that she refused to listen to medical advice. She never did the exercises recommended by physios. She continued smoking and drinking. I was with her when she was being clerked in after one of her many ambulance rides to hospital. The young doctor asked if she took any exercise. She thought for a moment before saying, “It was a long walk to school”.She liked cleanness and tidiness and predictability. Until she was forced to move into the assisted living apartment she maintained a garden that was as clean and tidy as the interior of the house. When we had a cat she would put folded cloths in its favourite sitting spots to protect the furniture and would sometimes sneak up on it from behind and spray its back end with Marks & Spencer vaginal deodorant, something the cat did not enjoy. She didn’t read books. She didn’t listen to music.Mum had no interest in my writing. With a couple of minor exceptions she never spoke about it and certainly never asked questions about it. The one book of mine she read was Curious Incident while on holiday with Dad shortly after it came out. Her review in its entirety: “I thought there was too much swearing in it. Then I had to drive around Menorca in a car with your father and it seemed quite realistic.”In the years before Curious, and for quite a few years after, she made it clear that she would prefer me to have a “proper job”. I pressed her once to be specific and say what kind of job I could do that would make her happy. She thought for a while, trying hard to combine our two very different world views, then suggested that I could perhaps “design tools to help disabled people”.View image in fullscreenThe family house at 288a Main Road, New Duston. Illustration by Mark Haddon.Dad was an academic failure, proud of the fact that he earned one point for an English paper because he managed to write his name at least. 18 Cranbrook Road, where he grew up, was not a bookish household. There was a Bible, a prayer book and eight volumes of the Newnes’ Pictorial Knowledge presumably bought in instalments from a door-to-door salesman. Other than that it was the Sun and the Radio Times. He was, however, a prodigious sportsman. He learned to swim by watching Johnny Weissmuller in the Tarzan films. He played water polo, he sprinted, he hurdled, he swam, he boxed, he played rugby. He was also a fine draughtsman. After national service he went on to set up his own architectural partnership, designing buildings for the Open University, Carlsberg and Ikea, riding out the building slump of the 70s by designing abattoirs. In consequence we ate a lot of free pork pies as children and Dad took my subsequent vegetarianism, I suspect, as something of a personal insult.He was a big man with a short fuse.My sister once asked Mum, “Why does Dad hate me so much?”“You have to remember,” said Mum, “that he only wanted one child.”She would later say to Donna, one of her favourite care assistants, during one of the daily visits in which they shared gossip, Silk Cut and honey-roasted cashews from Waitrose, that she, too, only wanted one child. In truth, I don’t think she wanted children at all, but she had a lifelong fear of being different, of standing out, and while a woman who was unable to have children of her own would have been an object of sympathetic pity in their circles in Northampton in the early 60s, a woman who chose not to have children would have been eccentric at best and a pariah at worst.We were, I think, too much hard work. “I don’t know how you cope with three children,” she once admitted to Fiona. “I couldn’t cope with two.” I walked my sister the mile to school every day from the ages of six (me) and five (her). Dad made us breakfast and Mum stayed in bed until we had left the house. Mum also had a weekly cleaner, something unheard of among our friends. Dad would take us both to church on Sundays and then to his parents afterwards, leaving Mum at home on her own. On Saturdays and during school holidays he would regularly take Fiona to the golf club and the rugby club while he trained or played and she was looked after by Snowy the groundsman so that Mum had only one child to look after at home. That didn’t mean she was parenting as such. I would usually be in the garden, alone in my room or at a friend’s house. Often she would have cluster headaches, take Solpadeine and spend long periods lying down in a darkened bedroom.I think Mum and Dad embraced the idea of me as a freakishly clever child because it lessened their need to understand meBefore Dad died and Mum had the stroke that would put her in a nursing home I would regularly drive to Northampton to visit both of them. Dad spent the greater part of his time sitting in the armchair in his room. On one occasion the only other male resident of the memory unit picked up a sewing box from a sideboard and, for reasons known only to himself, walked into Dad’s room and tried to brain him with it. Dad floored him with a single punch, telling his favourite care assistant Judith afterwards, “I’ve still got it”. It was Judith who told me that the digital picture frame I’d brought, far from entertaining him or aiding his memory, was confusing him. He found it difficult to distinguish between people who had really come into his room and people whose pictures appeared on the little screen. In particular he kept thinking that a younger version of Mum had been visiting. “That woman’s been in again, coming on to me,” he said to Judith on one occasion. “She doesn’t stand a fucking chance.”The visits to Mum were harder work. She would often greet me by pointing out that I was losing more hair, and pay me barbed compliments about being unexpectedly smart if I was wearing a collared shirt. She asked what my children were up to and this would occupy us for a few minutes. Mostly we talked about her life. It was not a life she was enjoying. News and politics we avoided where possible. I was glad when there was some financial, practical or bureaucratic problem I could help her sort out. I think she found me boring mostly. Sometimes she would say, “Don’t look so glum”, or, “Entertain me”. She cried every time I left and clung on to me when I gave her a brief hug. I was embarrassed by how uncomfortable I found this and how difficult it was to respond in kind. I’m sure, deep down, it was because I had no memory of being hugged by her, no memory of Mum saying she loved us, no memory of her showing us real affection as children, and because there was a good deal of self-pity in her sadness. But this is just post-rationalisation. What I felt at the time was disgust, of a kind I’ve never felt about anyone else.To say that I was the favourite would imply actual liking. I certainly got preferential treatment on account of the double blessing of being both the older child and a boy. Dad allowed Mum to hit Fiona, for example, but not me. She did so regularly, once taking down Fiona’s pants at a bus stop to smack her when she was seven years old.View image in fullscreen‘I had recurrent nightmares as a child.’ Illustration by Mark Haddon.I think Mum and Dad embraced the idea of me as a freakishly clever child because it lessened their need to understand me. I was off in my own world of encyclopaedias and star charts, a world whose language was alien to them and in which I would know best how to look after myself. In contrast they treated Fiona as an encumbrance, and because she wasn’t as academic as me she was unable, in those early years, to earn the affirmation at school that she was missing at home.When, many years later, Fiona was taken into Kingston hospital with meningitis and was awaiting the results of a lumbar puncture to find out whether it was viral or bacterial (the latter can be rapidly fatal) she rang home, but Mum said they couldn’t visit because “Your father has golf in the morning”. They carried on finding reasons not to visit for the entire week she was in hospital.Neither Mum nor Dad went to her degree show when Fiona got a distinction in her MA in production design for film and television, and when she later got a job at the BBC Mum’s reaction to the news was, “You’ve already got a job looking after three children.”The last words Mum spoke to Fiona in person were, “I’ve never believed a word you’ve said.”We assume it’s hard when a loved and loving parent dies, but it can be just as hard when you lose a parent whom you don’t love and who never loved you. When Mum and Dad died it was a relief for me. For my sister it was the moment when she knew for certain that she would never hear them say sorry.What does it mean, the injunction not to speak ill of the dead? Which dead? For how long after their passing are we meant to hold our tongues? And doesspeaking illmean telling lies or telling the truth?Mum was obsessed with what other people might think of her. Someone in their village was knighted and I addressed my next letter home to “Lord and Lady Haddon”, not realising how upset she would be in case someone would think they were mocking their newly elevated neighbours. Fit in, don’t make a fuss, don’t complain or rebel or seem unnecessarily different. Propriety was everything. They bought a large antique 18th-century oil painting of an anonymous local gentleman in a heavy gold frame. To some people Mum joked that it was one of her ancestors. To others she said nothing and let them assume precisely that. Like Dad, she’d risen a long way and found herself in a place that never quite felt like solid ground. She assumed other people would judge her in the way that she judged them, by the way she spoke, the way she dressed, the cream carpets, the framed maps of the county.I don’t think it ever occurred to her that people might look at her and ask, “Was she kind? Did she care about other people? Did she love her children?”This is an edited extract from Leaving Home: A Memoir in Full Colour by Mark Haddon (Chatto & Windus).

Maybe it was a singular incident that triggered it, like that monster wave in Biarritz, France, almost 20 years ago that body-slammed me on to the seabed, taking all the skin off my chin.More likely is that my transition from fearless to frightened had been more of a slow creep, and a perfectly rational one when you consider the danger of riptides, hidden rocks, sharks and concussion. But for me, I feel it goes deeper. Almost inevitably my job will have had something to do with this. Nearly two decades of working as a journalist reporting on the very worst things that human beings can do to other human beings in a wide array of contexts has definitely eroded my sense that I can keep myself – and others – safe from harm in a dangerous world.View image in fullscreenIn recent years, I have found that any bit of sea with waves above waist-height makes it a no-go zone for me, even though I’m a good swimmer and love being in water. On holiday I’m often left fretting on the shoreline, while my family joyfully rides the waves without me.This makes me very sad. So when I recently found myself about to change jobs for the first time in 14 years, I decided that I needed a circuit break and that this circuit break should be a week-long trauma surfing retreat in Morocco. Here, I figured, I could process some of the emotionally shredding content I’d exposed myself to while, hopefully, finally facing up to my fear of waves.View image in fullscreenA post-surf meal at Riad dar Haven.Photograph: Chris WerretThe company behind the retreat I signed up to is Resurface. Founded by psychologist Josh Dickson, who specialises in trauma, recovery and personal growth, the idea is to provide a holistic experience by combining morning yoga and surf lessons with afternoon group therapy work.In a call before the retreat, Josh said his intention is to create a “flow” state, where the body and the mind are able to work together towards healing and renewal, bolstered by the sunshine, cold water and a disconnection from the rigours of our everyday lives.Surfing is not just excellent physical exercise, it requires the surfer to be immersed in nature, concentrating fully on what they’re doing moment to moment. It also triggers an array of helpful hormones –endorphins, dopamine and serotonin for mood boosts, andadrenalineand norepinephrine for thrills and focus. All of these help to create the perfect set up for therapeutic work.We travelled to beautiful beaches around Tamraght, where the waves were so tiny it was difficult for even me to be frightenedI had initially booked on to one of Resurface’s first Reset retreats, designed to promote resilience and prevent burnout. Yet for various complicated reasons, I instead ended up on its first EMDR (eye movement, desensitisation and reprocessing) group retreat.Developed in the 1980s by US psychologist Francine Shapiro, the basic aim of EMDR is to help reduce distressing emotions connected to particular memories or past traumas that the body might be holding on to.The theory is that traumatic events are not neurologically processed in the same way as healthy memories, and so they can resurface and intrude. EMDR therapy uses bilateral stimulation – for example, rapidly moving your eyes from one point to another or tapping your body left then right at the same time as concentrating on a traumatic event. This, the theory goes, allows the brain to process and store the memory normally.View image in fullscreenThe writer enjoyed the chilled atmosphere of Tamraght.Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyObviously doing this in a group setting, among strangers, feels pretty intimate and exposing, so it was with some trepidation that I arrived in the small surf town of Tamraght, just north of Agadir, one sunny October afternoon to begin the retreat.Tamraght is lovely. The quieter, more chilled sister of the flashier surf tourism hotspot Taghazout, a couple of miles to the north, its dusty streets are full of busy restaurants, ceramics and surf shops, and with a lovely seafront where you can hang out with the beach camels.Learning to catch a wave, nearly always failing and then paddling straight back out to try again, was a meditation in itselfThat night, at Riad dar Haven, our beautiful and welcoming home for the six days of the retreat, our cohort – an eclectic, multi-generational bunch – met for a dinner of chicken with green olives and lemons cooked by the resident chef.The next morning, after a short introductory session with Josh featuring some fairly excruciating but fun ice-breaking exercises, we piled into the mini van and headed down to the beach where we struggled into wetsuits and divided into groups. Some of us had never surfed (myself included), others were more experienced.Our teachers, led by local surf instructor Youness Arhbi, were excellent – patient, funny and obviously experienced at convincing first-timers with cement hips that we had a chance of standing up on our huge foam learner boards.Every morning we travelled to different, beautiful beaches around Tamraght, where the waves were so tiny it was difficult for even me to be frightened. I found the experience of being in the cold, salt water for three or four hours at a stretch exhausting yet exhilarating. And, although I was definitely not a natural, the process of learning to catch a wave, nearly always failing and then paddling straight back out to try again, was a meditation in itself.After the lessons, our group of 12 would all sit together on the beach, the sun on our faces, eating lunch and sharing the triumphs and frustrations of our surfing exploits. Then we would pile in the bus and head back to the riad where we would begin the afternoon’s therapy session.At the beginning of the week, this part of the day felt pretty exposing, but Josh was thoughtful, confident and knowledgable in leading us through the process.View image in fullscreenAnnie Kelly in Tamraght, MoroccoAt first, I didn’t find EMDR particularly transformational, although it was interesting that what came up during the sessions was often not the memory or event I had decided to focus on at the beginning. However, as the week progressed, I was surprised to discover that these sessions became the most transformational thing about the retreat for me.As for the surfing, I ended the week being almost as rubbish as when I started, but it didn’t really matterAfter years of slowly and corrosively losing faith in the world, I found real hope and connection in sharing with a group of people willing to face up to their own personal heartbreaks, traumas and pain. It was a balm that did more to restore my faith and hope in people than any amount of self-reflection could offer.As for the surfing, I ended the week being almost as rubbish as when I started, but it didn’t really matter. On my last day, the waves had changed, and although they could not credibly be described as big, they were big enough for me to feel scared. Yet with our instructor’s encouragement – and a bit of cathartic sobbing on the beach when it all got too much – I persevered.And just once, in the last half-hour of the lesson, I managed to clamber awkwardly to my feet and stand up. As I raised my arms in the air in triumph, I heard cheering from the beach and watched as the group rose to their feet and joined me in celebration.The trip was provided byResurface, which offers seven-night surf therapy retreats from£2,500pp, including accommodation, transfers, all meals, surf lessons, therapy sessions and activities; the next trips starts on11 AprilExplore more on these topicsSurfing holidaysMorocco holidaysHealth and fitness holidaysAfrica holidaysHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Made from fermented compressed soy beans, it’s an intelligent ingredient equivalent to meat in terms of protein, subtle and nutty in flavour and chewy in texture. Happily, it is also now widely available in most large UK supermarkets. Here, the tempeh is cooked in a typical Indonesian way – that is, fried until crisp, then coated in a sticky, spicy sweet soy sauce and liberally sprinkled with salted peanuts. In fact, the only anomaly is the leeks, making this dish mostly Indonesian but via a field in Lincolnshire.Leek and tempeh manisYou’ll probably need a trip to an online or local Asian supermarket to pick up the kecap manis, a sweet soy sauce; and sambal oelek, a zingy and magical Indonesian chilli sauce. While you’re there, you could also buy the makrut lime leaves, palm sugar and tempeh, but those are also available in most big supermarkets these days.Prep10 minCook30 minServes42 large leeks(330g)6 tbsp neutral oil, plus a little extra if need be400g tempeh, cut into 1cm cubes – I like theTofooandTibabrands4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced6cm x 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated4 tbsp sambal oelek3 fresh or frozen makrut lime leaves, deveined and finely shredded1½ tbsp palm sugar, or light brown soft sugar1 tbsp kecap manis,plus extra for drizzlingFine sea salt60g roasted peanuts, finely choppedSteamed jasmine rice, to serveTop and tail the leeks, cut them in half lengthways, then finely slice the whites and greens. Put the shredded leeks in a colander, wash them well in cold water, then sit the colander in a bowl of fresh cold water and leave for five minutes, swishing them from time to time with your hands. Drain the leeks and set aside.Put two tablespoons of the oil in a wide pan over a medium-high heat. When hot, add the tempeh and fry for eight to 10 minutes, turning until the cubes are golden and crisp on all sides, then transfer to a plate.Pat the leeks dry. Pour three tablespoons of oil into the same pan and tip in half the sliced leeks. Cook on a medium-high heat for about eight minutes in all, leaving them undisturbed for a couple of minutes at a time before stirring, so they crisp up. Once the leeks are crisp, transfer them to a second plate. Repeat with the remaining leeks, adding more oil if need be.In the same pan, add the remaining tablespoon of oil and the garlic and ginger, and fry, stirring, for two minutes. Add the sambal oelek, shredded lime leaves, palm sugar, kecap manis, half a teaspoon of salt and two tablespoons of water, then mix in all the browned tempeh, three-quarters of the crisp leeks and all but a sprinkle of the peanuts until well combined.Put the tempeh and leek mixture on a platter, drizzle with a little extra kecap manis, then top first with the remaining leeks followed by the remaining peanuts. Serve with hot jasmine rice.Explore more on these topicsIndonesian food and drinkThe new veganVegetablesFoodVegan food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
