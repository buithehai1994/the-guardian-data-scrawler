Be grateful we still haveLiz Truss. The UK’s lone fixed point. Our very own guilty secret. The prime minister we all try our best to forget we ever had, if only Liz would let us. But Truss is like that Japanese soldier who only realised the second world war was over in 1974. For Liz, global events mean nothing. She will keep fighting the Great Betrayal of 2022 for as long as she has breath. It’s all that gives her life meaning.Shortly before Christmas, Radon Liz decided to launch her own ultra-low-budgetYouTube TV and podcast show. No expense incurred. Now, it’s possible there are some who have watched the eight subsequent shows – Liz is a role model for masochists and crackpots – but there is no need for anyone else to bother. Unless, like me, you choose to drop in out of curiosity. To check that it’s as laughably deranged as you remember. And it is. Because each episode is essentially the same. Liz insisting she was the best prime minister the country ever had and that she was brought down by Dark Forces.Perhaps you can best judge a show by the quality of its guests. You would have thought a former prime minister would have access to some of the world’s best. A time to call in favours. Maybe not Trump – he’s a wee bit preoccupied with imperialist adventures – but someone close to him. Marco Rubio or Pete Hegseth. Surely they are mad enough? Apparently not.Then there were all those Tory politicians who couldn’t get enough of Lizzy three and a half years ago. Surely some of them would do her a favour. How about Kemi? Surely she could spare an hour to tell the world how much she admired the mini budget. But no. Not a single former colleague has stepped forward. Not even Chris Philp, who would do anything for attention. He’s let it be known he’s busy for the foreseeable future.So that has left Lizzy to scrape the barrel with an array of conspiracy theorists and rightwing columnists who are just as desperate for attention as she is. Though it’s possible some are just coming along for a £200 paycheck and the laughs. And yet … imagine how many contacts Truss must have burned through in little more than a month for her to scrape the barrel with the mephitic Dan Wootton. The former showbiz editor of the Sun, famed for exclusives on how Prince Harry wore socks that didn’t match and why this meant the end of the Royal Family as we know it,turned sacked GB News gobshite.Still, beggars can’t be choosers. So Liz began her “Podcast Extra Special” – the one no one had asked for – by reminding everyone she had been forced to resign, not for crashing the economy and being generally the most useless prime minister the country had ever had, but by the Bank of England and the Deep State, and welcoming Desperate Dan on to the show as one of the most brilliant political minds left in the country.Dan was a giant of independent journalism, Lizzy told us. One of the few people who could see the world as it really was. Desperate Dan couldn’t help but modestly agree. His defenestration from GB News was solely due to him calling out the mainstream media every night. There was only so much truth the channel could bear.Other versions are available. Everyone else remembers Wootton being sacked by MailOnline and who left after being suspended by GB News forlaughing at foul comments on air made by Laurence Foxabout a female journalist and then doing everything he could to try to save his job. But for Liz and Dan, he will always be a champion of free speech. Someone who walked away because it was the right thing to do. Reality is not their strong point.Having established his credentials as one of the foremost thinkers of his generation, Dan began what turned out to be a 20-minute rant. He had had unique access to the machinery of state. He was the Ultimate Westminster Insider, not some halfwit on the make.You could trust Dan to tell it like it was. Lizzy had indeed been brought down by the Deep State and the “Snivel” Service – such a way with words. The same people who had brought down Boris Johnson. All those stories about Partygate and Boris’s pathological inability to not tell lies were just made up. Liz and Boris should have been the saviours of our country. Instead they have been hung out to dry. Truss could only agree. She had been betrayed.“This is why millions of people are turning to independent shows like this one,” said Dan. At the last count, just 2,000 had bothered to tune into this particular show. But small beginnings and all that. There’s plenty of time for the audience to grow. The awards for Best Unintentional Comedy Series should come flooding in. Desperate Dan went on to list the real enemies of the people. Sky’s Beth Rigby. ITV’s Robert Peston. The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. They should all be locked up. How dare they go out and report the news! Journalism was no longer a profession. It was a racket.Wootton went on to say how the biggest story in global history –Tommy Robinson’s Unite the Kingdom rally– had had almost no coverage in the mainstream media. But he, Dan, had recorded it all on his phone and it had been amazing. X was amazing. No mention ofhow it was used to create deepfake porn.“We are incorruptible,” Desperate Dan declared. Deranged and deluded, more like. It was hard to work out who was the more stupid. Dan, Liz or the Lettuce. Time for Lizzy to wrap things up. There we had it, she said. Proof that she had been ousted by the Deep State. She was the once and future prime minister. A queen in waiting. So do tune in again next time. But only if you really hate yourself.Explore more on these topicsLiz TrussThe politics sketchConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

They made me gasp – and my childhood turned from monotonous monochrome to glorious TechnicolorAnita ChaudhuriThu 8 Jan 2026 07.00 ESTShareWhen my sister handed me a box of old Kodachrome slides last summer, I almost didn’t bother looking through them. Unusually for pre-smartphone times, my camera-crazy father had extensively documented our lives, filling dozens of photo albums. What could the transparencies possibly reveal that we hadn’t already seen countless times? I dimly remembered him ambushing us to watch slideshows, until we were old enough to rebel.My father died in 2012. Not long before, I had developed an interest in photography myself and, after he was gone, I found solace in my viewfinder. It was, and still is, a way of feeling connected to him. What prompted me to set up my iPad as a makeshift lightbox to view the slides was technical interest.One of the first images out of the box was of my mother and me on the tarmac at Heathrow airport. We are about to board an AirIndiaplane to Kolkata. We had lots of photos from that holiday, all of them black and white prints, conventional snaps, but I had never seen this epic photo before.My father came to Glasgow from India to finish his medical training in 1958 and, a few years later, met my mother who was a nurse at the same hospital. On this trip, my mother would meet her in-laws for the first time, and I my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins.Until that point in my four-year-old life, India had loomed large in my mind as an enchanted kingdom, the backdrop to my father’s many tales about his own childhood, which often featured kleptomaniac monkeys, magicians, precious jewels and an alarming number of snakes. My memories of our Kolkata trip are a bit more quotidian – shopping for shoes, going to a Chinese restaurant where we had chicken sweetcorn soup.I love this image because there are so many telling details. My mother, always a stylish dresser, looks like an extra from Mad Men. Staring dreamily into the distance was not an uncommon state in which to find her – but in this instance, it could well have been because she was bored of waiting for my father to compose his shot. Meanwhile, duffle-coated me is engaged in a glaring competition with another small child. It’s an uncomfortable reminder of what life was like as an only child. Before the arrival of my sister the following year, I’d been introverted and suspicious of other kids, perceiving them as a threat.And to the right there’s a glimpse into another family’s story – the voluminous hand luggage and the woman in the Dalmatian-spotted coat clutching an oversized teddy bear. All of this contributes to the sense of drama and occasion about overseas travel that existed back then. Meanwhile, the vintage Air India livery featuring its playful maharaja and the bright orange logo emblazoned on every step lend a festive air.As I looked through slide after incredible slide, I had the oddest sensation of feeling like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, seeing my childhood turn from monotonous monochrome to glorious Technicolor before my eyes. It was also poignant that, with the benefit of my new-found photographic knowledge, I could finally appreciate the skill and talent required to make these pictures. So much so that, lately, I have found myself perusing geeky websites about vintage projectors and the best ways to shoot colour transparencies. Anyone fancy coming over to watch a slideshow?Explore more on these topicsFamilyMy favourite family photoIndiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

For the chancellor’s cabinet colleague Emma Reynolds, it underlined the anger among Britain’s farmers.Christopher Marchment brought the coffin, along with his working cocker spaniel Grouse, from his arable farm in Hampshire to the annual gathering to call for the tax to be abolished.View image in fullscreenChristopher Marchment: ‘If people are out protesting like this, the government should think there’s something drastically wrong with their policies.’Photograph: Joanna Partridge/The GuardianNot that Reynolds needed reminding. Since becoming environment secretary in September’s reshuffle, the former financial services lobbyist has faced a cacophony of rural outrage, including the tractor horns that played a soundtrack to the Oxford event.The government’s pre-ChristmasU-turn on the inheritance tax changesfor farms, which raised the threshold at which estates are taxed, have been welcomed by groups including the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) and the Country Land and Business Association. However, they have done little to quell some food producers’ anger.Marchment said he knew of two farmers who had killed themselves because of the planned introduction of inheritance tax for agricultural assets and other business properties worth more than £1m.View image in fullscreenThe government’s U-turn on the inheritance tax for farms has done little to quell some food producers’ anger.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA“They wanted to pass their farms on,” he said. “We need food production in this country. If people are out protesting like this, the government should think there’s something drastically wrong with their policies.”One tractor, adorned with a cardboard cow, urged: “Moov over Labour, it’s time to go”, while other signs read: “Labour – killing our countryside” and “sheaves not Reeves”.Derek Pearce, a third-generation arable farmer from Buckinghamshire, said the government did not understand the countryside.“They are literally going after everything rural, whether it’s rural business, pubs are closing, business rates are going up, or farming. They’re going after the fishing, the shooting, everything,” he said.View image in fullscreenDerek Pearce says the government does not understand the countryside.Photograph: Joanna Partridge/The GuardianReynolds, who replaced Steve Reed in September, was on a charm offensive, telling the conference: “This government is serious about partnership with your sector.”Thanking farmers for clearing snow from roads in recent days, she called them “the heart of our national life for what you produce”.Reynolds said Labour’s climbdown on inheritance tax, which increased the threshold at which inherited farmland is taxed from £1m to £2.5m, was a sign ministers had listened.The tax had been labelled a “family farm tax” by critics andtriggered protests around the UK, with farmers arguing it would prevent many of them from passing on their farms to their children.While Reynolds was at the conference, her cabinet colleagues were preparing toannounce yet another policy U-turn, this time overchanges to business rates for pubsafter a wave of criticism from embattled publicans, particularly in rural areas, who havetaken to banning their local Labour MPs.Reynolds – who represents the constituency of Wycombe in Buckinghamshire that she described as rural and home to 89 farms – will face an uphill fight to win back the trust of food producers, who were little enamoured with her predecessor andaccused him of betrayal over the inheritance tax.View image in fullscreenEmma Reynolds was on a charm offensive at the conference and thanked farmers for clearing snow from roads in recent days.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAShe told journalists: “As a government we truly care about rural Britain, we are the party with more rural representation than any of the others.” However, there will be no further concessions: “From our point of view that’s it, I’m afraid.”Reynolds said she knew many people in rural communities decided to vote for Labour at the last election. “We took the rural wall in 2024. We have got 136 rural or semi-rural seats. That is a huge representation in parliament and I have conversations with those MPs week-in, week-out. There is huge growth potential in rural communities that is in farming but in lots of other areas as well, tourism, hospitality.”Tom Bradshaw, the NFU president, said: “The government has got to make farmers and rural communities feel valued, and at the moment farmers don’t know where the goalposts are. Does domestic food production matter to the government or not?”One tweed-jacketed attender, who did not want to give his name, had a more critical assessment. Ministers “handled the whole inheritance tax thing terribly”, he said. “A lot of rural communities won’t vote Labour again, even if the alternative isn’t much better. They were burned by them.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingInheritance taxLabourRural affairsTaxTax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

The Trump administration blames the victimMoira DoneganAn agent shot a woman in Minneapolis, causing vast and needless grief. Our country is diseased – but that is not the only truthThu 8 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 09.02 ESTShareAwoman in Minneapolishas diedas her neighbors fought Donald Trump’s mass deportation operation. On Wednesday morning, a group of local civilian protesters gathered around a site where several ICE agents were attempting to abduct migrants. The agents were part of a surge of roughly2,000 deportation officerswho have been sent to Minneapolis as part of Trump’s effort to persecute the Somali community there. In a disturbing incident caught onvideoby multiple onlookers, a woman driving in an SUV covered in bumper stickers blocked traffic on the residential road – perhaps as part of an effort to keep ICE vehicles from passing. In the videos, an ICE agent approaches the SUV, yelling: “Get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car.” He stands at the driver’s side, with his feet clear of the vehicle, and reaches into where the woman is driving. She begins to drive away, and an officer fires three shots, the last from behind the vehicle as the car pulls away from him. The SUV then crashes into a parked vehicle as onlookers scream in distress. “You did a murder, for what?” one of the protesters calls out to the agents.The driver, a US citizen who was described by Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar as a “legal observer”, was declared dead. She died less than a mile from where George Floyd was murdered byMinneapolispolice officer Derek Chauvin in 2020. Her name was Renee Nicole Good, and she was 37.Good is not the first person to be slaughtered by deportation agents in the course of their raids. In September, ICE agents in Chicago shotSilverio Villegas González,a Mexican-born father and cook, in the neck at “close range”as he allegedly fleda migrant abduction operation. He died, too.Non-fatal shootings by ICE agents have also disfigured American citizens and residents and warped their lives. Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old citizen in Chicago, allegedly tailed DHS agents in her car during that same Chicago operation in October,shouting “la migra”, a common Spanish slang term for immigration agents that advocates yell out as a warning. A DHS agent shot Martinez five times beforeallegedly driving off, leaving her bleeding in her car. Miraculously, she survived. Federal prosecutors tried to criminally prosecute Martinez for the incident, but the case against her quickly fell apart, andcharges were dropped. Altogether, a report bythe Tracefound that immigration officers opened fire in 14 known incidents in the course of their operations since July.As they were in Martinez’s case, federal authorities seem eager to respond to the death in Minneapolis by demonizing the woman they had shot. On Fox News, homeland security secretary Kristi Noemsaid of the incident: “It was an act of domestic terrorism.” She was referring to Good, the woman who was killed. “Officers got stuck in the snow. They were attempting to push out their vehicle, and a woman attacked them, and those surrounding them, and attempted to run them over.” This is untrue, and contradicted by videos of the incident, which show the officers not stuck in the snow, but screamingly approaching the woman in her own parked vehicle, and then shooting her at point blank range as she attempted to drive away.Inanother videofrom just after the incident, a crying woman sitting on the ground outside the crashed SUV screams: “They killed my wife. I don’t know what to do.” Later, she says: “We stopped to film and they shot her.” Her grief will now alter the course of her life. It will be vast, and it is needless. Will anyone be held accountable for it? The man who killed Good has so far not been identified. At the time he shot her, he was wearing a mask.The mass deportations spearheaded by the Trump regime are an ethnic cleansing effort. Immigration officers target peaceful working people on thebasis of their race. They kidnap them, and funnel them into detention centers where they endure horrible conditions, and are given few rights and even less due process. They are taken away from their jobs, their families, and their communities. With violence like what the immigration agent chose in Minneapolis today, the government is looking to tell Americans that resistance to this injustice is not worth it; it will only be punished.This is not true. The assaults on immigrants have created a righteous moral outrage on the part of those born in America and others protected by the rights of citizenship, and everywhere ICE and the DHS have embarked on their sadistic and racist kidnapping sprees, they have met resistance from Americans who hate tyranny and love their neighbors. These protesters are among the best of America, ragefully and rightfully facing down the armed forces of a would-be autocrat in an effort to protect the innocent. Though we do not yet know much about her, or about her presence on that Minneapolis street – Good’s mother says she believes her daughter was not involved in the protest, though videos of the incident make it seem as if she was – what we do know suggests that Renee Nicole Good represented the spirit of the movement: a hatred for injustice, a desire to protect the innocent, a sense of responsibility to those around her. Now, she has become a martyr to the cause.It is easy, as theTrump administrationattempts to consolidate authoritarian power and to rearrange the US into a formal white nationalist autocracy where power is defined by displays of violent domination, to think that the moral degeneracy represented by the immigration agents and those who command them represents a core truth of the American spirit – that ours is a country diseased in mind and soul, incapable of fulfilling the lofty goals of dignity and equality for all that have so long animated our national myths. There is some truth in this dark thought.But there is another truth, too: that everywhere ICE goes, they have been met with ridicule, resistance, and contempt from ordinary Americans, unarmed and unbending, who have faced down the kidnappers and bullies in persistent protests and street actions – sometimes even succeeding in freeing a kidnapped neighbor or bullying the thugs out of their neighborhoods. This, too, is a truth of this country: that people like Martinez, and like Good, are more numerous than the racists and the autocrats.On social media, Jon Collins, a reporter for Minnesota Public Radio,shared videoof ICE agents in Minneapolis being surrounded and confronted by protesters in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday’s shooting. In the clip, regular Americans, bundled up against the midwestern winter, surround the armed agents in a tight, angry circle. “Are you going to shoot someone else and kill them? Are you going to murder someone else?” one man taunts. It’s not an idle question: the protesters, civilians and ordinary people, are facing down armed men who have shown themselves capable of bigotry, brazenness, and murder. A moment later, someone shouts: “You can’t kill us all, Nazis. You can’t kill us all.”Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsMinneapolisOpinionUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsMinnesotacommentShareReuse this content"

The flights were expensive, and it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, so she asked her manager if she could extend the trip by two weeks, and work remotely from her friend’s house.That was her first taste of a “workation” – combining working with a holiday – and she loved it. She now regularly arranges petsitting in different places so she can visit family, friends and new cities for long weekends without spending extra.“I just think it’s brilliant for work-life balance. It’s a great way to have a change of scene – your evenings and weekends, you feel like you’re on a mini-holiday,” she said. “It’s just getting out in nature, a different perspective, different environment.”At 48, Katherine doesn’t fit the stereotype of a young digital nomad living a freewheeling life. But she’s one of a growing number of people of all ages who are taking advantage of digital technologies and increasing flexibility from employers to explore new ways of making the most of their free time.As a conference manager at a university, she needs to be in her hometown when she’s organising an event, but otherwise she can work anywhere where she can take a laptop. Her employer doesn’t have a formal policy, but managers will consider all requests.“It all comes down to individual relationships and trust, and having that autonomy – I know my deadlines, my role and what I need to get done; that doesn’t change if I’m at home or elsewhere,” she said.View image in fullscreenKatherine fits in some sightseeing at Piazza Municipio in Naples, Italy.Research from the Chartered Management Institute found that one in eight employers have a formal policy onworkations, while one in five managers said they had taken one themselves. Most perceived them positively, citing benefits such as mental health and work-life balance, though some feared data security implications.Petra Wilton, director of policy and external affairs at the CMI, recommended that employers should “put clear, transparent rules in place and actively manage them” to give managers the confidence to be supportive.A recent Grant Thorntonsurveysuggests the use of formal arrangements is growing, with the number of businesses with a workations policy increasing from 59% in 2023 to 77% in 2025. AYouGovpoll found that 37% of people able to work remotely were interested in taking a workation in the next 12 months.‘The adventure can turn into a disaster’: the digital nomad families ‘worldschooling’ their childrenRead moreTravel companies are also targeting these holidaymakers – for example Tui has a workation page advertising “handpicked hotels that are perfect for a working holiday”.This reflects a shift in people’s priorities from work-life balance towards “work-life blending”, where the boundaries between life and work are more blurred, said Daniel Wheatley, a researcher in the University of Birmingham’s management department.He added that “workation” was a comparatively new term in academic circles that arose out of the cultural changes brought about by the Covid pandemic, advances in digital technologies since the 1990s, and travel, holidays and leisure pursuits going mainstream in the late 1970s.The term reflects a growing culture of “life first, work second”, especially among younger employees, who are “exploring different ways of engaging in work, different forms and structures of careers rather than a linear pathway”, he said.But rather than being a new way of working, the growth of knowledge and service work could actually herald a full circle return to the medieval era of artisans and craftspeople living in the same place as their workshops, he added.“It gives a sense of freedom and allows people to take more control over lives,” he said, noting that it could also help people juggle caring responsibilities.However, he underscored the importance of proper breaks from work, so that workations are about “leisure time, social connectedness and wider wellbeing”, rather than “increased monitoring meaning [employees] never feel offline or disconnected”.Equally, access to perks such as workations risked entrenching division in society between people who have benefited from digital technologies and those who have not, in particular those who experiencedigital or labour market exclusionand precarity.Ian Brown, 58, a managing director for an industrial engineering company, has taken several workations to extend his holiday allowance after working from a beach hut in Jamaica, and now extends the perk to his employees.“It does feel ultimately that you’ve got more time away from the office space than normal – it takes you out of that environment, you’re away and doing something you enjoy. It refreshes you and gives you an added perk,” he said.He feels that flexibility helps him accept the more onerous aspects of his job, such as 60-hour weeks and out-of-hours work, and fosters a culture of trust and reciprocity with employees. “They remember that when you’re up against it and ask them for help.”He added: “The drawback I feared was that they would take the workation and not respond to requests to do something – that’s never happened – and the positivity is extraordinary.”Explore more on these topicsWork-life balanceWork & careersDigital BritainnewsShareReuse this content"

He claims that Farage called him a “paki” and would use taunts such as “go back home”.Meredith, 58, who is of Anglo-Indian heritage and has lived in Switzerland where he works as a product manager since 1999, said it was support for anti-racism that motivated him to come forward.He told the Guardian: “What really irked me was the denial [by Farage] of being racist.”“The word ‘paki’ was bandied by him – by Farage – there was kind of an entourage, if I remember right, hangers on,” Meredith said. “‘Go back home.’ The taunts is something I remember, the word ‘paki’, ‘go back home’ being used, certainly more than once. Simple taunts like ‘Jason is a paki’. I was 15, 16, something like that.”Meredith is one of several contemporaries to have alleged to the Guardian they were victims of targeted abuse by Farage, who has come under sustained pressure from politicians belonging to various parties to “own up” and apologise. So far, Farage has refused to do so.View image in fullscreenJason MeredithIn a series of legal letters and subsequent interviews his position seemingly shifted from outright denial to claiming he only engaged in “banter” that was not malicious or directed with intent.On Wednesday, when questioned by an ITV News journalist about the previous allegations,Farage went furtherthan he has in his own previous denials, saying: “I don’t apologise for things that are complete made-up fantasies. Some of what I heard was just absolute nonsense by people with very obvious, if you looked, political motivation.”Later on Wednesday, Farage told Times Radio that he acknowledged “aggressive banter”, but said claims that he had told one schoolmate to “go back to Africa” and made gas hissing noises at a Jewish pupil were “complete fantasy land”.It is a characterisation rejected by those who say they witnessed or were victims of his alleged bullying at Dulwich college.Most of the 34 have spoken to the Guardian on the record, with many saying they felt compelled to do so out of anger at the way Farage has handled the situation.Last week, Farage told the Times that the allegations were “having zero effect” and “maybe solidifying our core support.”Reform’s deputy leader, Richard Tice, has said those who had made claims against Farageare liarsand spreading “made up twaddle”.Twenty-six school contemporaries signed an open lettercalling on Farage to apologise for his alleged teenage racism, which they say was persistent and spanned his time at Dulwich from 13 to 18. He has not made any public statement in response to the letter, nor to aseparate letter signed by 11 Holocaust survivorsdemanding he tell the truth and apologise for alleged antisemitic abuse.View image in fullscreenFarage attended the private Dulwich college in south London during the late 70s and early 80s.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesAdrian Woods, 62, a translator, went to Dulwich for sixth form to sit his A-levels alongside Farage and Peter Ettedgui, an award-winning film director today. Ettedgui has claimed Farage would sidle up to him and say “Hitler was right” and “gas them”, sometimes adding a long hiss to simulate the sound of the gas chambers.Woods said: “I was present when Nigel was harassing [Ettedgui] about being a Jew. I don’t remember the gas chamber stuff but it was pretty obnoxious. I remember saying ‘leave off’. If I saw him bullying the smaller ones I would say: ‘Leave off, Nigel, stop it.’“Peter always wanted to be an actor. One day he launched the Shylock monologue – ‘if you prick us, do we not bleed?’ – he felt it, as a response to Nigel needling him.”Woods added: “I remember where it was. In the new wing, on the top floor, and Nigel was standing to my left, as far as I recall, Peter nearer over the window. Peter launched into the monologue as a response to Nigel making antisemitic comments to him. This happened a few times, I witnessed this a few times. He had a lot of other people he would either rib or josh with, needle them, but some of them were more hurtful than others.”Ettedgui, who is today a Bafta- and Emmy-winning director, said drama at school had offered him a sanctuary from the abuse.“During my first year at Dulwich, the vicious antisemitic abuse Farage directed at me left me pretty much speechless,” he said. “I simply had no idea how to deal with it. But by the time we moved up into the next year, I’d discovered acting; participating in school drama was a safe haven away from Farage.“It was astonishing to learn about Adrian Woods’ memory. I had totally forgotten this moment. But it is absolutely true that I was preparing the ‘Hath a Jew not eyes?’ speech for my audition at the National Youth Theatre.“Merchant of Venice is often seen as an antisemitic play, but the words Shakespeare put in Shylock’s mouth spoke deeply to me. I’m not at all surprised that others remember me using them as a weapon with which I could refute Farage’s hate speech.”9:09Can Farage survive racism and antisemitism allegations? | The LatestSeveral contemporaries have spoken of Farage having an obsession with the 1980 school roll having more boys with the surname Patel than Smith. The Guardian has verified that the 1980 roll had 13 Patels and 12 Smiths. According to one, this led to him burning a copy of the roll.Chris Kibble, 62, worked in finance. He also remembered Farage’s obsession with the surname Patel, a “diatribe that he used a lot”.He said: “I absolutely remember him kind of, you know, obviously, he discovered that one day, or his group of little mates, and it was sort of like, you know, he was, yeah, just public broadcasting about it.”Kibble also recalled Farage’s use of antisemitic language. “I was in some of those classes where, yeah, I do remember exactly that catchphrase of ‘gas em all’ coming out of [Farage’s] mouth.”Another former pupil does not remember this happening to Ettedgui in particular, but recalled one incident of Farage: “I do remember him and I do remember that specific grotesque nastiness.”He added: “The hissing – he did that to me. He would appear at one’s back and do ‘ssss’.”Infighting, broken promises and insisting on the national anthem: what seven months of Reform UK in charge actually looks likeRead moreJames Varcoe, 61, said Farage would sing songs about gassing Jews, not necessarily targeted at individuals, but with no context. Varcoe said Farage “was known for it” and described him as an “equal opportunity racist, not just antisemitic”.“All I recall is that he happily would use epithets about race, cheap epithets about race, but particularly the Jewish issue,” he said. “He used the P word, he used the N word, and happily would.”Nick Cannon, who was in the same year as Farage, said that he wrote a letter to the school’s headteacher to protest against his elevation to the position of prefect.Quick GuideContact Henry Dyer about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Henry using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I used to see him walking around the playground and you would see young children crying.”Cannon, 61, said that he recalled asking one young boy what had happened and being told that Farage had said “Hitler was right” to him.

Goretti was expected to drop by 36 millibars between 6pm on Wednesday and 6pm on Thursday.Named by Météo France, Goretti is set to cause travel disruption, power and communications problems and pose a potential risk to life and property acrossEnglandand Wales after changing direction and approaching from the south-west.The worst of the weather will hit overnight before the storm wanes on Friday.The Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: “As that rain pushes its way and it hits against that cold air that we currently have across us … on the northern edge, we are likely to see some fairly significant snow as we go through later [Thursday] and into Friday.”The warnings stretch from Sheffield, down to Leicester, across much of theWest Midlandsand most of Wales, coming into force at 8pm on Thursday and ending at 9am on Friday.A rare red warning for “dangerous, stormy” winds of up to 100mph in exposed and coastal areas has also been issued for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly for Thursday evening.An emergency alert, which means sounds blare from mobile phones, was issued to people in the Isles of Scilly at approximately 3pm, and people in Cornwall at approximately 5pm, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said.The weather could cause damage to buildings and homes, with roofs blown off and power lines brought down, the Met Office said. Very large waves and beach material thrown on to coastal roads, seafronts and homes also presented a threat, it added.View image in fullscreenSnowy conditions in Aberdeen on Thursday.Photograph: Beth Edmonston/PAMore than47,000properties were without power in the south-west at about9pm, according to National Grid’s website, while5,000had no power in the West Midlands and2,000inWales.The National Grid has issued guidelines, including advice to keep a torch and fully charged mobile phone ready for use, because of expected power cuts. Dŵr Cymru and Scottish Water have advised against keeping outdoor taps running, asking customers to instead check and protect exposed pipes and water tanks.As well as in Wales and the Midlands, heavy snow of up to 20cm is expected inSouth Yorkshire.There is a further yellow warning for wind for much of south-west England from 3pm on Thursday to 6am on Friday and yellow snow warnings for a large part of England and almost all of Wales from 5pm on Thursday until midday on Friday.Yellow rain warnings have also been issued across eastern England from 6pm on Thursday to 9pm on Friday, and in west Wales from midday on Thursday to 10am on Friday.National Highways has issued its own amber warning for snow in the Midlands from 6pm on Thursday to 9am on Friday, advising of “particularly difficult driving conditions” in Birmingham, Leicester and Nottingham.Rail passengers have been advised to check journeys before travelling, with services cancelled across Wales, Cornwall and north-west England. National Rail said all train services in parts of south-west England will be cancelled on Thursday evening and warned that there were likely to be delays and cancellations on Eurostar routes from London.Major airports have said they will continue to function normally with the exception of Jersey and Guernsey, which will close at 6pm.Amber cold weather health alerts have been put in place by the UK Health Security Agency until 11 January, meaning severe effects can be expected across health and social care services. Officials expect a rise in deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and over or with health conditions, with younger age groups also potentially affected.Meanwhile, Scotland’s attention had turned to recovery efforts after days of heavy snow that caused widespread travel disruption, the first minister, John Swinney, said on Thursday.More than 250 schools are set to remain closed on Friday, including more than 150 in Aberdeenshire, dozens in the Highlands and a number in Moray.A total of 278 schools were closed on Thursday across northern Scotland.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherSnowWalesEnglandCornwallWest MidlandsSouth YorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) said on Thursday thatIranian security forces had killedat least 45 protesters, including eight children, since the demonstrations began in late December.Shopkeepers heeded calls from seven Kurdish political groups for a general strike on Thursday, closing their doors in Kurdish regions and dozens of other cities around Iran. The Hengaw rights group posted footage of shuttered shops in the western provinces of Ilam, Kermanshah and Lorestan. It accused authorities of firing on demonstrators in Kermanshah and the nearby town of Kamyaran to the north, injuring several protesters.Demonstrations reached all 31 provinces on Thursday as the protest movement showed no signs of abating.In the southern Fars province demonstrators pulled down the statue of the former senior Revolutionary Guards al-Quds force commanderQassem Suleimani– considered a hero of mythical proportions by government supporters. Verified footage showed protesters cheering as the statue came down.Protests took place into the night Thursday, with a large crowd seen gathering on the vast Ayatollah Kashani Boulevard in the north-west of Tehran amid the sound of vehicle horns honking in support, according to social media images verified by Agence France-Presse. Other images showed a crowd demonstrating in the western city of Abadan. A woman attending a protest in that city late on Wednesday had been shot in the eye, according to IHR.IHR said Wednesday was the bloodiest day of the now 12-day movement, with 13 protesters confirmed killed. “The evidence shows that the scope of the crackdown is becoming more violent and more extensive every day,” said the IHR director, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, adding that hundreds more had been wounded and more than 2,000 arrested.On Wednesday a police officer was killed west of Tehran trying “to control unrest”, the Fars news agency reported.View image in fullscreenVideograb posted on social media shows protesters in the southern Fars province toppling a statue of Qassem Suleimani.Photograph: UGC/AFP/Getty ImagesMedia inside Iran and official statements have reported at least 21 people killed, including security forces, since the protests began, according to an Agence France-Presse tally.The protest movement is the largest in three years, and while it has not yet reached the size of the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom demonstrations, it has alarmed Iran’s political and security leadership.Rights groups accused authorities of resorting to tactics including raiding hospitals to detain wounded protesters. “Iran’s security forces have injured and killed both protesters and bystanders,” said Amnesty International, accusing authorities of using “unlawful force”.The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, on Thursday called for restraint in how the demonstrations are handled. “Any violent or coercive behaviour should be avoided,” said Pezeshkian in a statement on his website, urging “utmost restraint” as well as “dialogue, engagement and listening to the people’s demands”.The trigger for the protests, thesudden slide of the country’s currency and general economic malaise, has made it difficult for the government to address the grievances of protesters. The currency has continued to depreciate, while the government announced the end of a subsidised exchange rate for importers – a move that has already caused the price of groceries to soar.View image in fullscreenPeople shop at a fruit and vegetable stall in Tehran amid soaring prices, a rapidly devaluing currency, and mounting economic pressure.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesEveryday life has become increasingly unaffordable for Iranians. The average price of food has increased by more than 70% since last year, and medicine about 50% in the same time period.The government has said that solving the economic crisis afflicting the country is largely out of its hands, and that while it will work to tackle corruption and price gouging, it has few tools to use. It blamed the economic woes of the country on external factors, primarily the harsh sanctions placed on Iran mainly by the west in response to Iran’s nuclear programme.The protests thus far seem to be decentralised and lacking in a central figure, in contrast to the 2022 protests, when demonstratorsrallied around 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being arrested for allegedly wearing the hijab improperly.The exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the shah who was ejected by the 1979 Iranian revolution, has been trying to fill the leadership vacuum in the movement. He urged Iranians to yell from their windows on Thursday and Friday at 8pm local time to show their support.“Based on your response, I will announce the next calls to action,” Pahlavi said in a widely shared video.It is unclear the level of support Pahlavi enjoys, though videos of protests over the last 12 days have showed demonstrators chanting in support for the exiled prince. A social media channel close to Iran’s security forces published a video which purported to show intelligence agents visiting people in their homes warning them not to take part in Pahlavi’s protest, with other outlets claiming drones would be used to identify those who do participate.Though authorities have used violence against protesters, their crackdown has not reached nearly the same intensity as it did in 2022. Analysts have said that the state may feel less secure than it did three years ago,rocked by its June war with Israel.View image in fullscreenThe government crackdown has reportedly not matched the same intensity as the 2022 protests over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody.Photograph: Social Networks/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockThe government also faces threats from abroad, with the US president, Donald Trump,threatening to intervene in protests if Iran killed demonstrators. Trump on Thursday reiterated his threat to take severe action against Iran if its authorities “start killing people”, warning Washington would “hit them very hard”.The US state department also encouraged protesters online, sharing footage of some placing Trump stickers on road signs. “When prices are set so high that neither consumers can afford to buy nor farmers can afford to sell, everyone loses,” the state department said in a post on X.On Thursday night the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said the Iranian economy was “on the ropes”, telling the Economic Club of Minnesota: “It’s a very precarious moment. He [Trump] does not want them to harm more of the protesters. This is a tense moment.”German foreign minister Johann Wadephul, meanwhile, condemned the “excessive use of force” by Iranian authorities against protesters.The Iranian foreign ministry and military have lashed out over Trump’s comments, with Iran’s army chief threatening on Wednesday to carry out pre-emptive strikes on states that threaten Iran.Authorities have increasingly cast protesters as violent, saying that while the right to protest was legitimate, rioters and foreign-backed saboteurs had hijacked protests.Outlets close to the government said a police colonel was stabbed outside Tehran, while a police station in Chenaran, north-east of Tehran, was attacked on Wednesday night leading to the death of five people.Explore more on these topicsIranProtestMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

With its access to the case materials, witnesses and evidencerevoked, the BCA said it had to “reluctantly” withdraw from the investigation.Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem denied that the BCA had been cut out of the investigation and said it was a matter of jurisdiction. “They have not been cut,” she said. “They don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.”But Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, told a news conference that “Minnesota must be part of this investigation. It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome. And I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment.”Indeed, the reversal from federal law enforcement comes as theTrump administrationcontinues to justify Wednesday’s deadly shooting by accusing Good of engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” and claiming that the ICE agent who shot her was acting in “self-defense”, alleging she had tried to run him over.That narrative is at odds withvideo footage of the incident, which has been widely shared online. It shows Good reversing her car and letting at least one ICE vehicle pass before an officer tells her to get out of the car; she then tries to turn and drive away. An agent shoots her multiple times, remains on his feet and walks away apparently uninjured as her car crashes into a lamp-post and parked vehicle.The agent was identified independently by the Guardian as Jonathan E Ross, a Minnesota resident and 10-year veteran of federal law enforcement. Noem continued on Thursday to defend the federal agent – whom she described as “an experienced officer” – and said he had been treated in hospital after the incident. Both she and the vice-president noted that Ross had been injured in an incident six months ago when an undocumented immigrant resisted arrest in a vehicle.Vance also defended the shooting, repeatedly claiming, baselessly, that Good was part of a “leftwing network” of people who are trying to “incite violence against our law enforcement officers”.He told the White House press briefing without evidence that the young mother was “a victim of leftwing ideology” and had been “brainwashed”, and doubled down on the administration’s claim that the officer had acted in self-defense. Good, 37, was “dead because she tried to ram somebody with her car”, Vance said.The deadly incident, which occurred less than a mile from the spot where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020, escalated tensions that have been building for weeks in Minnesota amid ramped-up federal immigration enforcement operations and fraud investigations by the Trump administration.Authorities inMinneapolishad canceled school classes across the city on Thursday amid safety concerns and rising political tension after the US citizen and mother of three was killed during a large-scale immigration enforcement operation the day before.‘This is not normal’: Minneapolis on edge and angry after ICE killing of woman amid federal surgeRead moreDozens of clergy members from all faith backgrounds gathered with hundreds of people at the site of the shooting in south Minneapolis at noon to show that the city was unified in its response. “Renee Good stood for her neighbors. We now must stand for her,” said JaNaé Bates, a co-executive director of the interfaith group Isaiah.The crowd chanted “ICE out now” throughout the event, against visible signs of the tragedy: red paint in the snow read “ICE kills”, and writing on the street called for ICE to leave.Butemotions remained highin the city, and across the US, as the basic facts of the incident remain the subject of fierce debate.Ilhan Omarposted on social mediaThursday morning that thousands of people had gathered to honor Good last night, and that “ICE needs to get out of Minneapolis”.“We will never accept that a single federal agent can be judge, jury and executioner in our streets,” the Minnesota representative said.0:36Minneapolis residents hold vigil for woman fatally shot by ICE agent – videoJacob Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, also made several appearances on television networks on Wednesday night calling for peaceful protests and doubling down on his comments at a press conference earlier in the day in which he called for ICE “to get the fuck out of Minneapolis”.“People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart. Long-term Minneapolis residents that have contributed so greatly to our city, to our culture, to our economy are being terrorized, and now, somebody is dead,” Frey said.He said the homeland security department was already “trying to spin this as an action of self-defense”, a claim he said was “bullshit”.Some Republicans seized on Frey’s comments as incendiary, with Nancy Mace, a South Carolina representative,calling for the resignationsof the mayor and Walz.Map of where the ICE shooting occurred.Despite local officials’ calls for federal law enforcement to leave the state, the New York Timesreportedon Thursday that the Trump administration will deploy more than 100 US Customs and Border Protection agents and officers to Minnesota following the fatal shooting of Good.The agents will be redirected from operations in Chicago and New Orleans. The deployment is expected to last until Sunday, the newspaper reported, citing documents it obtained.Noem also stated that ICE operations would continue in Minneapolis, which saw asurge of about 2,000 federal agentsthis week to target immigrant populations.This story was amended on 8 January 2025 to correct the name of the ICE officer who shot Renee Nicole Good, which is Jonathan E Ross, not Jonathan David Ross. Also, an incorrect reference to Ross being a resident of Minneapolis was removed.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinneapolisTrump administrationUS politicsUS immigrationMinnesotanewsShareReuse this content"

Under the name Tia, it was placed under sanctions by the US for carrying crude oil from Venezuela in 2024, after which its name was changed to Arcusat and finally Tiavan.The Aria, registered under the flag of Barbados, was recorded sailing between Plymouth and Jersey early on Thursday evening, heading towards the Ust-Luga commercial port in the eastern Baltic. It is listed as being under sanctions from the US Treasury, with a note that it is linked to Russia’s largest shipping company.On Wednesday afternoon, US forces seized the Marinera oil tanker, previously the Bella 1, north-west of the British Isles in an operation supported by the Royal Navy and RAF, after following it for two and a half weeks from the Caribbean.It had been sailing towards Venezuela and the crew had refused to give permission for the US Coast Guard to board as it approached the South American country. The boat then fled north up the Atlantic, changing its name and adopting a Russian registration, though this was not enough to put off the US military.Explore more on these topicsWater transportMinistry of DefenceRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Instead Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and a potential rival to Vance in the 2028 presidential election, grabbed all the Maga glory.‘I don’t need international law’: Trump says power constrained only by ‘my own morality’Read moreOn Thursday,JD Vancedecided to strike back. Marco might have Delta Force, a giant armada and 150 bombers, fighter jets and reconnaissance planes but the VP had a verbal machinegun and he was aiming it directly at the media.Speaking to reporters at the White House, the bearded Vance made himself the face of the administration’s response to Wednesday’s fatal shooting of Renee Good, a 37-year-old poet and mother, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) officer inMinneapolis.Vance insisted that Good had tried ram the ICE officer with her car and picked on a CNN headline that said “Outrage after ICE officer kills US citizen in Minneapolis” as typical of misleading coverage in the “corporate media” (a sinister phrase to contrast with the nation’s noble bloggers and influencers).Wearing a Trumpy uniform of blue suit, white shirt and red tie, Vance fulminated: “This was an attack on law and order. This was an attack on the American people. The way that the media by and large has reported this story has been anabsolute disgraceand it puts our law enforcement officers at risk every single day.”No matter that videos of the incident suggest that Good was driving away. No matter that there is zero evidence she was a “domestic terrorist”. No matter that, in times past, officials would have sought to cool the temperature and declined to comment or on prejudge an active investigation.Vance was just warming up for the most ferocious media-bashing invective since press secretary Sean Spicer – equally eager to impress the boss – went ballistic at anyone who failed to report that Trump’s first inauguration drew the biggest crowd of all time.Vance had a captive audience of masochistic reporters crammed into the briefing room taking punches in the mouth then begging for his attention anyway. Press secretaryKaroline Leavittwatched approvingly from the sidelines, admiring the similarly youthful Vance’s knack for slick, audacious propaganda that matches her own.The 41-year-old claimed without evidence, for example, that Good was part of a “broader leftwing network” that has been working tirelessly and using “domestic terror techniques” to stop Trump enforcing immigration laws.Gazing around the room, Vance snarled: “Everybody who’s been repeating the lie that this is some innocent woman who was out for a drive in Minneapolis when a law enforcement officer shot at her: you should be ashamed of yourselves, every single one of you.”A reporter asked who Vance believes is behind this broader leftwing network. “Well, it’s one of the things we’re going to have to figure out,” he admitted before asserting: “There’s an entire network – and, frankly, some of the media are participating in it - that is trying to incite violence against our law enforcement officers. It’s ridiculous. It’s preposterous. And part of our investigatory work is getting to the bottom of it.”One reporter wanted to know how being part of this supposed leftwing network justified being shot? Vance said it did not then picked another fight: “I’m sorry guys, what’s going on here? You guys are meant to report the truth. How have you let yourself become agents of propaganda of a radical fringe that’s making it harder for us to enforce our laws?“You just asked me a question that presumed that the reason why this woman died is because she was engaged in legitimate protest.She tried to run somebody over with her car! And the guy defended himself when that happened.”The reporter’s cry of “the investigation is still ongoing!” went unheeded.A few minutes later, Vance growled: “The reporting over this has been one of the biggest scandals I’ve ever seen in media. I’ve never seen a case so misrepresented and misreported when you have a guy who is defending himself and is now being treated as some sort of federal assassin by so many of the people in this room.”Vance also faced questions about the War Powers Act, Venezuela – reports that he was kept out of the planning were “false” – and the security ofGreenland, which he urged European friends to take more seriously.But as he took his leave, he couldn’t resist one more swipe at the fake news fiends: “It’s really irresponsible for you guys to go out there and imply or tell the American people that a guy who defended himself from being rammed by an automobile is guilty of murder. Be a little bit more careful. We’re going to talk about toning down the temperature, which I know the president wants to do and I certainly want to do.”This would be the same president who responded to Good’s death within hours by posting on social media that she was “very disorderly” and accusing her of “violently, willfully, and viciously” running over the ICE officer. And when George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis five years ago, Trump responded to protests outside the White House withrubber bullets and teargas.But if Thursday’s briefing was Vance’s first audition to succeed the president, his allies will be pleased and millions of Americans will be terrified. The VP offered a younger, darker version of Trump with fewer rough edges and even more menace towards the media and the left. Rubio might have to kidnap a few more foreign leaders if he wants to catch up.Explore more on these topicsJD VanceThe US politics sketchDonald TrumpMinneapolisMinnesotafeaturesShareReuse this content"

School Ties (1992)Matt Damon is essentially a bland dish that requires the right spice truly to zing, which means he is often at his best when playing beastly. His flagrantly nasty turn as one of the antisemitic bullies who makes prep school life hell for a secretly Jewish classmate (Brendan Fraser) offers an early indication that Damon realised this, too.19. Courage Under Fire (1996)Damon lost about 25kg for a handful of scenes as the traumatised, heroin-addicted young Gulf war veteran recalling a rescue mission in which his commanding officer (Meg Ryan) was killed. The sudden weight loss left him reeling: “I was looking for something to set me apart: ‘Look what I’ll do, I’ll kill myself!’” It paid off. “Directors took note of it.”18. Syriana (2005)View image in fullscreenMoral complexity … Matt Damon and Alexander Siddig as Bryan Woodman and Prince Nasir Al-Subaai  in Syriana.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarIn this scattershot political thriller, Damon’s storyline has a crisp moral complexity. He plays Bryan Woodman, an energy analyst whose oldest son dies accidentally during a party at the home of a Middle Eastern emir. Woodman is later mollified with a lucrative contract from the emir’s family. “How much for my other kid?” he asks caustically – before accepting the offer. That’s capitalism.17. Contagion (2011)Reunited with Gwyneth Paltrow from The Talented Mr Ripley, though not for long. She plays Damon’s wife, who brings back from her Hong Kong business trip something more original than a giant Toblerone: a deadly virus. She expires messily soon after, as does their son, leaving Damon to fend for himself and their teenage daughter amid the ensuing pandemic. Steven Soderbergh’s 1970s-style all-star disaster movie was a hit on release, then found its second wind during Covid.16. Stuck on You (2003)View image in fullscreenComic sparkle … Damon and Greg Kinnear as Bob and Walt Tenor.Photograph: 20 Century Fox/AllstarTeam America: World Police is a work of genius, but it is wide of the mark in presenting Damon as a humourless lobotomised hunk. His comic sparkle is crucial to the charm of the Farrelly brothers’ Stuck on You, in which he and Greg Kinnear play conjoined twins who work harmoniously together as ice-hockey goalkeepers and short-order cooks. All is well until Kinnear’s acting ambitions lead them to Hollywood. First stop: a porn movie called Pavlov’s Dong.15. Oppenheimer (2023)Gruffness and warmth combine beautifully in Damon’s portrayal of Gen Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project, who hires J RobertOppenheimer(Cillian Murphy) to beat the Nazis in building an atomic weapon. Informed that the chances of destroying the world are near-zero, and asked what more he wants, he shoots back: “Zero would be nice.”14. Saving Private Ryan (1998)View image in fullscreenWar blockbuster … Damon as James Francis Ryan.Photograph: Dreamworks/Paramount Pictures/AllstarDamon bagged the title role of the soldier who is made the target of a rescue mission after his brothers are killed in action during the second world war. He gets a delayed and memorably casual entrance: after all the huffing and puffing that has gone into finding him in the first half of the movie, he simply pops up out of the tall grass in a field.13. The Martian (2015)View image in fullscreenOut of this world … Matt Damon as Mark Watney.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarA third Oscar nomination for acting – after Good Will Hunting and Invictus – came Damon’s way for playing astronaut and botanist Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars and assumed dead after his colleagues flee in a storm. As he establishes his survival plans, he keeps a sassy video diary (“In your face, Neil Armstrong!”), almost as if he knows he’s a movie character. This is intercut with scenes of the frantic Nasa team 140m miles away, which weaken the picture’s sense of isolation: what with all the cutaways to Earth, Watney never seems very alone.12. The Informant! (2009)Steven Soderbergh has given Damon a diverse array of roles – larking around in the Ocean’s trilogy, cosying up to Michael Douglas inBehind the Candelabra, even a cameo (termed “inexplicable” by Empire magazine) as a priest in Che: Part Two. But the pair have never made merry like they do in The Informant!, a farcical whistleblower yarn that deliberately punctures the gravitas of films like its near-namesake The Insider. As the deluded snitch, Damon’s doofus act is a scream.11. Good Will Hunting (1997)View image in fullscreenDopey drama … Minnie Driver and Matt Damon.Photograph: George Kraychyk/Miramax/ Kobal/Rex/  ShutterstockDespairing of their faltering acting careers, Damon and Ben Affleck wrote their own ticket to the big time – and won a screenwriting Oscar – with this dopey drama about an unsung genius (played by Damon at his brattiest and sexiest) toiling as a janitor at MIT. Producer Harvey Weinstein tried to foist hack directors on the pair but Damon stood his ground and demanded the indie auteur Gus Van Sant instead. “You’re a nobody!” raged Weinstein, aghast at the actor’s impertinence. “I’m a nobody,” replied Damon, “but I’m a nobody with director approval.” How did Weinstein likethemapples? Quite a lot, probably, once Good Will Hunting became one of Miramax’s most profitable releases.10. The Bourne Identity (2002)“I don’t know who I am. I don’t know where I’m going.” The confusion expressed by amnesiac assassin Jason Bourne could double as acri de coeurfrom Damon himself, who was all at sea after flops such as The Legend of Bagger Vance and All the Pretty Horses. Despite being so mired in reshoots that the gossip mill had it pegged as a disaster, the opening instalment in the Bourne action franchise became a slow-burning hit and did for Damon what The Matrix had done for Keanu Reeves. At this point, the series hadn’t properly developed a breakneck visual style to match the neck-breaking action – the final romantic reunion at a beachfront bar looks absurdly like an outtake from an old-school Bond movie – but Damon had found the ideal vehicle for his cultivated blankness.9. Interstellar (2014)When Damon pops up unannounced, it’s usually for comic effect: in the two most recent Thor movies, he is a stage actor playing in the plays-within-the-films, while Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back finds him selling out by making Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season. Not so inInterstellar, his first film for Christopher Nolan (after turning down the role of Two-Face in The Dark Knight). Damon is the baleful Dr Mann, who leads the Lazarus expedition through a wormhole to locate habitable planets, falsifies the data to suggest he has found one, settles down in cryostasis then tries to kill the astronaut who wakes him up. Rude!8. The Departed (2006)View image in fullscreenCrime pays … Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio as Colin Sullivan and Billy Costigan.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarDamon is usually more interesting as a traitor than a faithful, and there are few roles on his CV more treacherous than Colin, the gangster going undercover as a cop in Martin Scorsese’s remake of the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs. Leonardo DiCaprio is his opposite number, a cop infiltrating Boston’s organised crime gang, and both are tangled up with Vera Farmiga’s police psychiatrist. She gets to console Colin about his erectile dysfunction while he seethes quietly over breakfast. Other highlights include Colin’s porn-cinema confab with his boss (Jack Nicholson), who turns up brandishing a dildo.7. The Good Shepherd (2006)Robert De Niro executes this underrated CIA origin story with surgical precision. As Edward Wilson, a fictional spy recruited to the emergent agency straight from Yale, Damon’s civilised and even anonymous persona makes Wilson’s casual betrayals feel especially chilling. The misjudged casting of Eddie Redmayne, only 11 years Damon’s junior, makes it appear initially as though they are lovers rather than father and son. On the plus side, we get to see Damon in wig, dress and makeup for a college production of HMS Pinafore.6. Behind the Candelabra (2013)View image in fullscreenFrazzled insecurity … Damon as Scott Thorson.Photograph: HBO Films/courtesy Everett ColleSporting a Farrah Fawcett feather-cut, Damon plays Scott Thorson, who chauffeurs his bejewelled, fur-swaddled lover Liberace on stage in a cream Rolls-Royce. Michael Douglas nails the entertainer’s creosoted smarm, while Damon navigates Thorson’s descent from romantic bliss to frazzled insecurity in the decade between the couple meeting and Liberace’s death in 1987 from Aids-related illness. With sweaty humping and gruesome his’n’his cosmetic surgery, the director Steven Soderbergh spares no detail, though he might have been a touch less credulous in swallowing Thorson’s side of the story.5. The Bourne Supremacy (2004)It was this second Bourne adventure, with Paul Greengrass taking over from Bourne Identity director Doug Liman, that made the series the biggest influence on action cinema since the advent of the car chase (of which there is a fine example here, with Bourne gunning an increasingly battered yellow taxi through Moscow, demolition derby-style). Damon has never looked more at home than he does as the fugitive who has little memory of his time as a CIA assassin but has deduced from the way his erstwhile employers keep trying to kill him that a reference is out of the question. The addition of Joan Allen as one of his pursuers is inspired, and makes possible Bourne’s killer final line: “Get some rest, Pam. You look tired.”4. Gerry (2003)The only Matt Damon film to feature an end-credits shout-out to the Hungarian slow-cinema god Béla Tarr (who died this week), this bare-bones experiment about two friends, both called Gerry, lost in Death Valley, tests the patience, pushes the envelope and feeds the soul. Damon co-wrote the cryptic script with his co-star Casey Affleck and director Gus Van Sant. As the two Gerrys try, and repeatedly fail, to find their way back to their vehicle, this feels less like an existential Dude, Where’s My Car? and more like an extended desecration of Damon’s A-list status: his identity gradually blurs with Affleck’s, their faces charred and roasting under the sun. The scene in which Damon weeps solemnly from behind an improvised veil is among the finest in his career.3. The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)View image in fullscreenDiscomfort zone … Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Pamela Landy (Joan Allen).Photograph: Jasin Boland/Universal Studios“Jesus Christ. That’s Jason Bourne!” So gasps the CIA boss played by David Strathairn after watching a CCTV feed of Bourne (Damon) dispensing with five assailants in a stairwell at Waterloo Station. This threequel is thene plus ultraof the whole franchise – far superior to either the Damon-less spin-off The Bourne Legacy or his 2016 return in the drably titled Jason Bourne. Director Paul Greengrass expertly finesses his kinetic visual style; the whip-pans, crash-zooms and handheld shaky-cam hurl us into the hubbub. Damon looks supremely confident, having settled fully into his character’s discomfort zone.2. Margaret (2011)Arguably the best US film of the century so far, at least in its three-hour cut, Kenneth Lonergan’s kaleidoscopic portrait of post-9/11 New York hinges on a teenage firebrand, Lisa (Anna Paquin), whose involvement in a fatal bus accident intensifies her belief that she is the centre of the universe. In a flawless cast, which also includes Jeannie Berlin, Mark Ruffalo and the Succession duo of J Smith-Cameron and Kieran Culkin, Damon shows once again that he excels at being untrustworthy or morally compromised. He plays Lisa’s initially well-meaning teacher, who, flattered by her romantic interest in him, abandons his principles and sleeps with her (“You’re a fucking idiot,” he hisses at himself). The mute panic on his face when she later confronts him, all but naming him in front of a colleague as the father of her aborted child, proves that Damon gives good squirm.1. The Talented Mr Ripley (1999)View image in fullscreenPreppy charm … Damon as Tom Ripley.Photograph: Miramax/Sportsphoto/AllstarNo one ever mistook Matt Damon for Alain Delon. But then Anthony Minghella’s radical take on Patricia Highsmith’s Ripley thrillers is as distinct from Plein Soleil as the sun is from the moon. This version of Tom Ripley is preppy, even buffoonish. Leeching on to caddish playboy Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) in sun-splashed 1950s Italy, he is no calculating psychopath but a square who stumbles into murder as rashly as he spins his innocuous fibs. So much of the film seems to reflect Damon’s struggle to establish a vivid identity. Among the first words he speaks is a lament: “If I could rub everything out, starting with myself …” Other lines seem to comment on his persona. “You’re so white,” marvels Dickie on the beach, then amends it to: “Grey, actually.” Later, he provokes Tom to violence by taunting him about how boring he is. It’s like watching the actor’s own insecurities amplified. But his nervy performance shows definitively that blandness is his camouflage. The critic Manohla Dargis noted a smile “designed to hide something sinister, frightening, deadly”. Talented indeed.The Rip is out 16 January on Netflix; The Odyssey is released 17 JulyExplore more on these topicsRankedMatt DamonContagionOppenheimerSaving Private RyanThe MartianThe Bourne SupremacyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But that’s not always possible for various reasons, like a lack of access to nutritious foods or the effects of certain medications.Is it true that… you should take vitamin C when you’ve got a cold?Read more“Some people may need a supplement; some people need to be careful that they’re not getting too much of a supplement,” says Joan Blake, a registered dietitian and clinical instructor at Boston University. “It’s all over the place.”There are so many of these products for sale, and so many variants of what’s on a label, that shopping and selecting even a single supplement can be “dizzying” for consumers, says Millstine.For some nutrients, there’s arecommended dietary allowance(RDA) – an amount to aim for daily, set in the US by the food and nutrition board of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The RDA can vary by sex, age and medical status. There’s also a tolerable upper intake level (UL), which is the maximum safe daily limit. Consuming more than the UL can cause health problems, depending on the nutrient.Additionally, in the US, “there’s no vetting of products before they’re sold to ensure that the label is accurate”, says Cohen, whoseresearchsuggests contents and quantity labelling are often inaccurate.There is limited government oversight over vitamins and supplements. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)does not approvesupplements or their labelling before they are sold. The only way to know whether what’s listed on the label is accurate is if the product has been certified by theNational Sanitation Foundation(NSF) orUnited States Pharmacopeia(USP), says Cohen. These are non-profits with “high-quality, third-party certification programs”, he explains. You can usetheirwebsitesto find verified products.Check with your doctor before taking any new supplementBecause the recommended amount differs from person to person, it’s critical to speak with a healthcare provider before starting something new. You need to know how the product might interact with anything else you’re consuming, like a medication or another supplement, explains Cohen. Adverse health effects could arise, or medications could become less effective.Supplements can also affect blood tests, leading to inaccurate results, explains Dr Fernando Carnavali, an associate professor of internal medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. He says it’s important to continue to discuss any vitamin or supplement use with your physician in case of evolving research about potential interactions, benefits or harms.It’s best to use vitamins and supplements with caution, just as you would with over-the-counter medications like Tylenol, says Millstine. It’s also a good idea to stick to studied doses. She recommends using the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Healthwebsitefor information on dosing. The US Department of Agriculture alsohas a toolfor calculating the amount of vitamins and minerals you need.Conversely, do not take dosing advice from the person selling the product, due to a risk of bias, says Millstine.Carnavali suspects that because vitamins and minerals areperceived as natural, people are less likely to share what they are taking with their medical providers. It’s not uncommon for a patient to come in with questions about their health, only to learn that their vitamin and supplement habits were causing symptoms. “We’re not here to judge – we’re here to guide you,” says Carnavali.What happens if you take too much?Multivitamins:Multivitamin supplements contain at least three vitamins and one mineral.There’s no regulation of what nutrients must be included or how much.Accordingto the National Institutes of Health, some of these supplements contain vitamins and minerals in amounts higher than the established UL. Accordingly, there’s a risk ofexcess nutrients, especially if you’re taking a multivitamin with other supplements.Whatharm might occurdepends on the excessive nutrient in question. “Multivitamins can be tricky because you need to look at each of the components, and there are just so many of them,” says Millstine.There are risks associated with certain individuals. For example, the NIHstatesthat smokers and former smokers might want to avoid multivitamins with large amounts of beta-carotene or vitamin A, which are linked to an increased risk of lung cancer in smokers. For people who are pregnant, more than2,800 micrograms (mcg)of vitamin A a day can increase the risk of birth defects.People who take blood thinners should speak with their doctor before using a multivitamin containing vitamin K, which can decrease the effectiveness of those drugs.Vitamin D:“Vitamin D can become quite toxic when taken excessively,” says Millstine. High levels are associated with harms like nausea, vomiting and excessive urination. Extremely high levels are linked to kidney failure, irregular heartbeat and death. The NIH notes that high levels are“almost always” caused by excessive supplements.Individual requirements can differ, Millstine says. According to the NIH,the RDAfor adults between ages 19 and 70 is around 15mcg, or 600 international units (IU). The upper limit for the same group is 100mcg, or 4,000 IU.If your healthcare provider recommends you take vitamin D, it’s advisable to start at the standard dose, then recheck your levels in three months, says Millstine.Omega-3fattyacids:Omega-3 fatty acids are found in certain foods, like fatty fish and chia seeds. Supplementslike fish oilor fish liver oilcontaintwo typesof omega-3 fatty acids: docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, and eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA.Expertshaven’t establishedrecommended amounts for these two types, but the FDA recommends limiting the combined total to no more than 5g daily from dietary supplements. High doses can increase the risk of bleeding and stroke,accordingto the Mayo Clinic.A low-quality omega-3 product comes with more risks of side effects, ranging from heartburn to nausea, explains Millstine. These supplements can contain other elements, like vitamins A and D, anddosage can varyfrom product to product, so it’s important to check the label.For instance, if you’re taking a 1,000mg fish oil capsule with a 300mg omega-3 content, it’s worth checking what else is in the product, says Millstine. Non-EPA/DHA elements can cause issues like gastrointestinal symptoms and increased risk of bruising.Another omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), is found in plants. Apart from the food you eat, you can get ALA from flaxseed oil supplements. The recommended amount of ALA for adults is between 1.1-1.6g.Calcium:The typical recommendation for adults is 1,000-1,200mg of calcium daily, divided into no more than around 500mg at a time, says Millstine. Theupper limitvaries depending on your age and medical status. Calcium can negatively interact with other supplements and medications.Too much supplemental calcium cancause kidney stones. While research ismixedand more is needed, somestudiessuggest calcium supplements can increase the risk of heart disease, specifically in postmenopausal women.According to the UK’sNational Health Service, more than 1,500mg of calcium a day can lead to stomach pain and diarrhea.Vitamin C:Vitamin C is one of the more overused supplements, because so many people use it to avoid sickness, Blake says. While it may slightly shorten the duration of a cold,researchsuggests that it won’t prevent a cold.Extra vitamin C simply exits the body during urination. But chronic excessive use can lead to gastrointestinal issues like nausea and diarrhea, explains Blake. Doses greater than2,000mga day can lead to stomach aches, diarrhea and kidney stones.Millstine advises about 500mg to 1,000mg per day. “The problem with taking too much is it’s just not helping you, so why would you stress your kidneys in that way?” she asks.Vitamin B12:The NIH recommends2.4mcgof B12 daily for most adults, though personalized doses can vary. It’s available in different types of supplements, many of which have very high doses of B12.While rare, excessive B12 can be associated with symptoms like anxiety, agitation, flushing and headaches, says Millstine. It can interact with medications like gastric acid inhibitors and metformin. Other forms of vitamin B,like vitamin B6, can be more toxic.Magnesium:Magnesium supplements come in various forms, including magnesium oxide, citrate and chloride. These have different effects: for example, magnesium citrate is used as a laxative, so those with more sensitive stomachs might want to avoid it.Generally, the RDA for adults is about 300-400mg (depending on age and sex). TheUL for magnesiumvia supplements and medications specifically is 350mg.While there’sno risklinked to too much magnesium in food, high doses of magnesium might cause nausea, abdominal cramping anddiarrhea. Very large doses canbe fatal.People with kidney disease can’t excrete excess magnesium and should not take it unless it’s been discussed with their healthcare team, says Millstine.Probiotics:There isno officialrecommendation for the use of probiotics by generally healthy individuals. Blake recommends speaking with a registered dietitian nutritionist to determine which strain and dosage is right for you. Possible negative side effects include eczema and inflammatory bowel disease.If you can tolerate probiotics, excessive use may not be toxic, but there could be other downstream effects.“Probiotics can limit your ability to get to your natural, healthy microbiome,” says Millstine, adding that this is because high-dose supplements can hinder the diversity of your gut bacteria. “I caution people to really consider if they need probiotics.”Creatine:Creatine supplements can cause some bloating and gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as nausea, says Millstine. She recommends sticking to 4-5g per day.Research suggests that higher doses of creatinedo not offerany advantages. Because there’smixed evidenceof a negative effect on kidneys, people withkidney diseaseare especially advised to speak with their healthcare provider before trying it.Collagen peptides:Collagen peptides are smaller pieces of collagen and can come in powder and pill form. Collagen peptides can possibly help withjointandskin health, though much more research is needed to support these claims, says Carnavali.Though there’s no standardized dose,some researchshows 2.5-15g daily is safe. However, research not sponsored by supplement manufacturers is scarce.Millstine’s primary caution is not to use collagen peptides in place of a more complete protein powder, because they lack essential amino acids needed for overall health.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealth & wellbeingNutritionHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rather than following his genre peers who are busy aiming for the lofty heights of Don’t Look Now and Possession, British director Johannes Roberts is happy to give gen Z their very own Shakma, the goofy 1990 schlocker about a baboon driven wild by an experimental drug.Greenland 2: Migration review – disaster sequel is disastrously self-seriousRead moreThat film took a while to gain a cult following, ultimately accepted by the same drunk Bad Movie crowd who took in Troll 2, but Primate won’t take anywhere near as long. It’s a far better, slicker movie for one, a surgically well-made crowd-pleaser that swaps out baboon for chimp, cleverly turning him from test subject to domesticated pet. At 89-minutes and paced like a rollercoaster, there’s little room for life lessons, although the film does make for a stern, grisly reminder of why chimps should not be considered part of the family (something many still don’t seem to understand).It’s ultimately, and importantly, not Ben’s fault. Ben being the chimp who became part of a Hawaii-based family when the late matriarch’s linguistics work followed her home from the lab. He lives with teenager Erin (Gia Hunter) and her crimewriter father Adam (Troy Kotsur, Coda Oscar winner) in a lux, and crucially remote, cliffside house. They’re being visited by absent eldest daughter Lucy (Johnny Sequoyah) who has retreated since the death of her mother. She arrives with best friend in tow, and some stragglers, for a weekend of dad-free fun, abruptly called to a halt when Ben starts exhibiting some alarmingly odd behaviour. It’s not just that he’s weird with strangers (he is) but he’s also been bitten by a mongoose …As some foreboding explanatory text teases at the start, Ben has contracted rabies and as Lucy explains to her unlucky friends, “he’s not Ben anymore”. The cosy, teddy-clutching little brother has become a bloodthirsty killer and after a nasty initial confrontation, the group take refuge in the middle of the pool (Ben can’t swim and rabies is also associated with hydrophobia). Roberts gets right to it, perhaps a little too quickly (I could have done with a couple more scenes of Ben as pet rather than predator to flesh out the family dynamic and hammer home the horror of his turn), but once we’re off to the races, it’s a thrilling sprint to the finish.As I sat down to watch, I realised I’d failed to take notice of the rating and perhaps assumed that due to the young cast and evergreen studio thirst for a wider audience, it would be a PG-13. As the cold open climaxes with our first victim getting his face torn off, I realised I was very wrong. Roberts takes full advantage of his hard R, with more jaw-snapping, head-smashing, bone-crunching violence than we’ve seen in a studio horror for a while. It’s inventively, memorably nasty (a fall from a great height ends in a brutally novel way while Ben’s dispatch of an Instagram jock is genuinely, is-he-really-going-to-go-there repulsive) but Roberts doesn’t use his gore to sacrifice the slow, seat-edge build, Ben’s unpredictable behaviour keeping us on our toes. The creature work is remarkably effective, a rare modern feat of practical effects (Ben is played by movement specialist Miguel Torres Umba) and it pulls us that much closer to the chaos unfolding, adding a physical connection to something that could have felt digitally alienating. Ben’s journey to becoming a full, sadistic slasher villain (he even has a Halloween-referencing wardrobe moment) gets a tad laughable by the end but there’s such electricity to the extended family-fights-back finale, that you’ll be too involved in who makes it to care all that much. I found myself surprisingly invested, thanks to some committed young performers and a warm dad role for Kotsur (how many other wide-releasing studio films have featured a deaf actor, with multiple sign language-only scenes, so prominently in the last few years?).Roberts, and long-time co-writer Ernest Riera, are clearly paying loving homage to the many creature features of the 80s and while some of the nods pay off (the aforementioned practicality, the raucous teens), some of the synth-heavy score choices sometimes don’t, the choice to pick style over suspense often reducing the tension (Roberts’ ho-humStrangers sequelsuffered similarly). But Roberts, who also directed hit shark thriller 47 Metres Down and itssuperior follow-up, is mostly at his savviest and most ruthlessly efficient here, a confident leveling up for a genre film-maker finding his sweet spot. After a lacklustre year for horror, Primate makes for a wildly entertaining start to 2026.Primate is out in US cinemas on 9 January, in Australia on 22 January, and in the UK on 30 January.Explore more on these topicsHorror filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The GuardianThe president has vowed to kill off ‘woke’ in his second term in office, and the venerable cultural institution a few blocks from the White House is in his sightsByCharlotte HigginsThu 8 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 08.13 ESTShareOn 30 May last year, Kim Sajet was working in her office in the grandly porticoed National Portrait Gallery inWashington DC. The gallery is one of the most important branches of the Smithsonian Institution, the complex of national museums that, for almost 200 years, has told the story of the nation. The director’s suite, large enough to host a small party, has a grandeur befitting the museum’s role as the keeper of portraits of the United States’ most significant historical figures. Sajet was working beneath the gaze of artworks from the collection, including a striking 1952 painting of Mary Mills, a military-uniformed, African American nurse, and a bronze head of jazz and blues singer Ethel Waters.It seemed like an ordinary Friday. Until, that is, an anxious colleague came in to tell Sajet that the president of the United States had personally denounced her on social media. “Upon the request and recommendation of many people I am herby [sic] terminating the employment of Kim Sajet as Director of the National Portrait Gallery,”Donald Trumphad posted on Truth Social. According to the post, Sajet was “a highly partisan person” and a “strong supporter” of diversity and inclusion programmes, which by an executive order on his inauguration day, 20 January, he had eradicated from federal agencies. “Her replacement will be named shortly,” continued the message. “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Sajet is a Dutch art historian, raised in Australia, who is in her early 60s. She has platinum blond hair, and wears trouser suits in bright colours and statement spectacles. Her manner is warm and open, but she also projects an air of professional control. When we met in autumn 2025, she seemed so determined not to say anything controversial that I struggled to believe that anyone could consider her radical. She recalled that, after absorbing Trump’s post, she shot a look at her shaken colleague, and asked: “Are you OK?”“It honestly was another day in the office,” Sajet told me. “Truly, I don’t think people realise that as soon as you become a director at the Smithsonian, you are a public figure.” In the 12 years she had been running the museum, members of Congress were constantly questioning displays, she said. A disgruntled painter whose portrait of Trump she had refused to put on display – because, she said, the work was of insufficient quality – had pursued her through the courts for years.But surely, I asked, the president personally firing her on social media was something else? She shrugged, her tough outer coating intact. “I think we can all agree we live in unusual times,” she said.It had, perhaps, been only a matter of time before Trump targeted a senior figure from the Smithsonian Institution. In February, Trump had declared himself, despite having no authority to do so, chair of the Kennedy Center, the US’s national centre for the performing arts, and vowed to end “woke” programming – a prelude, it turned out, to actuallyrenaming the organisation after himself, with workmen adding his name, in slightly mismatching type, above that of Kennedy’s on the building’s facade this Christmas. At the national museums, there had been some hope his attention to the arts might peter out there. After all, the Smithsonian, as well as the National Gallery of Art, a separate body, had pre-emptively shut down their diversity offices soon after Trump’s executive order, despite not themselves being federal agencies.But on 27 March an executive order was published, claiming that the Smithsonian had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centred ideology” that “promoted narratives that portray American and western values as inherently harmful and oppressive”. The person assigned with removing this “improper ideology”, along with the vice-president, JD Vance, wasLindsey Halligan, a Trump aide in her mid-30s who had previously worked as an insurance attorney and had no experience in the arts.The executive orderwas titled Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.On 30 May, as soon as she heard of the Truth Social post, Sajet spoke to her boss, Lonnie Bunch III, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who had previously been founding director of its National Museum of African American History and Culture. “We very quickly said: ‘The president of the United States does not have the jurisdiction to fire a director at the Smithsonian,’” Sajet recalled. That power lay with Bunch himself, overseen by the Smithsonian’s board of regents, a traditionally non-partisan group composed of members of Congress and members of the public, plus the vice-president and the chief justice. “I just kept on working,” Sajet said.The next working day after Trump’s post, Monday 2 June, an emergency meeting of the Smithsonian’s board of regents was held. By the end, Sajet still had her job. A week later, on Monday 9 June, there was a second board meeting. Afterwards, the Smithsonian published a statement affirming that decisions on hiring and firing lay with Bunch. (This was despite the fact, according to people familiar with the meetings, that the vice-president, Vance, had personally called for Sajet’s head.) As a concession to the administration, the Smithsonian announced that Bunch would also take measures to ensure “unbiased content” in the museums, and report back to the board on “any needed personnel changes”.View image in fullscreenKim Sajet in front of Ellsworth Kelly’s Red Yellow Blue II in November.Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The GuardianSajet kept off social media, avoiding the threatening messages from Trump’s base that friends told her were amassing. She lasted until Thursday 12 June. In the end, she decided she should try to defuse what she feared could turn into a larger, more resolute attack on the museum. “It just became fairly obvious that the story wasn’t going to change,” she told me. “So I thought, ‘I’m just going to take control of this, and step outside of the maelstrom.’”In short, the president had ended up getting what he wanted – without a jot of authority to do so. As for Sajet’s supposed partisan position, her adherence to the loathed ideology of diversity and inclusion? Sajet’s mission had been, she told me, to ensure that Americans would be able to see portraits of people like themselves. Gradually, she made sure more women, more minorities, more Black people were represented on its walls. “It was just recognising that people had been knocked out of the national story, so let’s put them back in,” she said. “It wasn’t terribly revolutionary.”In a smoothly run liberal democracy, it is easy to imagine that the arts and culture are distractions unworthy of serious political attention. But as the culture wars have intensified over the past decade or so, and as politics has become less stable across the globe, that view has been harder to sustain. It is certainly not a view shared by Trump and his circle. On 19 August, the president gave the fullest articulation yet of his position. “TheMuseumsthroughout Washington, but all over the Country are,” he asserted on social media, “the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE.’”He continued: “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been – Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future.” He added: “I have instructed my attorneys to go through the Museums, and start the exact same process that has been done with Colleges and Universities where tremendous progress has been made.”To use different language, Trump wanted museums to reflect a Maga vision of American history that was nationalist and triumphalist, and downplayed reflection on darker aspects of its past, specifically its history of slavery. His views were of a piece with his other, smaller, forays into the cultural arena – his desire, for example, to build a triumphal arch in Washington, or his personal role invetoing what were regarded as “woke” artistsfrom becoming Kennedy Center honourees.Whereas the first Trump administration left cultural matters largely alone, in his second term it has made them a priority. Through lawsuits and executive orders, threats and intimidation, the administration is seeking to shift the country to the right, an abrupt and extreme escalation in the long battle for control over the narrative of American history fought by both the right and the left. To do so, he is targeting the institutions – universities and museums – that form people’s minds and imaginations, their sense of identity. “The goal,” as one senior employee of the Smithsonian told me, “is to reframe the entire culture of the United States from the foundation up.”View image in fullscreenAn exhibit at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, Washington DC.Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The Guardian“In Trump 1.0, the systems that held everything together were still working,” said Gus Casely-Hayford, the former director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of AfricanArt, now at the V&A East in London. “But those systems were not stitched together by anything more robust than culture, practice and belief. No one thought that anyone would unravel that, but so much of what the Smithsonian does tends towards what it means to be American.” And what it means to be American, it seems, is up for grabs as never before.The Smithsonian Institution is particularly vulnerable to Trump’s attentions. As a collection of national museums, with members of Congress and the vice-president on the board, it is physically close to the great centres of power in DC. It also occupies a unique status among US museums in that it is about 60% federally funded. As such, its aim is to be politically unbiased, though any follower of the BBC will know that impartiality is a moving target. This special status puts it in contrast to the country’s other great museums – for example the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Getty in Los Angeles – which are privately funded through philanthropy and endowments, and so at one remove from the government. Intimidation is one weapon an administration can use against the Smithsonian; funding is another. Already, the Smithsonian is anticipating a budget cut of $131.2m in 2026.There is one potential weapon, however, that the Trump administration might try to use against private museums. Many of them, along with charitable foundations and universities, have tax-exempt status, which Trump could threaten to remove. Glenn D Lowry, who recently retired as director of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, after 30 years, believes this may be coming. “Theoretically they can’t do it,” Lowry told me. “But the mere threat acts as a form of pressure. Institutions might start to self-censor, and that is a very real risk.”The Baltimore Museum of Art is an elegant Greek temple of a building that gazes steadily over its majority-Black, deeply segregated city. It stands on the fringes of a park that, until 2017, held a statue of a pair of confederate generals, now an empty plinth. On a weekday morning in November, the museum was full of bustle. A few visitors were drawn to its stellar collection of Matisses, but more, that day, were there to see an exhibition by Amy Sherald, the artist who, in 2018, had become famous for her painting of Michelle Obama dressed in a sweeping, geometrically patterned evening gown, which was commissioned to hang in Washington’s National Portrait Gallery.The show was full of of people clustering round Sherald’s striking, larger-than-life paintings of Black subjects to whom she had accorded the grandeur of heroic figures of 19th-century history paintings. Sherald had attended art school in Baltimore, and the exhibition, American Sublime, had the feel of a homecoming. But it had never been intended this way. At the end of July, two months before it was due to open, Sherald had withdrawn the exhibition abruptly from its intended home at the National Portrait Gallery in DC, over fears that her work was being censored – not by the Trump administration, but by the Smithsonian itself.By the time Sherald’s decision became public, on 24 July, Sajet had been gone from the portrait gallery over a month. In a statement, Sherald explained that she had decided to pull the entire show after she had heard of disquieting discussions at the central HQ of the Smithsonian – “the castle”, as it is known – over one painting. The work in question is a portrait, titled Trans Forming Liberty, of a trans woman in the triumphant pose of the Statue of Liberty. Sherald told the New York Times she had discovered there was an internal discussion about either replacing the painting with, or contextualising it by, a video of people reacting to the work. The discussion, she had gleaned, was prompted by fears that the portrait would attract adverse attention because trans people are such a frequent target for Trump’s circle. “The video would have opened up for debate the value of trans visibility,” Sherald said, “and I was opposed to that being a part of the American Sublime narrative.”View image in fullscreenAmy Sherald’s Trans Forming Liberty at the Baltimore Museum of Art in November.Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The GuardianTracking self-censorship is difficult. Often it operates in subtle ways – the removal of a word in a label here, the discreet pulling of a display that never got publicly announced there. One DC museums professional told me that they had been informed that “anything relating to trans life, or even acknowledging trans life, is going to need extra layers of review”. Another told me their institution had removed the phrase “social justice” from a wall text as a way of softening the way a particular artist (a socialist, anti-racist figure) was presented. In another context, references to the Dutch empire’s involvement in enslavement was discouraged from the labels on a display of Dutch landscapes.“People are acquiescing in advance as a way to stay under the radar,” said Steven Nelson, who recently stepped down from a senior position at the National Gallery of Art. “Very quickly, things that would not have been considered DEI began being considered DEI, which was almost anything not white.” No one currently in post at the Smithsonian or the National Gallery of Art spoke to me on the record about such matters, fearing for their jobs and for those of their colleagues. The less attention from the White House, the better. “Don’t poke at it,” was the phrase one museum director used.Some staff at the Smithsonian told me that the institution was being overly cautious. One person told me that a proposed label for a recent exhibition had referred to the “unjust” incarceration of Japanese Americans during the second world war. The central Smithsonian had asked for the word to be changed, because it could seem partisan. “America hardly ever apologises for anything, and it almost never gives reparations,” the person involved told me, “except for this event, this example in our history where we said sorry, and that apology came with money.” It was obvious to them that “unjust” was a fair summary of events, but the review demanded a wordier formulation. The drip-drip of such seemingly small adjustments sat uncomfortably with their personal ethics, “changing the language around this thing, not mentioning this thing – it is a question of small moral injuries”.At times, the self-censorship approaches dark comedy. One Smithsonian employee had removed the word “diversity” from texts and replaced it with the synonym “variety”. Diversity, after all, was a word guaranteed to provoke the ire of the Trump circle because of its association with DEI programmes. But in this particular case, “diversity” was being used in a strictly scientific context: the “diversity” of astronomical objects. Nevertheless, the employee was anxious about the word’s potentially snagging on any search engines through which the administration might run museum texts. Better, all round, to deflect the gaze.For some, the self-censorship – what some might call anticipatory obedience – is becoming increasingly frustrating. “I think courage is contagious,” one curator told me. “If a big institution like the Smithsonian, which has so much influence and power, were seen to be taking a stand, I think other institutions would. But the way that it gets communicated to the staff is like, ‘Well, if the CIA and the FBI can’t stand up to Trump, what can we do?’” Nelson put it even more bluntly: “The administration don’t really have to do anything, because institutions are doing it all for them.”In Washington DC this autumn, life often seemed normal. Restaurants and bars were bustling, streets were pounded by purposeful-looking people on official business. But every so often, one would glimpse something very different: soldiers clustered on street corners, in metro stations, even in shops. These were members of the National Guard deployed to support the efforts of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). Between January and the end of July,ICE arrested 88 peoplein DC. But then, from 1 August to the end of October, that number leapt to 1,147. “You could be walking your dog. And suddenly, black cars pull up and people mug some kid on a moped who’s delivering somebody’s dinner,” said one Smithsonian employee. “They pummel him or her to the ground, put their feet on their neck, put them in a black SUV, drive away, leave the moped there, leave the food on the sidewalk, and the neighbours walk out and see what they can do. It happens in other countries. Now it’s happening here.”The sense of life going on while at the same time, on another level, life had become disordered and frightening, was also true at the Smithsonian. On one level, an employee told me, nothing much had actually “happened”. Those with long memories pointed to the great Smithsonian scandals of the past, such as a 1990s show about the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. After noisy accusations of an anti-American bias, the show was substantially altered, and the director of the National Air and Space Museum resigned. No scandal, optimists pointed out, had yet occurred on that scale.This winter, the museums were still busy with visitors – at least, after the autumn’s long government shutdown ended. The Museum of African American History, the institution Lonnie Bunch had established, was hosting throngs of visitors, many of them Black Americans making the pilgrimage to absorb an unvarnished account of the cruelty and racism that was so central to their country’s history. One of its most moving artefacts is a chunk of iron ballast used in 18th-century slave ships to counterbalance the human cargo.Behind the scenes, though, a tense standoff was continuing between the Trump administration and the “castle”. In his 2019 memoir, Bunch had been frank about his awkward encounters with the president. He recounts giving Trump a tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in his first term. Before the president arrived, aides informed Bunch that he was “in a foul mood and that he did not want to see anything ‘difficult’”. Bunch decided to begin with the slavery section nevertheless, since “it was not my job to make the rough edges of history smooth, even for the president”. In a section on how nations such as Portugal, Britain and the Netherlands profited from the slave trade, Trump paused and studied a label. “I felt that maybe he was paying attention to the work of the museum,” writes Bunch. “He quickly proved me wrong. As he turned from the display, he said to me, ‘You know, they love me in the Netherlands.’ All I could say was let’s continue walking.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with Lonnie Bunch at the White House in 2019.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesOn 12 August, three weeks after Amy Sherald’s withdrawal of her show in DC, Lindsey Halligan and two other Trump aides wrote to Bunch. The letter began amiably enough, thanking him for a tour of some of the museums, but then announced that they would be leading a review of the institution. It would initially be focused on eight museums, including the Museum of American History, the Museum of African American History, the National Portrait Gallery and the American Art Museum – those, in short, most concerned with the country’s identity and self-image.For this, institutions would be required to provide, within 75 days, an ocean of information: exhibition outlines, texts of labels, exhibition catalogues, budgets, staff manuals, organisational charts, inventory of all holdings, educational resources, grant applications. Within 120 days, the letter continued, museums should begin implementing “content corrections”, replacing “divisive or ideologically driven language”. A “revitalised” curatorial vision should be rooted in the “strength, breadth, and achievements of the American story”. The institution would, in short, begin to focus on what it called “Americanism”.A week later Trump published his long post about how museums were the “last remaining segment of woke”. Two days after that,the White House put out an articleheadlined “President Trump Is Right About the Smithsonian”, detailing exhibits and texts regarded as objectionable, from apainting of a refugee familycrossing the wall at the Mexican border, to an animation illustrating the career of physician Anthony Fauci, to a wall text that described the founding of the US as “a profound unsettling of the continent”.Then, on 28 August, Bunch was summoned to the White House for lunch with Trump and Halligan. Afterwards, Bunch insisted in a letter to staff that the review of the institution would in fact be conducted by its own staff – a grasping-back of the Smithsonian’s independence – though information would be shared with the White House. He also addressed an anxious all-staff meeting held at the auditorium of the Museum of African American History. The message was, according to a staffer who was there: carry on with your work, keep doing what you do.These days, Kim Sajet is in Wisconsin. Soon after she resigned from the National Portrait Gallery, she was approached by the Milwaukee Art Museum to become its new director. The museum, located on the shores of Lake Michigan, is a spectacular ensemble of buildings: some by the Finnish architect Eero Saarinen in modernist concrete; some by the Spaniard Santiago Calatrava in the fantastical form of a giant bird, whose soaring wings are now a symbol of the city.We met a few weeks after Sajet had begun work there, in her new office – several degrees less grand than her previous perch in DC. “I’m still getting my head around the collection,” she said, of the museum’s eclectic holdings, which range from paintings by Georgia O’Keeffe and Agnes Martin to an Egyptian mummy, and one of the US’s most significant collections of Haitian art.View image in fullscreenKim Sajet in the Quadracci Pavillon at the Milwaukee Art Museum.Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The GuardianSajet told me she was loving Milwaukee, with its green spaces and lakefront walks, and was excited about running an institution that could exist at the centre of its local community. Privately funded, the museum is far away from the baleful gaze of Trump. When I asked whether she still feels she could be targeted, she said: “I don’t know. I mean, it could happen, right? I mean, I’m still a pretty visible symbol, whatever. Who knows what’s around the corner. But you just can’t live like that.”Ninety miles or so down the coast of the lake, in the Democratic stronghold of Chicago, Trump’s shadow had fallen far less darkly over its museums than in Washington, and, when I visited, protesters were gathering in force against ICE and its raids. The Museum of Contemporary Art had an exhibition about histories of queer culture in the city, and afeatured image on its websitewas a sculpture by the African American artist Arthur Jafa, based on a famous 1863 photo of an enslaved man with horrific scars on his back. (Reproductions of the photograph hadreportedly been ordered to be removedfrom national parks by the Trump administration.) At the Art Institute of Chicago, one of the great American museums, curator Sarah Kelly Oehler showed me the galleries of 20th-century American art she had recently rehung. “I think of myself in a trajectory of 150 years of curators,” she said. Hers was a pluralistic vision of modernism, with more work by female artists and artists of colour than in the past – an interpretation that would have looked alien to the visitors of 50 years ago. “My job is to offer historical information,” she said. “We have a very diverse audience in Chicago, and we have a responsibility to them. If we want to offer a place of respite and inspiration to them, we have to think about who these people are.”Back in DC, one museum director told me they were feeling calm – readier, than in the spring, for assaults by the administration. They knew what they would do if they were hauled up in front of a hostile congressional hearing, as were thepresidents of Columbia and Harvard last year. They had scenarios mapped out, “like a crime board”. Lonnie Bunch, in the meantime, is holding a delicate line. On 18 December, a new letter from the White House arrived for him. The Smithsonian had fallen short in providing the information requested on 12 August, it said. “We wish to be assured,” it continued, “that none of the leadership of the Smithsonian museums is confused about the fact that the United States has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world. The American people will have no patience for any museum that is diffident about America’s founding or otherwise uncomfortable conveying a positive view of American history.” Then came the threat. “As you may know, funds apportioned for the Smithsonian Institution are only available for use in a manner consistent with Executive Order 14253, ‘Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,’ and the fulfilment of the requests set forth in our August 12, 2025 letter.”The invention of whiteness: the long history of a dangerous ideaRead moreBunch wrote a note to all his staff the following day, quietly affirming, once more, the organisation’s autonomy. “For nearly 180 years, the Smithsonian has served our country as an independent and nonpartisan institution committed to its mission – the increase and diffusion of knowledge – for all Americans. As we all know, all content, programming, and curatorial decisions are made by the Smithsonian.”WithJD Vanceon the board of regents, along with Republican members of Congress, the question hovers: how long will 73-year-old Bunch survive in his position? “Lonnie knows his time is short,” one DC museum director told me. “It’s a question of how he decides to go, and of which hill he chooses to die on.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readMuseumsDonald TrumpArtArts fundingWashington DCUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It began not with a single shocking act but with quiet legal changes that narrowed space for dissent; each step justified as reasonable or necessary, until suddenly, democracy itself felt like a performance rather than a reality. Watching current developments in the UK, it’s impossible not to feel an uneasy sense of deja vu.Over the past few years, Britain has introduced a number of laws that have drastically curtailed the right to protest. ThePolice, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022and thePublic Order Act 2023grant police sweeping powers to restrict demonstrations, criminalise peaceful tactics and arrest people on vague grounds that they may have caused serious disruption or unease. Hundreds of arrestshave followed, including for slow marching, linking arms, or carrying protest equipment. Many of those arrested have faced prosecution, with courts handing down fines, and in some cases, lengthy imprisonment for peaceful protest activities, reinforcing the chilling effect of these laws.Officials say these measures are about balance and public order. But the balance has tipped towards control. Protesters and legal observers alike describe confusion about what is lawful, inconsistent police instructions and arbitrary arrests, even when organisers have coordinated with the police in advance. Activists are jailed for actions that only a few years ago would have resulted in a discharge, a fine or a suspended sentence. The result is growing uncertainty and hesitation that discourages people from speaking out or taking to the streets.This pattern is all too familiar. In Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, authoritarianism has taken root through the steady consolidation of government power. Under the guise of preserving “order” and “safety”, the government has restricted public gatherings andsilenced critical voices. Independent institutions, from the judiciary and media regulators to universities and cultural bodies, have been systematicallyundermined or taken over,ensuring that state power extends into nearly every corner of public life.Human rights official urges UK to review laws after Palestine Action placard arrestsRead moreHungary’s experience shows how fragile democracy becomes when legal safeguards erode, and how quickly laws written in neutral language can become instruments of repression. That trajectory should serve as a stark warning to the UK, where shrinking space for protest and dissent threaten democracy. The rule of law depends on legal limits that bind the state itself. When those limits weaken, when vague legislation hands discretion to the executive or to police, the door opens to abuse.That danger became clear last year in the UK, when the high court ruled that the then home secretary, Suella Braverman,had acted unlawfullyby lowering the protest threshold from “serious” to “more than minor” disruption, an attempt to make it easier for police to shut down protests altogether. The Labour government’s decision to defend those same unlawful regulations in court, rather than repeal them, was a troubling signal that across party lines, the instinct to control dissent runs deep.This creeping expansion of state power has extended far beyond the streets. Theproscriptionof the group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation marked an alarming new phase, with civil disobedience itself conflated with extremism.UN experts warnedthat such actions blur the line between legitimate activism and terrorism, echoing authoritarian tactics to stifle opposition under the guise of security.The UK is not Hungary, but the direction it is taking is alarmingly familiar. Make no mistake, this new authority in the UK may not be wielded by those who promise to use it responsibly. Laws outlast governments. Today’s “anti-disruption” powers could tomorrow be used to suppress strikes, silence journalists, or target minority communities.The lesson from Hungary is how quickly governments can manipulate the law to serve political ends, and how hard it is to undo that. Legal frameworks that curtail rights rarely stay idle – they are picked up, expanded and weaponised by those who find them convenient.The UK authorities, including central and local governments, the police and judiciary, can still change course. That means repealing or amending the most repressive elements of recent protest laws, ending the use of no-suspicion or“suspicion-less” stop and search, and committing to full transparency and accountability in how police powers are exercised. Above all, it means recognising that dissent, no matter how disruptive or uncomfortable, is not a threat to democracy but its safeguard.Freedom of assembly is not a gift governments grant their citizens; it is a right that protects citizens from their governments. Look to Hungary. Britain should not have to learn that lesson the hard way.Lydia Gall is a senior Europe researcher at Human Rights WatchDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There’s no more doubt that 2026 will be the sameThu 8 Jan 2026 09.21 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 18.24 ESTShareBy 1934, it was entirely evident what Benito Mussolini was up to. Italy’s dictator had already consolidated power, colonized Libya and annexed the city of Rijeka. He nevertheless got to stage the second-ever World Cup,managing it with a heavy handand even supplanting the Jules Rimet trophy with a far larger one. Hosting and winning that World Cup didn’t sate his expansionist appetites. By the end of the decade, Mussolini would take Ethiopia, annex Albania and back Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war.It was equally well established in 1978 in Argentina that General Jorge Rafaél Videla’s military junta, which had taken over two years earlier, was maintaining its grip on power throughsystematic detention, torture and murder. Still, protestations from other nations were ignored and the World Cup kicked off.“At last, the world can see the true face of Argentina,” saidFifapresident João Havelange at the opening ceremony, newly decorated with a medal from Videla.Argentina spared no expense in putting on itsWorld Cup, even though the total cost was a state secret. But the right-wing government also didn’t bother to slow the pace at which it disappeared political dissidents and opponents. Germany captain Berti Vogts proclaimed that “Argentina is a country where order reigns. I haven’t seen a single political prisoner,” though, so no matter.Trump loomed over sport like never before in 2025. Next year he will take even moreRead moreWhen Vladimir Putin presided over the opening ceremony to the 2018 World Cup, it had been four years since his forces annexed Crimea from Ukraine and he backed pro-Russian rebels in the Donbas region. Fifa didn’t mind.The problematic nature of these events may have been obvious at the time, but took some time to be fully acknowledged; for there to be no mistaking the actions and intentions of the host government. Years from now, when we look back on the geopolitical context of the 2026 World Cup – shared with Canada and Mexico but hogged by the United States – we’ll likely place it in the same category as those others. Hopefully, we have perfect clarity, and this edition of the World Cup will take its place among the most shameful incarnations of the quadrennial tournament.This conclusion was crystalized bylast week’s forceful and bloody abduction of the sitting president of Venezuela and his wife, before US president Donald Trumpannounced that the socialist state was now effectively an American-run territory.That was, of course, after Trump, or his henchmen,softened their support for Ukrainein its ongoing war with Russia;literally blew boats out of the wateron mere suspicion of drug trafficking;threatened to invade Mexicoandannex Canada(their World Cup co-hosts!),Greenlandandthe Panama canal; and started a trade war with, well,basically everybody,disrupting the global economy.We don’t yet know how far this administration, which promised isolationism but has insteaddelivered geopolitical mayhem, will go in a foreign policy that lacks any coherence beyond the governing assumption that it can do whatever it feels like.But it’s clear that it may just be getting started.Still, the World Cup will proceed. Fifa president Gianni Infantino has been immovable inhis support for Trump. Unlike Havelange and Videla, themedals and fake awardsare going in the other direction.It’s been some time since we had a World Cup without reasonable controversy. The 2010 and 2014 editions in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, were widely panned locally for the strain they put on nations with far more pressing needs. And yet those legitimate complaints seem quaint compared to the 2022 tournament in Qatar, acquired under well-documented corruption and leading directly tomany deaths and human rights abuses. The 2030 tournament will inevitably grow notorious for spreading the thing out over threecontinents, greatly increasing the environmental impact and giving the lie to any claims Fifa once made of caring for the climate. And then there’s the 2034 World Cup, which has already been signed over to the Saudi Arabia’s strongman de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman.The US-dominated World Cup fits neatly into this run. This nation isn’t presently in a position to lecture anybody else on human rights – nor has it ever been. The Qataris and Saudis are sportswashing outliers no longer. This is just what the World Cup is now: a convenient vehicle for carrying the aims of dangerously self-interested people.Perhaps some kind of boycott movement from fans toward Fifa events will gather steam, although the slow slide of acceptance to where we are suggests otherwise. One didn’t come off before Qatar, either, in spite of a lot of noise. It’s doubtful such a boycott would accomplish much by way of embarrassing the men, and the odd woman, who have killed off the parts of themselves that once felt shame anyway.Soccer has fully gone the way of the Olympics and Formula One, which long ago made their peace with whatever sordid baggage came attached to the highest bidder for their events.And when the story is told of how the World Cup fully and finally lost its way, they will point to the 2026 edition, played in Canada and Mexico and – problematically, embarrassingly, irredeemably – these United States.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on May 12.

In standalone form, Primark would probably have suffered a bigger share price thump than the 14% fall that the still-combined conglomerate sustained afterThursday’s profits warning.The problem atPrimarkis that it has suddenly become hard to know what to expect. A year ago, the stores in continental Europe seemed to be trading well while the UK ones hit a soft spot. Now the UK end is back on form, regaining some market share, while the continental stores have had a serious skid. In the 16-week peak trading period, like-for-like sales at the former were up 1.7% while the latter (meaning Europe excluding the UK and Ireland) were down 5.7%, a big decline.AB Foods is full of explanations of how it has managed to improve the UK performance: it points to sharper marketing, especially on critical lines under a “Major Finds” initiative; and introducing click and collect at a chain that famously doesn’t do home delivery.The open question, though, is whether the same self-help remedies will work so quickly on the continent. There are reasons to think not. For starters, the group doesn’t yet have the infrastructure in place to introduce click and collect over there, even though it plans to do so in the medium term. Then, as Panmure Liberum’s analyst points out, penetration levels are lower across many individual European markets: “The worsening like-for-like trends in Europe lead to concerns about whether it is just a reflection of the weak consumer environment or whether the proposition is losing traction.”Quite, it is all a bit mysterious. The consumer backdrop in many large European countries is clearly weaker than in the UK. Many retailers are saying the same – France, Germany and Italy seem to have been particularly weak for Primark. But one also wonders if the buzz around the brand has faded, or if competition from online channels such as Shein, Temu and Zalando is finally having an effect.Primark should still make £1bn of operating profit this year, think analysts, and even AB Food’s lowered forecast for operating profit margins, taking account of extra markdowns as a result of lower continental turnover, is 10%. So one shouldn’t exaggerate the scale of the problem. This is far from being a crisis. Over the long term, Primark should still have plenty of room to expand.But the difference from previous expectations also matters. It’s only two months since AB Foods was confident it would produce growth in group profits and earnings per share in the financial year that ends in September. Now it expects to be down. Analysts translate that as meaning the difference between being up 4%-5% and down by a similar degree. It is a chunky adjustment. The mood wasn’t helped by “mixed” trading on the food front, or bythe regulatory investigation into the proposed purchase of Hovis, or by the description of the US retail environment as “volatile”. But the continental news on Primark was clearly the main market-moving element: the once-purring retail machine has developed a splutter.In theory, that should make no difference to the thinking on corporate separation. AB Foods has always kept its eye on far horizons and in any case, the billionaire Weston family, the majority owner, would retain the same status in both businesses if a split happens. In practice, it might be best to avoid distractions for a year or two. Demergers work best when there is obviously value to unlock.Explore more on these topicsAssociated British FoodsNils Pratley on financePrimarkRetail industryFood & drink industryCompetition and Markets AuthorityRegulatorscommentShareReuse this content"

He held up the tiny green shoots, his hands shaking. My older brother Mohammed and I rushed outside, laughing despite the fear that had become our constant companion. Each sprout was a victory.Before Gaza’s skies darkened with smoke and the ground shook with bombs, our garden was a lush tapestry of trees and plants, each leaf and branch woven into our family memory. Birds danced above the branches. Five ancient trees stood tall, twisted trunks weathered by sun and wind, branches heavy with black and green olives. Fruit trees filled the air with sweetness – orange, lemon, a broad-leaved fig and a small clementine.View image in fullscreenAn eggplant, or aubergine, growing in the garden.Photograph: Taqwa Ahmed al-Wawi/The GuardianIn the midst of the Israeli bombardment, my brother Mohammed and our father committed a small but profound act of rebellion. They decided to plant – to extend our small crop. They bought seedlings and seeds from a local farmer, who tended a rare patch of green and sold plants grown on his land. They bought 30 corn seeds, costing 15 shekels, roughly $5; three pepper seedlings, each priced at $2; two eggplant seedlings; two stems each of mint, basil,ain jarada(a local herb, known for its fresh aroma) and arugula, all for a single dollar; and four potato seeds.When thegenocide came, it ravaged buildings, tore through markets, disrupted supplies and inflated prices beyond reason. Food became a luxury, and the simple act of eating turned into a daily struggle. The weight of hunger was heavy, occupying every corner of our lives. It was a constant companion, reminding us of what we lacked and how powerless we often felt.My father and brother placed each plant carefully, covering their roots with soil, pressing gently to hold them in place. The seeds represented a gamble against the odds, a test of faith that life could flourish even now. “To plant is to believe in tomorrow,” my father said, as he pressed them gently into the soil.Carrying heavy buckets, they hauled water for the garden from more than 200 meters away, where neighbours queued in line to fill jugs. Water, once abundant from municipal taps, had become a hard-won treasure.The work was exhausting. The heat bore down mercilessly. Despite dizziness and weariness, day after day, they watered, tended and cleared space, so the seedlings could stretch toward the sun. Each drop of water was a tiny act of resistance.View image in fullscreenCorn grown in the garden.Photograph: Taqwa Ahmed al-Wawi/The GuardianPlants such as tomatoes or cucumbers, which require protective greenhouses (“hammams”) to survive Gaza’s harsh conditions, had already failed. The garden’s path was littered with hardship. My brother’s heart aches when he thinks of a mango seedling he nurtured for 10 months. He had split the seed, soaked it, wrapped it for a week and, after seeing the sprout, planted it. For two months, he watered it diligently. But the genocide forced our family to flee to Rafah. When we returned five months later, the mango plant was dead.So my father and brother chose plants that thrived with less care – ones which could succeed even in the most difficult conditions.The highlight was the corn. Thirty kernels, bought as popcorn seeds, grew into proud green stalks up to my chest. Standing among them, I felt a quiet pride.Despite the harsh conditions, lack of water and constant danger, each plant managed to grow, offering us food and a sense of achievement amid devastation.Potatoes soon followed. We harvested them and, boiled or fried, they became a meal made even richer by their origin. We drank fresh mint tea. Arugula andainjaradaadded sharp, peppery notes to our salads.Today, as scarcity gnaws and violence rages, even during a supposed ceasefire, the garden is still breathing life. It is a mix of longtime residents – the fig, orange, lemon and olive trees – and our new crops. In a landravaged by genocide, it persists – leaf by leaf, root by root. It is a chronicle of endurance and quiet rebellion.Taqwa Ahmed al-Wawi is a writer, poet and editor based in GazaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A radical overhaul is neededThu 8 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 09.29 ESTShareGovernments come into office brimming with confidence. They say their election win is a mandate for change, and that work on its manifesto pledgeswill start immediately. Invariably, there is talk of sleeves being rolled up.Sooner or later, there is a rude awakening. Ministers push buttons and pull levers expecting things to happen instantly, and are shocked to find that they don’t. The reason for that is simple: the British state is big – andgetting bigger– but as an agent of change it is not up to the job.This is true at both central and local levels. Over the years, the capacity of government to intervene has been pared back and professional expertise has been lost as council services havebeen outsourced. The main job of the state is now to alleviate the consequences of failure, which are becoming ever more pressing.Obeisance to market forces explains part of the problem. For the past half-century, there has been a neuralgic aversion to anything that smacks of picking winners. The misguided idea that countries only really thrive when governments get out of the way of the private sector has taken root. There are, though, other factors at play. One is the dominance of the Treasury, which has tried – unsuccessfully – to be both a ministry that looks after the public finances, and a ministry of the economy. Another is the British cult of the amateur, which has fostered the belief that somehow or other things will work out.Other countries have decided that winging it is perhaps not the best approach, and have done things differently. East Asian countries such as South Korea made conscious decisions to establish companies in certain sectors – computer electronics and shipbuilding for example – and forced through change.Nor did China’sdominationof the solar panels market – and clean energymore generally– come about by accident. It was the result of the authorities in Beijing identifying low-carbon technology as a global growth opportunity,and then making sure the investment and the people were available. While Britain has talked about a new industrial strategy built around a net zero future but done little toturn that rhetoric into reality, China – and other countries for that matter – have got on with it.Even the US – supposedly the ultimate expression of the free market – has a mechanism for delivering an industrial strategy: in part through the money pumped by the federal governmentinto universities, in part through the links between defence companies and the state, and in part through good old interventionism. Last year, for example, the US government took a10% stakein chipmaker Intel: a clear case of picking winners.Only rarely, and then usually as a result of extreme circumstances, has the British state been geared up for transformative change. One reason why the 1945 Labour government was able to be so radical was that it inherited a fully functioning planned economy at the end of the second world war. Key industries were run from Whitehall, and labour was directed to where it was needed.In the 1960s, Britain flirted with indicative planning – the idea that governments should set broad targets, and work out how to achieve them through cooperation with private companies and organised labour. A National Economic Development Council (NEDC)was createdto bring together politicians, business leaders and trade unionists. Later, a new ministry, the Department of Economic Affairs, was set up to oversee a national plan for growth. Neither survived.And yet, the record of other countries suggests that the devotees of indicative planning in the 1960s were on to something. Britain will only emerge sustainably from its current economic torpor if the machinery of government is reformed to make the state more effective. That means breaking the power of the Treasury by creating alternative economic power bases within Whitehall – either by beefing up the power of the prime minister’s office, or by creating a standalone ministry with real clout. Something akin to the old NEDC should be brought back, with a remit to identify and nurture potential growth sectors.Money matters, but it is not the only thing that matters. Britain has theweakest record for investmentof any of the G7 nations, and that needs to change. Yet the investment will only really be effective if the state is willing to experiment and accept that not all projects will end in success. Other countries have shown the benefits of a pragmatic, trial-and-error approach. Repeating that success here requires substantial culture change, which is a big ask, but worth the risk.The alternative is that other countries continue to leave Britain for dead in the growth industries of the future, and that ideas that stem from here are commercially exploited elsewhere.Failure to reform the state to make it more dynamic will also entrench public cynicism about politics. Voters zone out when they hear about the latest government initiative because they suspect – quite rightly – that it is just so much hot air. Their day-to-day experience of the state, whether it isunfilled potholes,long waitsfor treatment in A&E, or draconian fines for minor littering offences, is not positive.There was a time when people had a more benign view of the state, but that was when it was seen as doing things for people rather than to people: establishing the NHS, putting new health centres next to schools, building homes. Without a makeover, the state will continue to appear not just big and useless, but also mean. It’s not a good look.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsIndustrial policyOpinionCivil serviceEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

What happened behind the scenes?Alejandro VelascoIn the early fray of foreign interventions, evidence is largely circumstantial. But here the circumstances tell a powerful storyThu 8 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareAs late as Saturday afternoon, fires continued to smolder in parts of Caracas. Residents throughout the city, stunned and anxious, filled grocery stores and gas stations, stocking up before a future unknown. Everywhere the question hung in the air like the smoke still clouding Venezuela’s capital: what next?After months of military buildup, deadly strikes at sea and a looming ground war, the United States made good on its threats to attack Venezuela in a dramatic overnight raid that ended with Nicolás Maduro in a New York City jail cell. Yet 48 hours later, little else appeared different in Caracas: Maduro’s inner circle remained in place; state institutions remained in their control; streets were calm, if tense, while authorities called on people to return to their daily lives. In other words: move along, nothing to see here.If this is regime change, it seems a strange sort, one that leaves the regime otherwise intact, and which raises a more pressing question than what comes next: what happened? Of course, much remains speculative. But at this point, information available suggests that after over a decade of tight cohesion around Maduro, his inner circle calculated they were better off without him and struck a deal with the Trump administration: Maduro in exchange for staying in power.In the early fray of foreign interventions, evidence is largely circumstantial. But here the circumstances tell a powerful story. First the raid itself. To be sure, US forces – covert and conventional – have formidable superiority over Venezuela’s military apparatus, whose primary plan to combat US intervention has long been asymmetric rather than head-to-head war. Still, the absence of even minimal organized resistance to a raid that involved multiple low-flying, slow-moving aircraft traversing densely populated and otherwise heavily defended Venezuelan airspace for more than two hours invites speculation not only about prior knowledge of the attack by Venezuela’s military, but about stand-down orders for the bulk of the country’s armed forces.Then came Donald Trump’s press conference. That he flatly stated the US intended to take control of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves and“run” the countrywere striking enough claims. Perhaps most stunning, though, was Trump’s assertion that Maduro’s vice-president – Delcy Rodríguez – wouldremain in placeif she “does what we want”. Summarily sidelined after years of building a government-in-waiting and offering up their country to Trump on a platter was Venezuela’s expatriate opposition, led by the Nobel laureate María Corina Machado. In a bid to placate the US president, she had earlier dedicated her peace prize to Trump. It didn’t work: “She doesn’t have the respect” of the country,Trump said.More likely for Trump, Machado didn’t have the respect of the people who matter in a transition: military, police, institutions. Here Rodríguez’s own statements over the weekend are key. Though initially striking a defiant tone on Saturday, calling forMaduro’s immediate returnand proclaiming him Venezuela’sonly president, by Sunday she declared herdesire to cooperatewith the US. By Monday morning, after a ruling by Venezuela’s supreme court declaring Rodríguez next in line after Maduro’s kidnapping and unlikely return, and surrounded by Maduro’s erstwhile inner circle and newly installed national assembly, she took the oath of office tobecome Venezuela’s president.The speed and seamlessness of a post-Maduro transition, especially in the wake of a violent military assault, seems more than extraordinary. It seems calculated if one considers the incentives and agendas of various major actors. Key players in Maduro’s government had just one card to play against the Trump administration’s mounting pressure: only we can ensure stability in any transitional context. As defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López commands the nation’s military and its vast economic interests; as interior minister, Diosdado Cabello can keep police forces as well as sprawling paramilitary groups – colectivos – in check; as national assembly president, Delcy Rodríguez’s brother Jorge Rodríguez can deliver legislative authority; and as former head of PDVSA, Venezuela’s national oil company, Delcy Rodríguez can manage the oil sector directly.Given this array of institutional and extra-institutional control, the alternative – a full-scale regime change with the opposition installed in power through foreign military intervention – would result in chaos for the US to fend with and manage. As an occupying force, and despite widespread rebuke of Maduro and his government, US troops on the ground would provide ready targets to insurgent sectors of the military, police, colectivos and nationalist groups while an opposition long in exile and with little local standing moved to rebuild the entire state apparatus from scratch. Even if Trump believed in democracy promotion, which he has amply disavowed at home and abroad, a quagmire of his doing would alienate far too many in his Maga base.In exchange for continuity in power, Delcy Rodríguez and others ultimately provided Trump with two prizes: oil and Maduro. Venezuela’s vast reserves – the largest in the world – have long been in Trump’s sights, especially as his rejection of the climate crisis and renewable energy drives his embrace of fossil fuels. In fact, Maduro himself had offered Trump major concessions for US oil companies to return to Venezuela under favorable terms. Yet his offer came with a condition to stay in power. As the administration mounted an ever louder case labelling Maduro the head of a multinational “narco-terrorist” cartel, striking a deal with him became untenable. That opened the door to others in his milieu to make a move handing Trump not just oil concessions, but Maduro as well.Maduro proved an especially attractive, and necessary, prize for others in the Trump administration. Since taking office, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has sought a spectacular display of US military prowess in order to proclaim a supposed return of US might. Lethal strikes against alleged drug boats had some effect. But each day the vast force of 15,000 troops splayed across the Caribbean went unused was a day the US lost credibility and seemed taunted by Venezuela. A made-for-television commando raid offered an opportunity to grandstand the power of the US military. Secretary of state Marco Rubio claimed a prize of his own in the bargain: cutting off the last source of material support for Cuba’s socialist government, leaving it vulnerable as never before to Rubio’s dream of regime change on the island of his parents.Even with prior collusion between the US and Venezuela, the scenario ahead remains rife with risk for Caracas and Washington. Delcy Rodríguez’s government must now strike the most delicate of balances: following the Trump administration’s orders while holding aloft the banners of independence and even anti-imperialism that have been hallmarks of Venezuelan governments going back 26 years. Further, her government needs to thread this needle with an armada off Venezuela’s coast, resurrecting gunboat diplomacy for the 21st century. But it has been some time since Venezuela’s leaders paid more than lip service to ideology, so the bargain may not be difficult after all. Especially considering the US is under constraints of its own: despite the threat of additional strikes, Trump’s continuing resistance to a full-scale invasion means his own ability to force his will upon Caracas is not unlimited, giving Venezuela’s government some room to maneuver.For now, the smoke from Saturday’s assault has cleared from Caracas. But the machinations and intrigue behind this extraordinary moment in global politics remain darkly veiled. Through the fog, for the people that matter most – Venezuelans in and out of Venezuela – the tragedy of a nation in the throes of a seemingly endless crisis shows no signs of abating.Alejandro Velasco is an associate professor of history at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsVenezuelaOpinionUS attack on VenezuelaDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

America’s allies must find new ways to guarantee their own interestsThu 8 Jan 2026 13.50 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 15.58 ESTShareOccasionally, history generates smooth changes from one era to another. More commonly, such shifts occur only gradually and untidily. And sometimes, as the former Downing Street foreign policy adviser John Bewputs itin the New Statesman, history unfolds “in a series of flashes and bangs”. In Caracas last weekend, Donald Trump’s forces did this in spectacular style. In the process, the US brushed aside more of what remains of the so-called rules-based order with which it tried to shape the west after 1945.The capture of Venezuela’s former president Nicolás Maduro has precedents in US policy. But discerning a wider new pattern from the kidnapping is not easy, especially at this early stage. As our columnist Aditya Chakraborttyhas arguedthis week, the abduction can be seen as a assertion of American power, but also as little more than a chaotic asset grab.The US’s historic allies are still struggling to understand these changes. Even more important, they are strugglingto respondto them. Events such as those in Caracas raise stark questions of power. They embody the exact same reality that President Trump delights in celebrating. The US is a superpower. Allies, including the UK, are not. These questions are not going to disappear. The British government should not be condemned for each hesitation. But the hesitations cannot continue indefinitely. Britain needs a grown-up debate and a clear new course of international direction.In the Spectatorthis week, Peter Mandelson, the former ambassador to Washington, rubs Europe’s noses in it. “Trump has the means and the will,” he says, “and they [Europe and the UK] do not.” In Caracas,he writes, Mr Trump did more in a day than diplomacy has achieved in 10 years. The issue that faces us, says Lord Mandelson, is “Europe’s growing political impotence in the world”. The way to reclaim a seat at the table is not through “histrionics” or “fine words” but by the collective deployment of “hard power and hard cash”, he writes.Many will disagree with this sweeping dismissal of international rules and its insistence on transatlantic realpolitik, perhaps because of its author. But Lord Mandelson is not alone. Officials, advisers, academics and commentators of every stripe are also trying to make larger sense of the US’s transformation from necessary power to rogue state.The arguments of Prof Bew, adviser to four prime ministers from Boris Johnson to Sir Keir Starmer, are important here. In his view, Caracas marks three things. First, an increased US willingness to use executive power for swift military action. Second, a further assertion of an American mercantilism that insists on US control of oil, gas and minerals. Third, at least as promoted by the state department, a turn to a hemispheric approach, implying perhaps that China and Russia would be given freer rein in other regions.We can, should and do regret these emerging shifts. But, as Prof Bew says, while we mourn the disintegration of the rules-based order, and decry the mercantilism now dominating the west’s most dynamic economy, the old world and its assumptions are not coming back any time soon. Countries such as Britain have to decide what economic and technological adaptations we should make in this new world to protect our interests and our people. No one can pretend that is easy. But it is a debate that involves us all, with implications that will affect us all, and therefore one in which all must have a voice.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Earlier this week Liz Kendall, the science and technology secretary, described the proliferation of the digitally altered pictures, some of which are overtly sexualised or violent, as “unacceptable in decent society”. What happens next will depend on whether she and her colleagues are prepared to follow through on such remarks. The government’s generally enthusiastic approach to AI, and thegrowing role they see for it in public services, do not inspire confidence in their ability to confront such threats.In addition to the deluge of bikini images, the Internet Watch Foundation, a charity, has evidence that Grok Imagine (an AI tool that generates images and videos from prompts) has been used to create illegal child sexual abuse images. Yet while X says that itremoves such material, there is no sign of safeguards being tightened in response to bikini images that are cruel and violating even where they do not break the law.The inadequacy of this response is unsurprising, given Mr Musk’s track record and that ofhis industry. But it is still disturbing. Earlier this week xAI, the company that owns both X (formerly Twitter) and Grok, announced that it has raised $20bn in its latest funding round. On Wednesday Mr Musk posted on X that “Grok is on the side of the angels”.In the UK, attention is now focused on the media regulator,Ofcom, which is assessing the need for an investigation. If it wants to retain public confidence, Ofcom needs to inject more urgency into its approach, and explain the steps it is taking. The UK’s online safety law treats service disruption as a last resort, meaning officials have to follow a process before they can do anything as drastic as block a particular site.The danger is that such steps can be dragged out by platforms that do not want to comply. A worrying example are thefines imposed on pornography websitesthat have failed to meet age verification standards – and which have so far not been paid. What is Ofcom going to do in response?More regulation will be needed as technology develops, disrupting long-established behaviours and norms. The public, as well as law and technology experts, needs to grapple with the question of how far individual rights over our own faces and bodies should extend. In Denmark, there are plans togive people copyright over their own likeness, so that manipulating photographs of real people without consent would become illegal – even when the images are not intimate or sexualised.But a government that takes the safety and wellbeing of women and children seriously cannot wait for such debates to play out, and must respond quickly to events such as those of the past week. Gaps in the law relating to chatbots need to be filled now, not in an AI bill that could take years. The police and crime bill could be amended to achieve this. Prof Clare McGlynn’s proposal for abroader-brush approach to sexual offences– in place of the current pattern of separate initiatives to tackle each emerging threat – should also be looked at. Ministers as well as regulators need to show that users, not platforms, are their priority. Rules governing the online world must be democratically agreed and enforced – and not ignored by big tech.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

However, the fact that DNA testing indicates several points of genetic connection does not mean that “there is a viable case that home could be a lot of places”, unless you consider home and identity to be some sort of mathematical percentage game. Neither does it invalidate a sense of belonging to any one place. It does, however, confound the assumptions of those who insist on seeing identity in essentialist terms, either ethno-nationally or racially.What Muir’s being “settled but never quite cosy” more accurately identifies is the sense that for some of us, being born in Britain confers a sense of Britishness that can sometimes feel like an honorary status. Periodically, that feeling is exacerbated by immigration policy and by the intemperate debates it ignites. We are now experiencing one of those periods, as the hostility of rightwing populism is accompanied by arise in hate crime(Racial and religious hate crime on UK public transport is growing, data shows, 2 January). Muir is therefore right to call for a more positive “conversation” before many more become like the man who “felt, for the first time, the need to watch his back”.Paul McGilchristCromer, NorfolkHaving grown up knowing that my ancestors were a mixed bunch, I was delighted to find that I and my siblings have many nationalities in our family history. I’m white with, so far, 10 different parts of the world I can apparently call home. I’m 27% English, 53% Irish (Eire) and the rest show the travels through Europe by my Roma ancestry.My DNA shows signs of travel and immigration. Many people on our little island will have the same or similar. I’ve a feeling if we all chose a different “home” to go to there wouldn’t be many people left to run the ship.Elizabeth WhitakerGiffnock,GlasgowAs Hugh Muir says, telling people to “go home” is nonsense. I was born in Africa, in a self-governing British colony. My parents were English speaking white South Africans. I lived in South Africa for a while as an adult but migrated to Australia in the 1980s to prevent my son being conscripted by the South African government to fight for apartheid in the townships.My DNA test came back with the expected English, Scottish, and German ancestry. There was also Dutch and a touch of African DNA.So I am sometimes asked where I am from. My accent can be hard to place. What should I say?Dr Meg PerkinsHastings Point, New South WalesHugh Muir’s article struck a strange chord with me. As middle-aged white man with no strong regional accent, I would attract no attention from the “go home” crew in England. Yet I was born in Zambia, have lived in Africa, Europe, North America and Asia, and hold British, Canadian and Swiss citizenship. When people ask where I am from, I genuinely struggle to answer. If told to “go home”, I would be equally bemused.I am not comparing my situation with his. I do not have to endure the racism that he and so many others do. I simply echo the incoherence of the simplistic concept of “home” and reinforce the brutal point that it is really only skin colour that matters to the casual xenophobe.David HartRenens, SwitzerlandHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This was not a misunderstanding; it was a founding act. Since then, the Islamic republic has consistently used violence, proxies and coercion to attack US interests while denying direct responsibility.The deadliest example came in Lebanon in 1983, when Iran-backedHezbollahcarried out the bombing of the US marine barracks in Beirut, killing 241 American service members, followed by the bombing of the US embassy that killed 17 Americans. US courts and intelligence agencies have repeatedly concluded that Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps helped plan, fund and train those operations.This pattern continued. In 1996, the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia killed 19 US Air Force personnel; US indictments and investigations linked the attack to Iran-backed Hezbollah al-Hijaz. After 2003, Iran supplied militias in Iraq with explosively formed penetrators and training. According toUS militaryassessments, these Iranian-backed weapons and groups were responsible for the deaths of at least 500 American soldiers during the Iraq war.These are not “myths originating from Israel” or “fiction authored in Tel Aviv”. They are findings of US courts, bipartisan administrations and international reporting. Iran’s leaders cannot credibly claim restraint while arming Hezbollah, Hamas and militias across Iraq, Syria and Yemen – groups explicitly committed to attacking the US and its allies.Real diplomacy requires honesty. A government that has spent decades exporting violence against civilians and soldiers alike cannot demand trust while refusing accountability. If Iran truly seeks peace with the west, the first step is not rhetoric about respect, but a clear break with terror, proxies, and the ideology that has made hostility to the United States a pillar of the regime itself.Name and address suppliedExplore more on these topicsIranUS foreign policyHezbollahMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpUS militarylettersShareReuse this content"

I am one, here on a skilled worker visa. The Labour government’s “A fairer pathway to settlement” proposal is performative policymaking, arising from troubling nationalist, anti-immigrant sentiment. It is designed to make visa-holding migrant workers’ lives more cumbersome and expensive, delaying time to indefinite leave to remain as well as introducing unnecessary qualification criteria, which then impair integration.Although we cannot vote for the government, visa-holding migrant workers are a constituency whose needs and contributions matter. We are now being used to appease the right, allowing theLabourgovernment to create a (false) picture that they are substantively addressing migration challenges. In other words, we are treated as a convenient political football.The significant effects of “earned settlement” proposals on work-visa holders has been largely overlooked. I urge UK settled residents, and citizens in particular, to respond thoughtfully to thegovernment’s consultation survey, which is open until 12 February, advocating for your visa-holding migrant worker neighbours, friends and colleagues. We are teaching your children, caring for your relatives, ensuring clean hospitals, providing medical care, bringing world-class research to your universities, and more.The daily functioning of key sectors depends on our labour alongside the labour of UK nationals and settled residents. Britain needs an immigration policy that meets both labour market needs and the UK’s humanitarian obligations. Do not be fooled: the current proposal under consultation does neither.Rev Dr Rebekah E SimsLancasterYou recently reported on research by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) showing that the number of people who believe one must be born in the UK to be truly British has nearly doubled – from 19% in 2023 to 36% by late 2025 – raising serious concerns about how national identity is being reframed in public debate (Number of people who say Britons must be ‘born British’ is rising, study shows, 29 December).As a British citizen married to a non-UK spouse, these shifting attitudes strike deeply at the reality of our everyday lives. My wife and I returned to the UK in 2021, complied fully with the spouse visa route and were due to apply for indefinite leave to remain this year. We have shouldered many thousands of pounds in visa fees and NHS surcharges in good faith, on the understanding that after a defined period we would secure permanence and stability for our family.Instead, government proposals now riskextending the pathway to settlementby another five years and imposing earnings tests that are impossible for full-time caregivers to meet. For families with British children, this means prolonged years of uncertainty and cost, with the very prospect of belonging continually moved further away.When too many in society begin to equate “Britishness” with birthplace or ancestry rather than shared values and lived commitment, policies that undermine legal residents are all too easily normalised.Stability, dignity and trust in public institutions matter to families like mine. We are not abstract statistics; we are neighbours, workers and parents trying to build a life here. Treating us as less worthy of permanence sows fear, harms cohesion and betrays the inclusive notion of British identity most people still say they believe in.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Well, not exactly. Just when Arsenal looked ready to lay down a real marker for their title aspirations, a rejuvenated Liverpool side that has been through the wringer since they werecrowned champions last seasonshowed the Gunners remain fallible.It could have been even worse for Mikel Arteta’s side ifLiverpoolhad been awarded one of two potential penalties or if Conor Bradley’s brilliant chip had not struck the crossbar in the first half.‘He didn’t realise’: Arteta defends Martinelli over Bradley incidentRead moreThe Liverpool defender’s night ended with him departing on a stretcher after a frustrated Gabriel Martinelli tried to push him off the pitch asArsenalchased a winning goal in injury time. The Brazilian was extremely fortunate to escape a red card for his actions with Bradley left in agony after twisting his knee.Arne Slot gave Martinelli the benefit of the doubt afterwards but the Liverpool head coach was justifiably delighted with the way his much-maligned defence coped with Arsenal’s threat. But the fact that the hosts didn’t even manage a shot on target in the second half until a Gabriel Jesus header in injury time is of concern for Arteta as Viktor Gyökeres put in another ineffective display up front.They may be six points clear of Manchester City and Aston Villa at the top of the table but Arsenal seem unlikely to do things the easy way if they are to end their 22-year wait to be crowned champions.Arteta had called on the Arsenal supporters to “make the difference” as they attempted totake advantage of CityandVilla’s slip-upson Wednesday night. Even the torrential rain before kick-off caused by Storm Goretti could dampen the feeling of optimism as the home fans held up a mosaic of red and white plastic bags when the teams emerged. Yet a dogged Liverpool side who were without a recognised striker were in no mood to roll over.Slot’s solution to the continued absence of the injured Hugo Ekitiké was to select Mr Versatile Dominik Szoboszlai as a false 9 with Florian Wirtz in support. It didn’t take Bukayo Saka very long to realise that he had the beating of Milos Kerkez, who was perhaps a surprise selection at left-back ahead of the more experienced Andy Robertson. One mesmerising run that left the Hungary defender and Alexis Mac Allister in his slipstream should have resulted in the opening goal but Martín Zubimendi was just the wrong side of his cutback. Saka then tried his luck from just outside the area with a shot that was parried away by Alisson.Liverpool slowly began to establish a foothold in midfield and it was the visitors who came closest to breaking the deadlock in the first half after an uncharacteristic mistake from William Saliba that was more down to being too casual than any nerves.The France defender had been alert to the danger when Bradley tried to play in Jeremie Frimpong but his back pass to David Raya took the goalkeeper by surprise and he could only play the ball straight into Bradley’s path. His chip looked destined for the empty net but struck the crossbar and Cody Gakpo’s follow-up was blocked.View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka (right) had a bright first half but faded as Arsenal’s frustration grew.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe half’s moment of controversy arrived 10 minutes before the break when Frimpong went down awkwardly under pressure from Piero Hincapié in the area, although it was hard to tell if there was any significant contact. He stayed down as play continued, with Leandro Trossard seeing his shot deflected wide at the other end. Liverpool’s players immediately surrounded the referee Anthony Taylor, with Declan Rice and Virgil van Dijk exchanging some choice words.The visiting supporters had reason to feel hard done by again at the start of the second half when Wirtz jinked his way past three players into the area and was about to shoot when Trossard intervened with a clumsy challenge that could easily have resulted in a penalty. Luckily for Arsenal, Taylor and the video assistant referee felt otherwise.Return of the Emirates Groan: Arsenal fans restless on night of stalemate with Liverpool | Jonathan LiewRead moreDespite the increased urgency in the stands, the hosts were struggling to match the intensity thatblew Villa away in the second halfof their last home fixture with four goals. There were huge groans when Zubimendi got in the way of a Trossard cross meant for Saka before Hincapié was forced off with an injury.Szoboszlai was given an opportunity toreplicate his free-kickfrom Liverpool’s win against Arsenal back in August but this time his effort sailed high and wide to much derision, even if he was much closer with another effort eight minutes from full-time.It was Liverpool who looked more likely to break the deadlock as Frimpong broke free but could not pick out the waiting Wirtz.The arrival of Gabriel Jesus from the bench for the ineffective Gyökeres, who has now gone 11 games without scoring from open play, was greeted with cheers from the home supporters desperate for their side to find a winner.The closest they came was when Gabriel Magalhães headed wide from a corner with the last action of the match that would have gone a long way to settling Arsenal’s nerves.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Australia custard-pied their way to a victory total of 160, narrowly avoiding falling pianos, dangling off giant clocktowers along the way.England’s Ashes humbling was more a series of letdowns than ‘series of our lives’ | Ali MartinRead moreIt felt fitting too that the endgame should revolve aroundEngland’s tried and trusted short-and-wide masterplan, a series that will remain fixed in the mind as an endless looping meme of an English seamer being square-cut to some distant crowing boundary.In the middle of this Stokes spent the day wedged in at first slip,nursing his newly acquired groin injury, a cricketer who is by this stage basically a hat, a collection of splints nailed together and a grimace. Again, it is no surprise that Stokes should be grimacing, stricken and wincing with agony. As a rule, unless specifically stated otherwise it should be assumed Stokes isalwaysgrimacing, stricken and wincing with agony.Cricket demands a daylong public persona. Stokes has his own version down pat, a kind of performative doom state, a showmanship of pain, like the hero in a western holding his chest and staggering backwards slowly through the saloon doors, but doing it for six hours straight from mid-morning to the afternoon shadows.Australia will do this to you. The Adelaide Advertiser ran an article midway through the third Test about the “captaincy killer” tradition of an Ashes tour, sniffing out blood, meltdown, collapse.Positives, then: even in abject defeat, and England really have been feeble on this tour, ground into the dust by a depleted Australia, Stokes has not disintegrated. It has been a gruelling six weeks in new ways too. The first terminally online Ashes. The first 24-hour content tour. Seventeen days of proper cricket across 67 days of being in Australia, all of it consumed with a ceaseless rolling babble, screen rot and brain chatter, urgent un-happenings, headline non-events.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes led England out on the final day in Sydney, ‘grimacing, stricken and wincing with agony’.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesStokes talked at one point about the urge to throw his phone in a river. Well, why not? This should be a consideration on future tours. England seemed totally unprepared for this refined form of exhaustion, brutalised by the experience of simply existing in Australia.But then, nobody has seemed ready for anything here, at an Ashes series so rushed and sloppy you half-expected to look down and notice both teams have taken to the field with their pyjama trousers sticking out of the hem of their whites.At the end of which some things are clear.Bazball is over. It’s goodbye to all that. The England and Wales Cricket Board’s three-year plastic branding exercise is done. Danger has been run towards. Transcendent game states have been attained and then misplaced. The wellness brand optics, jawline, tattoos, man-feelings, feet up on the balcony rail … it all feels not just dated, but terminally obnoxious.A vibe is, in the end, just a vibe. And this was a chimera, a rebadge, the snarl of a manufactured Japanese punk band. It worked for a while, because the talent and the lone founding idea were both real.It was fun for a while. We’ll always have the run chases, the creative captaincy, propped up by some all-time cricketers in their final flush. Bazball will always live in our minds and hearts. Oh, for a few years it will be considered passé and ridiculous. People will laugh about golf obsession, saving cricket and Ben Duckett discussing disruptive vibe energy. But we had nothing to do with those things and still loved Bazball. It’s got to come back some day. We can just hope it will be in our lifetimes.View image in fullscreenAustralia’s players enjoy a moment with the Ashes crystal trophy after condemning the final moments of Bazball to the past.Photograph: MB Media/Getty ImagesAnd yes, about half of that is probably true. But the only key element right now is that Stokes wants to stay, and that he will stay. For a starthe has explicitly tied himself to Brendon McCullum, out of loyalty and perhaps also politicking.McCullum should still go now. Not only has the planning been sloppy, his one superpower, taking away the pressure, demonstrably failed in Perth and Brisbane. McCullum may be granted a stay, depending on his willingness to work with more structure around him. But is this even desirable? Is Baz with brains no longer Baz at all? Why would you ask the guy whose authentic self is never learning, never looking around, to learn and look around?Of all the people in the sniper sights, Rob Key looks most vulnerable.Managing directors have to actually manage and direct. Too many details have been glossed. England’s Test, white-ball, Lions and Under-19 teams are all underachieving in a fug of cliquishness and blurred lines. Sacking the person at the top rarely solves much. The real failings are deeply structural. But this is another massive problem in itself. Someone has to be held to account here. There have to be consequences. English cricket, and indeed England itself, must at least try to be something else.Stokes is also not the problem here. The captaincy has been a little flat, hostage to some pretty wild bowling, but his playing returns are good. Stokes is arguably England’s best bowler now, with 42 Test wickets at 24 since December 2024. Aged 34, his batting has gone a little. His 10 innings in Australia include scores of 6, 2, 2, 5, 0, 1, five dismissals to the toe-singeing pace of Mitchell Starc. Maybe Stokes is actually Chris Woakes these days.But none of the obvious failures belongs to him. No real practice games. Catch your first ever pink ball in a Test match. Cricket as a tech bro-style life hack, all short-cuts and eat-this-one-super-food voodoo. This is on McCullum and Key.There are two problems for Stokes 2.0. Sporting eras do just run out of road. And no England captain has ever embodied so profoundly a complete way of playing, being, speaking. Any incoming coach or executive will have to refine and complement this. Stokes has also seemed a bit disturbed at times. He has blinked at key points in this tour, diverged in the messaging, seemed on the verge of checking out of his own project.Ollie Pope, for example, has reconfigured his entire sporting identity into some kind of pressure-shifting run-at-the-danger merchant, been told this is the basis for selection; then been dropped as Stokes bats like the skipper of some snow-bound ghost ship, icicles dripping from his beard, feet rooted.View image in fullscreenOne thing is clear after this Ashes, Bazball is dead, and there should be consequences for the likes of Rob Key (left) and Brendon McCullum.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesThe mid-tour talk of “weak men” was perhaps an attempt to drip some kind of emergency mid-season mastic into an environment that had become flabby and unchallenging. But these are the parts English cricket will give him to work with, the pathway kids.And it is here that Stokes faces his biggest issue. He wants to build again, to create something of substance. The problem is the England team represent nothing. England cricket has no content. It reflects no culture, expresses no vision other than high-performance gloss and TV rights money. This is clearer than ever in Australia, where cricket really is the national summer sport.Whereas England cricket has long since been Thatchered, emptied out, atomised. It’s a private party, a silent disco for a small and privileged minority. The England team are at least expressing some truth, that the sport exists most vividly in private schools and private fields. We are the hollow men. We are the weak men. We are probably from Cranleigh, Weybridge and Clapham High Street.We can have a root-and-branch review now. But what roots, what branches? Even the month of August has been sold off. The Overton window of what the ECB can do to improve its sport is increasingly small.The Ashes will continue to revolve in its own pristine space. People still come to the grounds and tune in to the TV broadcasts in record numbers. There are useful things the ECB could do. Market the product properly. Re-engage with county cricket, because in the end this is it, this is what you have.English cricket still has large resources. It is time to maintain, to look after the house, to react to the lessons in its own reports into elitism and alienation. But for all the heat and noise and colour this is a battle that feels in many ways like it has already been lost.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamCricketAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Judgment was due to come in Jeddah but it will be put off for another day at least, and instead of the sack there may be a medal waiting at the end of a month spent on edge after Real defeated Atlético 2-1. Goals from Fede Valverde and Rodrygo set up another Super Cup meeting with Barcelona on Sunday night, opportunity and obligation in one.On a night when Madrid scored after 77 seconds, Atlético’s last opportunity to get a result they probably deserved and force a penalty shootout slipped agonisingly away with only 10 more seconds remaining. Julián Alvarez had it, Antoine Griezmann almost did, but, in at last, a shot from the former just evaded the latter. As the ball bounced past the post, it took Atlético’s hopes with it.Xabi Alonso walking thin line at Madrid even with dressing room backingRead moreAgain, an encounter with their neighbours was hard to take and not that easy to explain either. That was Atlético’s 22nd shot, but they had trailed from the beginning when Gonzalo García, a 21-year-old replacement for Kylian Mbappé, chested down to Jude Bellingham inside the first minute. Conor Gallagher challenged him and, although there didn’t seem to be much in it, Real were handed the free-kick from which Valverde belted in the opener.From 25 yards and with a poorly constructed three-man wall standing before him, Valverde send a superb shot in a straight, rising arrow past Alex Sørloth and into the net. It wasn’t right in the corner, but with that side of the goal unprotected, it was far enough away for Jan Oblak, occupying the other side, to be unable to get more than a slight touch upon it.Real had taken the lead but Atlético took control. Perhaps because Real had taken the lead. One shot had been enough, and for a while it was all Real had; not that Atlético’s possession immediately yielded opportunities. Slowly, though, they were increasing the pressure, Real dropping ever deeper. Álex Baena almost released Alvarez, Sørloth’s effort went over, Alvarez had a shot blocked and Giuliano slipped as he raced into the area going at full, lung-busting pelt which often appears to be the only speed he can go at.Only García was really offering a way out, a constantly reliable recipient of the long ball. But then, just before the half hour, from an Atlético corner that led to a blocked shot from Marcos Llorente, Real were suddenly away and should have doubled their lead. Álvaro Carreras started the charge before Rodrygo took over, ran into the Atlético area, cut inside, sending the defender sliding past and out of shot, but then, clear now, shot weakly at Oblak. A moment later, Vinícius headed way over the bar from close range.View image in fullscreenFede Valverde sent Real Madrid on their way with a goal in the second minute.Photograph: Antonio Villalba/Real Madrid/Getty ImagesAtlético kept on, Real struggling to resist – especially on the left, where Carreras was often alone against the dynamism of Llorente and Giuliano. Occasionally moves broke down with the imprecision of Alvarez, a tad slow mentally, and Baena combined incisive passes with imprecise ones. But Atlético’s opportunities did become clearer. On 31 minutes Thibaut Courtois saved from Baena, then he made a superb save from a Sørloth header at the near post. A moment later, Sørloth somehow headed over from five yards, if that. Llorente and Giuliano had made it again.The lead could have come then and really should have soon after when Baena took the ball from Eduardo Camavinga, dribbled into the area, away from Valverde and Aurélien Tchouaméni. Having made himself space, the toe-end shot was saved by Courtois. The first rebound came to Alvarez, whose shot was blocked by Antonio Rüdiger – possibly with an arm, seen at full speed, but no slower view followed – and the second to Gallagher. His shot skewed wide. It was also the last thing he did, withdrawn at half-time. Real had faced 10 shots but made it there still holding the lead.And so it started again, everyone soon settling into the same pattern, Rüdiger intervening early. Or so it seemed. A sharp pass from Valverde was taken in his stride by Rodrygo, who escaped Robin Le Normand and slipped through the middle to steer a neat finish past Oblak. This was done, or so that seemed too. Because almost immediately a familiar path this time did bear fruit. Giuliano and Llorente combined to go past Vinícius, who didn’t do a huge amount to go with them. Giuliano clipped up the cross to the far post, where Sørloth headed in. There was an hour to go and the game was back on.It was an indication of the damage being done that briefly Alonso moved Bellingham across to protect the left and then with 20 minutes left, was obliged to restructure his defence entirely, Rüdiger and Raúl Asencio were both forced off. Tchouaméni moved back, Carreras moved across to join him at centre-back and the two men introduced, Fran García and Ferland Mendy, became double left-backs. Vinícius was withdrawn, his 16th Madrid game in a row going by without a goal. On the touchline Simeone, with whom words had been exchanged repeatedly, gestured for him to listen to the supporters who were whistling the Brazilian, another brief confrontation flaring up and Alonso later censoring his counterpart’s behaviour.Tiredness told. This was about holding on, seeing out the clock. The good news for Real was that time was passing and Atlético were not creating much now. In fact, Real had the best opportunity, Rodrygo accepting a gift inside the area only to be denied by Oblak, until Atlético raised themselves for one last effort despite the exhaustion. Courtois saved an overhead kick from Griezmann. Llorente, who must have four lungs, curled just wide. And Tchouaméni produced a sensational interception to prevent the Frenchman getting the equaliser, until on 95min 33sec Atlético’s moment came and then went again. Resisting, Real’s moment awaits still.Explore more on these topicsFootballAtlético MadridReal MadridEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The organisation will also hold a protest at the home match against Fulham on 1 February to make their voices heard at Old Trafford.The group wants the removal of the Glazer family and Ratcliffe from the club. Concerns were also expressed in relation to the work of the chief executive, Omar Berrada, and the director of football, Jason Wilcox, in the aftermath of Ruben Amorim’s sacking, which will lead to an interim replacement.“After lurching from one disaster to another, Ratcliffe comes across as an incompetent clown turning the club into a circus. Instead of best in class we’re a laughing stock,” the 1958 said. “It has been an extraordinary and deeply troubling few days at Manchester United.

Off it, the chaos is even worse.”Solskjær would be a huge risk for Manchester United’s beleaguered hierarchy | Jamie JacksonRead moreAmorim wasdismissed on Mondayafter 14 months amid tensions with Wilcox over tactics, resulting in the former United player Darren Fletcher taking charge at Burnley.

They are a vociferous supporters group for whom ticket prices and the treatment of fans by the club are key frustrations.“Manchester United is 150 years old. That proud history, built by generations of supporters, must be protected. If we do not act now, the club we pass on will be unrecognisable, stripped of its culture, its soul and its people.

Although the Yorkshire club lost that final to Bayern Munich, Yorath was an influential, combative, mainstay of the 1974 first division champions.Terry Yorath obituaryRead moreA player who initially struggled to break into Revie’s first XI saw his intelligence and professionalism win new friends at Coventry, Tottenham and Vancouver Whitecaps before becoming player-coach atBradfordCity. Yorath would later juggle club management at Bradford and then Swansea with managing Wales.He was at Bradford in 1985 on the day of theValley Parade firethat resulted in the death of 56 fans and left a further 270 injured. Yorath himself required treatment after being forced to jump from a window after bravely evacuating supporters from a club bar.As a player he won 59 caps for Wales, 42 as captain and, as manager, he guided the principality to the verge of qualification for the 1994 World Cup finals before a 2-1 defeat to Romania dashed that dream.View image in fullscreenYorath pictured with Coventry City in 1978.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyTwo years earlier Yorath’s life had changed irrevocably when his 15-year-old son Daniel collapsed and died while they were playing football in the back garden of their Yorkshire home. It emerged that Daniel had the genetic heart condition hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Yorath also had two daughters, the BBC sports presenter Gabby, and Louise as well as another son, Jordan. On Wednesday night Gabby Logan was presenting Match of the Day but left the studio part way through the programme due to “a family emergency”. On Thursday morning she and her siblings released a statement about their father’s passing.“To most he was a revered footballing hero but to us he was Dad; a quiet kind and gentle man. Our hearts are broken but we take comfort knowing that he will be reunited with our brother, Daniel.”Leeds said they were “devastated” to learn of Yorath’s death. “Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Terry’s family, friends and former team-mates at this incredibly sad time,” a club statement read.Yorath’s impact on Welsh football was “immeasurable”, said the Wales manager, Craig Bellamy. “The impact Terry Yorath had on Welsh football is immeasurable,” Bellamy said on the Football Association of Wales’ X account. “Terry epitomised everything it means to represent Cymru as a player, and watching the 1994 World Cup qualifying campaign with him as manager was the first time I experienced genuine belief that our country could qualify for a major tournament. As a country, we have so much to thank Terry for what he did.”Ashley Williams, who captained Wales at Euro 2016, said: “He’s such an icon in Welsh football. A footballing hero, such a big personality in Welsh football. It’s a huge loss. He’s one of those massive names you hear about when you get selected for Wales. He’s at the top of that list and you know you’ve got to live up to what he achieved.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.After losing the Wales job – a decision that upset and angered many – Yorath had stints in charge of Cardiff, Sheffield Wednesday and Margate either side of a two-year interlude in Beirut as the manager of Lebanon, overseeing a substantial improvement in the team’s fortunes between 1995-97.At the time Lebanon was emerging from a 15-year civil war and it seemed that Yorath had found sanctuary in a country that understood human loss. In a 1996 interview with Robert Fisk, Yorath spoke movingly of his enduring grief. He revealed that the football he and Daniel had been playing with four years earlier had never been moved from the spot where it had dropped in the back garden of the family home when his son collapsed. “It’s still there,” he said.During this period Yorath’s wife, Christine, remained in England and, after a separation, they divorced in 2007. During an interview with BBC Radio Wales in 2017 Yorath acknowledged he “didn’t really cope” with Daniel’s death. “I started drinking more,” he said. It echoed his reflection in an Observer interview in 2005: “Rather than bring us together, Daniel’s death has driven the family apart,” said Yorath. “I haven’t achieved what I could have since that afternoon.”He had, though, already hit heights other could only dream of touching. “Sad news,” reflected Yorath’s former Wales team-mate Mickey Thomas. “A brilliant captain and player.” The former Bradford striker Dean Windass spoke for many who had crossed paths with Yorath, describing him as a “great man and a gentleman”.Explore more on these topicsFootballWalesLeeds UnitedBradfordTottenham HotspurCoventry CitynewsShareReuse this content"

Except the windshield bore a small shattered star, delicate and sharp, like a snowflake pressed into glass. Cold Minnesota air leaked through the fracture, settling over the still body inside. The car became a sealed room, a thin shell holding death in place, surroundedby the stuffed animalsof the woman’s children.In the street, witnesses screamed. Not in words, but in sounds that come before language, as reality breaks faster than thought.Shock and outrage at scene of Minneapolis ICE shooting: ‘This is just sad’Read moreOn Wednesday morning, during an immigration enforcement operation tied to the Trump administration’s expanded crackdown, a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officershot and killed the driver. Bystander videoshows ICE agentsapproaching the stopped SUV, ordering the woman to open the door and grabbing the handle. As the vehicle began to roll forward, an officer standing in front of it fired at least two shots at close range as the SUV continued on and crashed into parked cars.Federal officials quickly described the killing as self-defense. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey called the incident recklessand demandedthat ICE “get the fuck out of Minneapolis”.The following night, only 15 minutes away, theMinnesota Timberwolvesare scheduled to play the Cleveland Cavaliers.That is the obscenity at the center of this moment. That the machinery of American life – professional sports included – simply lurches forward while a federal agency has just shot a woman dead in a residential neighborhood. The lights can come on at Target Center. The music can play. The crowd can cheer. And this can all be treated as background noise.What kind of country does that? If the goal is to force attention from those with the power to change conditions, the answer is not another statement or vigil. It is leverage. And in modern America, leverage means money. The most effective response available is for the Timberwolves to refuse to play.Not after investigations conclude. Not after the news cycle moves on. Now.Minnesota is not a war zone. It is a US city where people are expected to live ordinary lives. When violence is inflicted by the state in such places, civic institutions should not behave as if nothing has happened. Yes, a boycott would disrupt TV schedules and cost the league, teams and advertisers millions. That is precisely the point. Systems change only when their uninterrupted flow is challenged.The NBA has been here before. In 2020, after police shot Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the Milwaukee Bucksrefused to take the court for a first-round playoff gameagainst Orlando. The decision halted the league. It did more than any carefully worded press release ever could, because it forced a confrontation with economic reality. Athlete labor has power because the system depends on it. The circumstances are different now, but the urgency is not diminished.View image in fullscreenSterling Brown and George Hill were part of the Bucks team that took action after the shooting of Jacob Blake.Photograph: Jesse D Garrabrant/NBAE/Getty ImagesAmericans know the script. After state violence, the first instruction is always patience. Wait for the facts. Trust the investigation. By the time conclusions arrive – if they arrive at all – the moment has passed, and another civilian remains dead. Wednesday’s killing has followed that pattern exactly. Federal officials asserted the necessity of lethal force. Local leaders and witnesses disputed it. Video emerged and was immediately fractured into competing interpretations.What makes the uncertainty more corrosive is that it collides with the government’s own stated standards. A senior Department of Homeland Security officialtold NBC Newsthat ICE officers are trained never to approach vehicles from the front, instead using a 90-degree “tactical L” position. Officers are also instructed not to fire at moving vehicles – and to use lethal force only when there is an immediate risk of serious injury or death. Those facts will be debated for months, perhaps years. That is the environment in which federal power now operates inside American cities.Hannah Arendt warned that the most dangerous violence is not the kind that shocks the conscience, but the kind that becomes ordinary. When killing is treated as procedure, outrage has nowhere to go. A woman is shot dead in the morning, and by nightfall, tipoff arrives. The crowd cheers. Life goes on.This is what happens when armed federal agencies conduct operations in densely populated neighborhoods with minimal local oversight. Public acceptance is demanded immediately, while accountability is indefinitely deferred. Whether this shooting is ultimately ruled justified does not resolve the deeper question: what kind of civic life is possible when lethal federal enforcement becomes routine?The early response revealed more than officials likely intended. Elon Muskdeclared on Xthat the woman had tried to run people over. It was a definitive claim, delivered with the confidence of authority. Less than an hour later, Musk’s own AI system, Grok,publicly contradicted him, stating that the available video did not clearly support the use of lethal force under established standards. This is how state violence is now processed: flattened into competing claims, stripped of consequence, normalized through repetition.What cannot be disputed is the scale of the federal presence. The Department of Homeland Security hasdescribed its current Minnesota operationas the largest of its kind. Thousands of federal officers have been deployed into neighborhoods. Masked agents operate in public streets asleaders warnthat their presence is producing chaos and fear.This is the reality in which professional sports franchises continue to operate.NBA teams often present themselves as apolitical spaces, places of escape. That separation has never been real. Teams are civic institutions whether they acknowledge it or not. Their arenas are public spaces. Every game begins with a patriotic ritual, players and fans standing together to pledge allegiance. Politics cannot be removed from a spectacle that opens with an oath to the nation.The hypocrisy of national leadership only sharpens the moment. Donald Trump has repeatedly cast himself asa defender of protesters abroad, threatening intervention when foreign governments violently suppress dissent. Yet his administration has unleashed federal enforcement at home that leaves civilians dead, followed by demands for patience. Trump immediatelyposted in support of ICE, calling the woman “very disorderly” and claiming she “ran over” an officer. The confidence was total. The evidence remains contested.Calls for athletes to “stay out of it” misunderstand both history and power. Refusing to play would be a profoundly patriotic act. It would declare that federal violence in the city a team calls home will be met with a multi-million-dollar protest that interrupts the flow of capital. That athlete labor will not be separated from the communities that sustain it. That basketball does not float above the city but lives inside it.The Timberwolves have an opportunity to show that the stand taken in 2020 was not branding. That principles still exist beneath the sponsorships. That no game matters more than the lives outside the arena. If they play on, they send a message too – that this is just another night, another body, another thing to move past. That may be the easiest path. It is not the moral one.Explore more on these topicsMinnesota TimberwolvesNBAICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)BasketballUS sportsMinneapolisDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

She is most adept in the holding midfield role.Coffey was not named in the US’s 26-player squad on Thursday for a training camp in California this month, and that is understood to be related to her being given permission to travel to England.The move would be a blow to the NWSL, with another of its biggest stars leaving, and specifically another key player for the US national side. It would follow high-profile exits forAlyssa ThompsonandNaomi Girma, who were snapped up by Chelsea last year, and the USA right-back Emily Fox is in good form for Arsenal aftermoving in January 2024from North Carolina Courage.City are six points clear at the top of the WSL at the halfway stage in a season that resumes this weekend after the winter break.Brightonon Thursday signed the midfielder Olaug Tvedten from the Norwegian clubVålerenga. Brighton’s head coach, Dario Vidosic, described Tvedten as “a technical goalscoring midfielder with real quality”.Leicesterconfirmed the signing of the experienced full-backAshleigh Neville, who wasTottenham’s longest-serving player, andBristol Cityannounced their acquisition of the England wingerKatie RobinsonfromAston Villa.

These include an agreement to help fund road improvements, allied to a plan to encourage supporters driving to matches to park further from the ground.The approval ends a wait that began when detailed final plans were submitted in July and will delight the 26,000 fans on the club’s waiting list for season tickets. It will also afford Elland Road Uefa category four status, enabling Leeds to bid to host tournament matches.The rebuild will begin with the expansion of the John Charles – or West – Stand, from 8,000 seats to 17,750 thanks to the construction of a new upper tier. Preliminary work is due to start shortly and major construction will get under way at the end of this season.Paraag Marathe, the Leeds chair, has confirmed the stadium will remain operational throughout a project that will involve the expansion of the Don Revie – or North – Stand from its 10,414 capacity to a maximum of 15,300. “We are delighted to have secured planning permission for the expansion of Elland Road stadium,” said Marathe. “This is a historic day forLeeds United. As custodians of this great club we are committed to its long-term success and today’s decision supports our ambition to establish Leeds in the Premier League and continue progressing over the years to come.”Explore more on these topicsLeeds UnitedLeedsnewsShareReuse this content"

It suggests the college wants to reverse the painfully secured advances in social mobility. And my worry would be they are doing this so that others may follow. Hence the need to raise voices against this now.”Campbell is a supporter ofthe 93% Club, a network representing the UK’s state-educated students. The club’s chief executive, Sophie Pender, said its Trinity Hall members would be withdrawing alumni-funding donations until the policy was reversed, telling the college that its decision was “immoral and dangerous”.Pender said: “Your state-educated alumni are watching now; please don’t set this precedent. It’s not too late to course correct, and we will respect you all the more for it.”Under the policy adopted at the end of last year, Trinity Hall would approach independent schools to encourage applications in courses including languages, music, art history, classics and theology, to improve the “quality” of recruits. Most of the schools are in the south of England and charge upwards of £25,000 a year.The Sutton Trust, a charity that aims to boost UK social mobility through education, called for the policy to be reversed and said it was engaging with the university on the issue.Nick Harrison, the trust’s chief executive, said: “State-educated pupils should absolutely not be overlooked for recruitment to any university courses. We’ve previously found that those from private schools are already overrepresented on a wide range of courses, despite representing only 7% of the population. This already limits opportunities for those with similar abilities from state schools.“Gaining a degree remains one of the surest routes to social mobility, yet pupils eligible for free school meals are only around half as likely to go to university as their better-off peers. And persistent access gaps remain at the most selective institutions.”Trinity Hall alumni contacted the Guardian and took to social media to express their dismay at the policy. Several said they had contacted the college to register objections, and in some cases that they would refuse any fundraising appeals while the policy remained in place.One said: “This is clearly an attempt to recruit more wealthy students to boost Trinity Hall’s base of alumni with deep pockets. I am so deeply disappointed in my former college for implementing such a crude policy.”Mary Hockaday, the master of Trinity Hall, responded to alumni on Thursday evening, telling them that the media coverage was “very misleading”.Hockaday said in an email: “To be clear, there has been no change to our admissions policy or our commitment to widening participation, and we continue to work very hard to support and attract students from disadvantaged backgrounds.“We propose to add some schools to our existing recruitment email lists to ensure we receive applications from talented students from all backgrounds. This activity does not affect our overall admissions policy.”Jess Staufenberg, a co-founder of thePrivate Education Policy Forum, a thinktank that studies independent schools, said there was no evidence that private schools needed any encouragement to apply to Cambridge.If you went to state school, do you ever feel British life is rigged against you? Welcome to the 93% Club | Alastair CampbellRead more“These are some of the most expensive and socially exclusive schools in the world. We know that many of these schools have entire staff teams dedicated to ensuring successful Oxbridge admissions,” Staufenberg said.“Trinity Hall should present its evidence for why these private schools – rather than state schools in forgotten regions of the north-east, for instance – need a specific recruitment policy encouraging their students to apply.“Trinity Hall also needs to answer why it is not using its considerable endowment funds to track down and find the talented and brilliant students hidden in the nation’s most deprived communities.”Francis Green, a professor at University College London who hasstudied UK private schools and inequality, said: “If a college perceives they are receiving too few qualified applicants in particular subjects, they might do better to advertise this generally across the school spectrum, or even adjust their educational offering, rather than risk retreat on what has been one of the few positive developments in widening participation in recent years.”Explore more on these topicsUniversity of CambridgeOxbridge and elitismPrivate schoolsAdmissionsSocial mobilityAccess to universityStudentsnewsShareReuse this content"

TheTennesseeschool is also paying the teacher $500,000 in the settlement.Austin Peay spokesperson Brian Dunn said Darren Michael returned to his position as a tenured faculty member at the public university in Clarksville effective 30 December. A copy of the settlement agreement obtained through a public records request includes a $500,000 payment and reimbursement of counseling, asreported earlier this weekby WKRN-TV.Tennessee’s governor, attorney general and comptroller signed a document authorizing the settlement payment.Top union accuses Texas of targeting teachers over Charlie Kirk postsRead moreMichael, a theater and dance professor, was among people who reported facing a conservative backlash and punishment at work for their online posts about Kirk’s fatal shooting in September. He was later moved to a suspension status.In a 30 December email to the university community, Austin Peay president Mike Licari said the school did not follow the required tenure termination process. The communication was another requirement under the settlement.Licari added: “I deeply regret and apologize for the impact this has had on Professor Michael and on our campus community. I am committed to ensuring that due process and fairness are upheld in all future actions.”Two days after Kirk’s killing, Marsha Blackburn, a Republican senator from Tennessee,posteda screenshot indicating Michael on 10 September had posted the headline of a 2023 news article headlined: “Charlie Kirk Says Gun Deaths ‘Unfortunately’ Worth it to Keep 2nd Amendment.” Blackburn, who is also a candidate for governor, included a photograph and biography of Michael. She wrote: “What do you say, Austin Peay State University?” and tagged the university’s account.Blackburn’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the settlement.David L King, Michael’s attorney, said the professor said “nothing that was threatening or otherwise offensive”. King decried the pressure applied by “outside forces” and said the ordeal “caused a great deal of harm” to Michael and his daughter.Explore more on these topicsTennesseeCharlie Kirk shootingHigher educationSocial mediaUS universitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

While not all calls connected successfully, many did.“The venues targeted included seven hospitals, six bars, restaurants and supermarkets, two police force control rooms and a cancer information and support services centre. Hart twice attempted to call Westminster Abbey but he did so when it was night-time in the UK, meaning the calls were not answered,” the Met police said.“In those calls, he typically told the person who answered the phone that he had planted a bomb at their location, which would soon explode. He would make multiple calls, sometimes days apart, to the same victims. The calls were sustained and persistent, sometimes lasting almost half an hour.“On other occasions, he claimed to have planted a bomb in a hotel basement, describing it as homemade and filled with nails.”Although police said some of the call recipients were sceptical the threats were genuine, they still felt they had to take precautions. Security staff at some of the threatened locations searched their venues and one of the hospitals went into full lockdown while they searched for explosive devices.The court was satisfied Hart knew the calls would be received as the threats he intended them to be, police said.Explore more on these topicsUK newsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

In 1990, he recalled: “I spent so much time in my bedroom. It really was my entire world. I had books up there, my music up there, my record player. Going from my world upstairs out on to the street, I had to pass through this no-man’s-land of the living room.”View image in fullscreenThe young Bowie using a strength device at home.Photograph: David Bowie Estate/PAStanding in the room today felt extraordinary, said Geoffrey Marsh, who co-curated the V&A’s David Bowie Is exhibition in 2013 and will curate the restoration. “You think, someone who didn’t have any big advantages, who came from an ordinary family, went to an ordinary school – what was it that went on there which created this driving ambition to succeed, to want to be a star, and which took him right through to it?”‘The Ziggy Stardust suit sparked my adolescent awakening’: Moby, Goldie, Natalie Merchant and more delve inside Bowie’s archivesRead moreThe house experience will include never-before-seen archival items, including Bowie’s copies of the Observer’s books on music and architecture. “In one of them, he’s written his exam results in the back,” said Marsh. “He’s also written his name in as David Jones Jr because he went through this phase of loving Americana, so he gave himself the Jr title to show his allegiance. That’s very magical.”One artefact originally shown at the V&A was a photograph of Bowie’s hero, Little Richard, which he cut out when he was around 10 or 11 and stuck on his bedroom wall. It followed him throughout his life, and the restoration will return it to its original spot.“He always had that on the wall in his flat, until he died,” said Marsh. “What’s remarkable is that it’s an instant connection back to the late 50s and Little Richard as this extraordinary star.” Bowie’s Elvis Presley singles – some brought home by his father, who worked for Dr Barnardo’s – will also feature.Living friends, including the artist and musician George Underwood, who punched Bowie at school and left him with his mismatched irises, and the actor Dana Gillespie, have helped provide memories of visiting the house.“Dana remembers going there and being served tuna sandwiches,” said Marsh. “She came from kind of a posh upbringing, so I think she had quite a shock.”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Curator Geoffrey Marsh, artist George Underwood and Nicola Stacey, of the Heritage of London Trust, outside 4 Plaistow Grove.Photograph: Heritage Of London Trust/PAFunding for the project has started with a £500,000 grant from the Jones Day Foundation, an arm of the law firm Jones Day, anda public fundraising campaignwill begin this month.Marsh, the trust and the conservation architects Julian Harrap, who previously worked on Sir John Soane’s Museum and Pitzhanger Manor and Gallery in Ealing, will restore the house to exactly how it looked around 1963, when Bowie was 16.“One’s got to be really careful because there may be evidence of things like the wallpaper and paint colours buried under the modern decorations,” said Marsh. “Before any stripping out starts, there’s going to be an investigation looking at all that.”The house will host creative and skills workshops for young people, inspired by Bowie’s Beckenham branch of the Arts Lab movement and run by the trust’s Proud Places scheme, which has involved more than 10,000 young Londoners in local heritage projects. “It’s not just aimed at being a memorial to David’s extraordinary creativity,” said Marsh.“The music business can be particularly baffling if you’re a teenager, so part of the project is to work with young people and show them the drivers that helped David succeed, and which can hopefully help them succeed. It’s a platform for the future.”View image in fullscreenA photo taken from the window of Bowie’s childhood home.Photograph: David Bowie estate/PAA public consultation will have to take place on the proposed changes. Marsh is hoping for strong local support: “They’ve already got one famous house there: [that of] Charles Darwin. I think David will be a good contrast.”There will also be detailed planning applications on change of use and newer works will have to be undone: when Bowie’s older brother Terry was kicked out, the two upstairs bedrooms were knocked into one; a 1970s extension will also be taken down. “And of course,” said Marsh, “in the 1960s it wouldn’t have had an internal lavatory or bathroom, so all that’s got to be removed.”Show me the nipple-baring Ziggy knitwear! A tour inside David Bowie’s mind-boggling 90,000-item archiveRead moreThe house serves as a lesson in London real estate history. It was acquired from owners who lived in the house from 1970 until recently – the “incredibly steep staircase” was no longer tenable, said Marsh – who offered it directly to the trust. Marsh didn’t know how much they originally bought it for, but the property websiteZooplashows that a neighbouring one-bedroom house sold in August for £520,000, having previously been sold for £80,000 in 1997.View image in fullscreenBowie’s mother, Margaret Mary Jones, sitting in the garden at 4 Plaistow Grove.Photograph: David Bowie estate/PAWas Bowie happy at Plaistow Grove? “That’s a very tricky question,” said Marsh. While Bowie’s father, Haywood, was supportive – having had some experience running a club in Soho in the 1930s – he had different challenges with his mother, Margaret. “He used to say he would retreat to his bedroom to get away from the living room. And I think that’s part of why he got this huge ambition – sitting in his bedroom, often alone. His school friends would often ask him out and he’d say: ‘No, I’m going to stay at home and think, and work.’”Bowie: The Final Act – 10 years after his death, the rock god gets a rapturous resurrectionRead moreSeeing photographs of Bowie aged 16, said Marsh, spoke to his unusual sense of direction. “He’s looking straight through the camera lens at you. It’s just incredible for a 16-year-old, in an age before boybands and all the rest of it, stylists and fashion people. He created his own hairstyle, sets, made all the decisions about clothes. He thought everything through from his early teens.”Marsh encouraged members of the public to scrutinise photos of the young Bowie at home: anyone with matching rolls of wallpaper languishing in the attic was invited to come forward to help recreate the look of the house. “The other thing is that Mrs Jones gave away and sold items in 1970 when she left the house. So if anyone inBromley, or indeed anywhere else, has got anything they know from the house, we’d be very interested.”Explore more on these topicsDavid BowieBromleyLondonEnglandArchitectureHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

Researchers said the composition of litter found in the Rhine was very similar to that found in other European rivers including the Thames. These large quantities of litter also have the potential to damage crucial infrastructure such as drainage systems, leading to increased risk of flooding.Citizen scientists and researchers from the University of Bonn analysed litter collected from the Rhine between November 2022 and November 2023. They found the river carried up to 4,700 tonnes of “macrolitter” – pieces larger than 25mm in size – annually. They said more research was needed to understand the full extent of the problem.Hamann said the Rhine was one of the major contributors of Europe’s macrolitter into the sea, but added that many other rivers had not yet been investigated.View image in fullscreenLitter trap on the Rhine.

This cannot continue.”The union said the violence was causing some pupils to be afraid of attending school. The schools have remained open this week despite the strikes, and parents who spoke to the Guardian expressed surprise at the allegations.At Lily Lane primary in theManchestersuburb of Moston, teachers said they were not being supported to deal with high levels of aggression and that their concerns over pupils with highly complex special needs were being ignored.Outside Lily Lane at the end of the school day on Thursday, one parent said they had been unaware that the school had such severe issues until the news came about the teachers going on strike.Another parent said their child was happy at the school despite hearing that some students were occasionally aggressive.“My son likes it here,” said the parent, who asked not to be named. “We hear about fights sometimes but nothing like what’s been reported, we didn’t know that was happening and we hope it gets sorted out.”Rachel Knight and Jac Casson, NASUWT’s national representatives for Greater Manchester, said the multi-academy trust running the two schools, Changing Lives in Collaboration (CLIC) Trust, was responsible for the “devastating” working conditions.“Leaders have known about strike action for a month but have failed to engage in good faith or to make urgently needed improvements. Our teachers have taken the brave and necessary step of saying: no more,” they said.Jo Ashcroft, CLIC’s chief executive, said the schools would remain open during the strike.Ashcroft said: “The safety and wellbeing of pupils and staff in all our schools is of the very highest priority to us and we work closely with every one of our schools to ensure they maintain the very highest safeguarding standards at all times.“We also support our schools to ensure the needs of all pupils, including those with special educational needs, are fully met.“We completely respect the right of union members to take strike action where they believe it to be necessary. However, it’s disappointing in this case that strike action is taking place so soon after the ballot without adequate opportunity to respond to members’ concerns.”Explore more on these topicsPupil behaviourIndustrial actionPrimary schoolsTrade unionsSchoolsTeachingManchesterShareReuse this content"

The pub industry has been putting pressure on ministers to act.Photograph: David Noton Photography/AlamyHospitality industryReeves’s promise of pub business rates U-turn averts Labour rebellionChange in England largely welcomed by industry and Labour MPs but represents another climbdownKiran Stacey,Peter WalkerandRob DaviesThu 8 Jan 2026 14.33 ESTFirst published on Thu 8 Jan 2026 09.18 ESTShareRachel Reeves has avoided another damaging rebellion against her economic policies with the promise of a U-turn on controversial tax hikes for pubs in England, after weeks of protest from her colleagues and the hospitality industry.Government sources said on Thursday the chancellor was finalising a support package for the struggling industry that would include reductions to business rates for pubs, which had been facing a 76% rise on average over the next three years.Industry figures welcomed news of the U-turn, which comes after similar climbdowns overcuts to winter fuel payments,cuts to disability benefitsand arise in inheritance tax for farmers.But with the Treasury yet to publish details of the support package, Reeves’s colleagues say they are willing to push ahead with an amendment to the government’s finance bill if they feel it does not go far enough.Tonia Antoniazzi, theLabourchair of the all-party parliamentary group on beer, said: “I am over the moon, things are moving in the right direction.” But, she added, she and her colleagues were prepared to rebel against Reeves’s finance bill at a later stage if the new support proved insufficient.A government source said the new plan would “recognise issues with how business rates are collated”, and would be part of a wider package including measures to help pubs with licensing, opening hours and red tape more generally.Reeves’s decision to back down follows weeks of campaigning by publicans and MPs from across the Commons against changes she made in November’s budget.The chancellor announced at the time that she would reduce headline business rates for the hospitality industry. But at the same time she announced the end of Covid-era reliefs, which, when combined with a three-yearly revaluation of property values, dwarfed the impact of the rate cut. As a result, pubs were facing an average rise in rates of 76% over three years, while hotels were to go up 115%.Whitbread, which owns pubs, restaurants and the Premier Inn hotel chain, said it would have to pay between £40m and £50m more in tax as a result.View image in fullscreenWhitbread, which owns pubs and restaurants including the Beefeater chain, had said it would have to pay between £40m and £50m more in tax under the original plans.Photograph: Brian Anthony/AlamyThe move sparked an industry backlash with hundreds of landlords banning Labour MPs from their pubs,causing angstamong many for whom the pub was a useful convening space and a refuge from Westminster.The campaign has proved even more successful than protests by farmers against plans to raise inheritance tax on agricultural land, which also prompted a U-turn, albeit after 18 months rather than six weeks.Reeves commissioned work before Christmas on a possible package of support for pubs, led by Dan Tomlinson, a Treasury minister, who has been meeting business groups in recent days.Officials are still working on the finer points of the package, with some business groups calling for a multibillion-pound reduction in VAT while MPs argue for more modest discounts to business rates.Labour MPs welcomed the fact that Reeves had changed coursemore quicklyon this occasion than in the past, but said the changes should have come as soon as the impact became clear.“It’s great that the Treasury is in listening mode,” said one. “It’s just a shame it wasn’t listening before.”Officials defended the delay, saying the combined impact of the revaluation and the removal of reliefs only became clear once the government’s valuation office had sent details of its calculations to individual businesses.More than 30 Labour MPs were preparing to vote in favour of an amendment to the finance bill on Monday that would have reduced rates for hospitality businesses, in what would have amounted to a significant act of defiance against the chancellor.View image in fullscreenTonia Antoniazzi, the Labour chair of the all-party parliamentary group on beer, said MPs would wait to see who far Reeves’s changes went.Photograph: PjrNews/AlamyAntoniazzi said they would no longer push ahead with that amendment, but would keep it in reserve for when the bill came back at a later stage if they felt Reeves’s changes did not go far enough.Other MPs said the combined effect of multiple U-turns, often on spending cuts or tax rises, made them frustrated and more likely to rebel in future. “The mood with this one was not anger, we were just waiting for the inevitable U-turn,” said one.Industry insiders mostly welcomed the changes, though many said they were waiting to see the details before deciding whether to continue their campaign.Emma McClarkin, the chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said: “News that the government is going to look again at business rates increases is potentially a huge win for pubs across the country and shows government have not only listened to our concerns but acted.”Others said the package should apply to the entire hospitality industry rather than just pubs. “The entire sector is affected by these business rates hikes – from pubs and hotels to restaurants and cafes,” said Kate Nicholls, the chair of the industry body UKHospitality. “We need a hospitality-wide solution.”One industry boss criticised the government for failing to realise the problems the budget would cause for the sector, calling it “a monumental avoidable cockup”.Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryLabourPubsnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite an extensive police search, their parents have never been found.Scotland Yard has said its inquiries have been “exhausted”, but reiterated a plea for anyone with information to come forward.Elsa has been looked after by foster carers after being discovered by a dog walker in a shopping bag in Newham on 18 January 2024. Her brother and sister, Harry and Roman (not their real names), have already been adopted.View image in fullscreenThe shopping bag in which baby Elsa was found in Newham.Photograph: Metropolitan police/PAAt the East London family court on Thursday, Judge Atkinson ruled Elsa should remain with those caring for her, which would “pave the way” for them to apply to adopt her.Highlighting the extraordinary nature of Elsa’s story, she said in her judgment that only eight children were registered as abandoned in England and Wales between 2008 and 2018.“Elsa is a beautiful little girl, a raucous bundle of excitement and laughter,” Atkinson said. “I am pleased to have seen photos of her. I know from reports that she lights up the space around her. She is happy and settled in her new family, as yet unaware of how she differs from other children.”She added that Elsa’s “best chance in life comes with a permanent placement in an alternative family”, and said: “These siblings share something quite extraordinary. No one that they will meet in life is likely to understand what it is like to be a foundling, but they each know and understand.”In June 2024, the judge ruled the media couldreport the familial linkbetween Elsa and her two siblings after an application by the Press Association and the BBC.Elsa was believed to be about an hour old when she was found wrapped in a towel in a shopping bag at the edge of a park in East Ham. Hospital staff named her Elsa, after the character from the film Frozen.Roman was found in similar circumstances in a play area in Newham in late January 2019, when freezing temperatures and snow gripped the city. And, in September 2017, Harry had been found wrapped in a white blanket in Plaistow.In written submissions for Thursday’s hearing, Kate Claxton, for Newham council, said there would be contact between the siblings, including play dates and letters.Police have been unable to identify their mother, despite establishing a full DNA profile, reviewing hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and offering a £20,000 reward for three months last year.Last year, their search narrowed to about 400 homes from which experts believed the person who abandoned the children – who may or may not have been their mother – could have travelled. This proved unsuccessful, with officers saying they “cannot discount” a fourth child being found as time passes.Speaking to PA Media in May, DI Jamie Humm, the senior investigating officer, said the case was “wholly unprecedented”, but that police must conclude the person who abandoned the children “did not want to be found”.He said he believed the mother “is vulnerable, is in danger, and is in a position where they feel that they are unable to come forward for whatever reason”.On Thursday, Atkinson said the way Elsa was abandoned caused her “significant physical harm”, but that police had been “tenacious” and “tireless” in their efforts to find the parents.Explore more on these topicsLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, who was asked to review Mullally’s handling of the complaint, said he had decided to take no further action against her.In response, N said: “She’s not fit to be archbishop. This represents a betrayal of the Christian gospel. British public conscience will understand that while the crown may have appointed Sarah Mullally and Stephen Cottrell, Jesus Christ gave them their P45 years ago. They should both step down.”Immigration debate ‘dividing us’, incoming archbishop of Canterbury warns in Christmas sermonRead moreThe decision to appoint Cottrell to assess the complaint prompted criticism within the church because he had faced calls to resign last year over hishandling of a separate sexual abusecase when he was Bishop of Chelmsford – allegations against the priest David Tudor.Critics have said Cottrell’s dismissal of the complaint does not put a stop to questions of trust and accountability in the church.N said the abuse started in 2005 and 2006 when he alleged the vicar “groped my bum, put his hand between my legs” and asked him to perform a sexual act.Mullally became bishop of London in 2018.N claimed that after he made a formal complaint in 2019 about the alleged abuse, Mullally breached a church disciplinary code by sending a confidential email about the allegation to the priest concerned.N said: “That resulted in the course of absolute horrific harassment that drove me to suicide attempts. And that constituted the basis for my next CDM [church disciplinary measure] complaint in March 2020 against Mullally.”The diocese of London said proper processes had been followed and that there was no outstanding complaint against Mullally.N claimed it was wrong for the diocese to suggest his complaint had been dealt with. He said he had made CDM complaints against Mullally and Cottrell that were still in process.Officials at Lambeth Palace, the official London residence of the archbishop of Canterbury, said N’s complaint was not followed up because of “administrative errors and an incorrect assumption about the individual’s wishes”.On Thursday a statement from Cottrell’s office said: “On 7 January the archbishop of York issued his determination not to take any further action in relation to a CDM [church disciplinary measure] complaint originally filed against Bishop Sarah Mullally in 2020.”N said: “Everyone knew he was going to dismiss the complaint, we just need to discuss the grounds under which we will be appealing.” He said there was a conflict of interest in Cottrell dealing with the issue given he was also the subject of a complaint from N on the same matter.Robert Thompson, an Anglican vicar in the London diocese and a member of the General Synod, has called for a pause to Mullally becoming archbishop. He said it was not credible for Cottrell to adjudicate on the case.In an email to the Guardian, Thompson said: “The dismissal of this CDM complaint by the archbishop of York may close a case on paper, but it does not close the trust deficit. It will inevitably deepen concern about whether the Church of England’s disciplinary processes are capable of commanding the confidence of survivors or the wider public.“This decision does not resolve the serious questions that have been raised about safeguarding culture, accountability, and the handling of power at the highest levels of the church. It instead reinforces a longstanding perception that senior leaders are insulated from meaningful scrutiny by processes that are opaque, slow and internally controlled.”In a statement last year, Mullally said it was clear that a complaint made against her in 2020 “was not properly dealt with”. She said she was “seeking assurance that processes have been strengthened to ensure any complaint that comes into Lambeth Palace is responded to in a timely and satisfactory manner”.Michelle Burns, a former London diocesan safeguarding adviser, said: “For many survivors and safeguarding professionals this just reinforces the perception that the church disciplinary procedures just don’t work.“Sarah is a good person. But it would be ill-judged of the Church of England to put her in place until these safeguarding issues are resolved.”Explore more on these topicsSarah MullallyAnglicanismChristianityReligionLondonSexual harassmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Ross is a Minnesota resident and 10-year veteran of the special response team of ICE’s enforcement and removal operation.The death of Good, a mother of three, sparked outrage inMinneapolisand strident rebukes from Minnesota officials and on Capitol Hill. Thousands of people gathered in protest near the site of the shooting Wednesday night, and some Democrats on Capitol Hill have threatened to withhold funding to the Department of Homeland Security. Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, said on Wednesday: “To ICE: get the fuck out of Minneapolis.”Federal officials have so far refused to identify the officer, though the Minneapolis Star Tribunefirst identifiedRoss on Thursday. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also refused on Thursday to involve Minnesota law enforcement in the investigation of Good’s killing, prompting the governor, Tim Walz, tosay“it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome”.Ross did not respond to multiple requests for comment.In a statement to the Guardian, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant DHS secretary, said: “We are not going to expose the name of this officer. He acted according to his training.”Noem called Good’s actions “an act of domestic terrorism” and accused her of blocking in federal agents with her vehicle before the lethal shooting, but also indicated that the agent involved had been “dragged” by a vehicle during an enforcement operation last year. Vance also said during a press briefing at the White House on Thursday that the unnamed agent was dragged by a car “six months ago” and shared specific details that align with court documents in a Minneapolis case last summer.Videos of the shooting shared widely on social media show Good attempting to turn her red SUV around and leave the scene as a federal agent attempts to force open her passenger door. An ICE agent can be seen earlier walking around the car’s passenger side from the rear towards the front of the car on the driver’s side with his phone in his left hand. He leans forward and fires four shots from his pistol at Good. The car speeds away and crashes a short distance later into a car parked in the snow.According tocourt records, Ross was involved in the June arrest of Roberto Carlos Muñoz, an undocumented Mexican immigrant with an open immigration detainer and a criminalconvictionfor sexually assaulting his 16-year-old stepdaughter in 2022. Muñoz was contacted at his residence in Bloomington, Minnesota, by a group of federal agents on 19 June 2025.According to an affidavit from an FBI agent, Muñoz was in his car when federal law enforcement approached him. He did not comply with commands to get out of his vehicle and drove away. The feds pursued Muñoz and conducted a traffic stop. An ERO agent and an FBI agent approached the car and ordered Muñoz in both English and Spanish to put the car in park and provide documentation, which he did. When the ERO agent ordered Muñoz to exit the car, he refused.At this point, according to the affidavit, the ERO agent broke the rear driver’s side window of Muñoz’s car and tried to unlock the driver’s door. Muñoz threw the car into drive, speeding off with the agent trapped in the vehicle by his arm and dragged behind the car for 100 yards down the street along the curb, weaving past several cars. The agent was jarred loose from the window and fell into the street, and Muñoz drove off. The agent suffered serious lacerations on both arms, which required 33 stitches in total to close.At the White House on Thursday, Vance engaged in a lengthy defense of the officer’s actions andsaid: “[T]hat very ICE officer nearly had his life ended, dragged by a car six months ago, 33 stitches in his leg. So you think maybe he’s a little bit sensitive about somebody ramming him with an automobile.” The court documents indicate the stitches were on Ross’s arms and hand, not his leg.Muñoz was detained by local police officers whom he’d contacted after fleeing the traffic stop, saying he’d been attacked by ICE. He was taken into custody on an immigration detainer, charged with assaulting an officer, and convicted in early December after a federal trial. His attorney did not respond to requests for comment.Perjury instructionsfor Muñoz’s trial, the ERO agent injured in Muñoz’s detention was named Jonathan Ross. The FBI agent’s affidavit contains a picture of Ross from the back, and he has the same haircut as in videos of Good’s fatal shooting.This story was amended on 8 January 2025 to correct the name of the ICE officer who shot Renee Nicole Good, which is Jonathan E Ross, not Jonathan David Ross. An earlier version also reported property records and voter registration identifying a resident of north-east Minneapolis with a similar name; those details do not describe the ICE officer.Cate Brown contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinneapolisUS immigrationTrump administrationMinnesotanewsShareReuse this content"

Experts expect that premiums for enrollees of the planswill roughly doublewithout the subsidies.The Republican speaker, Mike Johnson, has opposed the credits, arguing they would enable fraud while calling the landmark 2010 law passed under Barack Obama the “Unaffordable Care Act”. Democrats made an extension a centerpiece of their demands during the record-longgovernment shutdownthat began in October, while moderate Republicans sought to strike a compromise that would be palatable to both parties.But after Johnson refused to bring any deal to the floor, four Republicans last month signeda discharge petitionthat forced a vote on the legislation extending the credits for three years, in a significant rebuke of the speaker.“All of those options were rejected, unfortunately, by House leadership, so it left us with two options – either expiration or clean extension. And clean extension is a far better option, in my view, and that’s why I proceeded down the path that I did,” House representative Brian Fitzpatrick, one of the four Republican signatories, said inan interview with NPRon Thursday.Fitzpatrick predicted that the Senate will “put their stamp on” the three-year extension, and then the House will consider it again.Democrats see the tax credits as part of their emphasis on fighting the “affordability crisis”, a key plank of their pitch to voters ahead of the midterm elections in November, when they will seek to retake the Senate and House. Trump, meanwhile, has dismissed the concerns about affordability as a “hoax”, though Johnson has said that Republicans plan to outline their own proposals to lower healthcare costs in the weeks to come.“The affordability crisis is not a hoax, it is very real, despite whatDonald Trumphad to say,” the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, said in a Thursday morning press conference. “Today, we have an opportunity to take a meaningful step forward, lower the high cost of living for everyday Americans, particularly as it relates to healthcare.”His counterpart in the Senate, the minority leader Chuck Schumer, said that the party did not plan to let the issue go.“Democrats are going to make healthcare and other high costs, the high cost of living, the No 1 issue for all of 2026,” Schumer said.Explore more on these topicsUS healthcareHouse of RepresentativesHealth policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpRepublicansHealth insurancenewsShareReuse this content"

The company says it is used by 7,800 NHS organisations, including more than 2,600 GP practices and a third of acute mental health trusts, with 61m electronic health records stored in its database. It has also expanded abroad, including to China, the Middle East and the Caribbean.The company, which is owned by Hester and based in Leeds, had a turnover of £97.1m in the year to 31 March 2025, up 13% on the previous year. It made pre-tax profits of £47.4m, up sharply from £17.4m, according to the latest annual accounts filed with Companies House.TPP paid a dividend of £50m in the most recent year, up from £7m in 2024 and £10m in 2023. Hester stepped down as a director of TPP in September but remains the majority owner with 75% or more of the shares. The company paid him a salary of £520,000 in the year to March 2025, the same as in the previous year.The filings, which were first reported by the Times, also show the company donated £10.2m to the Conservative party in the year to 31 March 2024.Hester and his company have made donations of more than £20m to the Tories since the start of 2023, the Electoral Commission’s register shows. The Phoenix Partnershipdonated a total of £15.3m, while Hester made a£5m donationin the second quarter of 2023.He was at the centre of a political storm in March 2024 after the Guardian revealed he told colleagues at his healthcare company in 2019 that looking at Diane Abbott, Britain’s first black female MP, made you“want to hate all black women”and that she “should be shot”.Abbott saidit was “frightening” to hear of the remarks.After the remarks were published,TPP issued a statementsaying Hester accepted “that he was rude about Diane Abbott in a private meeting several years ago but his criticism had nothing to do with her gender nor colour of skin”. The statement said he abhorred racism, “not least because he experienced it as the child of Irish immigrants in the 1970s”.As a key supplier to the NHS, TPP has received £591m from public contracts since 2016, according to invoicing data compiled by Tussell, which tracks UK public sector spending. This includes £281.7m from the Department of Health and Social Care, £56.1m from NHS England, £17.2m from Central and North West London NHS foundation trust, and the rest from NHS trusts across the country.Hester worked in the financial sector as a computer programmer for several years before starting the company. Running the NHS contractor has helped the 59-year-old amass a personal fortune worth £415m, according to the 2024 Sunday Times rich list, and earned him an OBE for services to healthcare in 2015.The TPP website states Hester wanted to remove the administrative burden from his now former wife, a family doctor, so she could focus on delivering care for her patients.By his own estimates, the company was worth £1bn in 2019 and he threw a“unicorn party”at his mansion near Leeds to celebrate reaching this milestone, complete with horses dressed up with horns.TTP has been contacted for comment.Quick GuideContact Henry Dyer about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Henry using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The company said it expected to meet profit expectations of about a £17m annual decline to £173m for the year to 27 December.It also warned profits for the year ahead were not expected to increase as it plans to open 120 new stores – fewer than hoped under its plans for continued expansion.Currie said: “It has been a very tough, challenging market last year. It is not just about the high street. If you look at consumer behaviour and how under pressure it has been a tough market to operate in.”She said households’ disposable income had been squeezed and consumers were choosing to save rather than spend if they did have spare cash, so Greggs was “taking a cautious outlook”.Currie said inflation was easing and was expected to be lower than it had been for some years and this was good news for consumers. She said the slowdown in price rises would “give a bit of respite to the consumer that’s probably got a bit fatigued [with inflation] over the past few years”.Explore more on these topicsGreggsFood & drink industryRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The company said it expected to deliver annual profits of about £3.1bn – the upper end of expectations.Aarin Chiekrie, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said many had hoped Tesco would be increasing its profit hopes and so had been disappointed.However, he said: “Tesco looks well-positioned to continue weathering macroeconomic headwinds and soft consumer sentiment. Its enormous scale and strong relationships with suppliers are a key ingredient to its success story.”Tesco said it had increased the amount of goods sold and won market share, while Murphy said it had “really leant in” on keeping prices down, keeping inflation “materially lower” than the industry level of 4.3% in December outlined by Worldpanel.Murphy said he believed Tesco could continue to take market share after it had “responded very decisively” to threats of price cutting by Asda last year.Price competition has stepped up in January as part of an annual attempt to win over shoppers recovering from a festive blowout. Asda this week pledged to drop the cost of everyday products to below those of Tesco’s and other competitors’ loyalty card prices after a tough Christmas when sales fell 4.2%, according to the latest Worldpanel figures.Under a strengthened “Asda price promise”, it said 2,300 everyday products were priced lower than loyalty card prices at Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, including fresh meat, fresh produce, chilled food and core grocery and bakery lines.Tesco this week promised to keep the cost of 3,000 branded products “consistently low” as part of its new “everyday low prices” campaign.Murphy said “consumer spending and resilience was good” in the run-up to Christmas and was “not a concern”. His comments came amid fears for the retail sector, which is facing rising costs and lacklustre consumer spending with spare cash squeezed by rising energy, food and tax bills, as well as fears about the wider global political situation and UK economy.Three retailers, the jewellery brandClaire’s, the cut-price homewares chain the Original Factory Shopand theclothing chain LK Bennettare all set to call in administrators.Marks & Spencer on Thursday revealed strong food sales growth – up 5.6% at established stores in the three months to 27 December – while clothing sales fell 2.9%.Murphy said he did not believe the government’sbudget announcement in Novemberhad any “material impact on customer spend” and that households had continued to aim to have a good time although they were “seeking great value without a shadow of a doubt”.“Consumer sentiment is mixed. Some households’ budgets are in really good shape and others are counting every penny,” he said.He said the outlook for 2026 was reasonably positive: “Employment is still resilient and that is a key fact in how consumers feel about the world. What we have seen over Christmas, despite comments to the contrary, is that people spent and bought into celebrating with their family.”He said Tesco was not concerned about new worker protections in theEmployment Rights Act, which are due to come into force later this year, as it had already adopted many of the measures.However, Murphy called on the government to revamp the business rates system, which he said was unfair. While Tesco will not pay more under the new regime announced in November, Murphy said retailers and hospitality businesses paid more than their fair share.Explore more on these topicsTescoSupermarketsRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Béla was already weakened in his body, but the spirit was still ferocious, rebellious, furious. We sat down to talk. It seemed fairly obvious this would be our ultimate, and most heartfelt, conversation.

I wanted to learn film-making and applied to become an assistant on the film. He gave me my first real job: as an assistant, I had to find a boy for one of the main parts. I spent months in the casting process, for a part that eventually was cut from the shooting script. But for Béla, every effort put into a given movie was never lost – it was integrated into the energy field of the enterprise. The final outcome had to be the product of difficult processes. The harder the task, the better quality one could expect. He wanted to film life, and its constant dance. The choreography was a revelation for me: 10-minute, uninterrupted takes, unifying space, characters and time. All in black and white.I gradually understood that this was the best way to learn about film-making, much better than any film school: find a master and be initiated to the mysteries of a given art form, the way painters or artisans learned their craft for centuries. In Béla’s case, the work had to involve a closely knit group of trusted collaborators, a particular attention to craft (a level hardly reached nowadays, sacrificed on the altar of speed and efficiency), a deep connection to everything human, especially to those forgotten by an increasingly superficial society, and a profound love of physical film as opposed to anything computer-based, because all his films were grounded in the physical world. And yet, they all yearned to reach a metaphysical level, which corresponded to my natural inclination.View image in fullscreenAn enterprise of madness … The Man from London.Photograph: Artificial Eye/Sportsphoto/AllstarIn retrospect, The Man from London was an enterprise of madness – a Hungarian movie, based on a French language book by Belgian writer Georges Simenon, shot with international actors and Hungarian half-amateurs, all speaking on set in their native language, in a complex European co-production involving a shoot in Corsican town Bastia, dressed as a port in Normandy – all this in a period, 1930s setting. The project also involved the building of the main set element, a metal monster watchtower overlooking the bay. It all seemed to be a Fitzcarraldo-like project with gargantuan ambition, but the sheer talent, resilience and inspiring presence of Béla, his partner and editor Agnes Hranitzky, production designer László Rajk, and screenwriter (and now Nobel prize winner) László Krasznahorkai, and all the other crew members also made me believe this was the centre of the world.View image in fullscreenFerocious, rebellious … Béla Tarr at Cannes film festival in 2007 at a photocall for The Man From London.Photograph: Antonelli/Laruffa/ShutterstockThe filming was fraught with difficulties and constant challenges, primarily because of a structural discrepancy between the available funds and the scope of the film. Béla, in his unrelenting quest for perfection, was switching between cinematographers while looking for new finances. It was then that I understood the difference between compromise andcompromission. A film-maker has to navigate on that spectrum. Sometimes, sacrifices have to be made. At other times, artistic integrity requires the director stand firm. It wasn’t easy, even for Béla, to find the right path forward. French producer Humbert Balsan killed himself during the months of uncertainty that had engulfed the movie. It was a tragic example of how Béla’s art was profoundly linked to the real world. Life is cinema and cinema is life – with a little help from people like him.One day, when filming was stopped, I stumbled in a bookstore in Bastia upon a book containing the transcripts of theSonderkommandosof Auschwitz. It then took me 10 years of maturing to find a form to tell the story of what would become my first feature film, Son of Saul. One cannot depart easily from Béla Tarr’s world – it has to be a fierce gesture. When I left, it was a great loss for me, but I also took with me the rebellious attitude, the one always questioning the conventions of cinema, the codes and academic attitudes of those making films.With Sátántangó and Werckmeister Harmonies, Béla Tarr became the vividly disquieting master of spiritual desolationRead moreIn the winter of 2004, Béla was tasked to shoot with Robby Müller, the great cinematographer, a short film in Budapest aboutHungaryentering the EU. He called it Prologue. With a couple of assistants, I was tasked to find overnight 300 homeless people, all agreeing to be filmed while waiting in line for some food: a flow of endless faces, humanity, fragility, the forgotten ones. This is how he saw Hungary in Europe. Béla was driving me to the shoot, and he asked me, almost in a shy way, whether I thought this would be a good short film. Why would the great director ask a young assistant such a question? Maybe, he knew already, that I would always honour the tradition that he belonged to, and that I would do my best to keep the flame burning.Explore more on these topicsBéla TarrHungaryLászló NemesEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

This Dantean journey through fungal hell is riveting – though frogs may disagreeCatherine SlessorThu 8 Jan 2026 09.03 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 12.56 ESTShareSylvia Plath’s poem Mushrooms is a sinister paean to the natural world. Her observations on fungi are freighted with foreboding, noting how “very / Whitely, discreetly, / Very quietly” they “Take hold on the loam, / Acquire the air”. The poem ends: “We shall by morning, / Inherit the earth. / Our foot’s in the door.”Plath’s ominous ode from 1959 forms the opening salvo in an exhibition dedicated to fungi’s creepy omniscience. Far from merely getting a foot in the door, the door has been blasted off its hinges by fungi’s preternatural capacity to reproduce, spread, evolve – and annihilate. How they thrive with a perverse intensity on discarded, dead and dying things, impelling the cycle of decay and regrowth. As coprophiliacs, necrophiliacs and silent assassins, they are legion, and have been around for over a billion years.They crawl into hospital beds – and from there into our lungsFeaturing installations, films and soundscapes confected by a range of artists,Fungi: Anarchist Designersis a Dantean journey through the many circles of fungal hell, contrived to convey their terrifying ubiquity and resilience. A timelapse film of the aptly named basket stinkhorn, burgeoning from fleshy phallus into a perforated umbrella, sets the tone. The stinkhorn emits the smell of rotting flesh to attract flies, which feast on it and disperse its spores.“Fungi refuse the commands of human masters and to abide by human standards of propriety,” say the exhibition’s curators, anthropologist Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing and architect and artistFeifei Zhou. “They latch on to our worst habits, turning industrial trade into continent killing machines. They leap into commercial agriculture, wiping out vast fields. They crawl into hospital beds and from there into our lungs. We cannot ignore them.”View image in fullscreenNinety extinctions and counting … the tombstone for frog species.Photograph: Aad HoogendoornThe exhibition is not about fungi’s increasing role as a passive building material or product, exemplified by the rise of mycelium panels. Instead, its focus is on “anti-design”, highlighting their role as “co-designers of the world”, outwitting it and bending it to their will.From the sea to the stratosphere, fungi’s domain is vast. Taxonomically, it encompasses more than two million organisms, from microscopic yeasts, moulds and mildews to lichens and mushrooms, some laced with psychotropic properties or lethal toxins. Amanita phalloides, or death cap, is the principal culprit in most human deaths from mushroom poisoning, including the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. Now globally established, through the cultivation of non-native tree species, the prevalence of the death cap illustrates the unintended consequences of humans tampering with nature.Fungi thrive on our venality and shortsightedness. Monocultural forests and crop plantations, reductively cultivated for profit, are grist to their mill. The genetic sameness of industrially farmed commodities such as sweetcorn, bananas and coffee makes them especially vulnerable to fungal attack. Capable of ripping through conifer plantations, heterobasidion root rot is one of the most feared diseases. Its balefully destructive impact is crystallised in a multimedia installation by forest pathologist Matteo Garbelotto and artistKyriaki Goni, entitled: “We shall by morning, inherit the earth” after Plath’s chilling poem.View image in fullscreen‘We cannot ignore them’ … Fungi: Anarchist Designers.Photograph: Aad HoogendoornPlants and trees are not the only victims of fungi’s advances. A giant “tombstone” is inscribed with the names of assorted frog species rendered extinct by a microscopic fungus. Accompanying it is a magnified image of a fungal tube piercing the skin of a corroboree frog. It might look innocuous, but, to date,more than 90 amphibian species have been wiped outand many are still endangered.Aficionados ofThe Last of Uswill be familiar with how humanity has been reduced to mushroom-headed monstrosities through the cordyceps virus, based on an all too real type of parasitic fungus that infects insects, controls their brains, and then erupts from the host’s corpse as fungal stalks to spread its spores, an exquisitely horrific conjunction of death and sex.Humans are, indeed, susceptible to fungal infections, mainly of the prosaic kind that favour warm, moist crevices and a lack of personal hygiene. But more sinister invaders are always lurking. A mock-up of a hospital bed bay forms an impromptu shrine to the multi drug-resistant candida auris, which spreads through hospitals and can be deadly, killing as many as one in three patients who contact it.Yet fungi’s nihilistic propensities are underscored by a curiously compelling beauty. Historic architectural drawings from the Nieuwe Instituut’s archive are shown floridly mottled with fungal discoloration, like Rorschach inkblots, while Japanese artist Hajime Imamura creates “mycelial sculptures” as thin, intertwined coils, draped probingly across a ceiling.View image in fullscreenHajime Imamura’s ‘mycelial sculptures’ in Fungi: Anarchist Designers.Photograph: Aad HoogendoornLizan Freijsen’s “tufted floor objects” (ie rugs) resemble patches of dry rot, a fungus that thrives in damp houses and wooden ships. Originally, it was confined to a corner of the Himalayas, but has since made its way around the world through the conduits of colonial trade. Michael Poulsen’s towering, stalagmite-like model of a termite mound spotlights the symbiosis between fungi and termites; the fungi break down plant cell walls to provide food for the insects.After Hiroshima was obliterated by an atomic bomb, one of the first living things to emerge from the devastated landscape was the matsutake mushroom, traditionally fetishised by the Japanese as a gourmet delicacy. Shiho Satsuka and Liu Yi’s lyrical animated film illuminates the relationship between the matsutake and Japanese pine forests, showing how fungi can make places habitable for trees in terrain disturbed by the impact of people, earthquakes or war.Actual living fungi make an appearance in “architecture must rot”, an installation exploring how materials – in this case, plywood cocoons in sealed terraria – are broken down and transfigured by fungal growth. In re-imagining decay as a positive, ecologically beneficial mechanism, it questions the fiction of architecture’s physical permanence (in reality, all buildings have finite lifespans) and how fungi might mediate processes of transformation and regeneration.The Dantean journey culminates in a corridor of manifestos urging us to rethink how we live with the more-than-human world, and to envisage futures shaped by negotiation and interdependence. Enlivened by a wealth of detail, most of it deliciously disquieting, this atmospheric and engrossing exhibition ensures you’ll never look at a mushroom in the same way again.

The originalGreenlandwasn’t even a traditional hit; it was released in theaters and on VOD at the end of 2020, when plenty of cinemas remained closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but it garnered some attention for being an unusually sober and thoughtful apocalypse movie, especially given that Butler previously starred in the likes of Geostorm. Because Greenland was about surviving a global apocalypse rather than averting one, any sequel would have to venture into the unknown with a drastically different status quo.We Bury the Dead review – Daisy Ridley tackles the undead in solid zombie twistRead moreGreenland 2 obliges for a little while, though it also walks back some of the hope that ended the first film. The story rejoins engineer John Garrity (Gerard Butler), his administrator wife Allison (Morena Baccarin) and their now-teenage son Nathan (recast as Roman Griffin Davis) as residents of a Greenland bunker. They’re lucky to have been government-selected for entry when the Earth was rendered largely uninhabitable by comet fragments five years earlier; they’re also chafing at the loss of freedom, tough decisions and overall claustrophobia that comes with cohabitating underground with hundreds of others. (Curiously, none of them seem to have made many friends despite the close quarters.)The survivors are still down there because it turns out that the clearing of air mentioned at the end of the first film is spottier than they thought. John repeatedly ventures outside the bunker, but only with proper gear and to forage for additional resources. He also frets about a restless Nathan putting himself at risk to explore the greater world. This conflict is mooted when a series of earthquakes destroy the bunker once and for all. A small group of survivors, including the Garrity family, therefore sets out to find a rumored crater that supposedly features a large pocket of breathable air, located somewhere in France. In this case, the grass is always greener on the other side of the English Channel.This country-hopping mission lends Greenland 2 somewhat greater scope than its predecessor, even as it essentially recreates its central dynamic of John Garrity assembling a piecemeal, largely improvised path to potential safety for his family. This time, the environmental countdown clock is a little less firm – the worst of the comet’s fragments have long since smashed into the planet, but smaller fragments, radiation storms and the occasional tidal waves still abound at irregular intervals – while some added health issues try to make up for any diminished urgency.Frequent Butler director Ric Roman Waugh – this is their fourth film together, and the first of two January movies Waugh has on deck, with a Jason Statham vehicle up next – keeps the action moving, if not always especially exciting. The most directly nerve-wracking set pieces are also some of the most ridiculous, as when the family traverses a dried-up English Channel only to find themselves at the mercy of a comically rickety series of barely-there bridges. The budget seams show when wide shots paint compelling scenes of a post-apocalyptic landscape, and then the close-ups mostly involve wobbly ladders or dimly lit exchanges of gunfire.Moreover, though, this sequel doubles down on its predecessor’s earnestness, to the point of alternating between grimly offing side characters at random and then getting all maudlin about its own pitilessness. Fair enough that a post-apocalyptic story will be suffused with some sadness; the problem is, Waugh has a grasping, indelicate way with human drama that doesn’t do his star in any favors. Butler has relaxed into a dependably rumpled middle-aged presence, especially when he’s allowed to use his Scottish accent. But he veers toward good-dad bathos here.He and Waugh seem desperate to turn this 98-minute adventure into a periodic funeral dirge, all while ignoring any realities that might uncomfortably echo our own world. Initially, Greenland 2 recalls and expands on the original’s accidental status as a Covid movie, with its masking gear and justified paranoia over the radiation sickness people might contract without it. Little comes of this, though, beyond using a radiation-detecting device to assure the characters that they don’t actually need the masks after a certain point in their journey. (No need to watch masked actors, of course, but that’s also the moment when it feels like the series abandons any sense of contemporary connection.) Greenland 2: Migration takes itself seriously in all the wrong ways; it wants to maintain a safe distance from the real world, while urging the audience to shed a tear over some imagined nobility.Greenland 2: Migration is out in US cinemas on 9 January and in the UK and Australia soonExplore more on these topicsGerard ButlerAction and adventure filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Another woman arrives home bloodied, gasping with fear and for wine, and starts scrubbing her hands before clearing her flat of – well, everything.A female voiceover intones that there are two sides to every story. “Which means someone is always lying.” Absolute nonsense, obviously, but it sounds great and more importantly it confirms what we were hoping: that we are in the presence of a glossy, efficient adaptation of a bestselling thriller and it is time to switch off our brains and enjoy (unless you are the type who likes to try to solve the mystery before the characters do, in which case, Godspeed and let me know where you get the energy from).This particular piece of glossy efficiency is His & Hers, a six-part adaptation of Alice Feeney’s 2020 bestseller of the same name (there are two more in the works – Sometimes I Lie and Rock Paper Scissors), produced by Jessica Chastain and boasting a fine array of actors in the main parts.Jon Bernthal (The Bear, We Own This City and, for those whose memories stretch this far back, an early and much lamented loss to The Walking Dead) plays small-town detective Jack Harper, in charge of the investigation into the murder.Tessa Thompson(Westworld, Creed) is Anna, a steely former TV news anchor who gets an early sniff of the case, which has occurred in her old home town, and is keen to secure the scoop to restore her status at the station. Her position was taken by a younger, blonder rival while she was mourning the loss of her child. But we are not in the business of exploring unfathomable grief here, simply of providing motivation and narrative propulsion. So we do not dwell on sorrow but enjoy Anna taking the rival’s husband, Richard (Pablo Schreiber), with her as her cameraman and, once she has undermined his marriage and obliquely challenged his masculinity (invisible next to your celebrity wife earning five times your salary, aren’t you?), her after-hours entertainment. Anna is also the woman we saw returning panting and covered in claret at the top of the show.View image in fullscreenUnder suspicion … Jon Bernthal as Jack Harper.Photograph: NetflixThe next revelation is that Jack and Anna are estranged husband and wife. Though not estranged enough for him to be fine with the fact that she is banging the cameraman. The dead woman – I may as well fill you in on everything while I’ve got you – is Rachel Hopkins (Jamie Tisdale, Isabelle Kusman as a teen), who by all accounts, including Anna’s, was the meanest of mean girls growing up (we get a flashback scene of Anna, who was in her clique at school, watching her trick someone into drinking a glass of urine) and didn’t massively improve thereafter.Suspects accrue accordingly – including Anna. And, soon afterwards, Jack – who sure does not want to give the cheek swab required of all the officers who dealt with the discovery of Rachel’s body, so as to eliminate them from inquiries. There’s also Rachel’s cuckolded husband, Clyde (Chris Bauer, a veteran character actor rightly hired here, I suspect, for his ability to deliver a line like “She had a mercenary energy that I found intoxicating” without bringing the whole teetering edifice down), plus an unspecified number of cuckolders. And unless the girl who drank urine has moved away, I’d put her on the list, too.Further complications and potential plot lines include other girls from the clique, Jack’s alcoholic sister Zoe (Marin Ireland) and Anna’s ageing mother – neglected by her, still cared for by Jack – who is losing her grip on reality but whose porous memory I would bet still retains a vital clue or two about secrets long thought buried. The use of dementia as an acceptable form of deus ex machina in thrillers is something I would like to put in a complaint about, but I’m not sure to whom. I should wait and find out whether His & Hers is actually guilty of it first, I suppose.The twists, they are plentiful. The absurdities, they multiply. The viewerly enjoyment, it increases. The script – intoxicating mercenariness aside – is serviceable. The endeavour is bingeable. Nobody needs more, this early in the year.

But in full, Girl Taken, like the 2016 book Baby Doll by Hollie Overton on which it is based, is something much better. It takes the neglected parts of such stories – the sadder, quieter, far less titillating and voyeuristic aspects of what it means to take a person out of her home, her world and her life, and away from those of the people who love her – and fleshes all that out instead. It makes for a slower burn, but a much more deeply engaging and psychologically complex thriller than we customarily expect from such a setup, and – in asking what it really means to survive an act of profound violence – harrowing in a more valuable way.Lily and Abby (played with depth and delicacy by Tallulah and Delphi Evans) are twin 17-year-olds, on the cusp of – well, everything really, as you are when you are happy teenage girls. We meet them on the last day of the summer term. Lily is set to enjoy the summer with her lovely boyfriend Wes (Levi Brown, who was so extraordinary in 2024’s This Town) and partying, and Abby is laying plans to go to university. She is the star pupil in Mr Hansen’s English class (“You can start calling me Rick now” he says as the final school bell goes) and the popular young teacher has always encouraged her ambitions.View image in fullscreen‘Played with depth and delicacy’ … Tallulah Evans as Lily in Girl Taken on Paramount+.Photograph: Clapperboard TV/Paramount + Paramount GlobalGirl Taken is a lean but unhurried six-parter and takes time to build the girls’ world in enough detail that we feel the pain when one of them is wrenched out of it by the will of one man. In the first of many upendings of expectations, Rick (Alfie Allen, in a fantastic and – given how much he clearly relishes the meaty role – fantastically restrained performance) abducts Lily. In one of several improving changes to the book (and it’s a good book), the message is that a predator does not need a connection to an individual; any momentarily vulnerable young girl will do. This adds a slightly different gloss from usual to the question of motivation and places the blame for his action more assertively on the perpetrator than usual, however much he tries to muddy the waters later on.Rick’s sexual and other violence against Lily takes place almost entirely off screen. We focus instead on the guilt consuming Abby (whose argument with Lily is what led her to be walking home alone and – it is surmised – taken by a stranger somewhere along the way) and the flailing despair of their mother, Eve (Jill Halfpenny, bringing her all to an underwritten part). In keeping with the unsensationalised mood of the drama, the refuge Eve takes in drink results in a functional rather than histrionic alcoholism and is all the sadder and more credible for that.View image in fullscreen‘We feel the pain’ … Delphi Evans as Abby, Tallulah Evans as Lily and Jill Halfpenny as Eve in Girl Taken on Paramount+.Photograph: Paramount + Paramount GlobalWe see Rick insinuating himself into the search for Lily and, in later years, keeping in touch with the family, who are grateful for his support as the rest of the town and the media move on. There is a fine depiction of the coercive control Rick exerts over his wife that again works against the idea, as a lesser thriller would have it, that such sadistic monsters hide their true selves from everyone, that they exist as outliers, eruptions of pure evil rather than as points on a continuum.It is no spoiler to say that Lily escapes. The second half of the series has her recovery – such as it is, such as it can be – and that of her family at the forefront, and the damage that a perpetrator can continue to inflict even from behind bars when he knows how to work the justice system to his advantage. The fight for legal justice is interwoven with the fight of the family to accept what has happened to Lily and to the rest of them while she was away, and to construct a new normal that will allow them to move on, one day, in relative peace. There are enough twists and reveals as the episodes unfurl to let the show retain its thriller title, but Girl Taken gives a lot more than that.Girl Taken is on Paramount+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

What is certain is that this latest Schubert recording, following on from his release of the late sonatas late in 2022, reveals a rewardingly mature, un-egotistical approach to the eight Impromptus, some of the composer’s most profound music.View image in fullscreenArtwork for Schubert: Impromptus, Op 90 – Eric Lu.Photograph: Warner ClassicsLu is very much attuned to the way in which Schubert creates overarching structures, conjuring a mesmerising feeling of stasis with music that’s alive with detail under the surface – in his performances of several of them, time really does seem to stand still. Right from the lonely opening of Op 90 No 1, he draws the ear in with the scope of his phrasing: even though his playing can be weightier than some, his lines go on and on into the distance and corners are smoothly turned, with the dramatic passages growing out of what has come before. Perhaps these performances aren’t yet quite distinctive enough to make this recording top choice in a crowded field, but they certainly back up the Chopin judges’ decision: Lu is a serious talent.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

Shortly after losing his job as a bathroom salesman, he learns that he and his girlfriend Harriet are being evicted from their flat. Can life get any worse? Apparently, it can. Matt finds a note from Harriet saying she has left him and that he shouldn’t contact her. But then he receives a call from a stranger offering him a job that comes with a luxury apartment, leading him to wonder if his fortunes are turning.Perhaps Harriet will come back if she knows they have a fancy new home. The third mystery novel from comedianBob Mortimercomes with his trademark quirky touches including a talking animal in the form of Matt’s cat, Goodmonson, and whimsical metaphors; for Matt, trying to place a familiar face is akin to “trying to find a mouse’s handbag in a builder’s skip”.The narrative is built around the alternating viewpoints of Matt, Harriet and their neighbour Carol, a sharp-tongued divorcee. While Mortimer reads Matt’s chapters, Arabella Weir gives voice to Carol, whose liking for a younger man frequently lands her in trouble. Harriet, who we soon discover hasn’t left Matt at all but has been the victim of a crime, is read by Diane Morgan, whose delivery is as drily funny as you’d expect from the star of Philomena Cunk.

Its third episode heavily featured the Cribs’ bassist and vocalist Gary Jarman talking about his band’s first flush of mid-00s fame. It centred on their 2005 single Hey Scenesters!, from which the episode also took its name. It was a curious choice: on close examination, Hey Scenesters! wasn’t a celebration of what some people unfortunately dubbed the New Rock Revolution so much as the sound of Jarman and his bandmate brothers poking fun at it.View image in fullscreenThere was the peculiar dichotomy of theCribsin a nutshell. They were a band so of the mid-00s moment that they were nearly signed to a record label founded by Myspace. But they always seemed slightly apart from the scene. They were certainly less voracious in the pursuit of mainstream success than contemporaries Razorlight or Kaiser Chiefs: “A cash injection, a nasty infection – don’t regret it,” offers a song from their ninth album, Selling a Vibe, with the pointed title Self Respect. They were more in tune with what their sometime-producer Edwyn Collins called “proper indie” from a pre-Britpop age, when “indie” indicated not a predilection for skinny jeans and trilby hats, but something set apart from the mainstream that viewed the attentions of Top of the Pops and the tabloid press with deep suspicion and balanced limited commercial ambitions against artistic freedom. It was a point underlined by the kind of artists who gave them co-signs. Quite aside from the former frontman of Orange Juice, there was Sonic Youth’s Lee Ranaldo, Johnny Marr – who briefly joined the Cribs, co-writing 2009’s Ignore the Ignorant – and the late producer/engineer Steve Albini.That slight sense of distance served the Cribs well. Unlike their peers, they never met with vast success – their records sold respectably rather than astonishingly well – but they kept having Top 10 albums long after Britain’s 00s alt-rock vogue passed. The lyrics on Selling a Vibe regard their past with a rueful eye – unmistakably the tone of a band who dug in for the long haul some time ago and have been through some tough experiences. The spectre of a legal battle with their former label haunts the title track and You’ll Tell Me Anything (the band got back the rights to their first five albums), while Summer Seizures and Looking for the Wrong Guy deal with a certain loss of innocence: “The good times never last” avers the former; “ain’t it a shame tomorrow finally came?” opens the latter, before reflecting on “the folly of youth”.The Cribs: Never the Same – videoBut 22 years on from their eponymous debut album, the Cribs are still going and, on the evidence of Selling a Vibe, wearing their longevity and elder statesman status rather well. There’s a certain confidence about the album’s sound. It won’t surprise anyone conversant with the Cribs’ oeuvre to learn that it deals in distorted guitars and sharp, punchy songs. Produced by Caroline Polachek’s former Chairlift bandmate Patrick Wimberly, it feels a little more streamlined than its predecessor, Night Network: there’s a faint 80s pop sheen to A Point Too Hard to Make and a drum machine pulse underpinning Rose Mist, but it’s not a radical departure. What is striking is how uniformly well-written and powerful the songs are. Time and again, they hit a perfect balance: nothing here feels slick or overworked, but the melodies soar, the choruses hit, everything clicks faultlessly. If Selling a Vibe was a debut album, people might well be working themselves into a froth about it, but then again, it’s unlikely the songs here could be by a new artist: they speak of experience, the product of a band who have worked out exactly what they do and how to do it.‘We’ve got to release the dead hand of the past’: how Ireland created the world’s best alternative music sceneRead moreThe lyrics suggest the Cribs know that the position they occupy – longevity, a solid cult following, refining rather than reinventing – isn’t the stuff that grabs headlines or provokes hyperventilating excitement: “In these days of excess, the shortest stories are the sweetest,” notes Distractions. Equally, Selling a Vibe implies a band battered by experience but rightfully contented: as the roll call of forgotten contemporaries mentioned during that indie sleaze podcast underlined, there are far worse fates. The album ends with Brothers Won’t Break, a song that celebrates fraternal relations among the Jarman siblings and ponders men’s difficulties with sharing their emotions, but ultimately feels like a hymn to the Cribs’ durability: “After all this time holding the line, we weren’t ever going to leave it … we’ll keep it from an honest place.” They sound happy with their lot.

It’s ostensibly a label, where each EP has a different named artist, and each sleeve, designed by Nick Almquist, features a different abstract expressionist monochrome doodle. But all the tracks are numbered, not named, and each EP is actually the work of just one producer, Izaak Schlossman (credited as IS), joined by a changing cast of collaborators.The music also seems to dart into the mist, not just resisting genre classification, but actually seeming to evaporate as it plays. The most obvious comparison is the microhouse scene of the early 00s, in which artists such as Vladislav Delay, Isolée and Ricardo Villalobos made softly bumping tracks with the same level of playful sonic detail you might hear in a rainforest. False Aralia tracks also have a strong dub techno flavour thanks to all the mournful hazy chords, and a track like 01 by Externalism has a skanking, loping dub rhythm, but there are none of techno’s steady four-four beats. The closest Schlossman comes is on the almost Kraftwerkian Iri.gram EP, or 03 by Borgesian Term, a finely engineered groove built from live drums, heavily warped vocals and ASMR-triggering, cochlea-tickling sound design.Vocalist Anya Prisk features on four releases, her voice so heavily treated it becomes another synthetic sonic gesture, though Schlossman’s one concession to straight songcraft, Vehicular’s stunning 01 (sung by Lucas Deleon), is like chillout music for a genuinely frigid poolside in an off-season holiday resort. False Aralia tracks seem to fold over the corners of reality with the delicacy of an origami expert, letting you peek into a soft-focus alternate world.Ben Beaumont-ThomasThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenFrances Chang.Photograph: Linnea NugentFrances Chang – I Can Feel the WavesAhead of supporting Cate Le Bon in the US, the New Yorker unleashes a gorgeous loosie, reminiscent of a more domesticated take on Astrid Sonne’s off-kilter piano and conversational musings.Robyn – SexistentialRobyn defies André 3000 saying no one would want to hear him rap about his colonoscopy with her own deliriously brash rap about the carnal rearrangements of dating while doing solo IVF.Bonnie “Prince” Billy – They Keep Trying to Find YouOn a comeback as lovely – spare and sunlit – as it is sinister, Will Oldham sings a tribute to someone who’d do anything, even “allowing isolation to fully derange”, to remain hidden.A$AP Rocky – Punk RockyRocky’s crying in his truck, drowning his sorrows and trying to write love songs even though he hates them, to a swirly psychedelic haze that threatens to drag you with him into the mire.Peter Gabriel – Been UndoneAs he did in 2023, Peter Gabriel will release a new single every full moon this year: the steady Been Undone is an affecting look at human fallibility and anxiety about the void.Doechii and SZA – Girl, Get UpDoechii’s chilling on a roof, not a care in the world … a pose that swiftly comes undone as she hits back at haters in acute detail, her vexed verses softened by SZA’s slithery chorus.Juni Habel – Evergreen in Your MindSharing the same dusky light as Jessica Pratt’s records, the Norwegian singer traces the gap between reality and memory in swaddled vocal harmonies, to a reassuring acoustic guitar motif.Laura SnapesSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify – or transfer it toApple,Tidalor other servicesExplore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the 30 years since I was a student of that benign, pipe-smoking, elbow-patched man of letters Malcolm Bradbury, the private language of creative writing workshops has taken over the world.What writers used to say to small circles of students in an attempt to help them improve their storytelling technique has become a familiar way, often parodic and self-knowing, of interpreting the grand and not-so‑grand narratives of our time. “Don’t worry about Liz Truss’s YouTube series – she’s just having a main character moment.”The most intense distillation of this system of thought (if you can even call it that) has always been the craft book, the writing manual. These are sometimes written by the most successful in the profession (like Ursula K Le Guin’s Steering the Craft) or the most successful at advising the profession (Robert McKee’s Story) but most often they are put together by novelists and screenwriters towards the close of their academic careers as creative writing tutors. John Gardner’s The Art of Fiction is the grandaddy of this subgenre.With A Long Game, Elizabeth McCrackenhas come pretty late to the party. And she’s determined to liven things up. For a start, she does not agree with craft books, either their sentiments or their usual tone: “chipper, cheerleaderish, generally with an encouraging second-person narrator meant to make the whole exhausting process of writing a book seem possible”. It’s obvious she’s thinking of such motivational titles as Walter Mosley’s This Year You Write Your Novel.We know from her big entrance – sentence one, page one – that McCracken, novelist, memoirist and former tutor at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, is going to cause more than a few cocktails to be spat out or spilled. “Nobody knows how to write a book,” is how she starts. “I don’t like craft books. It’s possible that I’ve never read one through.” She proceeds to demonstrate how she has more than a few thoughts on the cosy consensus that preceded her. She’s a self-confessedly epigrammatic writer, and her quips yearn to be underlined: “To feel ashamed about writing isn’t interesting, but writing about shame is fascinating.”In this, she’s not your usual wise old literary hand. Instead, she is naughty, perverse, quietly exhibitionist and bracingly unashamed. She reminds me of the teenage older sister of one of my best friends at school. She lived in a world I didn’t. She behaved or misbehaved just as she chose; and sometimes she did the wrong thing, the bad thing, because it was more interesting.McCracken’s is the naughty older sister view of writing. And I agree with it. Writing isn’t about compiling a list of rules and then obeying them. If it were that, then none of the really great writers I’ve ever read would have been interested in it. Not for half a day. Writing is a form of sustained mischievous truancy. It’s not about being good.This attitude will be amazingly freeing for many rule-haunted writers. If you are being poisoned by a particularly cliched piece of workshop feedback, “Show, don’t tell” or “Write what you know”, McCracken will supply an antidote. It will be intense, distilled from experience, and the inoculation may cause you pain. But afterwards, you’ll stop sweating and shivering, and get on with living. Here McCracken is on that most hated and hackneyed piece of advice, “Write every day”: “Every-day writers have a clear answer to the question,How will you get your work done?Me, I harness the power of my own self-loathing.”Not your usual piece of creative writing workshop advice, but true to the particular insanity of this scribbled life.A Long Game: How to Write Fiction by Elizabeth McCracken is published by Jonathan Cape (£14.99).

There is a hero, Ramza – an idealistic nobleman with luscious blond hair who cavorts about the medieval-inspired realm of Ivalice in search of high adventure. But quickly, and with narrative elegance, the picture complicates: peasant revolutionaries duke it out with gilded monarchists; machiavellian plots plunge the kingdom into chaos. Ramza must navigate this knotty political matrix, all while experiencing his own ideological awakening.There is a strong case to be made that Final Fantasy Tactics tells a better story than the landmarkFinal Fantasy VII(which saw Cloud Strife and a ragtag bunch of eco-terrorist pals taking on the shady megacorporation Shinra). And with our real-world political focus shifting from the looming threat of the climate crisis to the more pressing rise of fascism (though the two are inextricably linked), one can make the argument that Tactics is now also the more timely game.In this remastered version, the plot still sparkles. Shakespearean dialogue is now fully voice-acted with delightfully hammy performances: you can practically feel the spittle on your face as one of the game’s royalist rotters delivers an incandescent tirade against the common folk.Within this terrific political tapestry, you engage in the real meat of the game: turn-based combat of rare malleability. Each of your party – Ramza, lowborn Delita, and many more – has their own “job” (essentially, a character class), and these can be changed and subsequently remixed with few limitations (want to create a gun-toting mage? No problem!). This level of customisation, coupled with the exquisite diorama levels where the skirmishes take place, results in a symphonic take on chess.These battles aren’t just riotous fun; they are also poetic. “I’ve been dealt a hand. I simply play it,” says one foe during a dramatic showdown at a cascading waterfall. The line speaks to the tragedy that gradually surfaces as you play through these square-gridded encounters – the sense that every character has been thrust into a maelstrom of events bigger than themselves. Heroes, villains, and everyone in between are but pawns on the battlefield, hurtling towards their own prefigured date with destiny.The Ivalice Chronicles is not interested in narrative flexibility; its plot does not bend to the whims of the player likeotherRPGs. The story’s framing – recounted as a historical account in the distant future – makes this abundantly clear. As such, the game is less about fantasy and fairytales than history itself. Forget easy resolutions: here, events simply produce yet more events; trauma begets trauma. It is one battle after another for Ramza and his comrades.This might sound doom-laden, and, in truth, it frequently is. Yet there is no mistaking the moral principles that suffuse writer Yasumi Matsuno’s stirring story of inequality, division, and pig-headed elites who seek to consolidate their already mighty power. Matsuno, who studied foreign policy before becoming an economic reporter, has described Final Fantasy Tactics as a work of “class struggle”. Now, in the time ofNo Kings protestsin the US, theerosion of political rightsin the UK, and thefurther enrichingof the world’s hyperwealthy, the game feels even more resonant.Ramza offers a model for resistance, and also a commentary on the struggle of opposition in such turbulent times. He is principled, uncompromising and always seeks to do right – and his reward is to be deemed a heretic by the most powerful institutions of his time.Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is available now; £39.99Explore more on these topicsGamesFinal FantasyRole playing gamesStrategy gamesPlayStation 4PlayStation 5Nintendo SwitchreviewsShareReuse this content"

His new production,(We indulge in) a bit of roll play, is designed to provoke frank discussions around sex and disability. “People say the right things and that they support equality, but what if you push that into areas that are less comfortable? Like would you ever date a disabled person? Would you marry a disabled person? Would you have sex with a disabled person? Some would go, ‘Yeah, of course I would.’ But would they? There’s still discomfort in recognising that disabled people have sex lives.”Softley Gale and his co-writers, Hana Pascal Keegan and Gabriella Sloss, aim to challenge audiences in the show which he is also directing. They hope to counter narratives around disabled people needing charity or pity, and instead show lives that are complex and nuanced. “We don’t see a lot of disabled characters full stop. Seeing them having respectful, enjoyable sex is almost unheard of. By doing that in the ways that we do, we’re being quite provocative,” he says.The playfully named production follows Ben, a young disabled man, portrayed by Ed Larkin (star of the West End musicalThe Little Big Things). Ben juggles living at home with his parents alongside being at university and having an occasional girlfriend, and the play explores the limitations and expectations that come with this. “He is dependent upon his parents for his care needs, and to get out and about,” says Softley Gale. “His mum and dad make presumptions about him and what he can do. Those presumptions can actually be quite wrong and misguided.” A big presumption is around sex. It’s a theme that the Glasgow-based Birds of Paradise has explored before, including inWendy Hoose, a comedy about two young people – including a physically disabled woman – seeking a one-night stand.View image in fullscreenMisplaced presumptions … a scene from Wendy Hoose.Photograph: Eamonn McGoldrickAn intimacy coordinator, Vanessa Coffey, has been involved in the whole process of the new play, starting with a workshop to explore the idea and address the production’s topics sensitively. As the play developed, part of Coffey’s job was ascertaining “what we need to tell prospective performers the piece is going to be, what sorts of things they might be asked to explore. It’s essentially about consent, that everybody knows the piece of work that we’re making, and allowing people to feel that the safety scaffolding is there.” She highlights that it’s also important to ensure audiences feel safe with what they’re watching.The production addresses the subject of sex sensitively, using humour and allowing the audience to see themselves in the work. “But we also then take them to places that challenge them a little bit, and we ask questions that are difficult to grapple with,” Softley Gale explains. “That’s all that theatre can do. It’s not very good at giving solutions or answers. We actually haven’t got the answers, but I think it’s good at asking questions.”View image in fullscreen‘Graphic with purpose’  … the poster for (We indulge in) a bit of roll play.Illustration: Laura WhitehouseThe play shows Ben’s parents having “a lot of sexual agency, a lot of access to sex,” says Softley Gale. “And then we see this young guy, Ben, who maybe doesn’t have the same access.” The play, he explains, features frank sexual content. “The opening scene depicts the parents having sex on their kitchen table, complete with chocolate sauce. The script includes an OnlyFans livestream sequence where Ben performs solo sex work. There’s extensive sexual dialogue throughout, escalating from flirtation to explicit descriptions of penetration, body fluids and various sexual acts. The play also depicts conversations about sex work, kink culture, and includes references to sex clubs, baby oil wrestling, and various sexual scenarios.” He stresses that the sexual content serves the play’s central themes about disabled people’s right to sexual expression, agency and visibility. “It’s graphic with purpose rather than gratuitous. The production will use theatrical techniques – lighting, staging, suggestion – to present these moments with both honesty and artistry appropriate for adult theatre audiences.”Softley Gale hopes the production will help make those audiences consider their preconceptions, including asking how physically disabled people have sex. “We’re not trying to ignore that question or say that’s a bad question,” he says. “How do we get that conversation moving forward? If we try to pretend it’s not a thing, that doesn’t help anyone. If we shy away from questions, we give the audience permission to shy away as well. It’s about making people uncomfortable in a comfortably uncomfortable way.”“There’s a lot of curiosity that sits around what people might perceive as taboos,” says Coffey. “If people leave this space wanting to have conversations about what they saw, that will be the big outcome.” Addressing these themes in theatre isn’t just about challenging perceptions, but about making disabled lives more visible, explains Softley Gale. “A lot of the feedback we get from disabled audience members is, ‘I’ve never seen my story told before’ – and that’s a really powerful thing.”(We indulge in) a bit of roll play is atTramway, Glasgow, 19-21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreDisabilitySexnewsShareReuse this content"

Could Vecna still come back with a secret episode?Benjie GoodhartThu 8 Jan 2026 08.07 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 08.19 ESTShareIn recent days, my 14-year-old daughter has been exhibiting signs of becoming a conspiracy theorist. But this isn’t your common or garden Twin-Towers-grassy-knoll-moon-landings business. She has fallen, entirely and joyfully, for a conjecture known as Conformity Gate – and she is not the only one.For the non Gen-Zers out there, Conformity Gate is the theory that the much-vaunted finale of Netflix behemothStranger Things, released on 1 January in the UK, wasn’t the real finale at all.Fuelled by energy drinks and pasty from lack of sunlight, fans of the show have been beavering away in basements around the world to produce a fantastical hypothesis that the finale’s rather soupy 40-minute epilogue was all an illusion created by the show’s mind-controlling villain Vecna. A secret final episode, showing what had really happened, would be released on 7 January, at 8pm US Eastern Time (1am in the UK).Explaining the labyrinthine intricacies of the “evidence” cited by Conformiteers would take thousands of words. Essentially, it involves some people sitting with their hands in their lap wearing orange graduation gowns, too many people wearing glasses, a roll of dice totalling seven, a dial changing colour, a wonky milkshake-timeline, strategically positioned exit signs, a woman having short hair, a door handle switching sides, a character missing some scars, and one of the characters remarking that the town of Hawkins “feels different” – hardly surprising, as it’s no longer full of murderous monsters, cracks in the earth, and a psychopath made out of tree roots.View image in fullscreen‘X-A-LIE’ … Max Mayfield (Sadie Sink) places her binder on the shelf in the finale of Stranger Things: Season 5.Photograph: NetflixAs the fans’ Hive Mind produced ever more fanciful theories, a screenshot from the final episode was widely circulated on social media. It showed the principal characters’ Dungeons & Dragons binders lined up on a shelf. If you read some of the letters going across each binder, it says “X-A-LIE”.This was not an indication that you shouldn’t believe everything you read on the site formerly known as Twitter, but instead proof that everything that happened in Dimension X (AKA The Abyss) was a lie. Or something. I watched every episode and I don’t even know what that means.But I don’t need to know. Because it turns out the screenshot had been doctored. In the show itself, the row of letters read XAILE, which may just have been an exhortation for the show’s more enthusiastic conspiracists to remember to breathe out.As hysteria mounted, Netflix posted a cryptic message on its social media accounts, saying “Your Future is on its way. #WhatNext Jan 7, 2026”. This, along with a belief in the significance of the number seven in the show (Will Byers made a dice roll of seven just before being taken by a demogorgon in Stranger Things’ first ever episode), led fans to believe that the new show would drop on 7 January. Indeed, at the appointed hour last night, so many fans tuned in to Netflix to check that the site reportedly crashed, leaving it showing an error message. Netflix was overloaded by fans searching for a show that didn’t exist.View image in fullscreen‘The screenshot had been doctored’ … The real image of the Stranger Things binders.Photograph: NetflixIt was never going to. In recent days, Netflix had added, in stern capital letters, to its Instagram bio the message: “ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING”.Interviewed by Variety on 1 January, the show’s creators, Matt and Ross Duffer, addressed some of the fan theories regarding the final series. “The show has just grown so massive. Online, there’s just so much misinformation. Just tons of it. We would be here for hours trying to bat down the stuff that was not true. But at the end of the day, hopefully the work speaks for itself, and it is the show that Ross and I wanted to make.”But perhaps the work did speak for itself – and not in an entirely good way. It seems likely that the myriad fans suggesting that there was a secret finale still to come were motivated by disappointment. For some, the ending was too saccharine (although I liked the passing of the baton to the younger generation of D&D-ers, a throwback to the Friends finale where they walked into Central Perk to find their usual seats taken by a younger group).In the end, Conformity Gate was probably the result of a number of things: the Duffer brothers’ desire to get people discussing the show by putting in red herrings; a desire to leave things open-ended, preserving an opportunity to milk the cash cow in the future; and, most shamefully, a degree of sloppiness.Certainly, there were mistakes. The doorknob, the dial and the missing scars were simply continuity errors. Meanwhile, we were expected to believe that Hopper returned to his job as police chief in spite of having killed that many US soldiers? Why did we never get to see the comeuppance of Linda Hamilton’s dastardly Dr Kay? And what became of poor Vickie, Robin’s erstwhile girlfriend?Little wonder thata petition on Change.orgdemanding that Netflix release the full finale, including deleted scenes, reached nearly 400,000 signatures in a matter of days. Remarkably, after a 128-minute final episode including a seemingly infinite number of endings, key story arcs were just forgotten, and fans were left feeling short-changed.Today, many will be feeling bereft that no new episode landed overnight (though I suspect many more were just having a bit of fun). But others, it seems, are soldiering on with their theory. The latest suggestion, my daughter informs me, is that the behind-the-scenes documentary landing on 12 January will actually be a meta-episode, where fiction has seeped into the reality of the actors’ lives (as happened in A Nightmare on Elm Street 7). The “documentary” will be the secret final episode. Hmm.Looking back on the Conformity Gate craze, and how it gripped the show’s younger viewers, we can at least be grateful for one thing. Imagine, for a moment, that the mythical final episode had been predicted to land at midnight on6/7January: the two most irritating Gen Z crazes of recent times, merging into one. It doesn’t bear thinking about.Explore more on these topicsStranger ThingsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When you write songs, do you think about how listenersmightcarry them into their own lives, or do the songs stop being yours after they are done?VanearleWhen I wrote [2019’s] Watch Me Get Married, I thought maybe people would have that as their wedding song. But mostly it’s inconceivable what people are gonna do with a song. I don’t think about it too much because there are 100,000 places where it’s gonna live. Have I ever heard about any inappropriate uses of songs? I think having Our Anniversary as a wedding song is a little surprising, but maybe they’re realists.Smog: Our Anniversary – videoAs an appreciator ofdub, if you could spend a week in a studio to collaborate with anydubartist at their peak, who would you go for?albertoaylerI’d have to say Lee “Scratch” Perry just because he was so crazy. He was like a little kid – just infectious excitement. I think that he would have been easy to hang out with. But also, King Tubby was such a minimalist and I’d be curious about how he determined when enough was enough – investing so much power in the fewest elements. Have Fun With God [the 2014 dub remix album of 2013’s Dream River] was very traditional – all the moves were taken from 70s Jamaican records. Maybe once is enough. But I do like the idea of recycling recorded things to make something else – that’s what initially attracted me to dub. If I did [a new remix album], I may do achopped and screwedrecord.I’ve heard that you lived in Knaresborough, NorthYorkshire, roughlybetweenthe ages of 12and 15. What did you do for fun at that time?pinballfilmsI wasn’t quite a teenager, more like age seven to 12. There was a lot of farmland that we weren’t really supposed to be on, but we couldn’t help ourselves. And there was a particular farmer that had the most land, and he had orchards. I loved being in the apple orchards with all the trees lined up. The farmer would often come chasing us. Mostly it was climbing walls, going places that we weren’t supposed to be, exploring the river and fishing. In the last year I was there, I started getting into music and going to record stores. Moving from Maryland, the biggest culture shock was that when you’re in America, you’re just one of the guys, but when you’re in England in the 70s and you’re an American, you’re kind of from another planet. A lot of the [popular] music and TV was American. People were watching Dallas, The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman and Starsky & Hutch. In a way, [being American] was like being a movie star. England at the time was a rough place compared with what I was used to, like that movie Kes. There would be gangs of punks roaming around and causing trouble, like A Clockwork Orange.What do you think are good ways to support musicians besides going to concerts? In other words: is it time to leave Spotify?fredrikstaiI heard you watched The Sopranos during lockdown. Is being in the music business like being in the mob?ekaterinanoviaObviously, buying merchandise or records. Is it time to quit Spotify? We don’t really have a choice. Someone else asked if the business is like the mob. I’ve been on an independent label [Drag City] all my life, which is avoiding the mafia. But then streaming happened and basically we were coerced into putting all of our music on streaming services. Drag City did hold out for 10 years or something. Then finally, with all the bands’ consents, they gave in – and they would be out of business now if they hadn’t. That, to me, feels a little bit like coercion or mafia techniques. In a way, they were forced into cooperating with this new thing where someone else is in charge of the money. That was the first time that it felt a little like The Sopranos.View image in fullscreenBill Callahan performs in Spicewood, Texas, 2025.Photograph: Astrida Valigorsky/WireImageYour records have been releasedon Chicago’s Drag City formore than30 years. What would you say makes this label a perfect fit for your music and way of working?TheVisitorI always think that we grew up together. We both started out at the same time and we figured out what we wanted, what our parameters were, what we were willing to do and do together. Especially at the beginning, they would confer with me about all the next moves and growth they were considering. As I did more records, there were new situations that I was facing as I got slightly more popular, and that was all stuff that we worked out together. I basically feel like it’s my label. In a very broad sense, I have complete control. If I gave them a silent record and said, “put this out”, they would do it without question. I think that’s extremely rare. No one can give me more freedom, there’s no reason to go anywhere else.Who are for you some of the funniest lyricists, or lyrics?bertisgRandy Newman, and songs like Love Story (You and Me) where he sings: “Someday he may be President / If things loosen up.” I heard that song decades ago and that was a very impactful line, just to know that you could put that much humour in a song, and it’s not just a laugh – it also has meaning to it. I remember when I was a kid and I heard Short People – that’s the kind of humour that a lot of people are offended by. His sense of humour is very sly, but also social commentary. [Pavement’s] Stephen Malkmus is pretty funny in a very out-there way – he has some straight humour songs, but a lot of his lyrics make me laugh because they’re verbal acrobatics.Bill Callahan’s 20 best songs – ranked!Read moreAcross your career, you seem to have deepened your understanding of how you can use your tools. Can you connect with the idea of being a craftsman in how youapproach your work?savaleI’ve always hated that word when it comes to music, and it just does not apply to me. If that person could see me in my life, they would not even dream of calling me a craftsman. I picture a craftsman as the guy who’s got his tools all labelled in boxes and shelves and knows where everything is. I’m more of a drunk professor; I like happenstance and coincidence and mistakes. I know nothing about synthesisers, but I’ll randomly pick one and turn it on and start recording. I press some buttons and play something and somehow try to make it work. I’m only precise about writing the lyrics and then the rest of it is more like: throw it at the wall. I don’t know anything about chord progressions. It’s more being open and receiving things from wherever they come from. I feel more like a medium. A craftsman builds something out of nothing. And I think I receive things that are already built, and make sure the reception is accurate.Bill Callahan: Partition – videoIn the song Partition [from 2022] you sing, “Meditate, ventilate … Microdose, change your clothes / Do what you’ve got to do”, which stuck with me. Do you meditate? Ventilate? Microdose? Change your clothes? I meditate, too, and feel the space in your songs somehow.aimzo_d0tYeah – I think exercise, socialise, externalise … those are all the things that make sure that everything is flowing correctly and nothing is blocked or hidden. Meditation is crucial for me. Right after I moved to Austin around 2004, I think that’s when I started meditating. That was the first time I’d had a house and it was quiet enough. Up until then I’d been in apartments with thin walls. I was trying to reinvent my whole life, and so meditation was part of that. I wanted a backyard and a driveway, a piano. Kind of settling down. I was kind of a late bloomer, so once I hit my 20s, I wanted to explore the country and have the fun that I didn’t have in my teenage years. Then I had enough of that.Bill Callahan: ‘I can’t die – life is too good, it can’t end’Read moreWould you allow your voice to be licensed for AI-produced songs?Nicens_boiNo. Does it scare me? It does. It’s just sad to me, really, the way people are devaluing everything with AI. I mean, we’re here. We’re humans on Earth. That’s the fun of it, being a human that doesn’t know everything and trying things out, experimenting and exploring. Being able to do everything without any effort is not fun. When some artist that you like makes a new record, it’s exciting – maybe they did something even better than the last time, or maybe they really fucked up and that’ll be really interesting and give a new dimension to that person. AI is never going to make anything worth thinking about. You could make 100 quote-unquote “Frank Sinatra” records but [sighs] … it’s just not human. Creating things involves growing as a human, and that’s not what AI is about.View image in fullscreenA human on Earth …Photograph: Hanly Banks CallahanHave you ever written a perfect song in your dreams, as happens in[2009’s] Eid Ma Clack Shaw?staypositiveYeah – I’ve heard the most heavenly melodies and try to hold on to them in my subconscious. They’re never there when I wake up. I’ve heard amazing lines that disappear, like invisible ink. I’ve been trying to be in closer communion with my subconscious – before I go to sleep, I ask my dreams to show me something. It works sometimes. Dreams and music are very close kin, they’re these intangible things that hit you very hard. They’re both spirit things. It’s crazy that we dream and we pay so little attention to it, like they used to say: “Oh, it’s just the brain cleaning itself out.” There’s gotta be more to it than that.My Days of 58is released on 27 February via Drag City.Explore more on these topicsBill CallahanFilm & Music reader interviewAmericanafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now back with an adventurous new album, he talks about the man who stole his identity and why he doesn’t care for ‘good taste’Thu 8 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTShareAfew years ago, a stranger stole Sébastien Tellier’s identity. The impostor – sporting the musician’s trademark sunglasses and beard – posed as the Frenchman at fancy parties, nabbed free clothes from Chanel (Tellier used to be an ambassador for the brand), and even held meetings with bosses from Hollywood studios (Tellier has dabbled in soundtrack work). “He [also] took a lot of drugs like ketamine in front of a lot of people,” Tellier continues with perfect nonchalance from his Paris home, sunglasses and beard present and correct. The crime was only rumbled when a confused woman got in touch to tell him she’d been partying with “Sébastien Tellier” in France only to see on Instagram that the real Tellier was playing a gig in Belgium.This experience has been alchemised into pop gold via Copycat, a sparkly synthpop workout on his upcoming eighth album, Kiss the Beast. “My name you steal it / Hat and success,” Tellier croons for the song’s chorus over a chunky bassline, disco strings and synths that crackle and spark like fireworks. It’s typical Tellier, mixing the serious – things got so bad with the impostor that Tellier was briefly forced to show his passport at the school gates when collecting his two small children – with the playfully naive.It’s a trait he’s employed throughout his career, be it pairing the majestic, Tony Allen-assisted dreamscape La Ritournelle, a “pop classic” according to friend Nicolas Godin of Air, with a song called Ketchup vs Genocide on 2004’s Politics; or, four years later, performing his sleek Beach Boys-meets-electropop single Divine, co-produced by Daft Punk legend Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, at Eurovision. It’s hard to imagine anyone else associated with the ultra-cool French touch scene going near the derided song contest, let alone arriving on its stage via a small golf cart.View image in fullscreenSébastien Tellier at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games opening ceremony.Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty“I don’t want to be the slave of good taste,” he says, a plume of cigarette smoke haloing him as he holds his phone under his chin.“To be just Eurovision, it’s a nightmare,” he continues. “But to be just [fancy Parisian hotel] Plaza Athénée, it’s a nightmare also. Sometimes it’s super-good to have just a burger.”The title and artwork for Kiss the Beast, the latter shot by revered French fashion photographer Jean-Baptiste Mondino, may explore Tellier’s “paradox and deep duality” but musically it also features comical snatches of sheep baaing (on Mouton), while the lounge jazz of Loup (or “wolf’) is constantly disrupted by bursts of frantic electronic wig-outs. It’s about balance, Tellier thinks: “You know, it’s very important to feel comfortable with all the aspects of life.”My favourite album when I was 20 was Rock Bottom by Robert Wyatt. In my 50s, I really love to listen to Lionel Richie or Barbra StreisandLast year Tellier turned 50, a milestone age that seemed to unlock something in him. Aware that “the rest of the way before death is not so long”, he wanted this album to reach a bigger audience. Hence why Kiss the Beast features collaborations with the likes of Nile Rodgers and Kid Cudi, plus production input from Oscar Holter, the Max Martin affiliate whose bulging pop CV includes Blinding Lights by the Weeknd. Holter’s presence feels like an interesting mainstream move for an artist seemingly happy on the periphery of pop, I suggest to Tellier.“It’s hard to explain, but in a way I want to respect my age,” he says. “My favourite album when I was 20 was Rock Bottom by Robert Wyatt. You know, this kind of ‘I’m a crazy guy, I feel bad, I hate the world’.” He sucks deeply on his second cigarette of our time so far. “But step by step, in my 50s, now I really love to listen to Lionel Richie, or Barbra Streisand.”Tellier’s early love for Wyatt mirrored his mindset growing up in the “tough” area of Cergy-Pontoise, north-west of Paris. “I was afraid to see bad guys. I was afraid on the bus. I was afraid at the train station and all this shit,” he says, getting up and pacing around his house. A newly built city, Cergy-Pontoise offered only a concrete life. “So no culture, no soul. I was very sad. If you are in the city but near the sea, for example, you can dream with the sea. But in this new city, in the far suburbs of Paris, there were no mountains, no beautiful river, no ocean, nothing like that.”He says it felt like only he and his father listened to music, cutting them off as this strange little “island of culture”. After he moved out, into his first “shitty” apartment in Paris, he started to make his own music on a four-track recorder. He was also drinking heavily. “I had a very kind of savage life,” he says. “I partied a lot and I didn’t take care of myself at all.” One night, all that changed after he saw the music video for Air’s Kelly Watch the Stars on TV. “I felt a connection between me and their music,” he explains. “Like pop, electro, and at the same time international, but French.”Noticing that the name of Air’s then-label, Source, was shown on the screen, a few days later Tellier took his demo tape to their offices. After a short meeting, his dark-hued instrumental Fantino was added to a compilation the label was releasing, nestled alongside Phoenix and various other “cool French dudes”. Shortly after that, Air launched their own label, Record Makers, and signed Tellier. He would also support them on tour in 2001. “We played almost 2,200 times,” he says, still in awe. “This part of my life was really important because with them I discovered the world and with them I escaped my old, sad world.”View image in fullscreenSébastien Tellier in his golf cart at the 2008 Eurovision song contest final.Photograph: Andrej Isaković/AFP/Getty ImagesAcross a career that’s now spanned a quarter of a century, he’s never looked back, playfully crisscrossing genres and exploring concepts. He’s keen to clarify the latter. “Not ‘It’s a concept, oh, that will be boring,’” he smiles. “No, no, no. For me, it’s very important to bring some glamour to my concepts, because just concept, it’s too boring. Conceptual movie, conceptual everything, it’s boring!” On 2012’s My God Is Blue, for example, he mused on religion dressed like a cult leader, while 2020’s Domesticated – its title suggested by his friend, the movie director Sofia Coppola – celebrated his life with his wife, Amandine Martinon de La Richardière, and children via the prism of songs such as the hypnotic sci-fi opus Domestic Tasks.His biggest WTF moment remains that Eurovision performance, however. Not that Tellier feels any shame. He knew he wasn’t going to win (he finished 19th) and only did it because “a lot of people watch the TV show”. If anything, he wanted his performance to be weirder; his initial plan was to drive his golf cart straight off the stage.The 20 greatest French touch tracks – ranked!Read more“I had the opportunity to create something huge like an accident at the Eurovision. I thought: ‘I will be so famous with this crash that it will be great in front of millions and millions of people.’” Unsurprisingly, it was deemed too dangerous by the show’s producers. Instead, he arrived in the golf cart carrying an inflatable globe full of helium which he duly inhaled. “But nobody noticed; it was not visual enough,” he says. “Nobody saw it. Nobody talked about it.”It’s that disconnect between idea and execution, artist and audience, that Tellier can’t stand. I ask him if he agrees with Godin’s appraisal of La Ritournelle, a song that has soundtracked everything from sports montages to a L’Oréal advert to an episode of Come Dine With Me, and – at 63m plays on Spotify alone – his biggest streaming hit by far. “Yes, [it is a classic] in a way, because it’s an important song for a lot of people,” he says, briefly switching nicotine for caffeine. “They play this song at weddings, or at funerals. You know, for important moments in life. So it has a special place in the heart of the audience.”Creating a bridge to them is what he’s always tried to do. Only now it’s being done via big pop songs about impostors, wolves and sheep.Kiss the Beast is out30 January; Tellier playsKoko, London, 23 March.Explore more on these topicsMusicDance musicElectronic musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve worked hard, am in the process of changing careers to be more of service to others, gone to therapy. I go to the gym, eat the right food, have built things I’m proud of. And yet nothing sticks. Every time I hit a goal, there’s this tiny burst of pride, then it’s gone.Lately, I’ve noticed how tangled this has become with how I see my body. I’ve been training and eating well for ages, but I still feel ashamed when I look in the mirror,as though I’ve failed some invisible test. People tell me I look great but it doesn’t land. There’s this constant hum of “not good enough” running underneath everything, no matter what I do.The worst part is that I know what’s going on. I can name it: shame, a need for external validation. But naming it doesn’t make it go away. It feelsas though I’m performing endless autopsies on my self-esteem, again and again, searching for a cause of death.How do I stop living like this? Howdo I build a sense of worth that isn’t constantly slipping throughmy fingers?Eleanor says:The new year brings so many ways to establish, at last, that we’re enough. New calendar, new routine, new diet, new me. So many are physical: bodies as a symbol of worth, achievement, discipline. For a lot of people, exactly as you’ve described, the promise doesn’t quite work – it starts to feel like filling a sieve. I keep pouring in evidence that I’m attractive, productive,so why don’t I feel like I’m enough? Why isn’t it working?The first of my friends is having a baby and it makes me feel pressured. How do I reframe this?Read moreBear with me on this, but I think looking into the distance can be a useful way of correcting that. We are mortal. We are going to age. You’ll have wrinkles and grey hair. You’ll feel old. People you love will die. You’ll die.I know this sounds morbid; “Well, you’ll die” was probably not what you thought you’d hear in response to “How can I build a sense of self-worth?”But I don’t mean it just as nihilism. The reality of death does force some clarity about what’s valuable about us; clarity that can go missing in the daily grasping for control over our schedules, our bodies. What do you want said at your funeral? What will the people who love you miss about you? Almost certainly the answer is not how much you went to the gym; which meal prep method you used; how well you did the things you were Supposed To Do To Be Good Enough. Here he lies, may he rest in peace; he ate the right food. We gather to cremate her; such a small waist.The things you will be cherished for in age and mortality will be idiosyncratic.They’ll be the unique combination of things that onlyyouare. They will not be how well you adhere to universal standards – especially not ones about fitness, or the way your body looks.I find thinking about this can be a useful way to build self-worth that actually belongs to you. We can make a weird mistake when we’re trying to prove our worth to ourselves: we measure on short timelines, and by universal standards. Life gets anxiously assessed by the day, the hour: was my time optimised, my macros hit, my emails sent? This doesn’t build a sense of self-esteem, because ticking these boxes is not what we truly value in people, including ourselves – not when we think about a whole life.Sometimes you have to look through the eyes of the people closest to you to get the proper read on why you’re worthy of esteem. That perspective looks at the individual, one-off person you are. It doesn’t look at how well you measured up to generic expectations of achievement or appearance.If building self-esteem in your own eyes is difficult, it could help to look at how you’d like to be missed when you’re gone.This letter has been edited for clarity and length.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingLeading questionsAustralian lifestyleMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nothing melts away a stressful day like whizzing down a hill; not having to think about petrol prices, one-way streets or parking spots does wonders for my mood.When it came to maintenance, though, my attitude was decidedly timid. If something worked, that was good enough for me – how it did so was simply none of my business. Strange noises and glitches were things I figured would either go away on their own or deteriorate into something I’d hand off to an expert. I’m not proud to admit I’ve walked my bike half an hour to a bike shop to fix a puncture more than once; my chain was perpetually caked in gunk because I thought even looking at it the wrong way might break something.My rookie era: I’m learning to swim in the ocean, braving the waves and marine lifeRead moreWhen a nasty stack wrote my bike off, I needed something cheap to take its place. For a cool $50 I picked up a late-70s Malvern Star – it had rust spots and crumbling tyres, but it rode like a dream and I instantly fell in love. Maybe it was how little money I’d spent, or its no-frills, low-tech parts, but I suddenly felt the urge to tinker.Guided by little more than YouTube tutorials and exasperated phone calls to my dad, I installed new handlebars and brakes, a new chain, a rear rack and a front basket, all with second-hand parts rummaged from the bins at my localcommunity bike co-op. I was hooked; the ability to figure out how each part informs the whole, to diagnose a problem myself and fix it for next to no money, generated a sense of self-satisfaction powerful enough to get me up a medium-sized hill.looping video of alan spinning bike wheelLast summer I got even more ambitious; wanting a project to get stuck into without dismantling my main commuter, I bought an old steel frame and built it up from scratch, spray-can paint job and all. Making a working machine out of nothing is intensely gratifying, and I learned a lot – not least that when it comes to old bikes, parts are a lot less interchangeable than they might look.It turns out taking off parts, scrubbing off the rust and road grime, then putting them back on isa highly relaxing and enjoyable wayto spend an afternoon. When most of my week is spent looking at words on a screen, it feels meditative to occupy my hands with something practical. I’m still very much a novice and prone to biting off more than I can chew, but learning I’m capable of building and fixing something has increased my confidence in my own abilities across the board. I find myself missing my bike sessions when I’m too busy or the weather is bad – plus, grubby fingers are a great way to avoid doomscrolling.Even when I am on my phone, I’m scrolling differently. There’s a whole world of content dedicated to bike repair, from subreddits where people show off theirclunkers and frankenbikesto detailed repair tutorials,laid-back ride-alongsand wordlessASMR-esque build videos. It’s a positive and easygoing corner of the internet that’s less about Lycra and millisecond gains than about keeping it cheap, chill and cheerful.26:41Experience Sydney's new GreenWay trail on its grand opening in this immersive 360 capture – videoOf course, there have been plenty of occasions where I probably should have relied on my old philosophy of leaving well enough alone. An old bike can be easy enough to make rideable, but making that ride pleasurable can be fiendishly difficult – parts wear out, and replacing one thing can sometimes break another. But even that’s part of the joy of it – I know there’ll be another opportunity to dive back into the parts bin just around the corner.Explore more on these topicsCyclingMy rookie eraAustralian lifestyleHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the gloomiest month of the year? Are they mad?) tend to take our feet off the alcohol pedal and give our livers something of a rest.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Water, of course, is the easiest, cheapest and probably most effective way to detox; it’s also the most boring. We can zap our inner organs with herbal infusions, turmeric/kale/spirulina shots and smoothies, or with the fermented goodness of kombuchas and kefirs, but sometimes the mindful drinking halo of virtue can become too heavy to bear and we want something that feels like a “real” drink. You know, the one at the end of the day when you deserve something cheering, or when you meet your mates in some scuzzy pub or swanky wine bar, and you want a drink for relaxation and pleasure, but still steer clear of the hooch.Booze-free beer is your friend here, and the choice has never been greater. Fortunately, we have come a long way since the days of Barbican,the UK’s first non-alcoholic beerlaunched by Bass in 1979, and a sad, bitter apology for a lager. Most nolo beer (meaning it has at most a 0.5% ABV) is brewed to normal strength, and the ethanol is then removed, either by vacuum distillation or reverse osmosis. This dealcoholisation can be brutal, though, because it also strips out alcohol-soluble flavour and aroma compounds, as well as ethanol’s mouth-filling texture.But now, with the popularity of nolo drinks skyrocketing, investment in R&D has led to leaps in both technology and quality. Even so, these new methods are very expensive, which is why most nolo beers have until recently remained in the hands of the big producers. What’s exciting many brewers now, though, especially small-scale craft operations, is the introduction of cheap, hybridised yeast strains that ferment just a small percentage of the sugars in the mash, so leaving a very low ABV. These, coupled with new biotech products that add aromas, flavours and mouthfeel, make the new generation of nolo beers much more, well, beery.Some new producers such asImpossibrewgo a step further, adding so-called “functional” nootropic ingredients designed to recreate the feelings of relaxation and “beer buzz” that we get after a pint or two. Who cares if their efficacy is merely auto-suggestive? The beers taste good and are at the very least a stimulating topic of pub chat. Having said that, be aware that nolo beers are susceptible to bacterial contamination, so it’s best to stick to cans or bottles, rather than on draught in a grubby bar.

I originally put that down to the lack of time and attention I’d given those poor plants, but I’m now starting to wonder if the soil in my raised garden beds overlooking Lyme Bay in Dorset is actually right for them.I’m not giving up just yet, though, and this year I’ll be trying different varieties in a different bed that I’ve prepared and composted over the winter with seaweed mulch. As luck would have it, however, my friend Rob Corbett came to the rescue a couple of weeks ago by giving me several specimens when he delivered some wine fromhis Castlewood vineyarda few miles away in east Devon. If you know your gourds even a little, you will also know that squashes keep for months, which is handy, because they ideally need to cure and ripen before use. Happily, that also means you can use your crop throughout the long winter months.I suppose that when you grow your own squashes and pumpkins, you potentially get stuck for what to do with them, but the possibilities are almost endless – for example, I recently made a cheesecake topped with a sweet squash relish, as well as a chocolate and pumpkin pie that’s a bit more appealing than the classic American version; I even made a squash cocktail with a new, Kentish version of the classic Italian walnut liqueur, nocino, made byPleasant Land Distillery in Aldington, just outside Ashford. As the base, I used some of the skins, seeds and trimmings left over from making a squash risotto, and added some mezcal to the mix, too – as odd as that might sound, it was really quite delicious.Buying a squash can be a little daunting, especially to the uninitiated, because some of the nice orange ones, such as crown prince and sunshine, are often huge and heavy, and definitely won’t fit into your shopping basket. I suspect that’s why so many shops and supermarkets sell mainly butternut, which is kind of the size of a large swede and will easily go in a shopping bag. Mediterranean and Turkish supermarkets have the right idea, though, because they often sell those nice big squashes in manageable, ready-cut wedges, an added bonus of which is that you can easily see what the flesh is like inside – not to mention how much skin and seeds you’re being expected to pay for.I’ve used a fair amount of squash in today’s recipe for a colourful winter salad, both roasted and shaved, which brings a lovely contrast in textures and flavours to proceedings. I used crown prince, because I had one that was ripe and ready to go, but any ripe, orange-fleshed squash, or a mixture of squashes, would work well.If you like, top the salad with a scattering of toasted reserved pumpkin seeds, or even chop some up and add them to the dressing for a bit of extra crunch.Roast pumpkin and pickled walnut saladServes4 as a side2 tbsp rapeseed oil, or olive oil400g ripe, orangesquash flesh(crown prince, sunshine or butternut), peeled and deseededSalt and black pepperA couple of handfuls small salad leaves, washed and driedA few sprigs of fresh tarragon, leaves picked (optional)4 pickled walnuts, drained (save the liquid) and cut into 1cm diceFor the dressing1 tbsp cider vinegar1 tbsp pickled walnut liquor from the jar3-4 tbsp rapeseed oil, or pumpkin seed oilToasted pumpkin seeds, whole or chopped, to finish (optional)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the oil on a roasting tray and stick it in the oven to heat up. With a vegetable peeler or on a mandoline, shave a third of the squash flesh into ribbons, put them in a bowl of iced water and put in the fridge until needed – they will curl up a little while chilling.Cut the rest of the squash into wedges or rough chunks. Season the squash chunks, then carefully toss them in the hot oil and roast for about 30 minutes, turning once halfway, until tender and lightly coloured all over.Meanwhile, drain and dry the shaved squash, then mix with the salad leaves, tarragon and pickled walnuts. In a small bowl, whisk all the ingredients for the dressing with any leftover oil from the squash roasting tray, then season to taste.Arrange everything in a large bowl or plate, or on individual plates, then spoon over the dressing and serve, perhaps topped with a few toasted pumpkin seeds.Mark Hix is a restaurateur and writer based in Lyme Regis, Dorset.

There are workmen up ladders, hammering, plastering, but I leave my muddy walking boots by the door. There’s no central heating or hot water and Banjo Beale and his husband, Ro, have been camping out here for weeks, but he greets me, dazzlingly debonair, in a burnt orange beanie and fabulous Moroccan rug coat.The 2022 winner of the BBC’s Interior Design Masters, who went on to front his own makeover showDesigning the Hebrides, Banjo’s vibe is more exuberant Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen than quizzical Kevin McCloud. His latest project with Ro, the transformation of a derelict mansion on the small Hebridean island of Ulva into a boutique hotel, is the subject of a new six-part series, airing on BBC Scotland. I’m here for a preview of the finished rooms.Ulva mapAt just 7.5 miles long by 2.5 wide, Ulva, across a narrow strait from the Isle of Mull, was privately owned until recently. When it went on the market in 2018, a community buyout was orchestrated with the aim of attracting people back to Ulva and breathing new life into the island.The first national census in 1841 recorded a population of 570 on the island, but largely owing to the brutal evictions of the Highland Clearances (when lairds forced crofting tenants off the land, replacing them with sheep), by 2015 there were just three adults and two children living here.View image in fullscreen‘Arrested decay’ is the aesthetic Beale was aiming for when restoring Ulva House.Photograph: Shelley Richmond/Hello Halo/BBC ScotlandCommunity buyouts are becoming more common across Scotland, following the example of islands such as Eigg, empowering locals to take control of their futures and save local businesses. Numbers on Ulva have since swelled to 16 – the long-term target is 50 – after an advert was posted inviting applications for settlement here. Now, two Aussies (Banjo and Ro) and their wolfhound/greyhound cross, Grampa, are shining an even brighter spotlight on this remote island and helping to turn its fortunes around.The good thing about Ulva being community owned is we’re all in this togetherBanjo BealeThere has been a house here, once the seat of Clan Macquarie, since the 17th or 18th century. The original property was replaced by a Regency-style mansion at the beginning of the 19th century and, after a fire in the 1950s, it was rebuilt on the same footprint. The elegant, Grade B-listed, modernist mansion (with a nod to Arts and Crafts and Regency-influenced interiors) “has good bones” Banjo tells me, but it was derelict when they first stumbled upon it – and decided to plunge their savings into converting it into a hotel. They have secured a rent and repair lease and part of the profits will be ploughed back into the community. “The good thing about Ulva being community owned,” Banjo explains, “is we’re all in this together.”View image in fullscreenThe couple have also taken on a restaurant, The Boathouse, on Ulva, along with their business partner SamThe pair first washed up in the Hebrides because Ro had a dream of becoming a cheesemaker and they had heard about Sgriob-ruadh (pronounced skrib-rooa), the dairy farm turned award-winning artisan cheesemaker on Mull. Ro learned how to make cheese while Banjo dipped his toe into interior design, doing up the striking Glass Barn cafe with its owner, Chris Reade; rummaging through the old farm buildings for things he could use – and sparking a new passion.The project is a coming together of our styles. We want it to feel bohemian, whimsicalIn the entrance hall of Ulva House, and curving up the grand staircase, a romantic mural features palm trees against a mountainous landscape, painted by the artist Melissa Wickham, while a profusion of towering pot plants is scattered around a bamboo-clad reception desk.“Ro loves tropical stuff,” Banjo smiles. “I’m more classical. The project is a coming together of our styles. We want it to feel bohemian, whimsical.”I follow him into the Library Bar. “I think I am a frustrated antiques dealer,” he admits as I admire the giant zinc and marble-top bar. “I’ve been collecting pieces for years; most of it’s in storage in a huge shed at the cheese farm.”View image in fullscreenBearnus Bothy is a five-mile hike from Ulva’s jetty along a coastal trackBelgium and France are his main hunting grounds; he found the Parisian pitch pine bar near Lyon, a steal at just £1,500. How they got it over from Mull on the tiny passenger ferry is another story. “It had to straddle the boat, then we used a horse float [horse trailer] to get it from the jetty (there are no cars on Ulva) and took the windows out to get it in.”The library is opulent. You can imagine nursing a negroni and thumbing through the pages of some of the old books. Above the fireplace are framed plans Banjo found in a salvage yard, the date 1827, and signed “Macquarie”. Another Macquarie, he tells me, Major General Lachlan Macquarie (1762-1824), who was born on Ulva, became governor of New South Wales.The light-infused Orangery or drawing room is a glorious space peppered with more pot plants, distressed urns, vintage rattan chairs, and unframed oils on the walls. The peeling pale green paint has been painstakingly preserved with a layer of varnish, a Miss Havisham-esque process he explains is called “arrested decay”.View image in fullscreenThe living quarters in Bearnus BothyWhen it opens later in the year, the seven-bedroom hotel will be open seasonally, with Ro doing the cooking. Until then, visitors to the island can take their pick between two off-grid bothies and a revamped hostel. Banjo’s makeover ofCragaig Bothyfor the community featured in an episode of Designing the Hebrides. In fact, the hotel is his third project on Ulva. Last summer, he and Ro, along with a young farmer, charcuterie-maker and baker, Sam, also took on the lease ofThe Boathouse, the white waterfront restaurant by the jetty.It became an instant hit, with people flocking over from Mull for platters of langoustine and lobster perched at picnic tables near the rocks, and meandering along the waymarked walking trails that crisscross the island.The pretty, whitewashed bothy above the beach is a welcome sight after a squally walk – as is the basket full of logs by the fireI’m staying inBearnus Bothyfor the weekend, a five-mile hike from the jetty along a coastal track. It’s run by Andy and Yvette Primrose, who live off-grid on the neighbouring island of Gometra – an island off an island off an island. The couple are climbers – Yvette has tackled the north side of Everest and her book Expedition from the Backdoor is the tale of her 660-mile journey on foot from Shropshire to Knoydart, on the west coast of Scotland. They also run the island’s hostel.The pretty, whitewashed bothy above the beach is a welcome sight after a squally walk – as is the basket full of logs and the pulley above the stove for drying wet clothes. There are just two rooms, a bedroom with old-fashioned twin beds topped with woollen blankets and a kitchen/diner, a bathroom with flushing toilet and Belfast sink in between. There’s also a tin bath, which can be filled with water heated on the wood-burning stove.In front of the fire are two rocking chairs with tartan blankets. Lighting is by candles, tealights and battery-operated fairy lights. There are crocs and wellies by the door. A bookcase is stacked with novels, walking and wildlife guides and games to while away long evenings.Hebridean high: joy, tears and camaraderie on a 100km trek for charity across the Isle of SkyeRead moreFlicking through the visitor book by candlelight, I read about Swallows and Amazons-style family adventures, swimming from the beach below the bothy, sailing trips and picnics. Inspired, I hike over to Gometra, accessed at low tide over the sand, at high tide over a footbridge, scouring the shoreline with binoculars and spotting seals basking on rocks and a family of otters playing in the water. Soaring high above is a hen harrier. There’s not another soul around.Solitary rambles might soon be a thing of the past, of course, now that the island is being “re-peopled”. And, with a hotel opening on the horizon, the future for Ulva is starting to look brighter and a little busier.Accommodation was provided by Bearnus Bothy (airbnb.co.uk), minimum two-night stay from £121.CalMac(calmac.co.uk) ferries sail fromLochalineon the Scottish mainland toFishnish on Mull,from £6.50 return for foot passengers, £25.60 for a car.

You decide who is putting their foot in itFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 8 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 08.45 ESTShareThe prosecution: ZaraMaya covers our floors in dirt, germs and scuff marks. To me, it’s grossLiving with my housemate, Maya, for 14 months has taught me one thing: shoes belong outside. Before you walk into your home, you should take them off and put them on the shoe rack.I believe in these rules, but Maya always walks into our house with her shoes on. I find it repulsive. I keep trying to get her on side: I’ve implemented a strict shoes-off policy in our house, and have also bought a shoe rack so there is a place to store them. But she always forgets.I guess this is her house too, and our argument begs the question: who gets to set the rules at home? In my view, when someone insists on wearing shoes inside the house, chaos is inevitable. By wearing shoes inside, Maya covers our floors in dirt, germs and scuff marks. To me, it’s gross: my family is Moroccan, and over there you always leave shoes at the door or outside. Maya is British and doesn’t get it. She even worries that if we leave our shoes on the shoe rack by our door, they might get stolen.Our home is shared, and everyone should be able to walk barefoot inside without fear of stepping on mudTo me, this shoe thing is about respect. Our home is shared, and everyone should be able to walk barefoot inside without fear of stepping on mud, leaves or dirt from outside. Maya says it doesn’t make any difference to the cleanliness of our house as I have a dog, Rufus, and so we are all equally responsible for the dirt on the floors. But Rufus’s paws don’t hold on to dirt like human shoes. Also, I wipe Rufus’ paws every time we come back from a muddy walk. One time, before we had the rack, I found chewing gum that Maya had stepped in, on Rufus’s bed.Wearing shoes inside is offensive to me and makes the house feel dirty. Every time I glance down and see Maya’s shoes lying around indoors, it’s also a reminder that she is ignoring the rules of shared living, even though she said she’d try to use the rack and wear slippers around the house. For the sake of hygiene, safety and household harmony, I think Maya should use the shoe rack – and take her outside shoes off whenever she’s indoors.The defence: MayaNot every shoe fits neatly on the rack, and sometimes life is a mess and I just forget. That doesn’t make me lazy, or a bad housemateZara loves this wooden shoe rack she bought recently, but I honestly just sail straight past it. I don’t think wearing shoes indoors is evil, and neither is leaving a few pairs on the kitchen floor.I try to leave my shoes in my room, but sometimes I walk through the house and kick them off in the kitchen – it’s not a crime.I guess I’ve grown up wearing shoes around the house. I find it cosy and practical, and I like the way it feels. I don’t do it from the moment I wake up, but if I’m about to go out, I will put my shoes on a bit beforehand. And when I come home I won’t take them off immediately. Zara and I come from different backgrounds, and so have different habits.Zara is offended that I don’t want to use the shoe rack, but from a practical standpoint, not every shoe fits neatly on the rack, and sometimes life is a mess and I just forget. That doesn’t make me lazy, or a bad housemate.I’ll stop wearing my shoes inside when Rufus gets a pair of doggie slippersZara treats the sight of shoes on the floor like a crime scene, and me like a criminal. But some days I’m rushing out, coming home late, or just too tired to line up my boots. It takes time to arrange them and make sure I’m not knocking over any other shoes.This just means we’re living in our home like normal people. Shoes scattered here and there don’t hurt anyone. I also think Zara doesn’t have a leg to stand on about dirty floors because she has Rufus. A dog drags all sorts through a home and she doesn’t have indoor socks for him. I’ll stop wearing my shoes inside when Rufus gets a pair of doggie slippers.I’m against barefoot living indoors, whereas Zara loves that. Bare feet feel a bit hippy, and as we have wooden floors it gets cold in the winter. Yes, I have slippers, but I don’t always want to wear them either, and if you go to take the bins out, they become outdoor shoes anyway.I’m trying to get comfortable in slippers, but I think occasionally wearing shoes inside is harmless. Zara should stop trying to make the shoe rack happen. It’s not for me.The jury of Guardian readersShould Maya stop wearing shoes in the house?It’s not a big ask to remove one’s shoes when coming indoors. Shoes are filthy and carry all kinds of bacteria from public toilets, train stations and pubs that Rufus’s paws won’t.Charlotte, 35I’d suggest a good doormat, removal of really dirty shoes and no bare feet. The most important aspect of this is probably not a scientific or practical one. Zara and Maya need to accept that they are sharing and need to compromise.Christopher, 64Wearing shoes around the house is inherently disgusting. Thesoles of most shoes carry coliform bacteria, as well as pesticides, lead and other pathogens. Maya also disregards Zara’s feelings. The comment about doggy socks is just a tit-for-tat response as Maya isn’t concerned by dirty floors.Adam, 55Although it pains me to rule in favour of Maya, Zara has no right to insist that people who share the house conform to her rules. Rule-making necessitates agreement, and where there is none there is no obligation to comply. Removing your footwear on entering a house is common courtesy, not a law.David, 73If you share a living space with someone, you must be willing to adapt. Maya could adapt by taking her shoes off at the door. It’s less clear how Zara could adapt. Should she start wearing her shoes inside? Should she just chill out? The most sensible adaptation is that Maya takes her shoes off.Eddie, 46Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: shouldMaya take her shoes off at the door?The poll closes on Wednesday 14 January at 9am GMTLast week’s resultsWe asked ifNoah should changethe way he showers.4%of you said yes –Noah is guilty96%of you said no –Noah isinnocentExplore more on these topicsLife and styleYou be the judgefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was a beautiful celebration before the shock of the pandemicSimon HattenstoneThu 8 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareDiane and I had been living together for more than 30 years, and our children were 28 and 26 when we got civilled. We’d never wanted to get married. It seemed a bit too pipe and slippers. It also felt like tempting fate. We were really happy without being married, so why change things? And you can’t have more of a commitment than children. But we always said if they introduced civil partnerships for heterosexual couples, we’d get civilled.I think friends assumed we did it primarily for tax reasons – to ensure that if one of us died, the other wasn’t left in the shit. There was an element of that. But more importantly, we actively wanted to get civilled. It actually felt really romantic – tying the civil knot as an expression of love after all this time together. It was such a beautiful day, in every way. 3 January 2020, just after civil partnerships had been legalised for opposite-sex couples, and we almost made history. We were only the fourth heterosexual couple to be civilled in Haringey. Get in!The ceremony was short and super sweet. We had a lovely registrar (she beamed throughout and said it was the most “joyful” ceremony she’d officiated), we played some of our fave and most appropriate songs, dancing into the room to Jackie Wilson’s(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higherfollowed by Stevie Wonder’sI Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever)and closing with Marvin Gaye’sHow Sweet It is (To Be Loved By You). I was bucketing 30 years’ worth of tears when I made a speech and signed the book.As well as being a great day, with hindsight, we also look back at it as an age of relative innocence. Covid was already circulating, but we were in blissful ignorance about what was round the corner, never having experienced a pandemic before, especially one involving a novel virus.We just had close family there – my sister’s family, Diane’s sister’s family, the mums and Jimmy, who is our unofficially adopted son. We had a huge party planned for March, but it never happened because I got ill and (even if Boris Johnson didn’t think so) we thought it was irresponsible to get so many people together in the pandemic.A few days after the planned party, the country went into lockdown. At the time, it was devastating not being able to get all our friends together. But every negative has an upside (well, lots do). We got to eat more than our share of the food, and gave away the rest of it to homelessness charities. And not having the party has made the ceremony even more of a memorable occasion.I love this picture, taken by our older daughter, Alix, for lots of reasons. I find it really hard to smile naturally for the camera, but this is totally real – my smiliest smile ever. Diane seems pretty happy, too. I also love it because it’s the last time both our mums were together for an event, and both have since died. I’m sure they wanted to ask why we had to get civilled rather than married, but they just enjoyed the day instead. Finally, I love it because our younger daughter Maya is sitting so close to my mum, she looks as if she’s on her knee, which reminds me of old times.Explore more on these topicsFamilyMy favourite family photoCivil partnershipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is a small, community-run charity that works with local farmers, crofters and others to take over “spare” fields and land for wildlife-friendly crops.Some sites are planted with annuals such as cornflower, corncockle, marigold and poppy – important sources of pollen, nectar and flowers that used to grow among the grain crops before herbicides became commonplace. Others, such as this one on a hill farm, have been planted with seed crops that benefit birds and other wildlife during autumn and winter.From afar, the field gleams icy-white, and when I arrive the ground is crunchy underfoot. The black oat and barley stalks are brittle and more of a pale gold, thick and glistening with the hoarfrost – the open and empty seedpods of the fodder radish too. A chaffinch pecks atop a head of millet, and soon I’m watching charms of finches fly down from the surrounding birches to disappear in the vegetation. Some birds alight on the stalks, and when they take off again they’re joined by 20 to 30 more birds that have been skulking below.View image in fullscreenA flock of linnets.Photograph: Amanda ThomsonMy neighbour reckons this field has seen flocks of a thousand or more birds this winter. Mainly chaffinches, but greenfinches and goldfinches too, and – an exciting sight for me – a few wintering bramblings. It’s remarkable how these birds, so often overlooked as prosaic, gain new fascination in these numbers.As if from nowhere, a new flock appears – perhaps a hundred linnets. I think of the aptness ofJohn Jamieson’s entryin his 1867 Dictionary of the Scottish Language: “Havoc-burds. Those large flocks of small birds, which fly about the fields after harvest; they are of different species, though all of the linnet tribe.” They flock from treetop to field to tree and split into squads and platoons, before coming together in a company on the topmost branches of a rowan. It’s mesmerising to watch this repeating in the lowering sun. I stay until my feet are numb.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsBirdsCountry diaryWildlifeWinterRural affairsAnimalsWalkingFarmingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’d describe this one as majestic and proud. It is confident that it can say exactly what it wants and needs to say. The volume is amazing without deafening you. They’ve brightened up the sound a bit and it fits the space perfectly.”View image in fullscreenJed Hughes showcases the ‘amazing’ Britton organ.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianThe instrument was built in 1955 bymaster organ builders Harrison & Harrisonafter two of its predecessors were destroyed by fires in 1898 and 1945.Created for civic rather than religious purposes, it was played at what was then known as the Colston Hall for more than 60 years, becoming a centrepiece of the city’s musical heritage.When a major refurbishment of the venue began in 2018, Harrison & Harrison was asked to restore the organ, one of the few of its kind still working.Its staff carefully removed every pipe, valve and bellow, catalogued each of the many thousands of components and transported them almost 300 miles north to the company’s workshop in Durham.There, decades of grime and grit – plus nicotine staining – were scraped away and repairs made. Some of the work was heavy, some intricate – the largest pipe is 10 metres long, the smallest the size of a little finger.More than 1,000 pneumatic motors were refitted with new leather and the console, which features four keyboards, was rebuilt and mounted on a frame, making it easier to move around. The hope is that rock bands as well as classical musicians will use it in their shows.The revampedBristolBeacon reopened in November 2023 but it has taken until now to get the organ ready, which included “voicing it” – making sure it precisely fits the venue’s main space, the Beacon Hall, which holds about 2,000 people. It is loud but can also produce subtle string and woodwind sounds.View image in fullscreen‘The volume is amazing without deafening you,’ says Jed Hughes of the newly restored historic organ.Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianOn Sunday, thecelebrated organist and broadcaster Anna Lapwoodwill play to a sold-out crowd but in the meantime, it has been up to Hughes to keep the organ match ready.“The killer with organs is that if they sit and don’t get played, everything stops,” said Hughes, who describes himself as organ janitor. “Regular use is the best thing for an instrument.”So he has been coming in every week, kicks off his shoes, preferring to play in his socks, and performs for about three hours to an empty concert hall. “Problems may develop like a note sticking,” he said. “When that happens I notify Harrison & Harrison and it’s normally a matter of poking out a bit of dust or something and then it’s fine again.”Among the stories that have been highlighted during the restoration project was how in 1909, suffragettes hid in one of the Britton organ’s predecessors overnight to disrupt a political speech to call for votes for women.The idea now is to make the organ more accessible to Bristol citizens and in Februarypeople are being invited to join a choir, even if they have no prior experience of performing in public, and sing along on stage with the organ.A new scholarship programme is already training the next generation of young Bristol organists, trying to make sure organs remain relevant and loved.Three of them, Joshua, Christopher (both 15) and Jenna, 13, visited this week as Hughes filled the hall with music. “It sounds marvellous,” said Christopher. “It fills the hall so well.” Jenna plays the piano, drums and clarinet but loves the organ. “It’s got lots of buttons, stops. It’s fun to play.”Simon Wales, the chief executive of Bristol Beacon, described the Britton organ as a restored jewel. “Its history is woven deeply into the cultural life of Bristol. The new sound is colossal.”Explore more on these topicsBristolHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

The US Africa Command branch of the US militarysaidon 25 December that its “initial assessment is that multiple Isis terrorists were killed in the Isis camps”.Malik Samuel, a researcher with Good GovernanceAfrica, said he had spoken to a Lakurawa member who said about 100 fighters were killed in a forest camp in the Tangaza area of Sokoto state. He said he was told that about 200 were missing, with many of the remaining fighters now trying to cross into Niger. This could not be independently confirmed.View image in fullscreenThe effects of an airstrike in Offa, Nigeria. It is not known how many fighters were killed despite Donald Trump hailing ‘numerous perfect strikes’.Photograph: Abiodun Jamiu/AFP/Getty ImagesResidents of Nukuru, a village about 6 miles from the reported camp,told the BBCthat fighters on about 15 motorcycles had fled through the community, riding three to a bike.Missile debris fell on empty farmland about 60 miles south in the town of Jabo, which local peoplesaidhad never been attacked by Lakurawa. Debris also reportedlydamaged a hotel500 miles south of Tangaza, injuring three workers.It remains unclear why the US specifically targeted Lakurawa, which operates in a rural, underdeveloped and almost entirely Muslim area in the north-west near the Niger border. Most violence in the area is perpetrated by armed gangs known as bandits.Trump had previouslyaccused the Nigerian governmentof failing to stop the killing of Christians, an important theme for his evangelical base. Two US officialstold the New York Timesthat the airstrikes were a one-off aimed at allowing Trump to claim he was going after a group that had killed Christians.View image in fullscreenA screengrab of an X post by the US Department of Defense showing a missile launch.Photograph: US Department of Defense/AFP/Getty ImagesMurtala Abdullahi, a Nigerian security consultant, also said Lakurawa was probably a symbolic target. “How do you establish a link that [a] bandit group has been hitting the Christian community?” he asked. “That’s difficult. But if you hit a jihadist group then you don’t need to establish a link.”Abdullahi said he did not know why the US had chosen to hit Lakurawa rather than Boko Haram, which is far more notorious internationally and attacks both Christians and Muslims.Since the airstrikes, global attention around Trump’sunpredictable, militarised foreign policyhas turned to Venezuela, where US forcesabducted Nicolás Maduroon 3 January, and Greenland, where Trump and other senior US officials haveexpressed renewed interestin a US takeover.Very little is known conclusively about Lakurawa, from the year it started to the number of fighters. Even the meaning of its name, which some analysts say is a Hausa pronunciation of “les recrues” (“the recruits” in French), is not an agreed fact.Nigeria designated the groupas a terrorist organisationin January 2025. Some analystssaythe group is linked to Islamic State’s Sahel branch. However, Samuel said he had interviewed Lakurawa members who professed loyalty to al-Qaida.Researchers agree that the group’s senior members are from Mali or Nigeria. Local people in Sokoto state report that fighters speak Hausa with a foreign accent and a different language among themselves.In about 2017, Lakurawa was invited by some local communities to protect them against bandits. However, the group has since turned to violent methods similar to those of the bandits, as well as enforcing their extreme version of Islam.“That coercive authority that they started asserting turned communities against them,” said Kato Van Broeckhoven, a United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research researcher.View image in fullscreenThe effects of an airstrike in Jabo, Nigeria.

Just last week, gunmenkilled more than 30 peoplein Niger state, in the centre-west of Nigeria, and abducted an unknown number of people. Local people told reporters they included students from a Catholic school where 300 pupils and teachers were kidnapped in November andonly freed in December.“Why is Nigeria a fertile ground for all these groups to come in and operate?” Samuel said. “It is simple: because of governance issues … You see clearly the level of poverty in these places, you see clearly the absence of the state, the vacuum that has been created.”Explore more on these topicsNigeriaIslamic StateTrump administrationUS foreign policyAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Human rights organisations working in the country estimate thatVenezuelaholds between 800 and 1,000 political prisoners, most of them detained for taking part in protests after the 2024 election, widely believed to have been stolen by Maduro.The head of Venezuela’s national assembly, Jorge Rodríguez, the brother of the acting president, Delcy Rodríguez, said the move was a “unilateral gesture to reaffirm our unbreakable decision to consolidate peace in the republic and peaceful coexistence among all”.Venezuela’s opposition leader, María Corina Machado, hailed the move, saying it showed that “injustice” would not prevail in the country. “This is an important day because it shows what we have always known: that injustice will not last forever and that truth, although it be wounded, ends up finding its way,” she said in an audio message published on social media.Spain’s foreign ministry confirmed the release of five Spanish nationals, one of them a citizen with dual nationality, who it said were “preparing to travel to Spain with assistance from our embassy in Caracas”.“Spain, which maintains fraternal relations with the Venezuelan people, views this decision as a positive step in the new phase Venezuela is entering,” the ministry said.Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, told the public broadcaster RNE that the dual national wasRocío San Miguel, a Spanish-Venezuelan lawyer, activist and human rights defender who was detained in February 2024 and accused by the regime of treason, conspiracy and terrorism in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate Maduro.Before Venezuela’s announcement, estimates suggested there were more than 40 foreign nationals detained in the country, including about 20 Spaniards and five US citizens, among them James Luckey-Lange, 28, who disappeared in December and was being held at military counterintelligence headquarters in Caracas.On Tuesday, Donald Trump said Venezuela had “a torture chamber in the middle of Caracas that they’re closing up”, without elaborating. In recent days, speculation has centred on the Helicoide de la Roca Tarpeya, an iconic structure inaugurated in 1956 as an avant garde shopping centre and later turned into a prison and torture site underChavismo.View image in fullscreenEl Helicoide de la Roca Tarpeya in Caracas, Venezuela.Photograph: Jesús Vargas/Getty ImagesMartha Tineo, the general coordinator of the NGO Justicia, Encuentro y Perdón (Justice, Encounter and Forgiveness, or JEP), which monitors political detentions in Venezuela, said she had confirmed that some sections of El Helicoide are being vacated.“But the Helicoide complex is vast. It not only houses the prison where political detainees are held, but also administrative offices of the Bolivarian National Police, and those are the areas that are being cleared … So we might assume that over the coming days – hopefully within a week, or however long it takes – we may indeed see the closure of that immense torture centre, but for now, that is not happening,” she added.JEP estimated that there were 1,017 political prisoners before Rodríguez’s announcement. By 10.30pm UK time on Thursday, the organisation had confirmed only “around eight or perhaps 10 political prisoners”, but said it would not disclose names to avoid raising anxiety among families who have been waiting for months – and in some cases years – for news of their loved ones.The announcement of the detainees’ release is being treated with caution by activists. In the days leading up to the US operation, the regime said it would release 187 people –99 on Christmas Dayand 88 on New Year’s Day – but organisations were able to independently verify the release of only a portion of that total.Although she has so far confirmed only a few releases, Tineo remains hopeful. “The information we have is that it is very likely that many releases will take place – or at least that is what has been said [by the regime],” she said, adding that the release process, which involves legal procedures, can take time, potentially days when dealing with large numbers of people.“That is why we have been calling for composure and calm, to keep us united in both hope and vigilance,” Tineo added.Alfredo Romero, the head of Foro Penal, an NGO that estimates there are still 806 political prisoners in Venezuela, posted that by early evening he had only been able to confirm five releases. “We expect the freedom of all political prisoners, not partial and conditional gestures,” he wrote, referring to the fact that many people freed in recent months were granted only conditional liberty, subject to precautionary measures such as travel bans, mandatory court appearances and restrictions on speaking to the media about their cases.At a press conference announcing the decision, Jorge Rodríguez – who many believe is now effectively running the country alongside his acting-president sister – said that “within a few minutes” the public would learn “the nature of the people who are receiving the benefit of release”, something that had still not happened hours later.He added: “In order to contribute and collaborate in the effort that all of us must make for national unity and peaceful coexistence, the Bolivarian government, together with the institutions of the state, has decided to free an important number of Venezuelan and foreign individuals, and these release processes are taking place from this very moment.“Consider this gesture by the Bolivarian government, with its broad intention of seeking peace, as the contribution that all of us must make so that our republic can continue its life in peace and in pursuit of prosperity.”Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaAmericasNicolás MaduronewsShareReuse this content"

He denied the charges.The former president and his supporters, including Donald Trump, have argued that he is the victim of a leftwing “witch-hunt”.In December, his allies in Brazil’s conservative-dominated congress pushed through a bill to reduce his prison sentence from 27 years to a little over two.Lula hadmade no secretof his plan to strike down the bill. However, Brazil’s congress has the last word and could reject the president’s veto.Bolsonaro was convicted over a scheme to stop Lula from taking office after the former president’s razor-thin loss in the 2022 election that highlighted Brazil’s stark political divisions.The plot allegedly involved a plan to assassinate Lula, his vice-president, Geraldo Alckmin, and the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes.Prosecutors said the scheme failed because of a lack of support from the military’s leadership.Bolsonaro’s lawyers have appealed, in vain, for him to be allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest, on health grounds.He has suffered serious health complications related to a stabbing on the campaign trail in 2018, and spent a week in hospital in December after surgery for a groin hernia andtreatment for recurring hiccups.On Wednesday, he returned to hospital for check-ups after a fall in prison. Doctors gave him a clean bill of health.Under the current rules, he is expected to serve at least eight years in jail.The bill passed by congress also aims to benefit others convicted over the coup plot, as well as more than 100 people who were imprisoned for their role in the January 2023 riots.Explore more on these topicsBrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaJair BolsonaroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked if it would be longer than a year, he replied: “I would say much longer.”His comments came after Venezuela’s interim president,Delcy Rodríguez, defended plans to open up her country’s oil market to Washington.Rodríguez said on Wednesday that the USattack to remove her predecessor, Nicolás Maduro, had put a “stain” on the countries’ relations, but that it was “not unusual or irregular” to trade with the US, adding that Venezuela was “open to energy relations where all parties benefit”.View image in fullscreenDelcy Rodríguez taking the oath of office in Caracas on Monday.Photograph: Ministry of information/ShutterstockIn his New York Times interview Trump made a similar claim, saying: “We’re getting oil prices down, and we’re going to be giving money toVenezuela, which they desperately need.”Trump did not answer questions about why he endorsed Rodríguez – a veteran member of a government he has accused of “narco-terrorism” – as Venezuela’s new leader instead of backing María Corina Machado, the opposition leader who led a successful election campaign in 2024 and won the Nobel peace prize.He declined to say if he had spoken to Rodríguez but said his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, did so “all the time”. The president made no commitments about when Venezuela might hold elections.On Thursday, Rodríguez’s powerful brother, the congressional president, Jorge Rodríguez, announced the release of “a significant number of Venezuelan and foreign individuals”, which he said was intended to “contribute and collaborate in the effort we must all make towards national unity and peaceful coexistence”.It is unclear exactly how many detainees will be released, but Alfredo Romero, the head of Foro Penal, a leading civil society organisation that has estimated there are more than 800 political prisoners in the country,posted: “We already know of some people on their way to freedom, including foreigners.”The announcement, however, is being treated with caution. In the days leading up to the US operation, the regime said it would release 187 people who were detained after protesting against Maduro’s theft of the 2024 election, but organisations were only able to independently verify the release of some of that total.The NGO Justicia, Encuentro y Perdón, which also monitors political detentions,saidit welcomed the announcement of the releases but was waiting for them to be “effective, immediate and verifiable”.“It is essential to reiterate that freedom is not a benefit or a concession granted by those in power: freedom is a fundamental human right. No one should be deprived of it for legitimately exercising rights such as freedom of expression, political participation or the defence of human rights,” the organisation wrote.US forces seizeda pair of sanctions-hit tankerson Wednesday and the administration announced it would manage all sales of Venezuela’s future crude production andoversee the sale of the country’s petroleum worldwide.3:35Dense, sticky and heavy: why Venezuela’s oil is valuable to Trump – video explainerChris Wright, the US energy secretary, said: “We’re going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela.”On Thursday, Wright said there would be room for China to have a role in Venezuela’s commercial relations, but only as long as the US remained “the dominant force there”.“Within that framework, where Venezuela’s main partner … is the US, can there be commerce with China? Sure. Are we going to allow Venezuela to become a client state of China? Absolutely not,” he told Fox Business Network.View image in fullscreenChris Wright, the US energy secretary.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersIn another interview on Fox News, the US vice-president, JD Vance, said Venezuela would be able to sell its oil only if it served the interests of Washington. “We control the energy resources, and we tell the regime: you’re allowed to sell the oil so long as you serve America’s national interest, you’re not allowed to sell it if you can’t serve America’s national interest,” Vance said.On Tuesday, Trump announced a deal to access to up to $3bn worth of Venezuelan crude, a sign that Venezuelan government officials are responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.US attack on Venezuela will decide direction of South America’s vast mineral wealthRead moreOn top of the ongoing embargo on oil, the US energy department has said the “only oil transported in and out of Venezuela” will be through approved channels consistent with US law and national security interests.That level of control over the world’s largest proven reserves of crude oil could give the Trump administration a broader hold on oil supplies globally in ways that could enable it to influence prices. Since thecapture of Maduro, Trump has continued to pledge that the US will “run” the country, despitepushback from Rodríguez.On Wednesday, Trump said Venezuela would only buy US-made products with the profits it makes from any deal with Washington to sell oil. In a social media post, he wrote: “I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our newOilDeal.”View image in fullscreenDemonstrators attend a rally in support of Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on Wednesday.Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty ImagesTrump is scheduled to meet the heads of major oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss ways of raising Venezuela’s oil production.TheFinancial Times reportedthat oil executives were expected to press the president on providing strong legal and financial guarantees before they agreed to commit capital to Venezuela. US officials had in recent weeks told US oil executives they would need to return to Venezuela quickly and invest significant capital there to revive the damaged industry, Reuters reported earlier this week.TheWashington Post reportedon Wednesday that the US had begun scaling back its naval presence in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, moving the USS Iwo Jima and the USS San Antonio to waters north of Cuba in the Atlantic and reducing troop numbers from about 15,000 to 12,000. It remains unclear, however, whether this marks the beginning of a de-escalation or a temporary reduction.On Thursday night, Venezuela’s interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, said the death toll from the US attack had reached 100 – including Venezuelan and Cuban soldiers as well as civilians – with a similar number injured. While the regime has held funerals for 24 Venezuelan troops and Cuba has released the names of 32 Cuban soldiers, few details are known about the remaining victims, aside from a handful of civilians identified so far, includingRosa Elena González, an 80-year-old woman killed in her apartment near a military base hit by a missile.View image in fullscreenDiosdado Cabello, Venezuela’s interior minister, has reportedly been warned by the Trump administration that he could be next to fall if he does not support the country’s acting president.Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty ImagesCabello, who has reportedly beenwarned by the Trump administrationthat he could be next to fall if he does not support Rodríguez, called Maduro’s capture a “barbaric, treacherous and terrible attack”.The minister also claimed – without providing evidence – that the original US plan did not include capturing Maduro’s wife,Cilia Flores. “When they were taking away brother Nicolás Maduro, they were not going to take Cilia, and Cilia told them: ‘If you take my husband, you have to take me too, you have to take me too,’” said Cabello.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsUS attack on VenezuelaVenezuelaTrump administrationUS foreign policyAmericasOilCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Tracking data suggested it was heading towardsRussiaafter departing from the Star Rafineri refinery, near İzmir, western Turkey, on 30 December.In 2024, only 18 ships identified as being part of the shadow fleet were thought to have changed their national registration to take the Russian flag, but Trump’s interest appears to have drawn many others to make the move.Beforeits dramatic seizureby US special forces on Monday,the tanker Marineracarrying Venezuelan oil was known as the Bella 1. It had sought to evade American intervention by switching its flag from a falsified Guyanese flag to a Russian flag, a crude image of which had been painted on its side.The tactic failed to protect Marinera – or a second vessel, known as M/T Sophia, which wasseized in the Caribbeanand escorted to the US by the coastguard on the grounds that it was conducting “illicit activities”.View image in fullscreenUS military forces interdicted the M/T Sophia in the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday.Photograph: US Southern Command/AFP/Getty ImagesIn early December, US special forces also seizedthe Skipper,a tanker off Venezuela that the US treasury had placed under sanctions in 2022 after claims it had been smuggling oil on behalf of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah.‘There are hundreds in the Baltic’: tracking Russia’s ‘shadow fleet’ of oil tankersRead moreBridget Diakun, a senior risk and compliance analyst at Lloyd’s List Intelligence, said that as of October there were 1,423 ships within the shadow fleet suspected of moving sanctioned goods for Russia,Iranand Venezuela.The fleet was growing by about 10 vessels a month, the data suggested. In recent weeks there had been a sudden trend towards some of those ships applying to join the Russian registry, Diakun said.Russia had reportedly dispatched a submarine to escort the Marinera in the days before it was boarded by US special forces, and the Kremlin had warned the White House off from intervening.According toanalysisby the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Russia’s shadow fleet transports an estimated3.7m barrels of oil a day, representing 65% of Russia’s seaborne oil trade, and generates an estimated $87bn (£69bn) to $100bn (£80bn) annual revenue.View image in fullscreenThe Skipper oil tankerwas seizedby US forces off the coast of Venezuela in December.Photograph: Satellite image ©2025 Vantor/ReutersOn Thursday, Douglas Alexander, the secretary of state for Scotland, defended the UK’s involvement in the seizure of the Marinera after Russia claimed that this was a breach of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.Alexander said: “This ship is part of the shadow fleet that funds Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.“As a UK government and as the United Kingdom, our national interest is served by avoiding the illegal fuelling of terrorism, of conflict and of misery, whether in Ukraine, the Middle East or anywhere else. So when we were asked by the United States to provide operation assistance, including basing an air surveillance support, we were absolutely willing to step up.“I think it is right and reasonable we work with our allies to confront the attempt to sanction-bust that we are witnessing from the Russians on a regular basis.”Explore more on these topicsShipping industryOilWater transportRussiaVenezuelaIranCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

The clip went immediately viral, racking up millions of views across social media. While theheadlinesfocused on Plichta’s age (22) and that she’s a preschool teacher, Plichta believes the reason for her arrest – seemingly the only one among roughly 200 protesters – went beyond the day’s events.Plichta, who recently co-founded local group Grand Rapids Opponents of War, which helped organize Saturday’s protest, had visited the Venezuelan capital of Caracas just last month, amid the Trump administration’s blockade. She was a part of a delegation to the International People’s Assembly for Sovereignty and Peace of Our Americas. Activists from dozens of groups planned to attend. But after Trump ordered that Venezuelan airspace be“closed in its entirety” on 29 November, many canceled their trips.Plichtastill attended, visiting communes and meeting with activists there, and claims she even spoke with Maduro.How effective is protesting? According to historians and political scientists: veryRead more“I came back to the US, and I’ve donereport-backs. I had spoken at that rally. I gave an interview, and immediately, during the interview, I get shut down and arrested out of 200 people. So what else can you say about that?” Plichta said.Plichta is now facing misdemeanor charges of “obstructing a roadway and failure to obey a lawful command from a police officer”, according to local outlet 13 On Your Side. Emerson Wolfe, co-director of Grand Rapids’Institute for Global Educationand chair of Palestine Solidarity Grand Rapids, said this is an established tactic of Grand Rapids police to suppress local protests and protesters.Last March, Wolfe spoke at a local International Women’s Day event; the next month, as they were preparing to lead the local Hands Off! protest, they were arrested with the same charge as Plichta over the previous action.“If it’s truly about the safety of people executing their sacred free speech rights in the streets of Grand Rapids, then why doesn’t [the Grand Rapids police department] arrest protesters right away, or do more to help encourage the safety of protesters downtown? Instead, they issue citations months later in order to criminalize dissent,” said Wolfe.Amidyesterday’s ICE killingof Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, thousands have taken to the streets in cities across the US to demonstrate. “First, they arrest us on camera, and then they shoot us in the streets,” Wolfe said of protesters. “This is unacceptable. We’re living in a nightmare right now, and it’s time for us to be escalating against this sort of brutality.”Wolfe said they had been following the anti-war movement since they were a teenager during the Iraq war; Plichta has been organizing for about two years. Both feel strongly that the Trump administration’s actions in Venezuela were a five-alarm fire for international politics writ large.“We do not want war. We do not want the US to escalate its attacks on Venezuela. We don’t want our friends and family to have to fight a rich man’s warfor oil,” Plichta said.Despite attempts at protest suppression across the US under the Trump administration, Plichta is undeterred. “I’ve seen a comment [that] ‘there’s now going to be 1,000 Jessicas with this’. It’s not about me or my name,” Plichta said. “So many people are going to be coming out more and more. When you try to suppress the movement, all it does is radicalize those who stand against needless war.”Said Wolfe: “If they don’t want us marching in the streets, how else do they expect us to voice our opinions?”This story was amended on 8 January 2025 to correct the spelling of Emerson Wolfe.Explore more on these topicsProtest (US)Building powerVenezuelaTrump administrationNicolás MaduroProtestUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

China’s ministry of foreign affairs said authorities were collaborating to combat cross-border telecom fraud scams.“China is willing to strengthen law enforcement cooperation with neighbouring countries, including Cambodia, to safeguard the safety of people’s lives and property,” the ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said.View image in fullscreenChen, handcuffed and hooded, being led off a plane at Beijing airport.Photograph: China's ministry of public security/AFP/Getty ImagesThe US justice department in October indicted Chen for wire fraud conspiracy and money-laundering conspiracy, and authorities have linked Prince Group, which operated more than 100 businesses in 30 countries, to a network of scam centres mainly in Cambodia and Myanmar that have defrauded victims globally.Cambodia’s central bank on Thursday announced the liquidation of Prince Bank, a lender founded by Chen, the latest in a series of moves against entities under or linked to the group across Asia, from Hong Kong and Singapore to Taiwan and South Korea.It gave no reason for the liquidation and it was not immediately clear whether Cambodian authorities would target other Prince Group entities.Age of the ‘scam state’: how an illicit, multibillion-dollar industry has taken root in south-east AsiaRead moreBritain and the US imposed sanctions on Prince Group in October and weeks later authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore froze or seized assets worth $354m and $116m linked to the company, which has businesses ranging from real estate and financial services to banking, leisure and hospitality.Prince Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday and Prince Group could not be reached.Prince Group said in November that US allegations of criminal activity by Chen were baseless and aimed at unlawfully seizing billions of dollars.CCTV said on Thursday that Chen was wanted on suspicion of fraud and operating illegal casinos. It said authorities would release a wanted list of key members of the “Chen Zhi criminal group” whom it urged to surrender at once.Cambodia’s interior ministry said on Wednesday that it had extradited three Chinese nationals including Chen to China at Beijing’s request. The Cambodian ministry statement did not provide details on Chen or his alleged crimes, but it said his Cambodian citizenship had been revoked.Beijing’s public security bureau set up a special taskforce to investigate individuals involved with Prince Group in 2020, calling the group a “mega cross-border online gambling syndicate”, a Chinese court document released in 2022 showed.The Cambodian ministry had also instructed other local authorities to make arrests in collaboration with the taskforce from Beijing, according to the document.Explore more on these topicsCambodiaChinaCybercrimeAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the name Tia, it was placed under sanctions by the US for carrying crude oil from Venezuela in 2024, after which its name was changed to Arcusat and finally Tiavan.The Aria, registered under the flag of Barbados, was recorded sailing between Plymouth and Jersey early on Thursday evening, heading towards the Ust-Luga commercial port in the eastern Baltic. It is listed as being under sanctions from the US Treasury, with a note that it is linked to Russia’s largest shipping company.On Wednesday afternoon, US forces seized the Marinera oil tanker, previously the Bella 1, north-west of the British Isles in an operation supported by the Royal Navy and RAF, after following it for two and a half weeks from the Caribbean.It had been sailing towards Venezuela and the crew had refused to give permission for the US Coast Guard to board as it approached the South American country. The boat then fled north up the Atlantic, changing its name and adopting a Russian registration, though this was not enough to put off the US military.Explore more on these topicsWater transportMinistry of DefenceRussiaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

If ratified, it would create a common market of nearly 800 million people, boosting EU exports of vehicles, machinery, wines and spirits.‘They’re drowning us in regulations’: how Europe’s furious farmers took on Brussels and wonRead moreMany European farmers fear being undercut by an influx of cheaper agricultural products from the Mercosur common market. Belgian farmers have also protested, rolling more than 1,000 tractors into Brussels last month.“We are between resentment and despair. We have a feeling of abandonment – with Mercosur being an example,” Stéphane Pelletier, a senior member of Coordination Rurale, told Reuters beneath the Eiffel Tower.View image in fullscreenIf ratified, the deal would create a common market of nearly 800 million people, boosting EU exports of vehicles, machinery, wines and spirits.Photograph: Romuald Meigneux/Sipa/ShutterstockThe French government said authorities would “not stand by”. Blocking roads or “attempting to gather in front of parliament – with all the symbolism that entails – is, once again, illegal”, the government spokesperson Maud Bregeon told French radio.Surrounded by a heavy police presence, farmers also demonstrated in front of French parliament’s lower house, heckling the national assembly president, Yaël Braun-Pivet, when she came out to meet them.The Mercosur deal is backed by Germany and Spain butFrance, mindful of its powerful farming lobby, has long been fiercely opposed. Paris has won significant last-minute concessions but, with municipal elections due in March, remains wary of the deal.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, confirmed on Thursday that he would vote against the deal, citing “unanimous political rejection” in France, but this seemed unlikely to derail it.The EU and Mercosur blocs have held negotiations over the deal for the past 26 years, with talks given added momentum by the Trump administration’s protectionist agenda and the rapidly growing impact of competition from China.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen,finally signedthe accord in late 2024, despite opposition from France, Poland and a couple of smaller states, but it has yet to be ratified by EU member states and parliament.The free trade accord aims to cut South American tariffs on European cars, clothes, food, fine wines and medicines. In exchange, the EU will open its markets, although it has set limits on imports of beef, pork, ethanol, honey and sugar.View image in fullscreenYaël Braun-Pivet speaks with farmers demonstrating in front of France’s National Assembly.Photograph: Stevens Tomas/ABACA/ShutterstockIn an attempt to win over member states, the commission this week proposed making an extra €45bn of EU funding available to farmers in the bloc’s next seven-year budget, largely offsetting a planned 20% cut in agricultural funding.Pensions timebomb: why Europe’s social contract is becoming unsustainableRead moreFrance had demanded further changes, including tougher safeguards allowing the EU to reimpose trade tariffs if prices fall by 5%, rather than the 8% stipulated in the accord. It also sought permission to ban imports of crops grown with pesticides, which are banned in the EU.However, the commission’s latest offer appears to have won over Italy, whose support was long uncertain. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, this week hailed what she called a “commonsense approach to supporting European agriculture”.While Rome is also believed to still be pushing for tougher price safeguards, analysts believe Italy’s apparent backing should now allow the deal to be approved by a qualified majority of member states on Friday, with or without French support.Under the qualified majority system, the votes of 15 of the EU’s 27 states representing 65% of its population are needed for the accord to be approved. It could be blocked by at least four countries representing 35% or more of the EU’s population.Without the 13% of the bloc’s population represented by what is, in effect, Italy’s casting vote, France – whose opposition to the accord is shared by Ireland, Poland and Hungary – seems unlikely to have the numbers to block it.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropean UnionParisEuropeInternational tradeGlobal economyProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

A few dozen of the sheep had other ideas about the route and made their way into a store of the Penny retail chain.“It was impossible to tell whether the sheep were looking for something particular on offer or just wanted to warm up,” the company said in a statement, noting that the flock seemed particularly fond of the checkout area where shoppers and staff were present.Panya the pygmy hippo: how a tiny baby animal became a sensationRead moreWitnesses said that while the animals resisted the urge to nibble their way through the fresh produce on display, their foray into the store left a path of destruction in the drinks section as their bustling knocked glass bottles and other products from the shelves.Video showed the sheep bleating but otherwise looking more curious than anxious amid the detritus.“The approximately 20 customers present reportedly took the spontaneous animal visit in their stride,” said Philipp Stiehler, the board chair of the Penny subsidiary in south-westGermany.After about 20 minutes, the sheep were coaxed out the door and rejoined their flock.The German embassy in London couldn’t resist a pun-filled post about the fluffy new mascots. “50 runaway sheep ram-paged through a German supermarket in rural Baa-varia, causing shear mania on Monday morning,” it posted on X. “After breaking away from their 500-strong herd, the brazen sheep spent 20mins milling around in the Penny supermarket before ewe-turning and seeing themselves out.”Stiehler dismissed speculation that Penny planned to bill their shepherd for the damage or cleaning costs, with the company instead seizing on the nationwide media attention and viral posts to say it wanted to sponsor feed for the 50 runaways for a year.Dieter Michler, the shepherd, told the public broadcasterBayerischer Rundfunkhe had been taking 500 sheep – ewes with their lambs – to their winter shelter. He guessed at least some of the 50 animals were distracted by acorns on the ground, leading the others astray as they lost contact with the rest of the flock.Then, he said, “someone must have walked into the supermarket with a bag and they followed”, seeing something that to them could have resembled concentrated feed or a sack of salt, which are used to feed the sheep.“I wouldn’t have thought it possible that they would voluntarily walk into the supermarket,” Michler said.A customer drove to catch up with Michler and the rest of his sheep and told him about the escaped animals’ unexpected excursion. By the time the herder arrived they were back in the car park after staff made loud noises to shoo them out of the supermarket.Michler said the animals were doing well after the excitement. “As soon as they were with the flock they were happy again,” he said.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAnimalsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

What we have achieved for France and inEuropeis a step in the right direction. Greater strategic autonomy, less dependence on the US and China.”The comments came as EU leaders – torn between the needs to defend international law and to keep the US onboard as a vital economic partner and defence ally in Ukraine and beyond – struggle to agree a coordinated response to Washington’s actions.While neither president said so directly, both were widely presumed to be referring to last weekend’sUS raid on Caracasandcapture of the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, and to Trump’s repeatedly stated aim oftaking control of Greenland.The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said on Thursday that the bloc was weighing its response if US plans to acquire Greenland materialise. “The messages we hear are extremely concerning,” she said. “If this is a real threat ... then what would be our response?”Nato ambassadors in Brussels also held a discussion about the Arctic territory, where they reportedly agreed the alliance should strengthen Arctic security. “No drama,” a senior Nato diplomat told Reuters. “Lots of agreement that Nato needs to accelerate its development of [a] stronger deterrence presence in the region.”Specific steps remain undecided, though some nations suggested modelling efforts on Nato’s eastern flank missions, Baltic Sentry and Eastern Sentry, which use flexible multinational deployments and advanced tech such as drones and sensors to monitor land and sea.View image in fullscreenFrank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, said the erosion of the world order had already reached an advanced stage.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPASteinmeier, speaking on Wednesday night at a symposium in Berlin to mark his 70th birthday, said global democracy was at risk. The former German foreign minister said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a watershed, but subsequent US behaviour marked a second “epochal rupture”.There had been a “breakdown of values by our most important partner, the US, which helped build this world order”, said the president, whose role is largely ceremonial. “It is about preventing the world from turning into a robber’s den, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want.”Steinmeier said the erosion of the world order had already reached an advanced stage. Smaller, weaker states risked becoming “completely defenceless”, and entire regions could be treated “as the property of a few great powers”.He said European security policy needed to be revised as a consequence. “We must not be weak,” he said, adding thatGermanycould only play a role “if we are taken seriously, also militarily”, so this was “the goal we have to achieve”.Macron in his speech also stressed the importance of safeguarding academic independence and “a controlled information space, where opinions can be exchanged completely freely, but where choices are not made by the algorithms of a few”.He said the EU’sDigital Markets Act(DMA), which covers competition, and theDigital Services Act(DSA) on content moderation – which the US has denounced as an attempt to “coerce” its tech companies into censorship – “must be defended”.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyInternational lawEmmanuel MacronFranceGermanyTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Researchers said the composition of litter found in the Rhine was very similar to that found in other European rivers including the Thames. These large quantities of litter also have the potential to damage crucial infrastructure such as drainage systems, leading to increased risk of flooding.Citizen scientists and researchers from the University of Bonn analysed litter collected from the Rhine between November 2022 and November 2023. They found the river carried up to 4,700 tonnes of “macrolitter” – pieces larger than 25mm in size – annually. They said more research was needed to understand the full extent of the problem.Hamann said the Rhine was one of the major contributors of Europe’s macrolitter into the sea, but added that many other rivers had not yet been investigated.View image in fullscreenLitter trap on the Rhine.

The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) said on Thursday thatIranian security forces had killedat least 45 protesters, including eight children, since the demonstrations began in late December.Shopkeepers heeded calls from seven Kurdish political groups for a general strike on Thursday, closing their doors in Kurdish regions and dozens of other cities around Iran. The Hengaw rights group posted footage of shuttered shops in the western provinces of Ilam, Kermanshah and Lorestan. It accused authorities of firing on demonstrators in Kermanshah and the nearby town of Kamyaran to the north, injuring several protesters.Demonstrations reached all 31 provinces on Thursday as the protest movement showed no signs of abating.In the southern Fars province demonstrators pulled down the statue of the former senior Revolutionary Guards al-Quds force commanderQassem Suleimani– considered a hero of mythical proportions by government supporters. Verified footage showed protesters cheering as the statue came down.Protests took place into the night Thursday, with a large crowd seen gathering on the vast Ayatollah Kashani Boulevard in the north-west of Tehran amid the sound of vehicle horns honking in support, according to social media images verified by Agence France-Presse. Other images showed a crowd demonstrating in the western city of Abadan. A woman attending a protest in that city late on Wednesday had been shot in the eye, according to IHR.IHR said Wednesday was the bloodiest day of the now 12-day movement, with 13 protesters confirmed killed. “The evidence shows that the scope of the crackdown is becoming more violent and more extensive every day,” said the IHR director, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, adding that hundreds more had been wounded and more than 2,000 arrested.On Wednesday a police officer was killed west of Tehran trying “to control unrest”, the Fars news agency reported.View image in fullscreenVideograb posted on social media shows protesters in the southern Fars province toppling a statue of Qassem Suleimani.Photograph: UGC/AFP/Getty ImagesMedia inside Iran and official statements have reported at least 21 people killed, including security forces, since the protests began, according to an Agence France-Presse tally.The protest movement is the largest in three years, and while it has not yet reached the size of the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom demonstrations, it has alarmed Iran’s political and security leadership.Rights groups accused authorities of resorting to tactics including raiding hospitals to detain wounded protesters. “Iran’s security forces have injured and killed both protesters and bystanders,” said Amnesty International, accusing authorities of using “unlawful force”.The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, on Thursday called for restraint in how the demonstrations are handled. “Any violent or coercive behaviour should be avoided,” said Pezeshkian in a statement on his website, urging “utmost restraint” as well as “dialogue, engagement and listening to the people’s demands”.The trigger for the protests, thesudden slide of the country’s currency and general economic malaise, has made it difficult for the government to address the grievances of protesters. The currency has continued to depreciate, while the government announced the end of a subsidised exchange rate for importers – a move that has already caused the price of groceries to soar.View image in fullscreenPeople shop at a fruit and vegetable stall in Tehran amid soaring prices, a rapidly devaluing currency, and mounting economic pressure.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesEveryday life has become increasingly unaffordable for Iranians. The average price of food has increased by more than 70% since last year, and medicine about 50% in the same time period.The government has said that solving the economic crisis afflicting the country is largely out of its hands, and that while it will work to tackle corruption and price gouging, it has few tools to use. It blamed the economic woes of the country on external factors, primarily the harsh sanctions placed on Iran mainly by the west in response to Iran’s nuclear programme.The protests thus far seem to be decentralised and lacking in a central figure, in contrast to the 2022 protests, when demonstratorsrallied around 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being arrested for allegedly wearing the hijab improperly.The exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the shah who was ejected by the 1979 Iranian revolution, has been trying to fill the leadership vacuum in the movement. He urged Iranians to yell from their windows on Thursday and Friday at 8pm local time to show their support.“Based on your response, I will announce the next calls to action,” Pahlavi said in a widely shared video.It is unclear the level of support Pahlavi enjoys, though videos of protests over the last 12 days have showed demonstrators chanting in support for the exiled prince. A social media channel close to Iran’s security forces published a video which purported to show intelligence agents visiting people in their homes warning them not to take part in Pahlavi’s protest, with other outlets claiming drones would be used to identify those who do participate.Though authorities have used violence against protesters, their crackdown has not reached nearly the same intensity as it did in 2022. Analysts have said that the state may feel less secure than it did three years ago,rocked by its June war with Israel.View image in fullscreenThe government crackdown has reportedly not matched the same intensity as the 2022 protests over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody.Photograph: Social Networks/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockThe government also faces threats from abroad, with the US president, Donald Trump,threatening to intervene in protests if Iran killed demonstrators. Trump on Thursday reiterated his threat to take severe action against Iran if its authorities “start killing people”, warning Washington would “hit them very hard”.The US state department also encouraged protesters online, sharing footage of some placing Trump stickers on road signs. “When prices are set so high that neither consumers can afford to buy nor farmers can afford to sell, everyone loses,” the state department said in a post on X.On Thursday night the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said the Iranian economy was “on the ropes”, telling the Economic Club of Minnesota: “It’s a very precarious moment. He [Trump] does not want them to harm more of the protesters. This is a tense moment.”German foreign minister Johann Wadephul, meanwhile, condemned the “excessive use of force” by Iranian authorities against protesters.The Iranian foreign ministry and military have lashed out over Trump’s comments, with Iran’s army chief threatening on Wednesday to carry out pre-emptive strikes on states that threaten Iran.Authorities have increasingly cast protesters as violent, saying that while the right to protest was legitimate, rioters and foreign-backed saboteurs had hijacked protests.Outlets close to the government said a police colonel was stabbed outside Tehran, while a police station in Chenaran, north-east of Tehran, was attacked on Wednesday night leading to the death of five people.Explore more on these topicsIranProtestMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The aim had been to return to the north-south split that prevailed prior to unification in 1990.In recent days, al-Zubaidi’s aides had vowed he would fight to retain Aden – long an STC stronghold – or retreat to conduct a guerilla campaign, but it appears plans for a late-night exile were already under way, and that splits emerging in the STC made his position untenable.He is said to have fled with some of his closest supporters in the government.The Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government’s ministry of information demanded international sanctions be placed on al-Zubaidi. It said: “Al-Zubaidi would not have acted with such recklessness without direction from Abu Dhabi … where he placed his personal interests and the interests of his supporters above the interests of the nation.”Areas of control map for Yemen as of 30 DecemberSaudi Arabia’s willingness to highlight the Emirati role in al-Zubaidi’s escape shows the continued anger in Riyadh at the Emirati role in backing the STC rebellion.On Tuesday night, al-Zubaidi had, at the last minute, refused a Saudi ultimatum to fly from Aden to Riyadh for talks, a move that angered the Saudis so much that they bombed an STC military camp. He apparently had reached the airport but did not board the plane, before returning to his home in Aden and then fleeing.A more than 50-strong STC delegation did fly from Aden to Riyadh. Members of the delegation said they were safe and that they had held constructive talks. It was not clear how free the delegation were to speak.The STC’s grip on Aden had been weakened by internal splits when Abdulrahman Al-Muharami, a commander of the Giants Brigades, issued orders to withdraw heavy weapons from military camps and to impose security control over commanders linked to al-Zubaidi’s Al-Dhala wing.The split made it easier for Saudi-backed forces to enter Aden. Leaders of the Saudi-backed government had left the city for Saudi Arabia when the STC took control last month.View image in fullscreenAidarous Al-Zubaidi is said to have fled with some of his closest supporters in the STC.Photograph: Ted Shaffrey/APThe disarray confirms the scale of the military and political overreach that has created a disaster for the southern movement.Three weeks ago, in a bid to control the entire south of Yemen, a confident STC poured into two previously independent-minded eastern governorates: Hadramaut and Al-Mahra. In a televised address on 2 January, al-Zubaidi declared a two-year transitional period leading to a self-determination referendum for the “State of South Arabia” within the borders of the former People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen, which was independent from 1967 to 1990.The advance angered Saudi Arabia, which usedlimited airstrikes and loyal local militia to force an STC withdrawal, provoking a wider collapse in STC support across the south.The UAE, diplomatically isolated, ended its military support for the STC initiative, a critical factor in the STC withdrawal. Abu Dhabi removed its military equipment and assets from bases and camps in Hadramaut, Shabwa, Aden, and the West Coast.It is not clear whether the Saudi diplomats back in the driving seat are sincere in saying they want to listen to the longstanding demands of the separatists, or will instead back calls to repress not just the STC for insurrection and treason but also the cause that it had led. Saudi Arabia has promised to stage a southern dialogue.The separatist cause has long been supported by the UAE,creating friction with Riyadh. Saudi Arabia shares a border with Yemen and opposes the fracturing of Yemen, preferring instead to focus on uniting the multiple Yemeni factions and tribes to try to drive the Houthis out.Explore more on these topicsYemenMiddle East and north AfricaSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesHouthisnewsShareReuse this content"

The Syrian army said it would begin military operations against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) after the deadline, and issued maps showing specific areas that needed to be evacuated.Shortly after the deadline expired at 1.30pm local time (1030 GMT) the Syrian government began shelling, with the SDF firing as well.The clashes are the most intense fighting in Syria since thefall of the Assad regimein December 2024, and sparked fears of a broader conflict between the Syrian government and the well-armed Kurdish authorities who control much of north-east Syria – nearly a third of Syrian territory.Despite an agreement for the SDF to merge into the Syrian army by the start of 2025, clashes have continued to erupt between it and the government. This week’s three days of fighting represent the longest open conflict between the two sides since the agreement was signed in March 2025.View image in fullscreenA member of the White Helmets, a volunteer civil defence group, helps people flee in Aleppo.Photograph: Ghaith Alsayed/APAbout 140,000 civilians have been displaced by the fighting since it started on Tuesday, according to the directorate of social affairs and labour in Aleppo. At least eight civilians have been killed in the Kurdish-majority neighbourhoods, and seven civilians and one soldier killed in government-controlled areas. Dozens more have been wounded on both sides.The SDF currently controls the Kurdish-majority neighbourhoods in Aleppo but on Wednesday the Syrian government announced its intention to push out Kurdish fighters from all of Aleppo city, in a move likely to exacerbate tensions between it and the Kurdish bloc in the north-east. The SDF denies having any fighters in the neighbourhoods, instead describing them as local self-defence forces.Both sides accused the other of human rights violations, with the Syrian government claiming the SDF used civilians as human shields, not letting them evacuate and shooting at them when they tried. The SDF shared videos of what it said were government forces shelling a hospital in Aleppo, as well of what it called “brutal artillery shelling” targeting populated residential areas in Sheikh Maqsoud.Many displaced people fled to other provinces of Syria, but some did not have the means to travel and sheltered in nearby mosques and churches.View image in fullscreenPeople hurriedly leaving Kurdish-majority neighbourhoods in Aleppo.Photograph: Adri Salido/Getty ImagesAt the root of the conflict are continuing disagreements about the status of the SDF in post-Assad Syria. It controls nearly a third of the country and has been a partner of US forces in their anti-Islamic State mission in Syria.Under the 10 March agreement, the SDF is meant to integrate fully into the new Syrian army. However, disagreements over how exactly that integration would take place have stalled progress.The SDF is seeking autonomy under the government, and after massacres on Syria’s coast and Druze-majority areas – in which some government-backed forces committed human rights violations against civilians – it has become more bullish on retaining its weapons. Some of the factions that make up the new Syrian army have been fighting the SDF for years and there is bitter enmity between them.A meeting on Sunday between Damascus and the SDF yielded no new progress on implementing the agreement, despite the deadline expiring.There is growing distrust on both sides, which has been worsened by fighting and a lack of progress in negotiations. Supporters of the government were outraged as pictures of civilians allegedly killed by SDF shelling circulated on social media, while thousands of protesters gathered in Qamishli, the de-facto capital of the SDF-controlled areas in north-east Syria, in solidarity with the SDF.Describing Syrian government forces as “jihadists”, Farhad Shami, a spokesperson for the SDF, said on Thursday afternoon that fighting in Aleppo “opened the door to the expansion of the war into other areas”.View image in fullscreenKurds shout slogans during a protest on Thursday in Diyarbakır, Turkey, against Syria’s military and in solidarity with the SDF.Photograph: Ilyas Akengin/AFP/Getty ImagesA US state department official on Thursday urged restraint on all sides, and said the US envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, was trying to mediate between the two sides.“All parties should focus on how to build a peaceful, stable Syria that protects and serves the interests of all Syrians, rather than pushing the country back into a cycle of violence,” the state department official said in a statement.The US has tried to maintain a balancing act between its longtime Kurdish allies in Syria and the new authorities in Damascus, to which it has grown closer.The SDF views US support and its continued military presence as a safeguard against Turkey, which has carried out three invasions against it. Turkey considers the SDF a Syrian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), a Kurdish separatist group with which it has fought a four decades-long insurgency.The Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, called the SDF the “biggest obstacle to peace in Syria” on Thursday, while the Turkish defence ministry said it would provide military aid to the government in Damascus if requested.Explore more on these topicsSyriaKurdsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In astatement, the agency said it had carried out searches at Singh’s home and Satat Sampada properties “as part of an ongoing investigation into suspicious foreign inward remittances received in the garb of consultancy charges” from climate campaign groups, “which have in turn received huge funds from prior reference category NGOs like Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors”.“However, cross-verification of filings made by the remitters abroad indicates that the funds were actually intended to promote the agenda of the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty within India,” the agency said.‘A shift no country can ignore’: where global emissions stand, 10 years after the Paris climate agreementRead moreThe FFNPT Initiative is an international campaign calling for a treaty to stop exploration for new fossil fuels and to gradually phase out their use. First endorsed by the Pacific Island nations of Vanuatu and Tuvalu, it has the support of 17 national governments, the World Health Organization and the European parliament, as well as a constellation of civil society figures.The ED officers said: “While presented as a climate initiative, its adoption could expose India to legal challenges in international forums like the international court of justice (ICJ) and severely compromise the nation’s energy security and economic development.”They said that in the course of their search they found a large cache of whiskey, above legal limits, at Singh’s home in Delhi and they told local police, who subsequently arrested and then bailed him on Monday night.The agency said it was investigating trips Singh made to Pakistan and Bangladesh last year, including how they were funded.Singh and Awasthi said in a statement that they were prevented from sharing details of the case for legal reasons, but added: “We categorically state that the allegations being reported are baseless, biased and misleading.”Singh is a familiar figure at Cop climate negotiations, having worked for more than two decades with international NGOs and climate campaigns including ActionAid and the Climate Action Network.Civil society organisations in India under Narendra Modi have faced severe pressures. Almost 17,000 licences to receive foreign funding have been suspended and a large number of civil society organisations have shut down.According to an unnamed ED officer quoted by theHindustan Times, the investigation into Singh began on the basis of intelligence received from Cop30, held in Belém, Brazil, last November. Other activists “whose climate campaigns may be inimical to India’s energy security” were also being investigated, another unnamed officer was quoted as saying.‘It’s hell for us here’: Mumbai families suffer as datacentres keep the city hooked on coalRead moreThe ED accused Singh of running Satat Sampada as a front, publicly projecting itself as a company marketing organic produce while its “primary activity appears to be channelling foreign funds to run narratives furthering the FFNPT cause in India, on behalf of foreign influencer groups”.The agency said the company had been running at a loss until 2021 when payments from campaign groups, registered as “consultancy services” and “agro-product sales”, turned its fortunes around.“The ED suspects misdeclaration and misrepresentation of the nature and purpose of the foreign funds received by SSPL. The agency is investigating the full extent of the suspected violations … and whether the activities funded were against the national interest, specifically India’s energy security,” it said.Singh and Awasthi said they started Satat Sampada with their own savings and loans secured on their home in 2016, and that the organisation’s consultancy and management services grew in 2021 after Singh left his full-time employment to focus more on its work.“His work and contributions are well documented across print, digital, television and social media, as well as public platforms,” they said.This article was amended on 8 January 2026 to correct the spellings of Jyoti Awasthi and the organisation Satat Sampada.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

While not all calls connected successfully, many did.“The venues targeted included seven hospitals, six bars, restaurants and supermarkets, two police force control rooms and a cancer information and support services centre. Hart twice attempted to call Westminster Abbey but he did so when it was night-time in the UK, meaning the calls were not answered,” the Met police said.“In those calls, he typically told the person who answered the phone that he had planted a bomb at their location, which would soon explode. He would make multiple calls, sometimes days apart, to the same victims. The calls were sustained and persistent, sometimes lasting almost half an hour.“On other occasions, he claimed to have planted a bomb in a hotel basement, describing it as homemade and filled with nails.”Although police said some of the call recipients were sceptical the threats were genuine, they still felt they had to take precautions. Security staff at some of the threatened locations searched their venues and one of the hospitals went into full lockdown while they searched for explosive devices.The court was satisfied Hart knew the calls would be received as the threats he intended them to be, police said.Explore more on these topicsUK newsLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

It suggests the college wants to reverse the painfully secured advances in social mobility. And my worry would be they are doing this so that others may follow. Hence the need to raise voices against this now.”Campbell is a supporter ofthe 93% Club, a network representing the UK’s state-educated students. The club’s chief executive, Sophie Pender, said its Trinity Hall members would be withdrawing alumni-funding donations until the policy was reversed, telling the college that its decision was “immoral and dangerous”.Pender said: “Your state-educated alumni are watching now; please don’t set this precedent. It’s not too late to course correct, and we will respect you all the more for it.”Under the policy adopted at the end of last year, Trinity Hall would approach independent schools to encourage applications in courses including languages, music, art history, classics and theology, to improve the “quality” of recruits. Most of the schools are in the south of England and charge upwards of £25,000 a year.The Sutton Trust, a charity that aims to boost UK social mobility through education, called for the policy to be reversed and said it was engaging with the university on the issue.Nick Harrison, the trust’s chief executive, said: “State-educated pupils should absolutely not be overlooked for recruitment to any university courses. We’ve previously found that those from private schools are already overrepresented on a wide range of courses, despite representing only 7% of the population. This already limits opportunities for those with similar abilities from state schools.“Gaining a degree remains one of the surest routes to social mobility, yet pupils eligible for free school meals are only around half as likely to go to university as their better-off peers. And persistent access gaps remain at the most selective institutions.”Trinity Hall alumni contacted the Guardian and took to social media to express their dismay at the policy. Several said they had contacted the college to register objections, and in some cases that they would refuse any fundraising appeals while the policy remained in place.One said: “This is clearly an attempt to recruit more wealthy students to boost Trinity Hall’s base of alumni with deep pockets. I am so deeply disappointed in my former college for implementing such a crude policy.”Mary Hockaday, the master of Trinity Hall, responded to alumni on Thursday evening, telling them that the media coverage was “very misleading”.Hockaday said in an email: “To be clear, there has been no change to our admissions policy or our commitment to widening participation, and we continue to work very hard to support and attract students from disadvantaged backgrounds.“We propose to add some schools to our existing recruitment email lists to ensure we receive applications from talented students from all backgrounds. This activity does not affect our overall admissions policy.”Jess Staufenberg, a co-founder of thePrivate Education Policy Forum, a thinktank that studies independent schools, said there was no evidence that private schools needed any encouragement to apply to Cambridge.If you went to state school, do you ever feel British life is rigged against you? Welcome to the 93% Club | Alastair CampbellRead more“These are some of the most expensive and socially exclusive schools in the world. We know that many of these schools have entire staff teams dedicated to ensuring successful Oxbridge admissions,” Staufenberg said.“Trinity Hall should present its evidence for why these private schools – rather than state schools in forgotten regions of the north-east, for instance – need a specific recruitment policy encouraging their students to apply.“Trinity Hall also needs to answer why it is not using its considerable endowment funds to track down and find the talented and brilliant students hidden in the nation’s most deprived communities.”Francis Green, a professor at University College London who hasstudied UK private schools and inequality, said: “If a college perceives they are receiving too few qualified applicants in particular subjects, they might do better to advertise this generally across the school spectrum, or even adjust their educational offering, rather than risk retreat on what has been one of the few positive developments in widening participation in recent years.”Explore more on these topicsUniversity of CambridgeOxbridge and elitismPrivate schoolsAdmissionsSocial mobilityAccess to universityStudentsnewsShareReuse this content"

Corner is also charged with causing grievous bodily harm to a police officer, Kate Evans. They deny the charges.On Thursday in closing submissions, Head’s barrister, Rajiv Menon KC, detailed his client’s years of activism, including her work with refugees in Calais. He said the suffragettes were celebrated publicly for their heroism but in their time were accused of being “a threat to the social order” and “unladylike, feral, aggressive, violent” by MPs and in the mainstream press.“The reality, of course, is very different,” Menon told the court. “The suffragettes were remarkable women from all walks of life united in their hope, their despair, their defiance and their dedication.“Charlotte Head is also a remarkable woman and I say that without any reservation. This is not something that lawyers defending clients in criminal trials often say … we are taught to avoid the personal. But it must be said in this case, not only because it is true but also because it is relevant.”Menon described Elbit Systems, of which Elbit Systems UK is a subsidiary, as a “dreadful company” that “has played a critical role in the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians” but is “wined and dined” in the corridors of power.He said any violence carried out by defendants on 6 August was unplanned and it was fanciful to suggest that Palestine Action would “suddenly abandon non-violent direct action”, which he said had been the hallmark of its previous activities.Earlier on Thursday, the prosecutor Deanna Heer KC, completing her closing submissions, rejected Corner’s defence, heard during the trial, that he struck Evans with a sledgehammer after he had been sprayed with Pava spray in order to protect one or more co-defendants whom he had heard screaming.Heer said his actions were “nothing to do with self-defence or defence of anyone else” and that the level of force Corner used against Evans, who sustained a fractured spine, was “completely unreasonable, completely disproportionate”.When she began her closing submissions on Tuesday – the court did not sit on Wednesday – Heer told the court that jurors may have views about the conflict in the Middle East but said: “For the purposes of this trial, however, your views about those matters don’t matter.”The judge, Mr Justice Johnson, addressed the jurors in a similar fashion before closing arguments began.“The nature of this case may excite strong emotions,” he told the jury. “But you must each keep cool heads. Your decision should be a decision in which bias, emotion, sympathy, prejudice, political views and matters of that sort play no part.”Barristers representing the other defendants are expected to give their closing submissions on Friday before the judge sums up the case for the jury, which is likely to be sent out to reach its decision early next week.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

TheTennesseeschool is also paying the teacher $500,000 in the settlement.Austin Peay spokesperson Brian Dunn said Darren Michael returned to his position as a tenured faculty member at the public university in Clarksville effective 30 December. A copy of the settlement agreement obtained through a public records request includes a $500,000 payment and reimbursement of counseling, asreported earlier this weekby WKRN-TV.Tennessee’s governor, attorney general and comptroller signed a document authorizing the settlement payment.Top union accuses Texas of targeting teachers over Charlie Kirk postsRead moreMichael, a theater and dance professor, was among people who reported facing a conservative backlash and punishment at work for their online posts about Kirk’s fatal shooting in September. He was later moved to a suspension status.In a 30 December email to the university community, Austin Peay president Mike Licari said the school did not follow the required tenure termination process. The communication was another requirement under the settlement.Licari added: “I deeply regret and apologize for the impact this has had on Professor Michael and on our campus community. I am committed to ensuring that due process and fairness are upheld in all future actions.”Two days after Kirk’s killing, Marsha Blackburn, a Republican senator from Tennessee,posteda screenshot indicating Michael on 10 September had posted the headline of a 2023 news article headlined: “Charlie Kirk Says Gun Deaths ‘Unfortunately’ Worth it to Keep 2nd Amendment.” Blackburn, who is also a candidate for governor, included a photograph and biography of Michael. She wrote: “What do you say, Austin Peay State University?” and tagged the university’s account.Blackburn’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the settlement.David L King, Michael’s attorney, said the professor said “nothing that was threatening or otherwise offensive”. King decried the pressure applied by “outside forces” and said the ordeal “caused a great deal of harm” to Michael and his daughter.Explore more on these topicsTennesseeCharlie Kirk shootingHigher educationSocial mediaUS universitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Without it, there is no authoritative accounting of what records exist, what has been withheld, or why, making effective oversight and judicial review far more difficult,” they said.As part of their request, Khanna and Massie asked Engelmayer to allow the independent monitor to be given authority to notify the court “about the true nature and extent of the document production and if improper redactions or other improper conduct is taking place”.“Absent an independent process, as outlined above, we do not believe the DOJ will produce the records that are required by the Act and what it has represented to this Court,” the representatives said.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The space agency did not identify the astronaut or the medical issue, citing patient privacy. The crew member is now stable.“It’s not an emergency evacuation, but we are erring on the side of caution for the crew member,” said Dr James Polk, Nasa’s chief health and medical officer.The crew of four arrived at the orbiting lab via SpaceX in August for a stay of at least six months. The crew included Nasa’s Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke along with Japan’s Kimiya Yui and Russia’s Oleg Platonov.Fincke and Cardman were supposed to carry out the spacewalk to make preparations for a future rollout of solar panels to provide additional power for the space station.It was Fincke’s fourth visit to the space station and Yui’s second, according to Nasa. This was the first spaceflight for Cardman and Platonov.“I’m proud of the swift effort across the agency thus far to ensure the safety of our astronauts,” Nasa administrator Jared Isaacman said.Three other astronauts are currently living and working aboard the space station, including Nasa’s Chris Williams and Russia’s Sergei Mikayev and Sergei Kud-Sverchkov, who launched in November aboard a Soyuz rocket for an eight-month stay. They are due to return home in the summer.Nasa has tapped SpaceX to eventually bring the space station out of orbit by late 2030 or early 2031; plans call for a safe re-entry over ocean.Explore more on these topicsNasaInternational Space StationSpacenewsShareReuse this content"

Prices slumped by almost 20% in 2025, marking thebiggest annual loss since the Covid-19 pandemicand the first time the oil market has recorded three consecutive years of annual losses.As well as driving market prices lower, officials reportedly claimed Trump’s plans to control Venezuela’s oil reserves, which are the largest in the world, include cutting Russia and China’s access to the South American country in order to establish a western hemisphere oil production stronghold.3:35Dense, sticky and heavy: why Venezuela’s oil is valuable to Trump – video explainerThe White House confirmed on Wednesday the US planned tocontrol Venezuela’s oil sales “indefinitely”after laying claim to 50m barrels of blockaded crude.The oil, which is stranded in tankers and storage facilities, could be worth up to $3bn (once sold on the global market, with the proceeds used to “benefit the Venezuelan people”, according to the US energy secretary, Chris Wright.On Wednesday, Trump said Venezuela would use the profits it made from any deal it struck with Washington to sell oil solely to buy US-made goods.“I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our newOilDeal,” he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.The US laid claim to the under-sanctions crude this week, and alsoseized a Russian oil tankerlinked to Venezuela after a two-week pursuit..If Trump was able to increase Venezuela’s oil output from 1m barrels a day (bpd), or less than 1% of global demand, to its previous highs of about 3m, he would bring US domestic production to about 14m bpd. This represents about one-third of the 40m bpd output of countries in the Opec+ alliance.However, there are doubts about whether Trump will be able to reignite Venezuela’s beleaguered oil industry after decades of underinvestment and corruption.The president has promised that US oil companies will return to the region to spend billions upgrading its infrastructure and growing its production. But the companies – including Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips – are reportedly wary.Trump said this week that US oil companies could be “reimbursed by us, or through revenue” if they invested in Venezuela. But executives have reportedly told the Financial Times they will want “serious guarantees” from the Trump administration before investing billions to increase Venezuela’s crude output.“No one wants to go in there when a random fucking tweet can change the entire foreign policy of the country,” one private equity investor who specialises in energy told the FT.Oil bosses met US officials at an industry conference in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday, and are due to meet Trump at the White House on Friday.Explore more on these topicsOilOil and gas companiesEnergy industryCommoditiesTrump administrationUS politicsVenezuelanewsShareReuse this content"

Well, not exactly. Just when Arsenal looked ready to lay down a real marker for their title aspirations, a rejuvenated Liverpool side that has been through the wringer since they werecrowned champions last seasonshowed the Gunners remain fallible.It could have been even worse for Mikel Arteta’s side ifLiverpoolhad been awarded one of two potential penalties or if Conor Bradley’s brilliant chip had not struck the crossbar in the first half.‘He didn’t realise’: Arteta defends Martinelli over Bradley incidentRead moreThe Liverpool defender’s night ended with him departing on a stretcher after a frustrated Gabriel Martinelli tried to push him off the pitch asArsenalchased a winning goal in injury time. The Brazilian was extremely fortunate to escape a red card for his actions with Bradley left in agony after twisting his knee.Arne Slot gave Martinelli the benefit of the doubt afterwards but the Liverpool head coach was justifiably delighted with the way his much-maligned defence coped with Arsenal’s threat. But the fact that the hosts didn’t even manage a shot on target in the second half until a Gabriel Jesus header in injury time is of concern for Arteta as Viktor Gyökeres put in another ineffective display up front.They may be six points clear of Manchester City and Aston Villa at the top of the table but Arsenal seem unlikely to do things the easy way if they are to end their 22-year wait to be crowned champions.Arteta had called on the Arsenal supporters to “make the difference” as they attempted totake advantage of CityandVilla’s slip-upson Wednesday night. Even the torrential rain before kick-off caused by Storm Goretti could dampen the feeling of optimism as the home fans held up a mosaic of red and white plastic bags when the teams emerged. Yet a dogged Liverpool side who were without a recognised striker were in no mood to roll over.Slot’s solution to the continued absence of the injured Hugo Ekitiké was to select Mr Versatile Dominik Szoboszlai as a false 9 with Florian Wirtz in support. It didn’t take Bukayo Saka very long to realise that he had the beating of Milos Kerkez, who was perhaps a surprise selection at left-back ahead of the more experienced Andy Robertson. One mesmerising run that left the Hungary defender and Alexis Mac Allister in his slipstream should have resulted in the opening goal but Martín Zubimendi was just the wrong side of his cutback. Saka then tried his luck from just outside the area with a shot that was parried away by Alisson.Liverpool slowly began to establish a foothold in midfield and it was the visitors who came closest to breaking the deadlock in the first half after an uncharacteristic mistake from William Saliba that was more down to being too casual than any nerves.The France defender had been alert to the danger when Bradley tried to play in Jeremie Frimpong but his back pass to David Raya took the goalkeeper by surprise and he could only play the ball straight into Bradley’s path. His chip looked destined for the empty net but struck the crossbar and Cody Gakpo’s follow-up was blocked.View image in fullscreenBukayo Saka (right) had a bright first half but faded as Arsenal’s frustration grew.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe half’s moment of controversy arrived 10 minutes before the break when Frimpong went down awkwardly under pressure from Piero Hincapié in the area, although it was hard to tell if there was any significant contact. He stayed down as play continued, with Leandro Trossard seeing his shot deflected wide at the other end. Liverpool’s players immediately surrounded the referee Anthony Taylor, with Declan Rice and Virgil van Dijk exchanging some choice words.The visiting supporters had reason to feel hard done by again at the start of the second half when Wirtz jinked his way past three players into the area and was about to shoot when Trossard intervened with a clumsy challenge that could easily have resulted in a penalty. Luckily for Arsenal, Taylor and the video assistant referee felt otherwise.Return of the Emirates Groan: Arsenal fans restless on night of stalemate with Liverpool | Jonathan LiewRead moreDespite the increased urgency in the stands, the hosts were struggling to match the intensity thatblew Villa away in the second halfof their last home fixture with four goals. There were huge groans when Zubimendi got in the way of a Trossard cross meant for Saka before Hincapié was forced off with an injury.Szoboszlai was given an opportunity toreplicate his free-kickfrom Liverpool’s win against Arsenal back in August but this time his effort sailed high and wide to much derision, even if he was much closer with another effort eight minutes from full-time.It was Liverpool who looked more likely to break the deadlock as Frimpong broke free but could not pick out the waiting Wirtz.The arrival of Gabriel Jesus from the bench for the ineffective Gyökeres, who has now gone 11 games without scoring from open play, was greeted with cheers from the home supporters desperate for their side to find a winner.The closest they came was when Gabriel Magalhães headed wide from a corner with the last action of the match that would have gone a long way to settling Arsenal’s nerves.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The injury occured while Kim was training in Laax, a regular World Cup venue and a key pre-Olympic stop on the circuit. The 25-year-old landed a maneuver cleanly but lost her edge shortly afterward, sliding awkwardly across the pipe and into the wall.With the Milano CortinaWinter Olympicsless than a month away, Kim said she is still unsure whether she will be able to compete. An MRI scheduled for Friday is expected to determine the severity of the injury and the timeline for her return.“I don’t have much clarity right now,” Kim said, adding that she is doing everything she can to remain hopeful while awaiting medical results.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

Her main concern, she explained Thursday, is instability, noting that the joint has popped out more than once since the initial injury.Kim emphasized that her form on snow had been strong prior to the fall, fueling optimism that she could return quickly if cleared by doctors. “I feel really good about where my snowboarding is at,” she said. “Once I’m cleared, I know I’ll be ready.”The injury arrives at a pivotal moment in Kim’s career. Already a two-time Olympic champion, she is attempting to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in halfpipe snowboarding, a feat that would further cement her status as one of the sport’s all-time greats.Kimburst onto the Olympic stageat the 2018 Pyeongchang Games, winning gold at just 17 years old, then defended her title four years later in Beijing. Shesecured her place on the US Olympic teamfor Milano Cortina last spring after winning the 2025 world championship and finishing the season ranked No 1 in the world.In a caption accompanying the video she posted on Instagram, Kim described riding through “waves of emotions” since the fall, acknowledging both frustration and resolve. She said her immediate focus is rest and rehabilitation, with the goal of returning as soon as possible.“The only thing I can do is rest/do everything in my power to come back as soon as possible,” she said, adding “p.s. I think I am getting old.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026SnowboardingWinter OlympicsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Mike is an incredibly creative football mind whose passion for the game and his players was evident every day. I wish him and his family the best moving forward.”The move is somewhat of a surprise after McDaniel told reporters on Monday that he was part of the team’s search for a new general manager.The Dolphins went 35-33 under McDaniel, reaching the playoffs in his first two seasons but losing in the first round each time. Miami missed the postseason in 2024 after being eliminated by the Jets in the regular-season finale. This season, their postseason hopes ended with a loss to Pittsburgh in Week 15, ensuring their 25-year playoff-win drought – the longest streak in theNFL– would continue.Miami parted ways with longtime general manager Chris Grier at the end of October and began their search for a new general manager this week. But a disjointed finish to the season that saw former first-round pick Tua Tagovailoa benched proved the final straw for Ross, who decided to move on from McDaniel.The Yale-educated McDaniel was seen as emblematic of a generation of young, ambitious head coaches whenhe was appointedby the Dolphins at the age of 38 in 2022. He had impressed the Dolphins with his work as offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers and soon turned around a sputtering Miami offense. In his first season in charge, the Dolphins finished sixth in total offense and were first the following season.However, that momentum has stalled and Tagovailoa has struggled mightily among injuries and a loss of form. On Monday, Taglovailoa said he would be happy to play for a new team next season.“That would be dope,” he said. “I would be good with it.”Explore more on these topicsMiami DolphinsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The NBA cannot treat state violence in a residential neighborhood as background noiseThu 8 Jan 2026 03.30 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 11.25 ESTShareThe SUV sat motionless against a tree on a south Minneapolis street, its engine quiet, angled as if it had simply run out of gas. Except the windshield bore a small shattered star, delicate and sharp, like a snowflake pressed into glass. Cold Minnesota air leaked through the fracture, settling over the still body inside. The car became a sealed room, a thin shell holding death in place, surroundedby the stuffed animalsof the woman’s children.In the street, witnesses screamed. Not in words, but in sounds that come before language, as reality breaks faster than thought.Shock and outrage at scene of Minneapolis ICE shooting: ‘This is just sad’Read moreOn Wednesday morning, during an immigration enforcement operation tied to the Trump administration’s expanded crackdown, a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officershot and killed the driver. Bystander videoshows ICE agentsapproaching the stopped SUV, ordering the woman to open the door and grabbing the handle. As the vehicle began to roll forward, an officer standing in front of it fired at least two shots at close range as the SUV continued on and crashed into parked cars.Federal officials quickly described the killing as self-defense. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey called the incident recklessand demandedthat ICE “get the fuck out of Minneapolis”.The following night, only 15 minutes away, theMinnesota Timberwolvesare scheduled to play the Cleveland Cavaliers.That is the obscenity at the center of this moment. That the machinery of American life – professional sports included – simply lurches forward while a federal agency has just shot a woman dead in a residential neighborhood. The lights can come on at Target Center. The music can play. The crowd can cheer. And this can all be treated as background noise.What kind of country does that? If the goal is to force attention from those with the power to change conditions, the answer is not another statement or vigil. It is leverage. And in modern America, leverage means money. The most effective response available is for the Timberwolves to refuse to play.Not after investigations conclude. Not after the news cycle moves on. Now.Minnesota is not a war zone. It is a US city where people are expected to live ordinary lives. When violence is inflicted by the state in such places, civic institutions should not behave as if nothing has happened. Yes, a boycott would disrupt TV schedules and cost the league, teams and advertisers millions. That is precisely the point. Systems change only when their uninterrupted flow is challenged.The NBA has been here before. In 2020, after police shot Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the Milwaukee Bucksrefused to take the court for a first-round playoff gameagainst Orlando. The decision halted the league. It did more than any carefully worded press release ever could, because it forced a confrontation with economic reality. Athlete labor has power because the system depends on it. The circumstances are different now, but the urgency is not diminished.View image in fullscreenSterling Brown and George Hill were part of the Bucks team that took action after the shooting of Jacob Blake.Photograph: Jesse D Garrabrant/NBAE/Getty ImagesAmericans know the script. After state violence, the first instruction is always patience. Wait for the facts. Trust the investigation. By the time conclusions arrive – if they arrive at all – the moment has passed, and another civilian remains dead. Wednesday’s killing has followed that pattern exactly. Federal officials asserted the necessity of lethal force. Local leaders and witnesses disputed it. Video emerged and was immediately fractured into competing interpretations.What makes the uncertainty more corrosive is that it collides with the government’s own stated standards. A senior Department of Homeland Security officialtold NBC Newsthat ICE officers are trained never to approach vehicles from the front, instead using a 90-degree “tactical L” position. Officers are also instructed not to fire at moving vehicles – and to use lethal force only when there is an immediate risk of serious injury or death. Those facts will be debated for months, perhaps years. That is the environment in which federal power now operates inside American cities.Hannah Arendt warned that the most dangerous violence is not the kind that shocks the conscience, but the kind that becomes ordinary. When killing is treated as procedure, outrage has nowhere to go. A woman is shot dead in the morning, and by nightfall, tipoff arrives. The crowd cheers. Life goes on.This is what happens when armed federal agencies conduct operations in densely populated neighborhoods with minimal local oversight. Public acceptance is demanded immediately, while accountability is indefinitely deferred. Whether this shooting is ultimately ruled justified does not resolve the deeper question: what kind of civic life is possible when lethal federal enforcement becomes routine?The early response revealed more than officials likely intended. Elon Muskdeclared on Xthat the woman had tried to run people over. It was a definitive claim, delivered with the confidence of authority. Less than an hour later, Musk’s own AI system, Grok,publicly contradicted him, stating that the available video did not clearly support the use of lethal force under established standards. This is how state violence is now processed: flattened into competing claims, stripped of consequence, normalized through repetition.What cannot be disputed is the scale of the federal presence. The Department of Homeland Security hasdescribed its current Minnesota operationas the largest of its kind. Thousands of federal officers have been deployed into neighborhoods. Masked agents operate in public streets asleaders warnthat their presence is producing chaos and fear.This is the reality in which professional sports franchises continue to operate.NBA teams often present themselves as apolitical spaces, places of escape. That separation has never been real. Teams are civic institutions whether they acknowledge it or not. Their arenas are public spaces. Every game begins with a patriotic ritual, players and fans standing together to pledge allegiance. Politics cannot be removed from a spectacle that opens with an oath to the nation.The hypocrisy of national leadership only sharpens the moment. Donald Trump has repeatedly cast himself asa defender of protesters abroad, threatening intervention when foreign governments violently suppress dissent. Yet his administration has unleashed federal enforcement at home that leaves civilians dead, followed by demands for patience. Trump immediatelyposted in support of ICE, calling the woman “very disorderly” and claiming she “ran over” an officer. The confidence was total. The evidence remains contested.Calls for athletes to “stay out of it” misunderstand both history and power. Refusing to play would be a profoundly patriotic act. It would declare that federal violence in the city a team calls home will be met with a multi-million-dollar protest that interrupts the flow of capital. That athlete labor will not be separated from the communities that sustain it. That basketball does not float above the city but lives inside it.The Timberwolves have an opportunity to show that the stand taken in 2020 was not branding. That principles still exist beneath the sponsorships. That no game matters more than the lives outside the arena. If they play on, they send a message too – that this is just another night, another body, another thing to move past. That may be the easiest path. It is not the moral one.Explore more on these topicsMinnesota TimberwolvesNBAICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)BasketballUS sportsMinneapolisDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

But there are ways to make it even more compellingOliver ConnollyThu 8 Jan 2026 04.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 11.26 ESTShareRemove teams withlosing recordsNo legitimate Super Bowl champion should have a losing record in the regular season. The Panthers, crowned NFC South champions at 8-9, are not an outlier. Since 2010, five teams with losing records have made the postseason. The 2022 Bucs were the first team to make the dance with a losing record since the league instituted a 17-game schedule. This season, the NFC South has done it again.This isn’t an annual problem, but it is an inherent design flaw.Division champs getting an automatic playoff berth – and a home game – is a hot topic every season. The usual defence is tradition. Divisions matter. Rivalries matter. Storylines matter. And they do – up to a point. Preserving divisions and guaranteeing a playoff berth is essential; there is no need for a record-only free-for-all here. The end-of-seasonSteelers–Ravens gamewas electric precisely because of what was at stake: a division title, a playoff spot, a good seed and the futures ofthe league’s two longest-tenured coaches. But that electricity should not grant teams immunity. You can win your division and still not deserve to play in January. Those ideas do not need to be mutually exclusive.If you win your division with a losing record, you get the hats, the banner and the bonuses. What you should not get is a playoff game. January should belong to teams that proved, at the very least, they could win more often than they lost. That’s not radical. It can be done while still maintaining that division winners keep homefield if they finish above .500.NFL playoff bracketThe Panthers will be a tough out in the wildcard round. They have the ingredients to replicate the 2011 “Beast Quake” game, when the Seahawks and Marshawn Lynch shocked the Saints despite a regular-season 7-9 record. They’ve taken some big scalps this season and have already beaten the Rams. But rewarding them with a home spot against one of the conference’s best after posting a losing record is wrong. If it was switched up this season, Minnesota would be in the playoff field over Carolina, with the home site awarded to the team with the better record (the Rams). That seems a fair swap.Expand the field – but do it cleanlyThere was a time when the NFL’s playoff structure felt close to perfect. Twelve teams. Two byes per conference. Excellence was rewarded, mediocrity filtered out, and the bracket made intuitive sense.Then the formatexpandedto 14 teams, largely to sell another television package and the whole thing began to look misshapen. Seven teams per conference with a single bye is awkward. One team rests, six do not. The reward for being elite is marginal. The punishment for sneaking in is almost nonexistent.There are some upsides. The regular season has more meaningful games down the stretch thanks to extra teams being in the hunt. The two added games have real stakes. What’s not to love? A Week 18 slate where a batch of teams rest their starters is worth it, given the weekend ahead. But the overall structure is ungainly. It is designed to flog TV inventory, not find a champion.View image in fullscreenThe Denver Broncos, as the AFC’s top seed, earned a bye in the wildcard round.Photograph: Hector Acevedo/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockA return to 12 teams isn’t happening. The NFL does not contract; it expands. If that is the direction of travel, then it should at least be done cleanly. Sixteen teams. Eight per conference. Give byes to the top-two seeds, or forgo byes altogether. Preserving homefield advantage for division champions (with a winning record) is a must in the first round. From there, the field should be re-seeded to give whoever had the best regular-season record home advantage.Expansion will eventually arrive – an 18th game, perhaps two new teams. When that time comes, adding an extra playoff spot per conference will be inevitable. The league can – and should – get there early.Bring jeopardy back to kickingIt has been a historic season for kickers. Records are falling for distance and accuracy. Pair that with thenew kickoff rulesandthenew kicking ball, and the playing field has been tilted in dramatic ways.The new rules were introduced to bring a spark back to special teams while reducing the volume of high-end collisions. That has worked. The knock-on consequences, however, have ever so slightlywarped the game. The touchback is being placed at the 35-yard line while quality kickerscomfortably nail kicks from 60 yards. Add the tweaks to special teams rules (such as touching the center) and the kickers are set up in field-goal range more often with more freedom to drill long shots. Case in point: Dallas’ Brandon Aubrey has kicked more 60-yard field goals in his three-yearcareer than every NFL kicker in the 20th century.View image in fullscreenCowboys kicker Brandon Aubrey has 11 field goals from 50-plus yards this season.Photograph: Frank Franklin/APThat’s great for Jacksonville, who will have a significant advantage this postseason because of Cam Little’s leg. Little has boomed field goals from 70 yards (preseason), 68 and 67 this season. Kickers bring the drama, but playoff games should be decided by the players who scrap away for 70-something plays.Lamar Jackson is a once in a lifetime talent. And the Ravens are still going backwardsRead moreThere are two potential changes. One is to add a “kicking zone,” similar to the “landing zone” during kickoffs. With a kicking zone, there would be a point of demarcation – call it the opponent’s 40-yard line – at which a team can attempt a field goal. Before that, an offense has to choose whether to punt the ball away or go for it on fourth down. It would manufacture fourth-down drama and force coaches into uncomfortable decisions.A set zone has its faults. It would feel artificial and clunky. It would also remove some of the strategy of the game. And you just know there will be a playoff game decided by a team falling one yard short of the kicking zone, which would inevitably lead to it being scrapped.The quieter solution is probably the better one: narrow the uprights.Kicking is a discrete skill. And we’re living in the glory years, when even college kickers are converting55-yard efforts. But the environment now allows those players to take on an outsized role. Reducing the width of the uprights would restore risk and suspense without changing the essence of the game. Long field goals would still be attempted, but they would again feel like choices rather than defaults. Tension would return. So would consequences.Right now, the talent of the NFL’s kickers has minimized risk. And risky football is fun. Risky football in theplayoffsis what fuels group chats and debate shows. Addressing the kicking boom would add even more jeopardy.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsJacksonville JaguarsCarolina PanthersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Videos shared on social media showed the Egyptian struggling to serve and position herself on the court.While the practice of favouring local players when awarding wildcards is widespread, including in grand slam and WTA tournaments, Abdelkader’s level of play has raised question marks about the wisdom of awarding her a place in a tournament sanctioned by the International Tennis Federation (ITF).In a statement released on Thursday, Tennis Kenya said: “Ms Abdelkader was granted a wildcard for week two of the event after submitting a formal request,” after a “short-notice withdrawal by the originally intended recipient”.“At the time, Ms Abdelkader was the only other player who had requested a wildcard,” the federation said, which was therefore granted to her based on the “information provided” by the player “and in the interest of maintaining a full and balanced draw while supporting the development of tennis in Africa.“In hindsight, Tennis Kenya acknowledges that this wildcard should not have been granted. The federation has taken note of this experience and will ensure that such an extremely rare occurrence never happen again.”The ITF said the decision to grant invitations for the Nairobi tournament was the responsibility of Tennis Kenya. In a statement published on Facebook, the Egyptian Tennis Federation also denied having played any role in awarding the wildcard to Abdelkader.“She is not registered with the Egyptian Tennis Federation and is not listed on any of our official player rosters,” it said.According to the player’s profile on the ITF website, the Egyptian played the first professional match of her career in Nairobi.Tennis Kenya said it was mindful of the impact the media coverage and social media comments might have on both the players involved in the match.“This is a young person and given the extent and nature of coverage of this match, Tennis Kenya and the ITF recognise the need to keep the wellbeing of both players as a primary consideration,” Tennis Kenya said in a statement. “Both organisations have reached out to the two players to offer support.”Explore more on these topicsTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

She is most adept in the holding midfield role.Coffey was not named in the US’s 26-player squad on Thursday for a training camp in California this month, and that is understood to be related to her being given permission to travel to England.The move would be a blow to the NWSL, with another of its biggest stars leaving, and specifically another key player for the US national side. It would follow high-profile exits forAlyssa ThompsonandNaomi Girma, who were snapped up by Chelsea last year, and the USA right-back Emily Fox is in good form for Arsenal aftermoving in January 2024from North Carolina Courage.City are six points clear at the top of the WSL at the halfway stage in a season that resumes this weekend after the winter break.Brightonon Thursday signed the midfielder Olaug Tvedten from the Norwegian clubVålerenga.

But then Glenn took the ice and was flawless from an opening triple axel to a finishing combination spin, earning 83.05 points, a hug from coach Damon Allen and a standing ovation of her own.“I knew that I came here to do my job,” Glenn said, “and I was happy to see that scores were up, scores were good, and I was able to keep them going up. I felt a responsibility to keep it going better and better and better.”Glenn wound up being the best.Isabeau Levito was third with 75.72 points on the opening night of the national championships, which are the last opportunity for skaters to impress the US Figure Skating officials who will decide the team for the Milan Cortina Olympics on Sunday.The dance competition gets started Thursday night alongside the men’s short program.The 26-year-old Glenn, who four years ago missed nationals and a shot at the Beijing Games because of Covid-19, channeled her trademark power and emotion into a program set to Like A Prayer by Madonna. Glenn followed her axel with a triple flip-triple toe loop, and her triple loop merely catapulted her into a rollicking finish to an energetic program.Allen was waiting for her rinkside, dressed in a maroon suit to match Glenn’s dazzling maroon dress.“Of course I feel ecstatic. The score was huge,” Glenn said. “My grandma passed last year and she was with me from day one, and I just felt it today, and I’m not usually one of those people that says it, but I felt like I had something help me today.”Glenn’s showcase came on the heels of a similarly splendid performance from the 20-year-old Liu, who finished sixth at the Beijing Games, then stepped away from the sport entirely because of burnout, butis in the midst of a remarkable comeback.Last year, she became thefirst American world champion since Kimmie Meissnerin 2006.Now, Liu is among a few US hopefuls trying to deliver women’s Olympic gold for the first time since Sarah Hughes in 2002.Liu performed the same short program from last year’s world championships, opening with a whirling triple flip, landing a solid double axel and finishing with what coach Phillip DiGuglielmo called her best triple lutz-triple loop of the season.“I’m really happy with the lutz,” Liu said. “That was good. That was real good.”View image in fullscreenAlysa Liu competes during the women’s short program on Wednesday night.Photograph: Jeff Roberson/APLevito, the 2023 champion and a former world silver medalist, had to withdraw from nationals last year because of injury. But she looked as if she had never missed a day, performing with style and grace to a medley of music honoring Sophia Loren.“I felt really happy with myself that I did my job,” Levito said. “I feel like I’m in a really good place right now.”Earlier in the night, Alisa Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov began defense of their US pairs title with a near-perfect short program, leaving them nearly eight points clear of the field as they hold out hope of making the American team for the Winter Games.While the 28-year-old Mitrofanov was born in the US, his 26-year-old partner was born in Finland. And despite the couple having wed in early 2024, and Efimova getting a green card approved that summer, she is still waiting for the US to decide whether to waive a three-year waiting period to become a citizen – one of the requirements to represent a nation in the Olympics.But time is running out before US Figure Skating must announce its Olympic team on Sunday.“We’re hoping maybe a last-minute miracle might happen,” Mitrofanov said.Efimova and Mitrofanov seemed to glide inside Enterprise Center on Wednesday night. They opened their short program with a beautiful triple twist, landed their side-by-side triple toe loop in sync, their throw triple loop covered a long expanse of ice, and they finished by pumping their firsts as their music came to a close.They wound up with a season-best 75.31 points, while Audrey Shin and Balazs Nagy were second with 67.67, Ellie Kam and Danny O’Shea right behind with 67.13, and Valentina Plazas and Maximiliano Fernandez were within podium reach with 67.03.“We’re definitely very proud with how we skated tonight. The crowd was amazing,” Mitrofanov said. “We really trusted each other. We trusted our training.

Judgment was due to come in Jeddah but it will be put off for another day at least, and instead of the sack there may be a medal waiting at the end of a month spent on edge after Real defeated Atlético 2-1. Goals from Fede Valverde and Rodrygo set up another Super Cup meeting with Barcelona on Sunday night, opportunity and obligation in one.On a night when Madrid scored after 77 seconds, Atlético’s last opportunity to get a result they probably deserved and force a penalty shootout slipped agonisingly away with only 10 more seconds remaining. Julián Alvarez had it, Antoine Griezmann almost did, but, in at last, a shot from the former just evaded the latter. As the ball bounced past the post, it took Atlético’s hopes with it.Xabi Alonso walking thin line at Madrid even with dressing room backingRead moreAgain, an encounter with their neighbours was hard to take and not that easy to explain either. That was Atlético’s 22nd shot, but they had trailed from the beginning when Gonzalo García, a 21-year-old replacement for Kylian Mbappé, chested down to Jude Bellingham inside the first minute. Conor Gallagher challenged him and, although there didn’t seem to be much in it, Real were handed the free-kick from which Valverde belted in the opener.From 25 yards and with a poorly constructed three-man wall standing before him, Valverde send a superb shot in a straight, rising arrow past Alex Sørloth and into the net. It wasn’t right in the corner, but with that side of the goal unprotected, it was far enough away for Jan Oblak, occupying the other side, to be unable to get more than a slight touch upon it.Real had taken the lead but Atlético took control. Perhaps because Real had taken the lead. One shot had been enough, and for a while it was all Real had; not that Atlético’s possession immediately yielded opportunities. Slowly, though, they were increasing the pressure, Real dropping ever deeper. Álex Baena almost released Alvarez, Sørloth’s effort went over, Alvarez had a shot blocked and Giuliano slipped as he raced into the area going at full, lung-busting pelt which often appears to be the only speed he can go at.Only García was really offering a way out, a constantly reliable recipient of the long ball. But then, just before the half hour, from an Atlético corner that led to a blocked shot from Marcos Llorente, Real were suddenly away and should have doubled their lead. Álvaro Carreras started the charge before Rodrygo took over, ran into the Atlético area, cut inside, sending the defender sliding past and out of shot, but then, clear now, shot weakly at Oblak. A moment later, Vinícius headed way over the bar from close range.View image in fullscreenFede Valverde sent Real Madrid on their way with a goal in the second minute.Photograph: Antonio Villalba/Real Madrid/Getty ImagesAtlético kept on, Real struggling to resist – especially on the left, where Carreras was often alone against the dynamism of Llorente and Giuliano. Occasionally moves broke down with the imprecision of Alvarez, a tad slow mentally, and Baena combined incisive passes with imprecise ones. But Atlético’s opportunities did become clearer. On 31 minutes Thibaut Courtois saved from Baena, then he made a superb save from a Sørloth header at the near post. A moment later, Sørloth somehow headed over from five yards, if that. Llorente and Giuliano had made it again.The lead could have come then and really should have soon after when Baena took the ball from Eduardo Camavinga, dribbled into the area, away from Valverde and Aurélien Tchouaméni. Having made himself space, the toe-end shot was saved by Courtois. The first rebound came to Alvarez, whose shot was blocked by Antonio Rüdiger – possibly with an arm, seen at full speed, but no slower view followed – and the second to Gallagher. His shot skewed wide. It was also the last thing he did, withdrawn at half-time. Real had faced 10 shots but made it there still holding the lead.And so it started again, everyone soon settling into the same pattern, Rüdiger intervening early. Or so it seemed. A sharp pass from Valverde was taken in his stride by Rodrygo, who escaped Robin Le Normand and slipped through the middle to steer a neat finish past Oblak. This was done, or so that seemed too. Because almost immediately a familiar path this time did bear fruit. Giuliano and Llorente combined to go past Vinícius, who didn’t do a huge amount to go with them. Giuliano clipped up the cross to the far post, where Sørloth headed in. There was an hour to go and the game was back on.It was an indication of the damage being done that briefly Alonso moved Bellingham across to protect the left and then with 20 minutes left, was obliged to restructure his defence entirely, Rüdiger and Raúl Asencio were both forced off. Tchouaméni moved back, Carreras moved across to join him at centre-back and the two men introduced, Fran García and Ferland Mendy, became double left-backs. Vinícius was withdrawn, his 16th Madrid game in a row going by without a goal. On the touchline Simeone, with whom words had been exchanged repeatedly, gestured for him to listen to the supporters who were whistling the Brazilian, another brief confrontation flaring up and Alonso later censoring his counterpart’s behaviour.Tiredness told. This was about holding on, seeing out the clock. The good news for Real was that time was passing and Atlético were not creating much now. In fact, Real had the best opportunity, Rodrygo accepting a gift inside the area only to be denied by Oblak, until Atlético raised themselves for one last effort despite the exhaustion. Courtois saved an overhead kick from Griezmann. Llorente, who must have four lungs, curled just wide. And Tchouaméni produced a sensational interception to prevent the Frenchman getting the equaliser, until on 95min 33sec Atlético’s moment came and then went again. Resisting, Real’s moment awaits still.Explore more on these topicsFootballAtlético MadridReal MadridEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The organisation will also hold a protest at the home match against Fulham on 1 February to make their voices heard at Old Trafford.The group wants the removal of the Glazer family and Ratcliffe from the club. Concerns were also expressed in relation to the work of the chief executive, Omar Berrada, and the director of football, Jason Wilcox, in the aftermath of Ruben Amorim’s sacking, which will lead to an interim replacement.“After lurching from one disaster to another, Ratcliffe comes across as an incompetent clown turning the club into a circus. Instead of best in class we’re a laughing stock,” the 1958 said. “It has been an extraordinary and deeply troubling few days at Manchester United.

These include an agreement to help fund road improvements, allied to a plan to encourage supporters driving to matches to park further from the ground.The approval ends a wait that began when detailed final plans were submitted in July and will delight the 26,000 fans on the club’s waiting list for season tickets. It will also afford Elland Road Uefa category four status, enabling Leeds to bid to host tournament matches.The rebuild will begin with the expansion of the John Charles – or West – Stand, from 8,000 seats to 17,750 thanks to the construction of a new upper tier. Preliminary work is due to start shortly and major construction will get under way at the end of this season.Paraag Marathe, the Leeds chair, has confirmed the stadium will remain operational throughout a project that will involve the expansion of the Don Revie – or North – Stand from its 10,414 capacity to a maximum of 15,300. “We are delighted to have secured planning permission for the expansion of Elland Road stadium,” said Marathe. “This is a historic day forLeeds United. As custodians of this great club we are committed to its long-term success and today’s decision supports our ambition to establish Leeds in the Premier League and continue progressing over the years to come.”Explore more on these topicsLeeds UnitedLeedsnewsShareReuse this content"

There’s no more doubt that 2026 will be the sameThu 8 Jan 2026 09.21 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 18.24 ESTShareBy 1934, it was entirely evident what Benito Mussolini was up to. Italy’s dictator had already consolidated power, colonized Libya and annexed the city of Rijeka. He nevertheless got to stage the second-ever World Cup,managing it with a heavy handand even supplanting the Jules Rimet trophy with a far larger one. Hosting and winning that World Cup didn’t sate his expansionist appetites. By the end of the decade, Mussolini would take Ethiopia, annex Albania and back Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war.It was equally well established in 1978 in Argentina that General Jorge Rafaél Videla’s military junta, which had taken over two years earlier, was maintaining its grip on power throughsystematic detention, torture and murder. Still, protestations from other nations were ignored and the World Cup kicked off.“At last, the world can see the true face of Argentina,” saidFifapresident João Havelange at the opening ceremony, newly decorated with a medal from Videla.Argentina spared no expense in putting on itsWorld Cup, even though the total cost was a state secret. But the right-wing government also didn’t bother to slow the pace at which it disappeared political dissidents and opponents. Germany captain Berti Vogts proclaimed that “Argentina is a country where order reigns. I haven’t seen a single political prisoner,” though, so no matter.Trump loomed over sport like never before in 2025. Next year he will take even moreRead moreWhen Vladimir Putin presided over the opening ceremony to the 2018 World Cup, it had been four years since his forces annexed Crimea from Ukraine and he backed pro-Russian rebels in the Donbas region. Fifa didn’t mind.The problematic nature of these events may have been obvious at the time, but took some time to be fully acknowledged; for there to be no mistaking the actions and intentions of the host government. Years from now, when we look back on the geopolitical context of the 2026 World Cup – shared with Canada and Mexico but hogged by the United States – we’ll likely place it in the same category as those others. Hopefully, we have perfect clarity, and this edition of the World Cup will take its place among the most shameful incarnations of the quadrennial tournament.This conclusion was crystalized bylast week’s forceful and bloody abduction of the sitting president of Venezuela and his wife, before US president Donald Trumpannounced that the socialist state was now effectively an American-run territory.That was, of course, after Trump, or his henchmen,softened their support for Ukrainein its ongoing war with Russia;literally blew boats out of the wateron mere suspicion of drug trafficking;threatened to invade Mexicoandannex Canada(their World Cup co-hosts!),Greenlandandthe Panama canal; and started a trade war with, well,basically everybody,disrupting the global economy.We don’t yet know how far this administration, which promised isolationism but has insteaddelivered geopolitical mayhem, will go in a foreign policy that lacks any coherence beyond the governing assumption that it can do whatever it feels like.But it’s clear that it may just be getting started.Still, the World Cup will proceed. Fifa president Gianni Infantino has been immovable inhis support for Trump. Unlike Havelange and Videla, themedals and fake awardsare going in the other direction.It’s been some time since we had a World Cup without reasonable controversy. The 2010 and 2014 editions in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, were widely panned locally for the strain they put on nations with far more pressing needs. And yet those legitimate complaints seem quaint compared to the 2022 tournament in Qatar, acquired under well-documented corruption and leading directly tomany deaths and human rights abuses. The 2030 tournament will inevitably grow notorious for spreading the thing out over threecontinents, greatly increasing the environmental impact and giving the lie to any claims Fifa once made of caring for the climate. And then there’s the 2034 World Cup, which has already been signed over to the Saudi Arabia’s strongman de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman.The US-dominated World Cup fits neatly into this run. This nation isn’t presently in a position to lecture anybody else on human rights – nor has it ever been. The Qataris and Saudis are sportswashing outliers no longer. This is just what the World Cup is now: a convenient vehicle for carrying the aims of dangerously self-interested people.Perhaps some kind of boycott movement from fans toward Fifa events will gather steam, although the slow slide of acceptance to where we are suggests otherwise. One didn’t come off before Qatar, either, in spite of a lot of noise. It’s doubtful such a boycott would accomplish much by way of embarrassing the men, and the odd woman, who have killed off the parts of themselves that once felt shame anyway.Soccer has fully gone the way of the Olympics and Formula One, which long ago made their peace with whatever sordid baggage came attached to the highest bidder for their events.And when the story is told of how the World Cup fully and finally lost its way, they will point to the 2026 edition, played in Canada and Mexico and – problematically, embarrassingly, irredeemably – these United States.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on May 12.

Although the Yorkshire club lost that final to Bayern Munich, Yorath was an influential, combative, mainstay of the 1974 first division champions.Terry Yorath obituaryRead moreA player who initially struggled to break into Revie’s first XI saw his intelligence and professionalism win new friends at Coventry, Tottenham and Vancouver Whitecaps before becoming player-coach atBradfordCity. Yorath would later juggle club management at Bradford and then Swansea with managing Wales.He was at Bradford in 1985 on the day of theValley Parade firethat resulted in the death of 56 fans and left a further 270 injured. Yorath himself required treatment after being forced to jump from a window after bravely evacuating supporters from a club bar.As a player he won 59 caps for Wales, 42 as captain and, as manager, he guided the principality to the verge of qualification for the 1994 World Cup finals before a 2-1 defeat to Romania dashed that dream.View image in fullscreenYorath pictured with Coventry City in 1978.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyTwo years earlier Yorath’s life had changed irrevocably when his 15-year-old son Daniel collapsed and died while they were playing football in the back garden of their Yorkshire home. It emerged that Daniel had the genetic heart condition hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Yorath also had two daughters, the BBC sports presenter Gabby, and Louise as well as another son, Jordan. On Wednesday night Gabby Logan was presenting Match of the Day but left the studio part way through the programme due to “a family emergency”. On Thursday morning she and her siblings released a statement about their father’s passing.“To most he was a revered footballing hero but to us he was Dad; a quiet kind and gentle man. Our hearts are broken but we take comfort knowing that he will be reunited with our brother, Daniel.”Leeds said they were “devastated” to learn of Yorath’s death. “Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Terry’s family, friends and former team-mates at this incredibly sad time,” a club statement read.Yorath’s impact on Welsh football was “immeasurable”, said the Wales manager, Craig Bellamy. “The impact Terry Yorath had on Welsh football is immeasurable,” Bellamy said on the Football Association of Wales’ X account. “Terry epitomised everything it means to represent Cymru as a player, and watching the 1994 World Cup qualifying campaign with him as manager was the first time I experienced genuine belief that our country could qualify for a major tournament. As a country, we have so much to thank Terry for what he did.”Ashley Williams, who captained Wales at Euro 2016, said: “He’s such an icon in Welsh football. A footballing hero, such a big personality in Welsh football. It’s a huge loss. He’s one of those massive names you hear about when you get selected for Wales. He’s at the top of that list and you know you’ve got to live up to what he achieved.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.After losing the Wales job – a decision that upset and angered many – Yorath had stints in charge of Cardiff, Sheffield Wednesday and Margate either side of a two-year interlude in Beirut as the manager of Lebanon, overseeing a substantial improvement in the team’s fortunes between 1995-97.At the time Lebanon was emerging from a 15-year civil war and it seemed that Yorath had found sanctuary in a country that understood human loss. In a 1996 interview with Robert Fisk, Yorath spoke movingly of his enduring grief. He revealed that the football he and Daniel had been playing with four years earlier had never been moved from the spot where it had dropped in the back garden of the family home when his son collapsed. “It’s still there,” he said.During this period Yorath’s wife, Christine, remained in England and, after a separation, they divorced in 2007. During an interview with BBC Radio Wales in 2017 Yorath acknowledged he “didn’t really cope” with Daniel’s death. “I started drinking more,” he said. It echoed his reflection in an Observer interview in 2005: “Rather than bring us together, Daniel’s death has driven the family apart,” said Yorath. “I haven’t achieved what I could have since that afternoon.”He had, though, already hit heights other could only dream of touching. “Sad news,” reflected Yorath’s former Wales team-mate Mickey Thomas. “A brilliant captain and player.” The former Bradford striker Dean Windass spoke for many who had crossed paths with Yorath, describing him as a “great man and a gentleman”.Explore more on these topicsFootballWalesLeeds UnitedBradfordTottenham HotspurCoventry CitynewsShareReuse this content"

That they don’t sleep and instead think a lot, like I’m going to.”Faux-humble José Mourinho plays his part on oddly tender Chelsea return | Barney RonayRead moreTheBenficapresident, Rui Costa, said after the defeat that the squad had already planned to stay at Seixal after the game in Leiria, a city 90 miles north of Lisbon. “It’s not a punishment, it’s a precaution for the next games,” he told Portuguese media. “It was already planned that the players would spend the night in Seixal.”The final of the League Cup will be played on Saturday in Leiria, but with Benfica not taking part, Mourinho said the squad would start preparing for their Portuguese Cup quarter-final against Porto next week. There was no indication as to whether his players would leave Seixal before Wednesday’s match at Estádio do Dragão.“Since there’s no final on Saturday, our next game is against Porto next Wednesday,” said Mourinho, who signed a two-year deal with Benfica in September. “Tomorrow, we’ll start talking and preparing for Porto.”View image in fullscreenBenfica’s Leandro Barreiro (left) and Samuel Dahl react to the defeat in Leiria.Photograph: Paulo Novais/EPABenfica went into Wednesday’s game as favourites to win the tournament, after local rivals Sporting lost to Vitória Guimarães in Tuesday’s first semi-final. Braga took a two-goal lead into the break, with Pau Víctor and Rodrigo Zalazar on target in Leiria.Vangelis Pavlidis’s penalty pulled one back, but Gustaf Lagerbielke secured victory for Braga before the Benfica defender Nicólas Otamendi was sent off in stoppage time. The defeat is another setback in a season where Benfica sit 10 points behind leaders Porto in the league, and have two wins from six Champions League matches.“The first half was awful, inexplicable,” Mourinho said. “I can’t find anything positive in the first half outside the first five minutes. The second half belonged to us, so would a draw have been a fair result? No. Anyone who plays as badly as we did in the first half deserves to lose.”“It would have been much easier to come here and congratulate Braga, but I can’t say that,” the 62-year-old added. “It wasn’t Braga that won, it was us who lost.” Mourinho also suggested his players did not respond to his team talk after the game, and questioned their overall mentality.“There was so much sadness, it ended up being a monologue,” he said. “But I don’t want to believe a Benfica player is nervous about a League Cup semi-final, because then he’s not a player for Benfica.”Explore more on these topicsJosé MourinhoBenficaEuropean club footballShareReuse this content"

The captain posted a strongly worded message after Wednesday’sdefeat at Bournemouththat initially appeared to accuse the hierarchy of telling “lies” before being edited to remove that incendiary reference.What remained onRomero’s ­Instagram post, though, was an apparent call for the Spurs directors to speak up. The players and Frank were again subjected to abuse by some of their fans after a latest loss that leaves Tottenham with five points from their past six matches, two of which have ended in defeat.Antoine Semenyo’s parting gift gives Bournemouth victory over shaky SpursRead more“At times like this, it should be other people coming out to speak, but they don’t – as has been ­happening for several years now,” Romero’s post said. “They only show up when things are going well.” In the initial post the second sentence read: “They only show up when things are going well, to tell a few lies.”Since Daniel Levy, who rarely spoke publicly,was forced out of his role at Spurs chairin early ­September, a new leadership team have been ­running the club. Peter Charrington,who was brought on to the board in March, stepped into a newly created role of nonexecutive chair. Vinai ­Venkatesham has been the chief executive since June. The club are run by the Lewis family through a family trust. They are relations of the British businessman Joe Lewis, the former Spurs owner.Frank said he and Johan Lange had talked to Romero on Thursday. “A lot of the things he’s done well on and off the pitch, I’m happy with,” the head coach said. “But also when you’re a young leader sometimes you make a mistake. Of course it’s good to keep it internally. Johan and I had a good conversation with him this morning about everything, which we of course keep internally.”Post-game footage from ­Bournemouth showed Micky van de Ven and Pedro Porro ­arguing with supporters. Romero also posted: “Apologies to all fans of you who ­follow us everywhere, who are always there and will continue to be. We are responsible, there’s no doubt about that. I am the first. But we will keep facing up to it and trying to turn the situation around, for ourselves and for the club.”His message concluded: “­Especially at times like this, ­keeping quiet, working harder and ­moving forward all together, is part of ­football. All together, it will be easier.”The Spurs striker Richarlison responded to Romero’s message with a hand-clapping emoji and Porro posted a response that began: “Amen.”Frank, under growing pressure with Spurs 14th in the Premier League, said Mohammed Kudus was not expected to return from injury until April. The Dane was ­pictured at Bournemouth holding an ­Arsenal-branded coffee cup after Spurs’ arch-rivals played at the stadium last weekend. “I definitely did not notice it,” he said. “It’s fair to say not ­winning every single football match, it would be absolutely stupid of me to [intentionally] take an Arsenal cup.”Guardian sportExplore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

The 26-year-old captained the side in the third one-day international the following day, scoring six from 11 balls, as England lost by two wickets toseal a 3-0 series defeat.Brook is understood to have self-reported the incident to England’s management, which led to the England and WalesCricketBoard (ECB) launching a formal disciplinary process that culminated in him being fined £30,000, the biggest financial penalty available, and warned about his future conduct. The Guardian has been told that the matter was handled by the highest levels of the ECB executive, who gave serious consideration to withdrawing the one-day captaincy.“I want to apologise for my actions,” Brook said in a statement on Thursday. “I fully accept that my behaviour was wrong and brought embarrassment to both myself and the England team.“Representing England is the greatest honour of all, which I take seriously and I am deeply sorry for letting down my teammates, coaches and supporters. I have reflected on the lessons it has taught me about responsibility, professionalism and the standards expected of those representing your country.“I am determined to learn from this mistake and to rebuild trust through my future actions, both on and off the field. I apologise unreservedly and will work hard to ensure this does not happen again.”The ECB said: “We are aware of this incident and it has been dealt with through a formal and confidential ECB disciplinary process. The player involved has apologised and acknowledged their conduct fell below expectations on this occasion.”Brook’s behaviour will lead to further scrutiny of England’s professionalism during two disastrous winter tours that have brought only one scrappy win – in the two-day Melbourne Test – from eight matches across two formats.The ECB may also face questions about the nature of the disciplinary process. Earlier in the tour, the managing director, Rob Key, had brushed off questions about social media footage that purported to show Brook and Jacob Bethell drinking at a rooftop bar in Wellington – earlier on the same night that culminated in the bouncer contretemps.“There wasn’t any action, like formal action,” Key said, when asked about the footage of Brook and Bethell before the fourth Test in Melbourne. “We’ve had four years where we’ve had none of these issues really, with any of the players. And there’s a whole process that we put in place for stuff like that, for what you do if they’re out of line. And I didn’t feel like that was worthy of formal warnings. But it was probably worthy of informal ones.3:07'We're losing more': Ben Stokes admits England need to go back to the drawing board – video“I think that was a bit of a wake-up call actually for what they’re going into,” Key added. “I don’t mind players having a glass of wine over dinner. Anything more than that, I think is ridiculous, really.”Key and the ECB also opted to take no action after an informal investigation into reports of excessive drinking during England’s mid-Ashes break in Noosa. Social media footage emerged from that trip of Ben Duckett appearing to slur his words in a late-night exchange with fans, one of whom advised him to “get an Uber to the nets” due to his poor form during the series.Brook was one of several England players photographed relaxing at a beachfront bar during the day in the Queensland resort. During a press conference before the third Test in Adelaide, he said the tourists “had a belting time” on the Sunshine Coast.Although he was England’s second-highest run-scorer in the Ashes series after Joe Root, Brook did not live up to his billing in Australia, passing 50 only twice in 10 innings and not scoring a hundred.In announcing a post-tour review shortly after the end of the Sydney Test, the ECB chief executive, Richard Gould, confirmed that its remit would include the team’s culture and behaviours, as well as on-field performance.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26Harry BrookEngland cricket teamThe AshesCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

McCullum, in turn, has accepted the need for improvement but will push back if he is told what to do.“If I’m asked my opinion he’ll be getting my full support and ­backing,” Stokes said after England’s five-wicket defeat at the SydneyCricketGround. “I absolutely love working with Baz. He’s a great man and he’s a very, very, very good coach. There’s more that goes on behind the scenes than he’ll ever give away or let out. So, yeah, he’s got my full support.”Australia hold on to win fifth Ashes Test and leave England rueing missed chancesRead moreLosing Ashes tours have traditionally led to bloodletting in the captaincy, coaching and administrative tiers. Stokes looks by far the most secure, and he confirmed at the end of play that, despite injury and diminishing returns with the bat, he has no intention of leaving his post.He said: “I am definitely keen as anything to carry on. I love having a challenge thrown at me and at the moment, the challenge is getting the team back to where we once were in terms of the performances that we were delivering.”McCullum appears safe before the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka that starts in February – plus a tour of Sri Lanka that serves as a warm-up starting two weeks today – but in the aftermath of the loss in Australia, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced it was already undertaking a review.Richard Gould, the chief executive, has said this will include “planning and preparation, individual performance and behaviours, and our ability to adapt and respond effectively as circumstances require”.This may result in a pinch point down the line, with McCullum set on his methods and sounding as if he will reject any suggestions that compromise them. “I am not against assistance but have a firm belief in how to get the best out of these players,” the New Zealander told BBC Sport.“I will look at it individually and say ‘what could I have done better?’ Am I for being told what to do? Of course I am not. But at the same time I’m not thinking there won’t be areas to improve.”View image in fullscreenBrendon McCullum speaks to members of the media at the end of the fifth Ashes Test.Photograph: David Gray/AFP/Getty ImagesStokes’s commitment to the Test captaincy was to be expected but, reflecting on the tour, he also admitted that his team has been tactically found out by opponents in recent contests and unable to adapt in turn. He said: “We are now playing against teams who have answers to the style of cricket that we have been playing over quite a long period of time now. In the first couple of years, teams found it difficult to try and come up with anything to combat the way that we played. But now teams are coming up with plans that are actually standing up to a certain style of cricket that we want to play.“You can see in moments throughout the series that when we’ve been positive and we have taken a few risks it has paid off in our favour, but there have been moments in games throughout the series and even before that, where we’ve almost gifted the flow of the game back to the opposition.”At one point Stokes even suggested England would now go “back to the drawing board”, although for now the detail of this appears to be confined to having “honest discussions”, including honest discussions with himself.He said: “When things haven’t gone well that filters throughout the whole group. Even myself, I’ve not been up to levels I expected of myself as an all-round player, as a captain as well. But I can tell that to myself. There’s nothing wrong with being truthful to yourself, and there’s also nothing wrong with being truthful to your teammates as well. Speaking the truth and saying stuff people don’t want to hear is sometimes the best thing.”Stokes insisted that his current dressing room still contains “the best players in England” and paid tribute to the “warrior spirit” of Brydon Carse in particular after finishing the tour with 22 wickets.He added: “Brydon Carse has played five Test matches, he’s run in every single time and given his absolute all and he has not shied away from any situation. Josh Tongue bowled I don’t know how many overs, he had to pick up a slack when I got injured and then he came in again today.“So in terms of this warrior tag that people get given, I think everyone does that when you pull the England shirt on. I don’t think anyone can question what some of the guys have done, especially with the ball. I’ve not seen anyone not giving their absolute everything every single time.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesBen StokesBrendon McCullumAustralia cricket teamEngland cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Jones did say the person involved was the father of her children, and the woman has two children with Rice, whom the Chiefs selected in the second round of the 2023 draft.No police reports were available in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, Kansas, where Jones alleges the abuse occurred.Rice missed the first six games this seasonfollowing an NFL suspensionfor his role in causing a crash on a Dallas highway that left multiple people injured during the 2024 offseason. Rice was sentenced to 30 days in jail and five years’ probation after pleading guilty to third-degree felony charges of collision involving serious bodily injury and racing on a highway causing bodily injury.Rice finished with 53 catches for 571 yards and five touchdowns as Kansas City went 6-11and missed the playoffsfor the first time in a decade.Explore more on these topicsKansas City ChiefsNFLDomestic violenceUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The person said the league’s trade call will not take place before Thursday. Typically, teams cannot discuss pending trades until they are approved by the league.The Timberwolves should not play until ICE violence in Minneapolis is held to account | Lee EscobedoRead more“I know you all have questions for me that right now I’m not at liberty to talk about or answer,” Hawks coach Quin Snyder said, unprompted, at the start of his postgame news conference Wednesday night following Atlanta’s win over New Orleans.NBA reporter Marc Stein was first to disclose that the sides were closing in on a deal, and ESPNfirst reportedthat the agreement was in place.The Wizards held McCollum and Kispert out of their loss at Philadelphia on Wednesday night, and Young was on the bench in street clothes for Atlanta. He left the bench area in the fourth quarter, then returned and left again for the final time with about 30 seconds left – slapping hands with a few fans as he headed toward the locker room.He leaves Atlanta as the Hawks’ career leader in assists (passing Doc Rivers) and three-pointers (passing Mookie Blaylock). He’s fourth on Atlanta’s free-throws list and sixth in points.Hawks power forward Mouhamed Gueye said he didn’t know during Wednesday’s game that the trade news had gone public. He had nothing but high praise afterward for his time with Young.“That’s TY. That’s Trae Young,” Gueye said. “When I first got here, he was one of the first guys that texted me, welcoming me to the city, gave me a lot of advice. Obviously, playing with Trae, as a big, is like a dream come true. I love him as a guy, I love him as a teammate. ... An Atlanta legend.”Young is 10th in points, 12th in points per game, first in assists and first in assists per game since entering theNBAas the No 5 pick in the 2018 draft.He is one of five players to rank in the top 10 in both points and assists since he entered the league; the others are Denver’sNikola Jokić, the Los Angeles Lakers’ Luka Dončić, the Los Angeles Clippers’ James Harden and Phoenix’s Devin Booker.View image in fullscreenTrae Young, left, reacts during the third quarter with Atlanta’s Dyson Daniels and Zaccharie Risacher during Wednesday’s game.Photograph: Todd Kirkland/Getty ImagesJokić has won a championship and is a three-time MVP. Dončić is considered an MVP candidate, Harden is a member of the 75th anniversary team, and Booker is a two-time Olympic gold medalist.Young doesn’t get the level of respect those players have earned. He’s a four-time All-Star – two of those nods coming through voting, two of them coming when NBA commissioner Adam Silver added him to the roster as an injury replacement.But the Hawks, this season anyway, have been better without Young. Atlanta were 2-8 this season when Young played; the Hawks are 16-13 without him. Over his career, the Hawks won 49% of their games when Young wasn’t in the lineup – as opposed to 45% when he played.He has a player option for about $49m for next season and is eligible for a three-year extension with the Wizards.McCollum averaged 18.8 points in 35 games with Washington this season and is a 19.6-point scorer for his career. The Hawks will become his fourth team; he also played for Portland and New Orleans.Kispert has been a backup for the bulk of his five NBA seasons, all with Washington.

Nearly three-quarters of posts collected and analyzed by a PhD researcher at Dublin’sTrinity Collegewere requests for nonconsensual images of real women or minors with items of clothing removed or added.The posts offer a new level of detail on how the images are generated and shared onX, with users coaching one another on prompts; suggesting iterations on Grok’s presentations of women in lingerie or swimsuits, or with areas of their body covered in semen; and asking Grok to remove outer clothing in replies to posts containing self-portraits by female users.Among hundreds of posts identified by Nana Nwachukwu as direct, nonconsensual requests for Grok to remove or replace clothing, dozens reviewed by the Guardian show users posting pictures of women including celebrities, models, stock photos and women who are not public figures posing in snapshots.Several posts in the trove reviewed by the Guardian have received tens of thousands of impressions and come from premium, “blue check” accounts, including accounts with tens of thousands of followers. Premium accounts with more than 500 followers and 5m impressions over three months are eligible for revenue-sharing under X’seligibility rules.In one Christmas Day post, an account with more than 93,000 followers presented side-by-side images of an unknown woman’s backside with the caption: “Told Grok to make her butt even bigger and switch leopard print to USA print. 2nd pic I just told it to add cum on her ass lmao.”A 3 January post, representative of dozens reviewed by the Guardian, captioned an apparent holiday snap of an unknown woman: “@grok replace give her a dental floss bikini.” Within two minutes, Grok provided a photorealistic image that satisfied the request. Other posts in the trove show more sophisticated employment of JSON-prompt engineering to induce Grok to generate novel sexualized images of fictitious women.The data does not cover all such requests made to Grok. While content analysis firm Copyleaksreported on 31 Decemberthat X users were generating “roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute”, Nwachukwu said that her sample is limited to just more than 500 posts she was able to collect with X’s API via a developer account. She said that the true scale “could be thousands, it could be hundreds of thousands” but that changes made by Musk to the API mean that “it is much harder to see what is happening” on the platform. On Wednesday, Bloomberg Newscited researcherswho found that Grok users were generating up to 6,700 undressed images per hour.Nwachukwu, an expert on AI governance and a longtime observer of and participant in social media safety initiatives, said that she first noticed requests along these lines from X users back in 2023.At the time, she said, “Grok did not oblige the requests. It wasn’t really good at doing those things.” The bot’s responses began changing in 2024, and reached a critical mass late last year.In October 2025, she noticed that “people were putting Halloween attire on themselves using Grok. Of course, a section of users realized we can also ask it to change what other people are wearing.” By year’s end, “there was a huge uptick in people asking Grok to put different people in bikinis or other types of suggestive clothing”.There were other indications last year of an increased willingness to tolerate or even encourage the generation of sexually suggestive material with Grok.In August,xAI incorporated a “spicy mode” settingin the mobile version of Grok’s text-to-video generation tool, leading the Verge to characterize it as “a service designed specifically to make suggestive videos”.Nwachukwu’s data is just the latest indication of how the platform under Musk has become a magnet for forms of content that other platforms work to exclude, includinghate speech,gore contentand copyrighted material.On Friday, Grok issued abizarre public apologyover the incident on X, claiming that “xAI is implementing stronger safeguards to prevent this”. On Tuesday, X Safety posted apromise to banusers who shared child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Musk himself said: “Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”Nwachukwu said, however, that posts like those she has already collected are still appearing on the platform. Musk is giving “the middle finger to everyone who has asked for the platform to be moderated”, she said. The billionaire slashed Twitter’s trust and safety teams when he took over in 2022.She added that other AI chatbots do not have the same issues.“Other generative AI platforms – ChatGPT or Gemini – they have safeguards,” she said. “If you ask them to generate something that looks like a person, it would never be a depiction ofthatperson. They don’t generate depictions of real human beings.”The revelations about the nonconsensual imagery on X has already drawn the attention of regulators in theUK,Europe, India, andAustralia.Nwachukwu, who is from Nigeria, pointed to a specific harm being done in the posts to “women from conservative societies”.“There’s a lot of targeting of people from conservative beliefs, conservative societies: west Africa, south Asia. This represents a different kind of harm for them,” she said.Explore more on these topicsGrok AIXAI (artificial intelligence)Elon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia whose net worth is nearly $159bn,told Bloomberg Televisionthis week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.“We chose to live in Silicon Valley,” Huang said. “And whatever taxes I guess they would like to apply, so be it.”This puts Huang in stark contrast with Google co-founder Larry Page, Palantir co-founderPeter Thieland Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they’re leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.Thetax proposalis being led by the labor union Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West. If passed, the tax would retroactively apply to residents as of 1 January, and billionaires would have five years to pay it.This means Huang would pay roughly $7bn and Page and Thiel would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $1.3bn, respectively, based on their current net worth.“What remains undeniable is the underlying unfairness of the current system,” Suzanne Jimenez, the chief of staff for SEIU-UHW, said in an email. “Regular working people pay higher effective tax rates than the wealthiest Americans … Asking those who have benefited most from the economy to contribute more – particularly to stabilize health care systems under direct threat – is a reasonable step.”The proposal is still in the beginning phases. Under California law, it needs to collect 874,641 signatures to qualify for the state ballot in November. It would also need to be signed by California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who has said he opposes the wealth tax.“You can’t isolate yourself from the 49 others,” Newsom said when asked about wealth taxes during theNew York Times DealBook Summitlast month. “We’re in a competitive environment.”This puts Newsom at odds with Ro Khanna, the California representative who represents Silicon Valley and who has championed the idea of a wealth tax. Khanna says tech billionaires will likely stay in the state, despite a tax, because California is where the larger industry, innovation and talent pool are located. “A billionaire tax is good for American innovation,” Khanna said, adding that it would spread the wealth to other sectors.When Thiel indicated he was leaving California because of the proposed tax, Khannaposted to X: “I echo what FDR said with sarcasm of economic royalists when they threatened to leave, ‘I will miss them very much.’”Some billionaires fleeThis is not California’s first billionaire exodus. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, famously departed for Texas in 2020, which stood tosave him millions in taxes. He has also shiftedseveral of his companies’ headquartersthere. Most recently, in 2024, Musk announced he was moving SpaceX to Texas because of a California law that aimed to protect transgender children in schools. Hecalled the lawa “final straw”.Other tech billionaires have also decamped to Texas, which has no state income tax. Citing a better tax environment, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdalemoved to Austinin 2020, and Larry Ellison transitioned Oracle’s headquarters there in 2020 (he has since said he’s moving the company to Nashville). Michael Dell, the founder of Dell Technologies, has long lived in Texas.Sacks made his announcement on 31 December, posting an image of the Texas flag on X and saying: “God bless Texas.” In a separate post the following day, Sacks wrote: “As a response to socialism, Miami will replace NYC as the finance capital and Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.”Musk, Lonsdale and Dell all responded with hearty welcomes. “No one will fight harder for the independent and free spirit of Texas than people who know [sic] it’s like when that’s taken away,” Muskwrote.Page has not publicly said where he’s moving, but in December companies associated with the Google co-founder filed documents to incorporate in Florida,according to the New York Times. He purchased two homes in Miami for $173.4m in December and January,The Wall Street Journalreported. Thiel, who owns a home in the Hollywood Hills, also seems to have set his sights on Florida. His investment firm, Thiel Capital,announcedon 31 December that it had opened an office in Miami. The firm said Thiel has maintained a personal residence in the city since 2020.On X, tech investors and other billionaires have blasted the proposed wealth tax. Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and former Facebook executive,saidthat without billionaires, California’s “budget deficit will only get bigger”, and Vinod Khosla, another investor,saidthat under the proposed tax, “California will lose its most important taxpayers and net off much worse”.Some have indicated they’d work to oust Khanna from Congress. Martin Casado, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz,wrotethat Khanna had “devolved into an obnoxious jerk” and that his support of the wealth tax had alienated him from moderates. In response, Garry Tan, the CEO of the startup accelerator Y Combinator,wrote: “Time to primary him.”The SEIU’s Jimenez said states like Massachusetts and Washington, which have other forms of wealth taxes, have seen billions of dollars raised to help the state. At the same time, she said, high-income residents have continued tosee their portfolios grow. Jimenez added that the union is “heartened” by Huang’s recent comments and is hopeful that more billionaires will follow suit.As for Huang, he saidNvidiais in Silicon Valley because that’s where the engineers are and he’s not worried about a billionaire tax.“Not this person,” Huang said. “This person is trying to build the future of AI.”Representatives for Page, Thiel, Sacks and Newsom did not return requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaThe super-richTax avoidanceUS politicsNvidiaPeter ThielLarry PagenewsShareReuse this content"

Rogers said she would issue a written order after the hearing that addresses OpenAI’s attempt to throw out the case.The court dispute comes amid a broader showdown over dominance in the market for generative artificial intelligence.Musk’s xAIand itschatbot Grokare competing with OpenAI and other technology developers.Musk is seeking unspecified monetary damages from what he calls “ill-gotten gains” by OpenAI.In a statement after the hearing, OpenAI said: “Mr Musk’s lawsuit continues to be baseless and a part of his ongoing pattern of harassment, and we look forward to demonstrating this at trial.”Musk’s startup xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Steven Molo, a lead trial attorney for the billionaire and xAI, said after the hearing: “We look forward to presenting all the evidence of the defendants’ wrongdoing to the jury.”Musk contends he contributed about $38m (£28m), roughly 60% of OpenAI’s early funding, along with strategic guidance and credibility, based on assurances that the organisation would remain a nonprofit dedicated to the public benefit.The lawsuit accuses OpenAI co-founders Altman and Greg Brockman of plotting a for-profit switch to enrich themselves, culminating in multibillion-dollar deals with Microsoft and a recent restructuring.OpenAI, Altman and Brockman have denied the claims, and have described Musk as “a frustrated commercial competitor seeking to slow down a mission-driven market leader”.Microsoft, which is also a defendant, urged Rogers to throw out Musk’s claims against it. A lawyer for Microsoft said there was no evidence that the company “aided and abetted” OpenAI.Microsoft has been approached for comment.Lawyers for OpenAI at the hearing asked Rogers to enter judgment against Musk, contending that he had not shown enough of a factual basis to sustain his allegations including fraud and breach of contract.OpenAI also contends that Musk failed to bring his allegations in a timely manner. The judge said the jury would be asked to weigh whether the lawsuit was filed outside the statute of limitations.Explore more on these topicsOpenAIElon MuskSam AltmanAI (artificial intelligence)Technology sectornewsShareReuse this content"

The flights were expensive, and it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, so she asked her manager if she could extend the trip by two weeks, and work remotely from her friend’s house.That was her first taste of a “workation” – combining working with a holiday – and she loved it. She now regularly arranges petsitting in different places so she can visit family, friends and new cities for long weekends without spending extra.“I just think it’s brilliant for work-life balance. It’s a great way to have a change of scene – your evenings and weekends, you feel like you’re on a mini-holiday,” she said. “It’s just getting out in nature, a different perspective, different environment.”At 48, Katherine doesn’t fit the stereotype of a young digital nomad living a freewheeling life. But she’s one of a growing number of people of all ages who are taking advantage of digital technologies and increasing flexibility from employers to explore new ways of making the most of their free time.As a conference manager at a university, she needs to be in her hometown when she’s organising an event, but otherwise she can work anywhere where she can take a laptop. Her employer doesn’t have a formal policy, but managers will consider all requests.“It all comes down to individual relationships and trust, and having that autonomy – I know my deadlines, my role and what I need to get done; that doesn’t change if I’m at home or elsewhere,” she said.View image in fullscreenKatherine fits in some sightseeing at Piazza Municipio in Naples, Italy.Research from the Chartered Management Institute found that one in eight employers have a formal policy onworkations, while one in five managers said they had taken one themselves. Most perceived them positively, citing benefits such as mental health and work-life balance, though some feared data security implications.Petra Wilton, director of policy and external affairs at the CMI, recommended that employers should “put clear, transparent rules in place and actively manage them” to give managers the confidence to be supportive.A recent Grant Thorntonsurveysuggests the use of formal arrangements is growing, with the number of businesses with a workations policy increasing from 59% in 2023 to 77% in 2025. AYouGovpoll found that 37% of people able to work remotely were interested in taking a workation in the next 12 months.‘The adventure can turn into a disaster’: the digital nomad families ‘worldschooling’ their childrenRead moreTravel companies are also targeting these holidaymakers – for example Tui has a workation page advertising “handpicked hotels that are perfect for a working holiday”.This reflects a shift in people’s priorities from work-life balance towards “work-life blending”, where the boundaries between life and work are more blurred, said Daniel Wheatley, a researcher in the University of Birmingham’s management department.He added that “workation” was a comparatively new term in academic circles that arose out of the cultural changes brought about by the Covid pandemic, advances in digital technologies since the 1990s, and travel, holidays and leisure pursuits going mainstream in the late 1970s.The term reflects a growing culture of “life first, work second”, especially among younger employees, who are “exploring different ways of engaging in work, different forms and structures of careers rather than a linear pathway”, he said.But rather than being a new way of working, the growth of knowledge and service work could actually herald a full circle return to the medieval era of artisans and craftspeople living in the same place as their workshops, he added.“It gives a sense of freedom and allows people to take more control over lives,” he said, noting that it could also help people juggle caring responsibilities.However, he underscored the importance of proper breaks from work, so that workations are about “leisure time, social connectedness and wider wellbeing”, rather than “increased monitoring meaning [employees] never feel offline or disconnected”.Equally, access to perks such as workations risked entrenching division in society between people who have benefited from digital technologies and those who have not, in particular those who experiencedigital or labour market exclusionand precarity.Ian Brown, 58, a managing director for an industrial engineering company, has taken several workations to extend his holiday allowance after working from a beach hut in Jamaica, and now extends the perk to his employees.“It does feel ultimately that you’ve got more time away from the office space than normal – it takes you out of that environment, you’re away and doing something you enjoy. It refreshes you and gives you an added perk,” he said.He feels that flexibility helps him accept the more onerous aspects of his job, such as 60-hour weeks and out-of-hours work, and fosters a culture of trust and reciprocity with employees. “They remember that when you’re up against it and ask them for help.”He added: “The drawback I feared was that they would take the workation and not respond to requests to do something – that’s never happened – and the positivity is extraordinary.”Explore more on these topicsWork-life balanceWork & careersDigital BritainnewsShareReuse this content"

There is a hero, Ramza – an idealistic nobleman with luscious blond hair who cavorts about the medieval-inspired realm of Ivalice in search of high adventure. But quickly, and with narrative elegance, the picture complicates: peasant revolutionaries duke it out with gilded monarchists; machiavellian plots plunge the kingdom into chaos. Ramza must navigate this knotty political matrix, all while experiencing his own ideological awakening.There is a strong case to be made that Final Fantasy Tactics tells a better story than the landmarkFinal Fantasy VII(which saw Cloud Strife and a ragtag bunch of eco-terrorist pals taking on the shady megacorporation Shinra). And with our real-world political focus shifting from the looming threat of the climate crisis to the more pressing rise of fascism (though the two are inextricably linked), one can make the argument that Tactics is now also the more timely game.In this remastered version, the plot still sparkles. Shakespearean dialogue is now fully voice-acted with delightfully hammy performances: you can practically feel the spittle on your face as one of the game’s royalist rotters delivers an incandescent tirade against the common folk.Within this terrific political tapestry, you engage in the real meat of the game: turn-based combat of rare malleability. Each of your party – Ramza, lowborn Delita, and many more – has their own “job” (essentially, a character class), and these can be changed and subsequently remixed with few limitations (want to create a gun-toting mage? No problem!). This level of customisation, coupled with the exquisite diorama levels where the skirmishes take place, results in a symphonic take on chess.These battles aren’t just riotous fun; they are also poetic. “I’ve been dealt a hand. I simply play it,” says one foe during a dramatic showdown at a cascading waterfall. The line speaks to the tragedy that gradually surfaces as you play through these square-gridded encounters – the sense that every character has been thrust into a maelstrom of events bigger than themselves. Heroes, villains, and everyone in between are but pawns on the battlefield, hurtling towards their own prefigured date with destiny.The Ivalice Chronicles is not interested in narrative flexibility; its plot does not bend to the whims of the player likeotherRPGs. The story’s framing – recounted as a historical account in the distant future – makes this abundantly clear. As such, the game is less about fantasy and fairytales than history itself. Forget easy resolutions: here, events simply produce yet more events; trauma begets trauma. It is one battle after another for Ramza and his comrades.This might sound doom-laden, and, in truth, it frequently is. Yet there is no mistaking the moral principles that suffuse writer Yasumi Matsuno’s stirring story of inequality, division, and pig-headed elites who seek to consolidate their already mighty power. Matsuno, who studied foreign policy before becoming an economic reporter, has described Final Fantasy Tactics as a work of “class struggle”. Now, in the time ofNo Kings protestsin the US, theerosion of political rightsin the UK, and thefurther enrichingof the world’s hyperwealthy, the game feels even more resonant.Ramza offers a model for resistance, and also a commentary on the struggle of opposition in such turbulent times. He is principled, uncompromising and always seeks to do right – and his reward is to be deemed a heretic by the most powerful institutions of his time.Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is available now; £39.99Explore more on these topicsGamesFinal FantasyRole playing gamesStrategy gamesPlayStation 4PlayStation 5Nintendo SwitchreviewsShareReuse this content"

But Europe isn’t powerless, and it isn’t aloneThu 8 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 13.05 ESTShareThe US is advancing a new global order. Over the past eight decades Washington pursued – when it suited American interests – an order based on international law, liberalism, multilateralism and democratic values. The new one is based on autocracy and the use of force, and is underpinned by xenophobic nationalism.For the transatlantic relationship this is transformative: it means that coercive action now drives policy change. Europe’s security dependency on the US is leverage to be ruthlessly exploited.Silicon Valleytech firms’ business interests converge with those of the White House, and the US instrumentalises far-right politicians in Europe to achieve its foreign policy objectives.By backing there-election of Donald Trumpand hisvice-president, JD Vance, radical libertarians have ensured that some of their beliefs are driving the ideological turn that is shaping Trump’s second term and the new global order. Ideas popular among radical, libertarian Silicon Valley executives, such aspro-natalism, support for eugenicsand even thereplacementof democracy by CEO-led “monarchy”, are fusing with Maganativism.As Ipredicted in June, the convergence of these forces means this administration will seek to bring about a transatlantic cultural revolution based on nativist values, welcomed by some members of the European far right, with a secondary objective of fragmenting and destroying the EU institutions.While far-right parties onboth sides of the Atlantichave long subscribed to nativist ideas, the US government is today actively seeking to export this ideology to Europe as part of its new imagined order.The US national security strategy (NSS) released by the White Houselast monthis the clearest articulation to date of this objective. It provides a framework for political and ideologicalinterventionismin Europe, drawing on the thinking of Vance and his radical libertarian backers.Theillegal captureof Venezuela’s president shows the lengths the US is willing to go to secure its “interests” and enact the NSS in pursuing this new order.In the case of Europe, the strategy in practice means that US state department funding for US embassies and other activities can be geared specifically towards promoting far-right parties. This may begin with those in the four countries – Austria, Hungary, Italy and Poland – that anunofficial, leaked versionof the strategy document identified as good candidates to be “pulled away” from the EU.Private funding, including from endowed rightwing thinktanks, could also be funnelled to so-called government-organised NGOs – many of which have beenestablished by Viktor Orbán’s regimein Hungary to advance nativist objectives. The US thinktank the Heritage Foundation, architect ofProject 2025, a far-right agenda for the Trump presidency, is reported to beactively seekingties with European thinktanks.At the same time, US tech billionaires have longbankrolledinitiatives to advance nativist ideas in Europe, and weaken and divide the EU. More recently, Elon Musk has used his social media platform, X, toopenly supportthe Alternative für Deutschland(AfD) party in Germany.The result is a toxic mix in which US tech companies’ desire to push the EU to deregulate its social media platforms combines with the White House’s nativist turn. The algorithms of platforms such as X and Meta-owned Instagram thrive on extreme views, including those often put forward by the far right. Attacks on the EU are intended to weaken its resolve to regulate the US tech giants’ businesses. The recentUS sanctioningof European civil society leaders exemplifies the convergence between Silicon Valley’s interests and the White House. It is intended to have a chilling effect on pro-democracy organisations working to counter online disinformation.As the US turns to singlehandedly changing the world order, the norms and laws European democracies stand for – democracy, human rights, the rule of law – which are already strained after years of far-right influence, are coming under further pressure.European democracies are facing a pincer attack: externally taking fire from the US administration and Silicon Valley companies, internally from the European far right – with an overlay of crippling dependency on the US for security.The White House does not even need to use this lever, as European leaders already self-censor out of fear of compromising their own or Ukraine’s security. For as long as Europe is limited by the military capabilities it can deploy independently of the US, security dependence will cloud any course of action or response to US policy that European leaders can consider. The operation in Venezuela escalates the seriousness of the Trump administration’sthreats to annex Greenland, demonstrating the very real risks to sovereignty and security beyond ideology.Navigating Europe’s role in an order that advances ideas counter to its raison d’être will be complex. Insulating the continent from nativist ideology is impossible, and building up strategic autonomy will take time Europe does not have. As the US administration merges threats to sovereignty with the promotion of far-right forces that are a threat to democracy, and pushes tech deregulation, Europe is left with few tools in its arsenal to address this multidimensional challenge.What it needs are genuine allies who can help counter the alternative order the US is putting on the table. They can be found in Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea and other remaining liberal democracies. South Korea’s defence industrial base supports European rearmament efforts. Australiaholds depositsof critical minerals essential for defence supply chains.Europe cannot stand up to the US alone; its only option is to urgentlydeepen and strengthen partnerships with countries who share its values and interests in a rules-based order, to build a viable political and military bulwark against the US’s new order.Armida van Rij is a senior research fellowat the Centre for European ReformExplore more on these topicsEuropeOpinionThe far rightDonald TrumpJD VanceProject 2025Silicon ValleyTechnology sectorcommentShareReuse this content"

America’s allies must find new ways to guarantee their own interestsThu 8 Jan 2026 13.50 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 15.58 ESTShareOccasionally, history generates smooth changes from one era to another. More commonly, such shifts occur only gradually and untidily. And sometimes, as the former Downing Street foreign policy adviser John Bewputs itin the New Statesman, history unfolds “in a series of flashes and bangs”. In Caracas last weekend, Donald Trump’s forces did this in spectacular style. In the process, the US brushed aside more of what remains of the so-called rules-based order with which it tried to shape the west after 1945.The capture of Venezuela’s former president Nicolás Maduro has precedents in US policy. But discerning a wider new pattern from the kidnapping is not easy, especially at this early stage. As our columnist Aditya Chakraborttyhas arguedthis week, the abduction can be seen as a assertion of American power, but also as little more than a chaotic asset grab.The US’s historic allies are still struggling to understand these changes. Even more important, they are strugglingto respondto them. Events such as those in Caracas raise stark questions of power. They embody the exact same reality that President Trump delights in celebrating. The US is a superpower. Allies, including the UK, are not. These questions are not going to disappear. The British government should not be condemned for each hesitation. But the hesitations cannot continue indefinitely. Britain needs a grown-up debate and a clear new course of international direction.In the Spectatorthis week, Peter Mandelson, the former ambassador to Washington, rubs Europe’s noses in it. “Trump has the means and the will,” he says, “and they [Europe and the UK] do not.” In Caracas,he writes, Mr Trump did more in a day than diplomacy has achieved in 10 years. The issue that faces us, says Lord Mandelson, is “Europe’s growing political impotence in the world”. The way to reclaim a seat at the table is not through “histrionics” or “fine words” but by the collective deployment of “hard power and hard cash”, he writes.Many will disagree with this sweeping dismissal of international rules and its insistence on transatlantic realpolitik, perhaps because of its author. But Lord Mandelson is not alone. Officials, advisers, academics and commentators of every stripe are also trying to make larger sense of the US’s transformation from necessary power to rogue state.The arguments of Prof Bew, adviser to four prime ministers from Boris Johnson to Sir Keir Starmer, are important here. In his view, Caracas marks three things. First, an increased US willingness to use executive power for swift military action. Second, a further assertion of an American mercantilism that insists on US control of oil, gas and minerals. Third, at least as promoted by the state department, a turn to a hemispheric approach, implying perhaps that China and Russia would be given freer rein in other regions.We can, should and do regret these emerging shifts. But, as Prof Bew says, while we mourn the disintegration of the rules-based order, and decry the mercantilism now dominating the west’s most dynamic economy, the old world and its assumptions are not coming back any time soon. Countries such as Britain have to decide what economic and technological adaptations we should make in this new world to protect our interests and our people. No one can pretend that is easy. But it is a debate that involves us all, with implications that will affect us all, and therefore one in which all must have a voice.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s not their jobMargaret SullivanAn almost admiring feeling pervaded the early coverage – and not just among right-leaning outletsThu 8 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 13.44 ESTShareIf you believe the early public opinion polls, Americans are uncertain about last weekend’s raid onVenezuelaand the seizure of the country’s leader,Nicolás Maduro.But many in the media seem to be trying to move that wavering needle to approval.That’s especially true on the right, of course, whereFox Newsis leading a full-on cheering squad.Even the right-leaning podcaster Megyn Kelly, a former Fox host herself, said the cable network’s early coverage was likewatching Russian propaganda.A great deal of the mainstream media seems reluctant to question Donald Trump’s stunning move. CBS News, under new editorial leadership, is leading that pack. Its Tuesday-night broadcast was practically Fox Lite, including a too-cute montage of AI-created images of the US secretary of state and former Florida senator, Marco Rubio, and these words fromanchor Tony Dokoupil: “It is a sign of how Florida, once an American punchline, has become a leader on the world stage … Marco Rubio, we salute you.” The segment was meant to be lighthearted, but it struck many as tone-deaf, or just plain irresponsible, under the circumstances.To their credit, influential global outlets like the Associated Press, Reuters, the Guardian, the Washington Post and the New York Times are providing serious news coverage. I was impressed, for example, by a Post piece that explored the growing despair on the streets, headlined “Fear grips Caracas as a new wave of repression is unleashed in Venezuela”. Detailing the crackdown that included the detention of journalists, the arrests of civilians and the spread of armed gangs, it stood in sharp contrast with a Post editorial that immediately cheered “one of the boldest moves a president has made in years” under the glowing headline: “Justice in Venezuela.”Hanging over the more serious coverage, for some observers, was thetroubling reportthat the Times and the Post knew about the raid in advance and held back publication at the urging of the Trump administration. The rationale was that they did so to avoid endangering American troops.Was such cooperation the right move?We’re in a radically new phase of American history. Some media coverage is helping to convey that frightening truthI talked to several ranking editors at news organizations, who hesitated to say that they would have done things any differently without knowing much more about the circumstances, the readiness of a verified story and, especially, the timing.Ben Smith of Semafor, known for a propensity to publish rather than hold back – as with the unverified Steele dossier when he was running BuzzFeed News – was one of these.“If you knew months in advance the US was considering ground action, that is obviously a story, and I think various people did report that,” Smith told me. “If there are helicopters in the air and your reporting would get them shot out of the air, I don’t think any editor would publish that.” (The Times, as recently as late December,reportedthat military action in Venezuela, involving army Delta Force units, could be phase two following the American attacks on Venezuelan boats.)More generally, though, an almost admiring feeling pervaded the early coverage.“Daring” was the word of choice on broadcast and cable news, including on the generally sober-mindedABC News; and the New York Times explored the “virtually flawless” mission in a front-page Sunday piece that nodded to, but did not emphasize, whether the raid was legal. The Times seemed to adjust course later in the week, as with its Wednesday edition of its newsletter the Morning, which featuredDavid Sanger’s analysisof the emerging Trumpian logic that he can “claim resources that, in his view, America cannot live without. He’s already setting up a parallel argument for Greenland.”Some of the strongest critical coverage came from singular voices, such as that of the former labor secretary Robert Reich, who aptly observed the throughline from the Trump-inspired insurrection on 6 January 2021 to theVenezuelaraid – and to whatever unaccountable power plays lie in the future.“A direct line connects Trump’s attempted coup five years ago to his capture of Nicolas Maduro last weekend,” hewrote in his newsletter. “Both were lawless. Both were premised on the hubris of omnipotence.”I was glad to see the New Yorker’s Isaac Chotiner’s quick reflexes inpublishing an interview on Saturdaywith Oona Hathaway, the president-elect of the American Society of International Law and a prominent Yale law professor. The headline, “The Brazen Illegality of Trump’s Venezuela Operation”, was a rare piece of mainstream-media candor in the first days.But let’s face it. A lot more people are likely to see overall soft coverage, especially on TV.As of last weekend, we’re in a radically new phase of American history. Some media coverage is helping to convey that frightening truth.But if you merely saw the “daring mission” headlines or caught the fun-filled “we salute you” paean to Rubio, or believed theFox Newscheerleading, you might not know it.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsUS press and publishingOpinionThe news on TVCBSFox NewsNew York TimesWashington PostVenezuelacommentShareReuse this content"

All through the run up to “Zoh’s” remarkable victory, the queen of tabloids outdid itself in hysterical brilliance – to such an extent that I and apparently tens of thousands of other New Yorkers were left excitedly panting for more, unable to share in the mourning that overtook rightwing commentators and pro-Trump operatives all across the land. Moreover, whether or not you voted for the Ugandan-born Muslim progressive/socialist, his improbable triumph furnished a great political education for anyone who bothered to pay attention, even if you weren’t a Post reader. Now, with Mamdani inaugurated and the unofficial municipal host of Nicolás Maduro, the deposed Venezuelan president, and his wife – jailed in Brooklyn and arraigned in federal court just a stone’s throw from city hall in Manhattan – Donald Trump’s newspaper mouthpiece is also an excellent way to make sense of the growing fissure inside the Democratic party about everything Mamdani represents.I didn’t say that the Post’s political reporting during the final month of the campaign was worth reading because it was accurate. Beginning with Miranda Devine’s 8 October column, whose headline proclaimed “The Dems are letting Antifa take over their cities”, the paper’s leading lights made analytical hash of what was really going on inside the Democratic party. “Portland and Chicago are emerging as the epicenter of anti-Trump resistance,” she warned. “[Governor JB Pritzker] and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson are endangering the lives of ICE and Border Patrol personnel,” apparently taking their cue from the “antifa militants” of the first Trump term who “terrorized” the country during the riots that followed the killing of George Floyd. “It will be a relief,” wrote Devine, “to find out who has been funding these violent groups that appear for all the world to be Dem street militia. How else to explain years of Democrats gaslighting us and Democrat governors and mayors covering for Antifa.”For Americans, 2026 started with two starkly different visions for the country | Moira DoneganRead moreBut it wasn’t antifa, the putatively leftwing anti-fascist coalition, that was the culprit featured on the front page of 19 October; it was an alliance between the winner of the Democratic mayoral primary, Mamdani, and a fellow Muslim, Imam Sirah Wahhaj, whothe Post claimedhad called for a 10,000-man army to enact “jihad” on New York (“No, don’t pick up a gun, no. Just march,” Wahhaj reportedly said). Mamdani had campaigned at Wahhaj’s mosque and had his picture taken with the man the Post called an “unindicted co-conspirator” in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. If you were confused by the apparent ideological contradiction between antifa’s leftwing and presumably secular conspiracy to take over the Democrats – via Pritzker, Johnson and Mamdani – and a competing, decidedly anti-progressive, anti-feminist, anti-gay, socially conservative jihadist Muslim movement, then you just needed to keep reading the Post.Sure enough, before you could say Mamdani-al-Qaida-Bin Laden-9/11, the tabloid of record had discovered the insurgent candidate’s truer origins: not the Islamic State, but rather Marxism-Leninism. Suddenly the Post’s special correspondent in Washington, Trump, wasdenouncing Mamdanias a “communist” who would lead the president’s hometown to “Economic and Social Disaster”. A quick read of Wikipedia reveals communism’s traditional hostility toward organized religion (including God, Allah and Yahweh), but the Post wasn’t publishing footnotes. Of course, by then, headlines like “Keep the Commie Out!” on the front page had been tempered by numerous Postrevelations about Mamdani’s alleged Jew hatred stemming from his“support for Muslim extremists”against Israel. Another perusal of Wikipedia might have noted the prominent Jews who participated in the Bolshevik revolution, but the Post stuck with the commie theme as long as it could – the day after the election the front page screamed “On your Marx, get set, Zo!Socialist Mamdani wins race for mayor”. “THE RED APPLE”, with a Cyrillic R, was placed adjacent to a victorious Mamdani, dressed in red, brandishing a hammer and sickle above his head. Whatever Mamdani’s plans for terrorizing the citizenry, he was good for newspaper publishers who still printed on paper. The Post was sold out in my neighborhood on 5 November – indeed, I couldn’t find any newspaper at all for sale at the six or so Upper West Side newsstands I visited.There’s good reason for the corrupted and cynical party pros to hate Zohran Mamdani.So what would it be? Pogroms, jihad or gulag? Perhaps all three. Well, none of them, as it turned out, at least not right away. When the mayor-elect visited Trump in the White House, the president was all friendliness and good will, even suggesting he’d behappy to move back to New Yorkwhile Mamdani was mayor: “I would feel very, very comfortable in New York, and I think much more so after the meeting.” The next day, 22 November, thePost ran the headline“I ♥️ You, Mam!” on its front page with a photograph of the two men shaking hands in the Oval Office.But what was happening in the real world of politics, outside the Post’s madhouse? In fact, contrary to the Murdoch press and the Trump saliva factory, the Democratic machine of party regulars, both national and local and surely including Pritzker’s many wealthy political allies, had been pulling out all the stops to prevent a “radical” takeover of its essential machinery, especially in New York City, where national and local party power merge. Charles Schumer, the Senate minority leader, and Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, lead the congressional party in Washington DC, but they also are the effective bosses of Brooklyn, new home to the Maduros and still the most populous and machine-dominated of the five boroughs that make up New York City. Schumer never made an endorsement in the mayor’s race, and Jeffries, aiming to discourage a primary opponent against him from Mamdani’s camp, endorsed the eventual winner at the last minute and with little enthusiasm. The state party chairman, Jay Jacobs,declined to endorse Mamdani, although Kathy Hochul, the governor, did endorse the insurgent. She also fears a primary challenge in 2026 and hasspoken out againstAndrew Cuomo, the barely disguised stalking horse for a national and state party oligarchy that let Trump’s late endorsement of Cuomo pass without any public comment.The bosses of both parties dislike popular participation in politics – just ask Trump’s primary opponents in 2016. When voters get excited about a candidate, they start making demands on the system, and top-down party patronage, candidate selection, log rolling and graft are all threatened. Mamdani helpeddouble the turnoutof registered voters compared with 2021, to at least 42%, and he won aslim but absolute majorityof the vote with more than 1 million ballots cast for him. Good reason for the corrupted and cynical party pros to hate him. How did he do it? By pledging to freeze rents in a scandalously expensive city dominated by real estate interests, including landlords like Trump. Mamdani didn’t call for expropriation of private land as a real communist would have done – he merely made social democratic noises about reining in prices and imposing slightly higher taxes on the rich. Nothing the blueblood pillar of New York society Franklin D Roosevelt would have objected to.Indeed, FDR’s “good neighbor” policy toward Latin America would have harmonized nicely with Mamdani’sshort and unequivocal protestagainst the Maduro kidnapping, which contrasted sharply with the critical but far more muted responses by Schumer (the coup was “reckless, there’s no planning”) and Jeffries, who made absolutely sure they wouldn’t be accused of coddling the nominal socialist and “bad guy” Maduro. The Democratic party line almost seemed to suggest that a better conceived overthrow might have been acceptable. Mamdani, meanwhile, also revealed that he’d called the president directly to protest the invasion, which ended his truce with the Post: “Sources and longtime pals of Trump said Mamdani is playing with fire – jeopardizing his honeymoon with the president – by grandstanding in opposition to the capture of Maduro,”reported Carl Campanile. On Monday, the paper’s front page reverted to form with Mamdani’s photo adjacent to the headline “DO AS I CHE!” (referring to the communist revolutionary Che Guevara) followed by “Venezuelans celebrate fall of Maduro, but Mamdani’s pals and NYC protestors scold them – demand return of dictator”. Neither Schumer nor Jeffries were identified as pals of Mamdani.I suggest reading the Post very carefully to try to understand our mad king’s thinking. I also hope the American military officers who violated their oath to the constitution by leading troops into Caracas show more restraint if Trump orders them to invade Greenland. But the more important political fight to watch at this moment is not Trump and JD Vance versus Charles Schumer and Gavin Newsom, it’s Mamdani and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez versus Schumer, Pritzker and Newsom, the three most powerfulDemocratsin the country. And the crucial fault line to watch, where the real political civil war is taking place, isn’t the old Mason-Dixon line – it’s somewhere alongside a new, undesignated border that separates a large part of Brooklyn, including where Schumer grew up and that Cuomo won – and a large section of Queens, where Mamdani moved to in 2018 and won. The Brooklyn machine – the organization that produced the lamentable mayor Eric Adams – took it in the teeth on 4 November, and that should be good news to everyone who’s not a professional politician.John R MacArthur is president and publisher of Harper’s MagazineExplore more on these topicsNew York PostOpinionZohran MamdaniNew YorkDemocratsNewspapersUS press and publishingUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

There’s no more doubt that 2026 will be the sameThu 8 Jan 2026 09.21 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 18.24 ESTShareBy 1934, it was entirely evident what Benito Mussolini was up to. Italy’s dictator had already consolidated power, colonized Libya and annexed the city of Rijeka. He nevertheless got to stage the second-ever World Cup,managing it with a heavy handand even supplanting the Jules Rimet trophy with a far larger one. Hosting and winning that World Cup didn’t sate his expansionist appetites. By the end of the decade, Mussolini would take Ethiopia, annex Albania and back Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war.It was equally well established in 1978 in Argentina that General Jorge Rafaél Videla’s military junta, which had taken over two years earlier, was maintaining its grip on power throughsystematic detention, torture and murder. Still, protestations from other nations were ignored and the World Cup kicked off.“At last, the world can see the true face of Argentina,” saidFifapresident João Havelange at the opening ceremony, newly decorated with a medal from Videla.Argentina spared no expense in putting on itsWorld Cup, even though the total cost was a state secret. But the right-wing government also didn’t bother to slow the pace at which it disappeared political dissidents and opponents. Germany captain Berti Vogts proclaimed that “Argentina is a country where order reigns. I haven’t seen a single political prisoner,” though, so no matter.Trump loomed over sport like never before in 2025. Next year he will take even moreRead moreWhen Vladimir Putin presided over the opening ceremony to the 2018 World Cup, it had been four years since his forces annexed Crimea from Ukraine and he backed pro-Russian rebels in the Donbas region. Fifa didn’t mind.The problematic nature of these events may have been obvious at the time, but took some time to be fully acknowledged; for there to be no mistaking the actions and intentions of the host government. Years from now, when we look back on the geopolitical context of the 2026 World Cup – shared with Canada and Mexico but hogged by the United States – we’ll likely place it in the same category as those others. Hopefully, we have perfect clarity, and this edition of the World Cup will take its place among the most shameful incarnations of the quadrennial tournament.This conclusion was crystalized bylast week’s forceful and bloody abduction of the sitting president of Venezuela and his wife, before US president Donald Trumpannounced that the socialist state was now effectively an American-run territory.That was, of course, after Trump, or his henchmen,softened their support for Ukrainein its ongoing war with Russia;literally blew boats out of the wateron mere suspicion of drug trafficking;threatened to invade Mexicoandannex Canada(their World Cup co-hosts!),Greenlandandthe Panama canal; and started a trade war with, well,basically everybody,disrupting the global economy.We don’t yet know how far this administration, which promised isolationism but has insteaddelivered geopolitical mayhem, will go in a foreign policy that lacks any coherence beyond the governing assumption that it can do whatever it feels like.But it’s clear that it may just be getting started.Still, the World Cup will proceed. Fifa president Gianni Infantino has been immovable inhis support for Trump. Unlike Havelange and Videla, themedals and fake awardsare going in the other direction.It’s been some time since we had a World Cup without reasonable controversy. The 2010 and 2014 editions in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, were widely panned locally for the strain they put on nations with far more pressing needs. And yet those legitimate complaints seem quaint compared to the 2022 tournament in Qatar, acquired under well-documented corruption and leading directly tomany deaths and human rights abuses. The 2030 tournament will inevitably grow notorious for spreading the thing out over threecontinents, greatly increasing the environmental impact and giving the lie to any claims Fifa once made of caring for the climate. And then there’s the 2034 World Cup, which has already been signed over to the Saudi Arabia’s strongman de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman.The US-dominated World Cup fits neatly into this run. This nation isn’t presently in a position to lecture anybody else on human rights – nor has it ever been. The Qataris and Saudis are sportswashing outliers no longer. This is just what the World Cup is now: a convenient vehicle for carrying the aims of dangerously self-interested people.Perhaps some kind of boycott movement from fans toward Fifa events will gather steam, although the slow slide of acceptance to where we are suggests otherwise. One didn’t come off before Qatar, either, in spite of a lot of noise. It’s doubtful such a boycott would accomplish much by way of embarrassing the men, and the odd woman, who have killed off the parts of themselves that once felt shame anyway.Soccer has fully gone the way of the Olympics and Formula One, which long ago made their peace with whatever sordid baggage came attached to the highest bidder for their events.And when the story is told of how the World Cup fully and finally lost its way, they will point to the 2026 edition, played in Canada and Mexico and – problematically, embarrassingly, irredeemably – these United States.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out on May 12.

The Trump administration blames the victimMoira DoneganAn agent shot a woman in Minneapolis, causing vast and needless grief. Our country is diseased – but that is not the only truthThu 8 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 09.02 ESTShareAwoman in Minneapolishas diedas her neighbors fought Donald Trump’s mass deportation operation. On Wednesday morning, a group of local civilian protesters gathered around a site where several ICE agents were attempting to abduct migrants. The agents were part of a surge of roughly2,000 deportation officerswho have been sent to Minneapolis as part of Trump’s effort to persecute the Somali community there. In a disturbing incident caught onvideoby multiple onlookers, a woman driving in an SUV covered in bumper stickers blocked traffic on the residential road – perhaps as part of an effort to keep ICE vehicles from passing. In the videos, an ICE agent approaches the SUV, yelling: “Get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car.” He stands at the driver’s side, with his feet clear of the vehicle, and reaches into where the woman is driving. She begins to drive away, and an officer fires three shots, the last from behind the vehicle as the car pulls away from him. The SUV then crashes into a parked vehicle as onlookers scream in distress. “You did a murder, for what?” one of the protesters calls out to the agents.The driver, a US citizen who was described by Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar as a “legal observer”, was declared dead. She died less than a mile from where George Floyd was murdered byMinneapolispolice officer Derek Chauvin in 2020. Her name was Renee Nicole Good, and she was 37.Good is not the first person to be slaughtered by deportation agents in the course of their raids. In September, ICE agents in Chicago shotSilverio Villegas González,a Mexican-born father and cook, in the neck at “close range”as he allegedly fleda migrant abduction operation. He died, too.Non-fatal shootings by ICE agents have also disfigured American citizens and residents and warped their lives. Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old citizen in Chicago, allegedly tailed DHS agents in her car during that same Chicago operation in October,shouting “la migra”, a common Spanish slang term for immigration agents that advocates yell out as a warning. A DHS agent shot Martinez five times beforeallegedly driving off, leaving her bleeding in her car. Miraculously, she survived. Federal prosecutors tried to criminally prosecute Martinez for the incident, but the case against her quickly fell apart, andcharges were dropped. Altogether, a report bythe Tracefound that immigration officers opened fire in 14 known incidents in the course of their operations since July.As they were in Martinez’s case, federal authorities seem eager to respond to the death in Minneapolis by demonizing the woman they had shot. On Fox News, homeland security secretary Kristi Noemsaid of the incident: “It was an act of domestic terrorism.” She was referring to Good, the woman who was killed. “Officers got stuck in the snow. They were attempting to push out their vehicle, and a woman attacked them, and those surrounding them, and attempted to run them over.” This is untrue, and contradicted by videos of the incident, which show the officers not stuck in the snow, but screamingly approaching the woman in her own parked vehicle, and then shooting her at point blank range as she attempted to drive away.Inanother videofrom just after the incident, a crying woman sitting on the ground outside the crashed SUV screams: “They killed my wife. I don’t know what to do.” Later, she says: “We stopped to film and they shot her.” Her grief will now alter the course of her life. It will be vast, and it is needless. Will anyone be held accountable for it? The man who killed Good has so far not been identified. At the time he shot her, he was wearing a mask.The mass deportations spearheaded by the Trump regime are an ethnic cleansing effort. Immigration officers target peaceful working people on thebasis of their race. They kidnap them, and funnel them into detention centers where they endure horrible conditions, and are given few rights and even less due process. They are taken away from their jobs, their families, and their communities. With violence like what the immigration agent chose in Minneapolis today, the government is looking to tell Americans that resistance to this injustice is not worth it; it will only be punished.This is not true. The assaults on immigrants have created a righteous moral outrage on the part of those born in America and others protected by the rights of citizenship, and everywhere ICE and the DHS have embarked on their sadistic and racist kidnapping sprees, they have met resistance from Americans who hate tyranny and love their neighbors. These protesters are among the best of America, ragefully and rightfully facing down the armed forces of a would-be autocrat in an effort to protect the innocent. Though we do not yet know much about her, or about her presence on that Minneapolis street – Good’s mother says she believes her daughter was not involved in the protest, though videos of the incident make it seem as if she was – what we do know suggests that Renee Nicole Good represented the spirit of the movement: a hatred for injustice, a desire to protect the innocent, a sense of responsibility to those around her. Now, she has become a martyr to the cause.It is easy, as theTrump administrationattempts to consolidate authoritarian power and to rearrange the US into a formal white nationalist autocracy where power is defined by displays of violent domination, to think that the moral degeneracy represented by the immigration agents and those who command them represents a core truth of the American spirit – that ours is a country diseased in mind and soul, incapable of fulfilling the lofty goals of dignity and equality for all that have so long animated our national myths. There is some truth in this dark thought.But there is another truth, too: that everywhere ICE goes, they have been met with ridicule, resistance, and contempt from ordinary Americans, unarmed and unbending, who have faced down the kidnappers and bullies in persistent protests and street actions – sometimes even succeeding in freeing a kidnapped neighbor or bullying the thugs out of their neighborhoods. This, too, is a truth of this country: that people like Martinez, and like Good, are more numerous than the racists and the autocrats.On social media, Jon Collins, a reporter for Minnesota Public Radio,shared videoof ICE agents in Minneapolis being surrounded and confronted by protesters in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday’s shooting. In the clip, regular Americans, bundled up against the midwestern winter, surround the armed agents in a tight, angry circle. “Are you going to shoot someone else and kill them? Are you going to murder someone else?” one man taunts. It’s not an idle question: the protesters, civilians and ordinary people, are facing down armed men who have shown themselves capable of bigotry, brazenness, and murder. A moment later, someone shouts: “You can’t kill us all, Nazis. You can’t kill us all.”Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsMinneapolisOpinionUS immigrationTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsMinnesotacommentShareReuse this content"

If he cared about Venezuelans’ – or anyone else’s – safety, he would not have imposedheightened restrictions or total banson travelers from 39 countries, 24 of whichFreedom Housecategorizes as “not free”. These include Venezuela and Iran, whose oppressed people Trump isthreatening to rescueby military force next.People from Venezuela and neighbouring countries: share your reaction to US raidRead moreWhat if any of those Venezuelans object to the takeover of their country?Resistance is inevitable, experts say, whether by paramilitaries, disgruntled but not defeated Maduro supporters, or puppets of China, Iran or Russia. Will the colonial viceroys crack down?Amnesty International released astatementon Saturday expressing concern about potential “escalation of human rights violations … stemming either from additional US operations or from the Venezuelan government’s responses to the US attacks”. Trump says he’s “not afraid” to deploy troops on the ground.The opposition leader María Corina Machado isready to return from exileand move directly to a new election, which she says she’d win handily. But Trump doesn’t want an election, and he doesn’t want Machado. Sources told the Washington Post he isstill peevedthat she failed to turn down the 2025 Nobel peace prize he wanted – even though she says she’dgladly share itnow.But beyond petty grudges, Trump and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, have reason to prefer Delcy Rodríguez, vice-president to Nicolás Maduro, to a democratically elected leader. Despite some belligerent talk, Rodríguez is “willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again”, the US president said. And if she doesn’t, “she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro”, hetold the Atlantic. In other words, she can be coerced for the oil the US wants to extract from her country.Equally important, a new president elected quickly, freely and fairly in Caracas would eliminate the pretext for maintaining control of the country while stealing its oil: that is, the return of democracy to the Venezuelan people.But you don’t have to predict Venezuela’s future to give the lie to Trump’s professed liberatory ideals. For proof that Trump couldn’t care less about freedom, Americans need look no further than their own front yard.An efficient method would be to examine Maduro’s violations of political and human rights – and then Trump’s. In its2024 country report, Amnesty International highlighted the Venezuelan government’s repression of protest, attempts to obstruct independent media and blockage of information about the environment; its criminalization of abortion and failure to protect LGBTQ+ rights; widespread poverty and lack of access to food and healthcare.The report cited excessive use of force, arbitrary and warrantless arrests of political opponents, human rights defenders and journalists, and the detention of children. Disappearances lasted days, during which detainees’ families “were denied information about their whereabouts”. The UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination “denounced the administrative detention of refugees and migrants … pending deportation without access to legal assistance or a procedure to access international protection”, Amnesty’s report said. Conditions of detention deteriorated; torture persisted.And “impunity prevailed for human rights violations”.The victims of these violations are not precisely the same in the two countries; nor is the magnitude of violence. But the parallels are striking: arbitrary arrests, disappearances, inhuman conditions in detention; bans on abortion and transgender care; poverty and inadequate food and healthcare.Trump has not yet imprisoned his political enemies, butUS attorney general Pam BondiandFBI chief Kash Patelare working on it. Human rights defenders are not in jail, but under the guise of combatting antisemitism, students have been abducted, and the US Department ofStateand thetreasuryare seeking to destroy non-profits that provide humanitarian aid to Palestine.The Department of Homeland Security has not shipped immigrants to extermination camps. But as of October, 20 people haddied in its custody– the deadliest year since 2005 – and asylees are being deported to their own or third countries where theyrisk imprisonment, torture or death.The US does not have a policy of extrajudicial killings, as Maduro appeared to. But presaging the raid on Venezuela, the US military summary executedat least 95purported smugglers in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. At home,theTrace, which tracks gun violence, documents 14 shootings by ICE as of 7 January, including four people observing or documenting raids and five driving away from traffic stops or evading agents. On Wednesday in Minneapolis, Renee Nicole Good, 37, was fatallyshot in her car, one of four fatalities caused by immigration agents’ bullets.Then there are the legal killings. After Trump’s first-day executive order “Restoring the Death Penalty and Protecting Safety”, the states executed 47 death row inmates in 2025 – “the greatest frenzy of capital punishment bloodletting in the US since 2009”, said theGuardian.A war with Venezuela – or Colombia, Iran or Greenland – could provide the state of emergency Trump seems to be hankering for. Such a declaration could enable the president to invoke the Insurrection Act, suspending civil liberties and intensifying political repression, or harshen and accelerate mass deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. The scant oversight the executive branch now receives would virtually evaporate.The only freedom Trump cares about is his own, to exert his megalomania and enrich himself and his cronies. He will stop at nothing to advance these liberties, including kidnap, murder, and the decimation of the global legal order that is already struggling to protect peace, democracy, human rights and the planet.Judith Levine is a Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

What happened behind the scenes?Alejandro VelascoIn the early fray of foreign interventions, evidence is largely circumstantial. But here the circumstances tell a powerful storyThu 8 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareAs late as Saturday afternoon, fires continued to smolder in parts of Caracas. Residents throughout the city, stunned and anxious, filled grocery stores and gas stations, stocking up before a future unknown. Everywhere the question hung in the air like the smoke still clouding Venezuela’s capital: what next?After months of military buildup, deadly strikes at sea and a looming ground war, the United States made good on its threats to attack Venezuela in a dramatic overnight raid that ended with Nicolás Maduro in a New York City jail cell. Yet 48 hours later, little else appeared different in Caracas: Maduro’s inner circle remained in place; state institutions remained in their control; streets were calm, if tense, while authorities called on people to return to their daily lives. In other words: move along, nothing to see here.If this is regime change, it seems a strange sort, one that leaves the regime otherwise intact, and which raises a more pressing question than what comes next: what happened? Of course, much remains speculative. But at this point, information available suggests that after over a decade of tight cohesion around Maduro, his inner circle calculated they were better off without him and struck a deal with the Trump administration: Maduro in exchange for staying in power.In the early fray of foreign interventions, evidence is largely circumstantial. But here the circumstances tell a powerful story. First the raid itself. To be sure, US forces – covert and conventional – have formidable superiority over Venezuela’s military apparatus, whose primary plan to combat US intervention has long been asymmetric rather than head-to-head war. Still, the absence of even minimal organized resistance to a raid that involved multiple low-flying, slow-moving aircraft traversing densely populated and otherwise heavily defended Venezuelan airspace for more than two hours invites speculation not only about prior knowledge of the attack by Venezuela’s military, but about stand-down orders for the bulk of the country’s armed forces.Then came Donald Trump’s press conference. That he flatly stated the US intended to take control of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves and“run” the countrywere striking enough claims. Perhaps most stunning, though, was Trump’s assertion that Maduro’s vice-president – Delcy Rodríguez – wouldremain in placeif she “does what we want”. Summarily sidelined after years of building a government-in-waiting and offering up their country to Trump on a platter was Venezuela’s expatriate opposition, led by the Nobel laureate María Corina Machado. In a bid to placate the US president, she had earlier dedicated her peace prize to Trump. It didn’t work: “She doesn’t have the respect” of the country,Trump said.More likely for Trump, Machado didn’t have the respect of the people who matter in a transition: military, police, institutions. Here Rodríguez’s own statements over the weekend are key. Though initially striking a defiant tone on Saturday, calling forMaduro’s immediate returnand proclaiming him Venezuela’sonly president, by Sunday she declared herdesire to cooperatewith the US. By Monday morning, after a ruling by Venezuela’s supreme court declaring Rodríguez next in line after Maduro’s kidnapping and unlikely return, and surrounded by Maduro’s erstwhile inner circle and newly installed national assembly, she took the oath of office tobecome Venezuela’s president.The speed and seamlessness of a post-Maduro transition, especially in the wake of a violent military assault, seems more than extraordinary. It seems calculated if one considers the incentives and agendas of various major actors. Key players in Maduro’s government had just one card to play against the Trump administration’s mounting pressure: only we can ensure stability in any transitional context. As defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López commands the nation’s military and its vast economic interests; as interior minister, Diosdado Cabello can keep police forces as well as sprawling paramilitary groups – colectivos – in check; as national assembly president, Delcy Rodríguez’s brother Jorge Rodríguez can deliver legislative authority; and as former head of PDVSA, Venezuela’s national oil company, Delcy Rodríguez can manage the oil sector directly.Given this array of institutional and extra-institutional control, the alternative – a full-scale regime change with the opposition installed in power through foreign military intervention – would result in chaos for the US to fend with and manage. As an occupying force, and despite widespread rebuke of Maduro and his government, US troops on the ground would provide ready targets to insurgent sectors of the military, police, colectivos and nationalist groups while an opposition long in exile and with little local standing moved to rebuild the entire state apparatus from scratch. Even if Trump believed in democracy promotion, which he has amply disavowed at home and abroad, a quagmire of his doing would alienate far too many in his Maga base.In exchange for continuity in power, Delcy Rodríguez and others ultimately provided Trump with two prizes: oil and Maduro. Venezuela’s vast reserves – the largest in the world – have long been in Trump’s sights, especially as his rejection of the climate crisis and renewable energy drives his embrace of fossil fuels. In fact, Maduro himself had offered Trump major concessions for US oil companies to return to Venezuela under favorable terms. Yet his offer came with a condition to stay in power. As the administration mounted an ever louder case labelling Maduro the head of a multinational “narco-terrorist” cartel, striking a deal with him became untenable. That opened the door to others in his milieu to make a move handing Trump not just oil concessions, but Maduro as well.Maduro proved an especially attractive, and necessary, prize for others in the Trump administration. Since taking office, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has sought a spectacular display of US military prowess in order to proclaim a supposed return of US might. Lethal strikes against alleged drug boats had some effect. But each day the vast force of 15,000 troops splayed across the Caribbean went unused was a day the US lost credibility and seemed taunted by Venezuela. A made-for-television commando raid offered an opportunity to grandstand the power of the US military. Secretary of state Marco Rubio claimed a prize of his own in the bargain: cutting off the last source of material support for Cuba’s socialist government, leaving it vulnerable as never before to Rubio’s dream of regime change on the island of his parents.Even with prior collusion between the US and Venezuela, the scenario ahead remains rife with risk for Caracas and Washington. Delcy Rodríguez’s government must now strike the most delicate of balances: following the Trump administration’s orders while holding aloft the banners of independence and even anti-imperialism that have been hallmarks of Venezuelan governments going back 26 years. Further, her government needs to thread this needle with an armada off Venezuela’s coast, resurrecting gunboat diplomacy for the 21st century. But it has been some time since Venezuela’s leaders paid more than lip service to ideology, so the bargain may not be difficult after all. Especially considering the US is under constraints of its own: despite the threat of additional strikes, Trump’s continuing resistance to a full-scale invasion means his own ability to force his will upon Caracas is not unlimited, giving Venezuela’s government some room to maneuver.For now, the smoke from Saturday’s assault has cleared from Caracas. But the machinations and intrigue behind this extraordinary moment in global politics remain darkly veiled. Through the fog, for the people that matter most – Venezuelans in and out of Venezuela – the tragedy of a nation in the throes of a seemingly endless crisis shows no signs of abating.Alejandro Velasco is an associate professor of history at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsVenezuelaOpinionUS attack on VenezuelaDonald TrumpTrump administrationAmericasUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

A sleazy banana-republic dictator flooding the American streets with blow. The over-the-border Delta Force extraction squad sent to pluck this schmo out of his impregnable fortress. The bronzed tough-talker who’s firing an RPG up the tailpipe of the international rules-based order – but who gets the job done. Call it: Caracas Thunder.Sounds like a bit of a throwback, you might be thinking. But, judging by his press conference after the US military’s abduction of Venezuelan presidentNicolás Maduro, Donald Trump seemed to have finally achieved his dream of directing his own 80s action movie.View image in fullscreen‘An incredible, fantastic movie’ … Jean-Claude Van Damme and Bolo Yeung in Bloodsport.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyTrump packed in the important tropes. It had been “dark and deadly” out there in the field – but American kickassery prevailed easily. Why settle for just one staple 80s action bogeymen – the tinpot authoritarian (Commando;Missing in Action) or the cartel kingpin (Lethal Weapon;Cobra) – when Maduro, now perp-walking for global audiences, could double up as both? And we never knew it, but it turns out Operation Absolute Resolve is part of a franchise brought to you by Donald J Trump Productions: “We’ve done some other good ones, like the attacks on Soleimani and al-Baghdadi, and the obliteration and decimation of the Iran nuclear sites,” the US president pointed out.His incontinent blatherings don’t exactly exit with the hollow-point devastation of a Schwarzenegger quipGiven that Trump rose to full prominence during the ego joyride of the 1980s, it’s no shock that his foreign policy is donning its headband and emulating that decade’s belligerent cinema. Led by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Chuck Norris and assorted lesser beefcakes, 80s action films were about buffing America’s self-image again after the national debacle of Vietnam (and the depressing corps of movies on that subject). The likes of Commando, the Rambo sequels and Missing in Action made unilateralism literal: a lone meathead serving American righteousness (if sometimes with an Austrian accent) to hordes of anonymous foreign goons, garnishing the mayhem with a killer payoff line when vanquishing the demonised bad guy.View image in fullscreenPresident Trump watches the arrest of Maduro from Palm Beach.Photograph: The White House/UPI/ShutterstockWith Maga Republicanism now pushing this cartoonish worldview to even more steroidal extremes, Trump is reverting to the natural frame of reference with which to package up his adventurism in digestible, memeable form. He’s hardly the first politician to lean on pop culture: after the Iran hostage crisis, Ronald Reagan once said he could take some pointers from Rambo about how to handle another such incident. But the current president trumps him for shamelessness:he has literally tweeted a picture of himself as Rocky.We’re long past irony of course. But is Trump, in customising his own 80s action flick, sincerely living out his own inner fantasies? Intel on his actual movie tastes is scant. He trotted out a placeholder set of five classics in a2012 Movieline article: Citizen Kane, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Gone with the Wind, Goodfellas and The Godfather. Last year, he was reportedly pushing for Paramountto make another Rush Hour film– though it’s not clear if it’s the franchise, or being seen as a media arbitrator, that excites him most.Step aside Thelma Schoonmaker; Trump has also apprised us of his scalpel-like use of the remote control when watching films, fast-forwarding past the boring bits to pare them down to 45 minutes max. So when he lauds Jean-Claude Van Damme’s lean, mean Bloodsportas an “incredible, fantastic movie”, it seems more in keeping with that impatience. With the film firmly part of the 80s knucklehead canon, maybe Trump watches the scene in which JCVD’s army captain/ninja does the splits tonutshot an opponentand sees a blinding metaphor for what he’s doing to the Democrat party.The would-be Badass-in-Chief still has work to do to live up to 80s style, though. His incontinent blatherings on Truth Social and on the mic don’t exactly exit with the hollow-point devastation of a Schwarzenegger quip. Probably to the satisfaction of the Austrian Oak – who actually has weathered into a fair approximation of a respectable elder.View image in fullscreenSylvester Stallone, Trump and Melania Trump at the Kennedy Center honours on 23 December 2025.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty ImagesIn fact, the angry, inflamed undertone to Trump’s politics and his base correspond more to the Stallone school (Sly now of course being one of the president’s “special envoys” to Hollywood). Reagan was right: there was a lesson in Rambo, at least the first one. That embittered, self-pitying outsiderdom was an ingrained national trait, and that the inverse of the heroic avenger was the loony apocalypse prepper, the lone gunman. Ronald would know: in March 1981, he was wounded by a failed Texan singer-songwriter inspired by Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver. And Trump, missing assassination by an earlobe’s width in July 2024, has had his own taste.Wuthering Heights, Michael Jackson and the ‘Trump effect’ – will 2026 see the end of the ‘woke’ blockbuster?Read moreSo perhaps the president isn’t starring in the movie he thinks he is. It wouldn’t exactly be news to out him as the villain. Maybe the Trump years are actually best seen as a supercharged return to 70s cinema, with its reverberating sleaze, corruption and paranoia. Venezuela as a distraction from Epstein tops anything in All the President’s Men or The Parallax View. Let alone, for the ultra-conspiracy heads, Trump as Putin’s sleeper agent in the control room of fortress America;the ultimate Manchurian Candidate. But who cares what us libtards think, when Trump, tuning into the live feed of the Caracas raid, could lap up his own private action blow-out: “You might never get to see it, but it was an incredible thing to see.” And now of course Greenland is on his radar.

Climate justice demands an inclusive approachThu 8 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 15.59 ESTShareAs the world faces the challenges of theclimate crisisand critical threshold levels or tipping points may be reached soon, a disputable idea is gaining momentum as a potential solution: solar geoengineering – the deliberate reflection of sunlight to cool the planet. Advocates argue it could buy us time. Critics warn of unknown risks. Some see it as a possible emergency break if temperatures spiral out of control. Others call it a dangerous distraction that undermines meaningful climate action.Research into solar geoengineering is advancing, including exploration of techniques such as stratospheric aerosol injection, which would involve spraying tiny reflective particles into the upper atmosphere to mimic the cooling effect of volcanic eruptions, and marine cloud brightening, which aims to enhance the reflectivity of low-lying marine clouds. While stratospheric aerosol injection is not being conducted, these technologies are being studied with increasing urgency in the global north. In the global south, however, they remain largely invisible to public discourse and policymaking.That must change – and fast.We can safely experiment on reflecting sunlight away from Earth. Here’s how | Dakota Gruener and Daniele VisioniRead moreThe global south is at the forefront of the climate crisis. Our regions are experiencing rising temperatures, extreme heat and altered rainfall patterns, which threaten health, food and water security. Wildfires, heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms are becoming more frequent and severe; together with rising seas they exacerbate existing inequalities and pose significant challenges to development and public wellbeing.While solar geoengineering has the potential to lower global temperatures, its effects would be unevenly distributed across different regions. Some areas might benefit, others might suffer harmful consequences, such as altered rainfall patterns or ecological shifts. Comprehensive research is needed to accurately determine who would benefit and who would suffer, and how to alleviate any adverse impacts. However, failing to do so inclusively could lead to geopolitical tensions and exacerbate climate injustice.Including the global south in any conversation about technologies that could alter the global climate is not only urgent – it is possibleGovernments in the global south face tough questions. Most haven’t taken a public stance on solar geoengineering. Research funding is scarce, and public debate is nearly nonexistent. The result? A risky silence and a growing gap in knowledge, capacity and influence.This needs to change – urgently.But including the global south in any conversation about technologies that could alter the global climate is not only urgent – it is possible. We are home to scientific talent and diverse worldviews that can inform global decisions about solar geoengineering. Excluding us risks repeating the colonial dynamics that have historically shaped climate policy: solutions designed for us but not with us.We study glaciers. ‘Artificial glaciers’ and other tech may halt their total collapse | Brent Minchew and Colin MeyerRead moreThere are some signs of constructive change emerging. The Degrees Initiative, for example, has begun funding scientists from the global south to study how solar geoengineering might affect their own regions. And the UK’s Advanced Research and Invention Agency is also funding researchers from the global south to explore the governance and ethics of geoengineering approaches. However, such efforts remain small and dramatically under-resourced.We need public research on solar geoengineering led by institutions in the global south. We need research networks rooted in southern universities. We need funding that supports south-south collaboration. We also need a global governance framework that ensures equity, transparency and informed consent.Engagement does not imply endorsement. Understanding solar geoengineering does not necessarily mean supporting its use. Instead, it means empowering ourselves to ask critical questions, assess potential benefits and risks, take part in policy discussions rooted in local realities, and challenge decisions made elsewhere.Solar geoengineering is not a solution. It won’t stop ocean acidification or end our dependence on fossil fuels. At best, it’s a temporary bandage. The risks of unintended consequences, political misuse or abrupt termination remain huge. But ignoring it won’t make it go away. If it is ever considered as part of a planetary emergency response, we must not let it be shaped behind closed doors. Climate justice demands a transparent approach.Any effort to correct the path of our planet after generations of polluting must be debated in the light.Dr Ines Camilloni is a professor at the University of Buenos Aires and IPCC Working Group vice-chairExplore more on these topicsGeoengineeringOpinionClimate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

We need to start preparing nowSarah Perkins-KirkpatrickDuring black summer, my daughters were too young to know what was happening. Now, amid another Australian heatwave, they deserve answersThu 8 Jan 2026 16.34 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 18.07 ESTShareWhen the forecasts for this week started to roll in, my mind immediately drifted back to Australia’s black summer.I had taken my daughters down to the pool in our estate in western Sydney, hoping for a brief reprieve from the relentless heat. The Gospers Mountain fire was raging in the Blue Mountains, but on that particular day the smoke didn’t seem too bad.We were in the water for no more than five minutes when ash started falling from the sky. The delicate black flakes landed gently on top of the heads of my young children, a poetically quiet omen for their future.Fast forward six years and south-eastern Australia is in the grips of another heatwave – the worst since 2019-2020. Both Melbourne and western Sydney will reach temperatures in the low 40s, towns in regional Victoria and New South Wales even higher. Canberra – where I live now – is experiencing consecutive days in the high 30s.Heatwave conditions are severe to extreme for large swathes of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT until Saturday. From Friday, strong winds associated with a cold front will push across Victoria and New South Wales, an exceptionally dangerous set-up for fire weather, reminiscent of the 2009 black Saturday fires.Mercifully, some of the conditions leading up to this heatwave aren’t as bad as in 2019 or 2009. The main difference is that we are not in a multi-year drought, meaning that fuel has not dried out to the same extent. We also now have a national fire danger index and, as a population, are generally more aware of how to prepare for impending fire danger.Maybe, hopefully, these factors will be enough to prevent a devastating fire event like those that followed previous severe heatwaves, despite significant fires already burning in Victoria. But we must not be complacent.We cannot talk about such an extreme heatwave without talking about the health impacts. I want to be very clear here:extreme heat kills. In fact, extreme heat kills more Australians thanall other natural hazards combined.0:34Footage shows smoke billowing from Victoria bushfire outbreak near Euroa - videoWe have been somewhat lucky to not experience a heatwave as severe as this for over five years. While the triple-dip La Niñas helped induce disasters of a different kind, they also silenced the increasing pulse of extreme heat, at least temporarily. The rainfall they brought recharged moisture levels in the land surface, breaking the inextricable link between drought and extreme heat. However, recent drier than normal conditions in the south-east have permitted this link to start re-forming, albeit not to the same intensity (yet) as black summer.And then there is the elephant in the room we wish we could ignore – climate change.The link between heatwaves and climate change is very clear – as the global average temperature climbs, so too will the frequency, duration and intensity of heatwaves, even if the global average temperature increases by just 1 or 2C. This is not only the case for Australia, but virtually everywhere else on the planet. In terms of how climate change drives extreme weather, the physical link between global average temperature and heatwaves are among the most well-studied and well-understood in the world.Heat is Australia’s ‘silent killer’. Here are the symptoms to watch out forRead moreIn short: we know climate change drives heatwaves, and we know we will see more of them in the future. And while it is too early to know the explicit influence of climate change on this particular heatwave, my guess is it will be very substantial.Reaching net zero emissions – whenever that might be – would offer some hope. By stabilising atmospheric greenhouse gases from anthropogenic sources, global average temperature might stabilise. However, any real benefits would probably not be felt for at least 100-200 years. Recent research indicated that Australian heatwaves willcontinue to rise– albeit more slowly – for at least 1,000 years, and delaying net zero by just 5-10 years results in substantially worse heatwave regimes for centuries to come.We have now reached a critical point where although imperative, net zero is no longer enough. We must also adapt.Effective and permanent adaptation goes hand-in-hand with net zero and must be legislated. Public awareness and education is also important. And it is critical we increase investment in public health dramatically, as many more will require life saving care during heatwaves in the coming decades.Once again, I find myself thinking about our brief moment in the pool during black summer. My daughters had no idea what was happening around them, and in that moment, I was grateful. But as they grow, they are becoming more aware of the world they are inheriting. I am careful not to burden them, however questions are increasingly being asked about drought, fires, heatwaves, and climate change.They deserve answers. And if, along with their peers, they are to face future heatwaves head on, we must do better.Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick is a professor of climate science at ANUExplore more on these topicsAustralia weatherOpinionClimate crisisBushfiresExtreme heatcommentShareReuse this content"

He held up the tiny green shoots, his hands shaking. My older brother Mohammed and I rushed outside, laughing despite the fear that had become our constant companion. Each sprout was a victory.Before Gaza’s skies darkened with smoke and the ground shook with bombs, our garden was a lush tapestry of trees and plants, each leaf and branch woven into our family memory. Birds danced above the branches. Five ancient trees stood tall, twisted trunks weathered by sun and wind, branches heavy with black and green olives. Fruit trees filled the air with sweetness – orange, lemon, a broad-leaved fig and a small clementine.View image in fullscreenAn eggplant, or aubergine, growing in the garden.Photograph: Taqwa Ahmed al-Wawi/The GuardianIn the midst of the Israeli bombardment, my brother Mohammed and our father committed a small but profound act of rebellion. They decided to plant – to extend our small crop. They bought seedlings and seeds from a local farmer, who tended a rare patch of green and sold plants grown on his land. They bought 30 corn seeds, costing 15 shekels, roughly $5; three pepper seedlings, each priced at $2; two eggplant seedlings; two stems each of mint, basil,ain jarada(a local herb, known for its fresh aroma) and arugula, all for a single dollar; and four potato seeds.When thegenocide came, it ravaged buildings, tore through markets, disrupted supplies and inflated prices beyond reason. Food became a luxury, and the simple act of eating turned into a daily struggle. The weight of hunger was heavy, occupying every corner of our lives. It was a constant companion, reminding us of what we lacked and how powerless we often felt.My father and brother placed each plant carefully, covering their roots with soil, pressing gently to hold them in place. The seeds represented a gamble against the odds, a test of faith that life could flourish even now. “To plant is to believe in tomorrow,” my father said, as he pressed them gently into the soil.Carrying heavy buckets, they hauled water for the garden from more than 200 meters away, where neighbours queued in line to fill jugs. Water, once abundant from municipal taps, had become a hard-won treasure.The work was exhausting. The heat bore down mercilessly. Despite dizziness and weariness, day after day, they watered, tended and cleared space, so the seedlings could stretch toward the sun. Each drop of water was a tiny act of resistance.View image in fullscreenCorn grown in the garden.Photograph: Taqwa Ahmed al-Wawi/The GuardianPlants such as tomatoes or cucumbers, which require protective greenhouses (“hammams”) to survive Gaza’s harsh conditions, had already failed. The garden’s path was littered with hardship. My brother’s heart aches when he thinks of a mango seedling he nurtured for 10 months. He had split the seed, soaked it, wrapped it for a week and, after seeing the sprout, planted it. For two months, he watered it diligently. But the genocide forced our family to flee to Rafah. When we returned five months later, the mango plant was dead.So my father and brother chose plants that thrived with less care – ones which could succeed even in the most difficult conditions.The highlight was the corn. Thirty kernels, bought as popcorn seeds, grew into proud green stalks up to my chest. Standing among them, I felt a quiet pride.Despite the harsh conditions, lack of water and constant danger, each plant managed to grow, offering us food and a sense of achievement amid devastation.Potatoes soon followed. We harvested them and, boiled or fried, they became a meal made even richer by their origin. We drank fresh mint tea. Arugula andainjaradaadded sharp, peppery notes to our salads.Today, as scarcity gnaws and violence rages, even during a supposed ceasefire, the garden is still breathing life. It is a mix of longtime residents – the fig, orange, lemon and olive trees – and our new crops. In a landravaged by genocide, it persists – leaf by leaf, root by root. It is a chronicle of endurance and quiet rebellion.Taqwa Ahmed al-Wawi is a writer, poet and editor based in GazaDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It began not with a single shocking act but with quiet legal changes that narrowed space for dissent; each step justified as reasonable or necessary, until suddenly, democracy itself felt like a performance rather than a reality. Watching current developments in the UK, it’s impossible not to feel an uneasy sense of deja vu.Over the past few years, Britain has introduced a number of laws that have drastically curtailed the right to protest. ThePolice, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022and thePublic Order Act 2023grant police sweeping powers to restrict demonstrations, criminalise peaceful tactics and arrest people on vague grounds that they may have caused serious disruption or unease. Hundreds of arrestshave followed, including for slow marching, linking arms, or carrying protest equipment. Many of those arrested have faced prosecution, with courts handing down fines, and in some cases, lengthy imprisonment for peaceful protest activities, reinforcing the chilling effect of these laws.Officials say these measures are about balance and public order. But the balance has tipped towards control. Protesters and legal observers alike describe confusion about what is lawful, inconsistent police instructions and arbitrary arrests, even when organisers have coordinated with the police in advance. Activists are jailed for actions that only a few years ago would have resulted in a discharge, a fine or a suspended sentence. The result is growing uncertainty and hesitation that discourages people from speaking out or taking to the streets.This pattern is all too familiar. In Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, authoritarianism has taken root through the steady consolidation of government power. Under the guise of preserving “order” and “safety”, the government has restricted public gatherings andsilenced critical voices. Independent institutions, from the judiciary and media regulators to universities and cultural bodies, have been systematicallyundermined or taken over,ensuring that state power extends into nearly every corner of public life.Human rights official urges UK to review laws after Palestine Action placard arrestsRead moreHungary’s experience shows how fragile democracy becomes when legal safeguards erode, and how quickly laws written in neutral language can become instruments of repression. That trajectory should serve as a stark warning to the UK, where shrinking space for protest and dissent threaten democracy. The rule of law depends on legal limits that bind the state itself. When those limits weaken, when vague legislation hands discretion to the executive or to police, the door opens to abuse.That danger became clear last year in the UK, when the high court ruled that the then home secretary, Suella Braverman,had acted unlawfullyby lowering the protest threshold from “serious” to “more than minor” disruption, an attempt to make it easier for police to shut down protests altogether. The Labour government’s decision to defend those same unlawful regulations in court, rather than repeal them, was a troubling signal that across party lines, the instinct to control dissent runs deep.This creeping expansion of state power has extended far beyond the streets. Theproscriptionof the group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation marked an alarming new phase, with civil disobedience itself conflated with extremism.UN experts warnedthat such actions blur the line between legitimate activism and terrorism, echoing authoritarian tactics to stifle opposition under the guise of security.The UK is not Hungary, but the direction it is taking is alarmingly familiar. Make no mistake, this new authority in the UK may not be wielded by those who promise to use it responsibly. Laws outlast governments. Today’s “anti-disruption” powers could tomorrow be used to suppress strikes, silence journalists, or target minority communities.The lesson from Hungary is how quickly governments can manipulate the law to serve political ends, and how hard it is to undo that. Legal frameworks that curtail rights rarely stay idle – they are picked up, expanded and weaponised by those who find them convenient.The UK authorities, including central and local governments, the police and judiciary, can still change course. That means repealing or amending the most repressive elements of recent protest laws, ending the use of no-suspicion or“suspicion-less” stop and search, and committing to full transparency and accountability in how police powers are exercised. Above all, it means recognising that dissent, no matter how disruptive or uncomfortable, is not a threat to democracy but its safeguard.Freedom of assembly is not a gift governments grant their citizens; it is a right that protects citizens from their governments. Look to Hungary. Britain should not have to learn that lesson the hard way.Lydia Gall is a senior Europe researcher at Human Rights WatchDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A radical overhaul is neededThu 8 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 09.29 ESTShareGovernments come into office brimming with confidence. They say their election win is a mandate for change, and that work on its manifesto pledgeswill start immediately. Invariably, there is talk of sleeves being rolled up.Sooner or later, there is a rude awakening. Ministers push buttons and pull levers expecting things to happen instantly, and are shocked to find that they don’t. The reason for that is simple: the British state is big – andgetting bigger– but as an agent of change it is not up to the job.This is true at both central and local levels. Over the years, the capacity of government to intervene has been pared back and professional expertise has been lost as council services havebeen outsourced. The main job of the state is now to alleviate the consequences of failure, which are becoming ever more pressing.Obeisance to market forces explains part of the problem. For the past half-century, there has been a neuralgic aversion to anything that smacks of picking winners. The misguided idea that countries only really thrive when governments get out of the way of the private sector has taken root. There are, though, other factors at play. One is the dominance of the Treasury, which has tried – unsuccessfully – to be both a ministry that looks after the public finances, and a ministry of the economy. Another is the British cult of the amateur, which has fostered the belief that somehow or other things will work out.Other countries have decided that winging it is perhaps not the best approach, and have done things differently. East Asian countries such as South Korea made conscious decisions to establish companies in certain sectors – computer electronics and shipbuilding for example – and forced through change.Nor did China’sdominationof the solar panels market – and clean energymore generally– come about by accident. It was the result of the authorities in Beijing identifying low-carbon technology as a global growth opportunity,and then making sure the investment and the people were available. While Britain has talked about a new industrial strategy built around a net zero future but done little toturn that rhetoric into reality, China – and other countries for that matter – have got on with it.Even the US – supposedly the ultimate expression of the free market – has a mechanism for delivering an industrial strategy: in part through the money pumped by the federal governmentinto universities, in part through the links between defence companies and the state, and in part through good old interventionism. Last year, for example, the US government took a10% stakein chipmaker Intel: a clear case of picking winners.Only rarely, and then usually as a result of extreme circumstances, has the British state been geared up for transformative change. One reason why the 1945 Labour government was able to be so radical was that it inherited a fully functioning planned economy at the end of the second world war. Key industries were run from Whitehall, and labour was directed to where it was needed.In the 1960s, Britain flirted with indicative planning – the idea that governments should set broad targets, and work out how to achieve them through cooperation with private companies and organised labour. A National Economic Development Council (NEDC)was createdto bring together politicians, business leaders and trade unionists. Later, a new ministry, the Department of Economic Affairs, was set up to oversee a national plan for growth. Neither survived.And yet, the record of other countries suggests that the devotees of indicative planning in the 1960s were on to something. Britain will only emerge sustainably from its current economic torpor if the machinery of government is reformed to make the state more effective. That means breaking the power of the Treasury by creating alternative economic power bases within Whitehall – either by beefing up the power of the prime minister’s office, or by creating a standalone ministry with real clout. Something akin to the old NEDC should be brought back, with a remit to identify and nurture potential growth sectors.Money matters, but it is not the only thing that matters. Britain has theweakest record for investmentof any of the G7 nations, and that needs to change. Yet the investment will only really be effective if the state is willing to experiment and accept that not all projects will end in success. Other countries have shown the benefits of a pragmatic, trial-and-error approach. Repeating that success here requires substantial culture change, which is a big ask, but worth the risk.The alternative is that other countries continue to leave Britain for dead in the growth industries of the future, and that ideas that stem from here are commercially exploited elsewhere.Failure to reform the state to make it more dynamic will also entrench public cynicism about politics. Voters zone out when they hear about the latest government initiative because they suspect – quite rightly – that it is just so much hot air. Their day-to-day experience of the state, whether it isunfilled potholes,long waitsfor treatment in A&E, or draconian fines for minor littering offences, is not positive.There was a time when people had a more benign view of the state, but that was when it was seen as doing things for people rather than to people: establishing the NHS, putting new health centres next to schools, building homes. Without a makeover, the state will continue to appear not just big and useless, but also mean. It’s not a good look.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsIndustrial policyOpinionCivil serviceEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsTax and spendingcommentShareReuse this content"

We were invited to speak about the state of the world and of the arts. We both thought light and darkness existed in the world, even if our perception about them differed. Béla was already weakened in his body, but the spirit was still ferocious, rebellious, furious. We sat down to talk. It seemed fairly obvious this would be our ultimate, and most heartfelt, conversation. As the former apprentice, I was able to see the master one last time, with all his rage, sorrow, love and hate.View image in fullscreenLászló Nemes in London, October 2025.Photograph: Shane Anthony Sinclair/Getty Images for BFII first met Béla in 2004 when he was preparing The Man from London. I wanted to learn film-making and applied to become an assistant on the film. He gave me my first real job: as an assistant, I had to find a boy for one of the main parts. I spent months in the casting process, for a part that eventually was cut from the shooting script. But for Béla, every effort put into a given movie was never lost – it was integrated into the energy field of the enterprise. The final outcome had to be the product of difficult processes. The harder the task, the better quality one could expect. He wanted to film life, and its constant dance. The choreography was a revelation for me: 10-minute, uninterrupted takes, unifying space, characters and time. All in black and white.I gradually understood that this was the best way to learn about film-making, much better than any film school: find a master and be initiated to the mysteries of a given art form, the way painters or artisans learned their craft for centuries. In Béla’s case, the work had to involve a closely knit group of trusted collaborators, a particular attention to craft (a level hardly reached nowadays, sacrificed on the altar of speed and efficiency), a deep connection to everything human, especially to those forgotten by an increasingly superficial society, and a profound love of physical film as opposed to anything computer-based, because all his films were grounded in the physical world. And yet, they all yearned to reach a metaphysical level, which corresponded to my natural inclination.View image in fullscreenAn enterprise of madness … The Man from London.Photograph: Artificial Eye/Sportsphoto/AllstarIn retrospect, The Man from London was an enterprise of madness – a Hungarian movie, based on a French language book by Belgian writer Georges Simenon, shot with international actors and Hungarian half-amateurs, all speaking on set in their native language, in a complex European co-production involving a shoot in Corsican town Bastia, dressed as a port in Normandy – all this in a period, 1930s setting. The project also involved the building of the main set element, a metal monster watchtower overlooking the bay. It all seemed to be a Fitzcarraldo-like project with gargantuan ambition, but the sheer talent, resilience and inspiring presence of Béla, his partner and editor Agnes Hranitzky, production designer László Rajk, and screenwriter (and now Nobel prize winner) László Krasznahorkai, and all the other crew members also made me believe this was the centre of the world.View image in fullscreenFerocious, rebellious … Béla Tarr at Cannes film festival in 2007 at a photocall for The Man From London.Photograph: Antonelli/Laruffa/ShutterstockThe filming was fraught with difficulties and constant challenges, primarily because of a structural discrepancy between the available funds and the scope of the film. Béla, in his unrelenting quest for perfection, was switching between cinematographers while looking for new finances. It was then that I understood the difference between compromise andcompromission. A film-maker has to navigate on that spectrum. Sometimes, sacrifices have to be made. At other times, artistic integrity requires the director stand firm. It wasn’t easy, even for Béla, to find the right path forward. French producer Humbert Balsan killed himself during the months of uncertainty that had engulfed the movie. It was a tragic example of how Béla’s art was profoundly linked to the real world. Life is cinema and cinema is life – with a little help from people like him.One day, when filming was stopped, I stumbled in a bookstore in Bastia upon a book containing the transcripts of theSonderkommandosof Auschwitz. It then took me 10 years of maturing to find a form to tell the story of what would become my first feature film, Son of Saul. One cannot depart easily from Béla Tarr’s world – it has to be a fierce gesture. When I left, it was a great loss for me, but I also took with me the rebellious attitude, the one always questioning the conventions of cinema, the codes and academic attitudes of those making films.With Sátántangó and Werckmeister Harmonies, Béla Tarr became the vividly disquieting master of spiritual desolationRead moreIn the winter of 2004, Béla was tasked to shoot with Robby Müller, the great cinematographer, a short film in Budapest aboutHungaryentering the EU. He called it Prologue. With a couple of assistants, I was tasked to find overnight 300 homeless people, all agreeing to be filmed while waiting in line for some food: a flow of endless faces, humanity, fragility, the forgotten ones. This is how he saw Hungary in Europe. Béla was driving me to the shoot, and he asked me, almost in a shy way, whether I thought this would be a good short film. Why would the great director ask a young assistant such a question? Maybe, he knew already, that I would always honour the tradition that he belonged to, and that I would do my best to keep the flame burning.Explore more on these topicsBéla TarrHungaryLászló NemesEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

When you write songs, do you think about how listenersmightcarry them into their own lives, or do the songs stop being yours after they are done?VanearleWhen I wrote [2019’s] Watch Me Get Married, I thought maybe people would have that as their wedding song. But mostly it’s inconceivable what people are gonna do with a song. I don’t think about it too much because there are 100,000 places where it’s gonna live. Have I ever heard about any inappropriate uses of songs? I think having Our Anniversary as a wedding song is a little surprising, but maybe they’re realists.Smog: Our Anniversary – videoAs an appreciator ofdub, if you could spend a week in a studio to collaborate with anydubartist at their peak, who would you go for?albertoaylerI’d have to say Lee “Scratch” Perry just because he was so crazy. He was like a little kid – just infectious excitement. I think that he would have been easy to hang out with. But also, King Tubby was such a minimalist and I’d be curious about how he determined when enough was enough – investing so much power in the fewest elements. Have Fun With God [the 2014 dub remix album of 2013’s Dream River] was very traditional – all the moves were taken from 70s Jamaican records. Maybe once is enough. But I do like the idea of recycling recorded things to make something else – that’s what initially attracted me to dub. If I did [a new remix album], I may do achopped and screwedrecord.I’ve heard that you lived in Knaresborough, NorthYorkshire, roughlybetweenthe ages of 12and 15. What did you do for fun at that time?pinballfilmsI wasn’t quite a teenager, more like age seven to 12. There was a lot of farmland that we weren’t really supposed to be on, but we couldn’t help ourselves. And there was a particular farmer that had the most land, and he had orchards. I loved being in the apple orchards with all the trees lined up. The farmer would often come chasing us. Mostly it was climbing walls, going places that we weren’t supposed to be, exploring the river and fishing. In the last year I was there, I started getting into music and going to record stores. Moving from Maryland, the biggest culture shock was that when you’re in America, you’re just one of the guys, but when you’re in England in the 70s and you’re an American, you’re kind of from another planet. A lot of the [popular] music and TV was American. People were watching Dallas, The Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman and Starsky & Hutch. In a way, [being American] was like being a movie star. England at the time was a rough place compared with what I was used to, like that movie Kes. There would be gangs of punks roaming around and causing trouble, like A Clockwork Orange.What do you think are good ways to support musicians besides going to concerts? In other words: is it time to leave Spotify?fredrikstaiI heard you watched The Sopranos during lockdown. Is being in the music business like being in the mob?ekaterinanoviaObviously, buying merchandise or records. Is it time to quit Spotify? We don’t really have a choice. Someone else asked if the business is like the mob. I’ve been on an independent label [Drag City] all my life, which is avoiding the mafia. But then streaming happened and basically we were coerced into putting all of our music on streaming services. Drag City did hold out for 10 years or something. Then finally, with all the bands’ consents, they gave in – and they would be out of business now if they hadn’t. That, to me, feels a little bit like coercion or mafia techniques. In a way, they were forced into cooperating with this new thing where someone else is in charge of the money. That was the first time that it felt a little like The Sopranos.View image in fullscreenBill Callahan performs in Spicewood, Texas, 2025.Photograph: Astrida Valigorsky/WireImageYour records have been releasedon Chicago’s Drag City formore than30 years. What would you say makes this label a perfect fit for your music and way of working?TheVisitorI always think that we grew up together. We both started out at the same time and we figured out what we wanted, what our parameters were, what we were willing to do and do together. Especially at the beginning, they would confer with me about all the next moves and growth they were considering. As I did more records, there were new situations that I was facing as I got slightly more popular, and that was all stuff that we worked out together. I basically feel like it’s my label. In a very broad sense, I have complete control. If I gave them a silent record and said, “put this out”, they would do it without question. I think that’s extremely rare. No one can give me more freedom, there’s no reason to go anywhere else.Who are for you some of the funniest lyricists, or lyrics?bertisgRandy Newman, and songs like Love Story (You and Me) where he sings: “Someday he may be President / If things loosen up.” I heard that song decades ago and that was a very impactful line, just to know that you could put that much humour in a song, and it’s not just a laugh – it also has meaning to it. I remember when I was a kid and I heard Short People – that’s the kind of humour that a lot of people are offended by. His sense of humour is very sly, but also social commentary. [Pavement’s] Stephen Malkmus is pretty funny in a very out-there way – he has some straight humour songs, but a lot of his lyrics make me laugh because they’re verbal acrobatics.Bill Callahan’s 20 best songs – ranked!Read moreAcross your career, you seem to have deepened your understanding of how you can use your tools. Can you connect with the idea of being a craftsman in how youapproach your work?savaleI’ve always hated that word when it comes to music, and it just does not apply to me. If that person could see me in my life, they would not even dream of calling me a craftsman. I picture a craftsman as the guy who’s got his tools all labelled in boxes and shelves and knows where everything is. I’m more of a drunk professor; I like happenstance and coincidence and mistakes. I know nothing about synthesisers, but I’ll randomly pick one and turn it on and start recording. I press some buttons and play something and somehow try to make it work. I’m only precise about writing the lyrics and then the rest of it is more like: throw it at the wall. I don’t know anything about chord progressions. It’s more being open and receiving things from wherever they come from. I feel more like a medium. A craftsman builds something out of nothing. And I think I receive things that are already built, and make sure the reception is accurate.Bill Callahan: Partition – videoIn the song Partition [from 2022] you sing, “Meditate, ventilate … Microdose, change your clothes / Do what you’ve got to do”, which stuck with me. Do you meditate? Ventilate? Microdose? Change your clothes? I meditate, too, and feel the space in your songs somehow.aimzo_d0tYeah – I think exercise, socialise, externalise … those are all the things that make sure that everything is flowing correctly and nothing is blocked or hidden. Meditation is crucial for me. Right after I moved to Austin around 2004, I think that’s when I started meditating. That was the first time I’d had a house and it was quiet enough. Up until then I’d been in apartments with thin walls. I was trying to reinvent my whole life, and so meditation was part of that. I wanted a backyard and a driveway, a piano. Kind of settling down. I was kind of a late bloomer, so once I hit my 20s, I wanted to explore the country and have the fun that I didn’t have in my teenage years. Then I had enough of that.Bill Callahan: ‘I can’t die – life is too good, it can’t end’Read moreWould you allow your voice to be licensed for AI-produced songs?Nicens_boiNo. Does it scare me? It does. It’s just sad to me, really, the way people are devaluing everything with AI. I mean, we’re here. We’re humans on Earth. That’s the fun of it, being a human that doesn’t know everything and trying things out, experimenting and exploring. Being able to do everything without any effort is not fun. When some artist that you like makes a new record, it’s exciting – maybe they did something even better than the last time, or maybe they really fucked up and that’ll be really interesting and give a new dimension to that person. AI is never going to make anything worth thinking about. You could make 100 quote-unquote “Frank Sinatra” records but [sighs] … it’s just not human. Creating things involves growing as a human, and that’s not what AI is about.View image in fullscreenA human on Earth …Photograph: Hanly Banks CallahanHave you ever written a perfect song in your dreams, as happens in[2009’s] Eid Ma Clack Shaw?staypositiveYeah – I’ve heard the most heavenly melodies and try to hold on to them in my subconscious. They’re never there when I wake up. I’ve heard amazing lines that disappear, like invisible ink. I’ve been trying to be in closer communion with my subconscious – before I go to sleep, I ask my dreams to show me something. It works sometimes. Dreams and music are very close kin, they’re these intangible things that hit you very hard. They’re both spirit things. It’s crazy that we dream and we pay so little attention to it, like they used to say: “Oh, it’s just the brain cleaning itself out.” There’s gotta be more to it than that.My Days of 58is released on 27 February via Drag City.Explore more on these topicsBill CallahanFilm & Music reader interviewAmericanafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The GuardianThe president has vowed to kill off ‘woke’ in his second term in office, and the venerable cultural institution a few blocks from the White House is in his sightsByCharlotte HigginsThu 8 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 08.13 ESTShareOn 30 May last year, Kim Sajet was working in her office in the grandly porticoed National Portrait Gallery inWashington DC. The gallery is one of the most important branches of the Smithsonian Institution, the complex of national museums that, for almost 200 years, has told the story of the nation. The director’s suite, large enough to host a small party, has a grandeur befitting the museum’s role as the keeper of portraits of the United States’ most significant historical figures. Sajet was working beneath the gaze of artworks from the collection, including a striking 1952 painting of Mary Mills, a military-uniformed, African American nurse, and a bronze head of jazz and blues singer Ethel Waters.It seemed like an ordinary Friday. Until, that is, an anxious colleague came in to tell Sajet that the president of the United States had personally denounced her on social media. “Upon the request and recommendation of many people I am herby [sic] terminating the employment of Kim Sajet as Director of the National Portrait Gallery,”Donald Trumphad posted on Truth Social. According to the post, Sajet was “a highly partisan person” and a “strong supporter” of diversity and inclusion programmes, which by an executive order on his inauguration day, 20 January, he had eradicated from federal agencies. “Her replacement will be named shortly,” continued the message. “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Sajet is a Dutch art historian, raised in Australia, who is in her early 60s. She has platinum blond hair, and wears trouser suits in bright colours and statement spectacles. Her manner is warm and open, but she also projects an air of professional control. When we met in autumn 2025, she seemed so determined not to say anything controversial that I struggled to believe that anyone could consider her radical. She recalled that, after absorbing Trump’s post, she shot a look at her shaken colleague, and asked: “Are you OK?”“It honestly was another day in the office,” Sajet told me. “Truly, I don’t think people realise that as soon as you become a director at the Smithsonian, you are a public figure.” In the 12 years she had been running the museum, members of Congress were constantly questioning displays, she said. A disgruntled painter whose portrait of Trump she had refused to put on display – because, she said, the work was of insufficient quality – had pursued her through the courts for years.But surely, I asked, the president personally firing her on social media was something else? She shrugged, her tough outer coating intact. “I think we can all agree we live in unusual times,” she said.It had, perhaps, been only a matter of time before Trump targeted a senior figure from the Smithsonian Institution. In February, Trump had declared himself, despite having no authority to do so, chair of the Kennedy Center, the US’s national centre for the performing arts, and vowed to end “woke” programming – a prelude, it turned out, to actuallyrenaming the organisation after himself, with workmen adding his name, in slightly mismatching type, above that of Kennedy’s on the building’s facade this Christmas. At the national museums, there had been some hope his attention to the arts might peter out there. After all, the Smithsonian, as well as the National Gallery of Art, a separate body, had pre-emptively shut down their diversity offices soon after Trump’s executive order, despite not themselves being federal agencies.But on 27 March an executive order was published, claiming that the Smithsonian had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centred ideology” that “promoted narratives that portray American and western values as inherently harmful and oppressive”. The person assigned with removing this “improper ideology”, along with the vice-president, JD Vance, wasLindsey Halligan, a Trump aide in her mid-30s who had previously worked as an insurance attorney and had no experience in the arts.The executive orderwas titled Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History.On 30 May, as soon as she heard of the Truth Social post, Sajet spoke to her boss, Lonnie Bunch III, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who had previously been founding director of its National Museum of African American History and Culture. “We very quickly said: ‘The president of the United States does not have the jurisdiction to fire a director at the Smithsonian,’” Sajet recalled. That power lay with Bunch himself, overseen by the Smithsonian’s board of regents, a traditionally non-partisan group composed of members of Congress and members of the public, plus the vice-president and the chief justice. “I just kept on working,” Sajet said.The next working day after Trump’s post, Monday 2 June, an emergency meeting of the Smithsonian’s board of regents was held. By the end, Sajet still had her job. A week later, on Monday 9 June, there was a second board meeting. Afterwards, the Smithsonian published a statement affirming that decisions on hiring and firing lay with Bunch. (This was despite the fact, according to people familiar with the meetings, that the vice-president, Vance, had personally called for Sajet’s head.) As a concession to the administration, the Smithsonian announced that Bunch would also take measures to ensure “unbiased content” in the museums, and report back to the board on “any needed personnel changes”.View image in fullscreenKim Sajet in front of Ellsworth Kelly’s Red Yellow Blue II in November.Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The GuardianSajet kept off social media, avoiding the threatening messages from Trump’s base that friends told her were amassing. She lasted until Thursday 12 June. In the end, she decided she should try to defuse what she feared could turn into a larger, more resolute attack on the museum. “It just became fairly obvious that the story wasn’t going to change,” she told me. “So I thought, ‘I’m just going to take control of this, and step outside of the maelstrom.’”In short, the president had ended up getting what he wanted – without a jot of authority to do so. As for Sajet’s supposed partisan position, her adherence to the loathed ideology of diversity and inclusion? Sajet’s mission had been, she told me, to ensure that Americans would be able to see portraits of people like themselves. Gradually, she made sure more women, more minorities, more Black people were represented on its walls. “It was just recognising that people had been knocked out of the national story, so let’s put them back in,” she said. “It wasn’t terribly revolutionary.”In a smoothly run liberal democracy, it is easy to imagine that the arts and culture are distractions unworthy of serious political attention. But as the culture wars have intensified over the past decade or so, and as politics has become less stable across the globe, that view has been harder to sustain. It is certainly not a view shared by Trump and his circle. On 19 August, the president gave the fullest articulation yet of his position. “TheMuseumsthroughout Washington, but all over the Country are,” he asserted on social media, “the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE.’”He continued: “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been – Nothing about Success, nothing about Brightness, nothing about the Future.” He added: “I have instructed my attorneys to go through the Museums, and start the exact same process that has been done with Colleges and Universities where tremendous progress has been made.”To use different language, Trump wanted museums to reflect a Maga vision of American history that was nationalist and triumphalist, and downplayed reflection on darker aspects of its past, specifically its history of slavery. His views were of a piece with his other, smaller, forays into the cultural arena – his desire, for example, to build a triumphal arch in Washington, or his personal role invetoing what were regarded as “woke” artistsfrom becoming Kennedy Center honourees.Whereas the first Trump administration left cultural matters largely alone, in his second term it has made them a priority. Through lawsuits and executive orders, threats and intimidation, the administration is seeking to shift the country to the right, an abrupt and extreme escalation in the long battle for control over the narrative of American history fought by both the right and the left. To do so, he is targeting the institutions – universities and museums – that form people’s minds and imaginations, their sense of identity. “The goal,” as one senior employee of the Smithsonian told me, “is to reframe the entire culture of the United States from the foundation up.”View image in fullscreenAn exhibit at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, Washington DC.Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The Guardian“In Trump 1.0, the systems that held everything together were still working,” said Gus Casely-Hayford, the former director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of AfricanArt, now at the V&A East in London. “But those systems were not stitched together by anything more robust than culture, practice and belief. No one thought that anyone would unravel that, but so much of what the Smithsonian does tends towards what it means to be American.” And what it means to be American, it seems, is up for grabs as never before.The Smithsonian Institution is particularly vulnerable to Trump’s attentions. As a collection of national museums, with members of Congress and the vice-president on the board, it is physically close to the great centres of power in DC. It also occupies a unique status among US museums in that it is about 60% federally funded. As such, its aim is to be politically unbiased, though any follower of the BBC will know that impartiality is a moving target. This special status puts it in contrast to the country’s other great museums – for example the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Getty in Los Angeles – which are privately funded through philanthropy and endowments, and so at one remove from the government. Intimidation is one weapon an administration can use against the Smithsonian; funding is another. Already, the Smithsonian is anticipating a budget cut of $131.2m in 2026.There is one potential weapon, however, that the Trump administration might try to use against private museums. Many of them, along with charitable foundations and universities, have tax-exempt status, which Trump could threaten to remove. Glenn D Lowry, who recently retired as director of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, after 30 years, believes this may be coming. “Theoretically they can’t do it,” Lowry told me. “But the mere threat acts as a form of pressure. Institutions might start to self-censor, and that is a very real risk.”The Baltimore Museum of Art is an elegant Greek temple of a building that gazes steadily over its majority-Black, deeply segregated city. It stands on the fringes of a park that, until 2017, held a statue of a pair of confederate generals, now an empty plinth. On a weekday morning in November, the museum was full of bustle. A few visitors were drawn to its stellar collection of Matisses, but more, that day, were there to see an exhibition by Amy Sherald, the artist who, in 2018, had become famous for her painting of Michelle Obama dressed in a sweeping, geometrically patterned evening gown, which was commissioned to hang in Washington’s National Portrait Gallery.The show was full of of people clustering round Sherald’s striking, larger-than-life paintings of Black subjects to whom she had accorded the grandeur of heroic figures of 19th-century history paintings. Sherald had attended art school in Baltimore, and the exhibition, American Sublime, had the feel of a homecoming. But it had never been intended this way. At the end of July, two months before it was due to open, Sherald had withdrawn the exhibition abruptly from its intended home at the National Portrait Gallery in DC, over fears that her work was being censored – not by the Trump administration, but by the Smithsonian itself.By the time Sherald’s decision became public, on 24 July, Sajet had been gone from the portrait gallery over a month. In a statement, Sherald explained that she had decided to pull the entire show after she had heard of disquieting discussions at the central HQ of the Smithsonian – “the castle”, as it is known – over one painting. The work in question is a portrait, titled Trans Forming Liberty, of a trans woman in the triumphant pose of the Statue of Liberty. Sherald told the New York Times she had discovered there was an internal discussion about either replacing the painting with, or contextualising it by, a video of people reacting to the work. The discussion, she had gleaned, was prompted by fears that the portrait would attract adverse attention because trans people are such a frequent target for Trump’s circle. “The video would have opened up for debate the value of trans visibility,” Sherald said, “and I was opposed to that being a part of the American Sublime narrative.”View image in fullscreenAmy Sherald’s Trans Forming Liberty at the Baltimore Museum of Art in November.Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The GuardianTracking self-censorship is difficult. Often it operates in subtle ways – the removal of a word in a label here, the discreet pulling of a display that never got publicly announced there. One DC museums professional told me that they had been informed that “anything relating to trans life, or even acknowledging trans life, is going to need extra layers of review”. Another told me their institution had removed the phrase “social justice” from a wall text as a way of softening the way a particular artist (a socialist, anti-racist figure) was presented. In another context, references to the Dutch empire’s involvement in enslavement was discouraged from the labels on a display of Dutch landscapes.“People are acquiescing in advance as a way to stay under the radar,” said Steven Nelson, who recently stepped down from a senior position at the National Gallery of Art. “Very quickly, things that would not have been considered DEI began being considered DEI, which was almost anything not white.” No one currently in post at the Smithsonian or the National Gallery of Art spoke to me on the record about such matters, fearing for their jobs and for those of their colleagues. The less attention from the White House, the better. “Don’t poke at it,” was the phrase one museum director used.Some staff at the Smithsonian told me that the institution was being overly cautious. One person told me that a proposed label for a recent exhibition had referred to the “unjust” incarceration of Japanese Americans during the second world war. The central Smithsonian had asked for the word to be changed, because it could seem partisan. “America hardly ever apologises for anything, and it almost never gives reparations,” the person involved told me, “except for this event, this example in our history where we said sorry, and that apology came with money.” It was obvious to them that “unjust” was a fair summary of events, but the review demanded a wordier formulation. The drip-drip of such seemingly small adjustments sat uncomfortably with their personal ethics, “changing the language around this thing, not mentioning this thing – it is a question of small moral injuries”.At times, the self-censorship approaches dark comedy. One Smithsonian employee had removed the word “diversity” from texts and replaced it with the synonym “variety”. Diversity, after all, was a word guaranteed to provoke the ire of the Trump circle because of its association with DEI programmes. But in this particular case, “diversity” was being used in a strictly scientific context: the “diversity” of astronomical objects. Nevertheless, the employee was anxious about the word’s potentially snagging on any search engines through which the administration might run museum texts. Better, all round, to deflect the gaze.For some, the self-censorship – what some might call anticipatory obedience – is becoming increasingly frustrating. “I think courage is contagious,” one curator told me. “If a big institution like the Smithsonian, which has so much influence and power, were seen to be taking a stand, I think other institutions would. But the way that it gets communicated to the staff is like, ‘Well, if the CIA and the FBI can’t stand up to Trump, what can we do?’” Nelson put it even more bluntly: “The administration don’t really have to do anything, because institutions are doing it all for them.”In Washington DC this autumn, life often seemed normal. Restaurants and bars were bustling, streets were pounded by purposeful-looking people on official business. But every so often, one would glimpse something very different: soldiers clustered on street corners, in metro stations, even in shops. These were members of the National Guard deployed to support the efforts of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). Between January and the end of July,ICE arrested 88 peoplein DC. But then, from 1 August to the end of October, that number leapt to 1,147. “You could be walking your dog. And suddenly, black cars pull up and people mug some kid on a moped who’s delivering somebody’s dinner,” said one Smithsonian employee. “They pummel him or her to the ground, put their feet on their neck, put them in a black SUV, drive away, leave the moped there, leave the food on the sidewalk, and the neighbours walk out and see what they can do. It happens in other countries. Now it’s happening here.”The sense of life going on while at the same time, on another level, life had become disordered and frightening, was also true at the Smithsonian. On one level, an employee told me, nothing much had actually “happened”. Those with long memories pointed to the great Smithsonian scandals of the past, such as a 1990s show about the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. After noisy accusations of an anti-American bias, the show was substantially altered, and the director of the National Air and Space Museum resigned. No scandal, optimists pointed out, had yet occurred on that scale.This winter, the museums were still busy with visitors – at least, after the autumn’s long government shutdown ended. The Museum of African American History, the institution Lonnie Bunch had established, was hosting throngs of visitors, many of them Black Americans making the pilgrimage to absorb an unvarnished account of the cruelty and racism that was so central to their country’s history. One of its most moving artefacts is a chunk of iron ballast used in 18th-century slave ships to counterbalance the human cargo.Behind the scenes, though, a tense standoff was continuing between the Trump administration and the “castle”. In his 2019 memoir, Bunch had been frank about his awkward encounters with the president. He recounts giving Trump a tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in his first term. Before the president arrived, aides informed Bunch that he was “in a foul mood and that he did not want to see anything ‘difficult’”. Bunch decided to begin with the slavery section nevertheless, since “it was not my job to make the rough edges of history smooth, even for the president”. In a section on how nations such as Portugal, Britain and the Netherlands profited from the slave trade, Trump paused and studied a label. “I felt that maybe he was paying attention to the work of the museum,” writes Bunch. “He quickly proved me wrong. As he turned from the display, he said to me, ‘You know, they love me in the Netherlands.’ All I could say was let’s continue walking.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with Lonnie Bunch at the White House in 2019.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesOn 12 August, three weeks after Amy Sherald’s withdrawal of her show in DC, Lindsey Halligan and two other Trump aides wrote to Bunch. The letter began amiably enough, thanking him for a tour of some of the museums, but then announced that they would be leading a review of the institution. It would initially be focused on eight museums, including the Museum of American History, the Museum of African American History, the National Portrait Gallery and the American Art Museum – those, in short, most concerned with the country’s identity and self-image.For this, institutions would be required to provide, within 75 days, an ocean of information: exhibition outlines, texts of labels, exhibition catalogues, budgets, staff manuals, organisational charts, inventory of all holdings, educational resources, grant applications. Within 120 days, the letter continued, museums should begin implementing “content corrections”, replacing “divisive or ideologically driven language”. A “revitalised” curatorial vision should be rooted in the “strength, breadth, and achievements of the American story”. The institution would, in short, begin to focus on what it called “Americanism”.A week later Trump published his long post about how museums were the “last remaining segment of woke”. Two days after that,the White House put out an articleheadlined “President Trump Is Right About the Smithsonian”, detailing exhibits and texts regarded as objectionable, from apainting of a refugee familycrossing the wall at the Mexican border, to an animation illustrating the career of physician Anthony Fauci, to a wall text that described the founding of the US as “a profound unsettling of the continent”.Then, on 28 August, Bunch was summoned to the White House for lunch with Trump and Halligan. Afterwards, Bunch insisted in a letter to staff that the review of the institution would in fact be conducted by its own staff – a grasping-back of the Smithsonian’s independence – though information would be shared with the White House. He also addressed an anxious all-staff meeting held at the auditorium of the Museum of African American History. The message was, according to a staffer who was there: carry on with your work, keep doing what you do.These days, Kim Sajet is in Wisconsin. Soon after she resigned from the National Portrait Gallery, she was approached by the Milwaukee Art Museum to become its new director. The museum, located on the shores of Lake Michigan, is a spectacular ensemble of buildings: some by the Finnish architect Eero Saarinen in modernist concrete; some by the Spaniard Santiago Calatrava in the fantastical form of a giant bird, whose soaring wings are now a symbol of the city.We met a few weeks after Sajet had begun work there, in her new office – several degrees less grand than her previous perch in DC. “I’m still getting my head around the collection,” she said, of the museum’s eclectic holdings, which range from paintings by Georgia O’Keeffe and Agnes Martin to an Egyptian mummy, and one of the US’s most significant collections of Haitian art.View image in fullscreenKim Sajet in the Quadracci Pavillon at the Milwaukee Art Museum.Photograph: Pete Kiehart/The GuardianSajet told me she was loving Milwaukee, with its green spaces and lakefront walks, and was excited about running an institution that could exist at the centre of its local community. Privately funded, the museum is far away from the baleful gaze of Trump. When I asked whether she still feels she could be targeted, she said: “I don’t know. I mean, it could happen, right? I mean, I’m still a pretty visible symbol, whatever. Who knows what’s around the corner. But you just can’t live like that.”Ninety miles or so down the coast of the lake, in the Democratic stronghold of Chicago, Trump’s shadow had fallen far less darkly over its museums than in Washington, and, when I visited, protesters were gathering in force against ICE and its raids. The Museum of Contemporary Art had an exhibition about histories of queer culture in the city, and afeatured image on its websitewas a sculpture by the African American artist Arthur Jafa, based on a famous 1863 photo of an enslaved man with horrific scars on his back. (Reproductions of the photograph hadreportedly been ordered to be removedfrom national parks by the Trump administration.) At the Art Institute of Chicago, one of the great American museums, curator Sarah Kelly Oehler showed me the galleries of 20th-century American art she had recently rehung. “I think of myself in a trajectory of 150 years of curators,” she said. Hers was a pluralistic vision of modernism, with more work by female artists and artists of colour than in the past – an interpretation that would have looked alien to the visitors of 50 years ago. “My job is to offer historical information,” she said. “We have a very diverse audience in Chicago, and we have a responsibility to them. If we want to offer a place of respite and inspiration to them, we have to think about who these people are.”Back in DC, one museum director told me they were feeling calm – readier, than in the spring, for assaults by the administration. They knew what they would do if they were hauled up in front of a hostile congressional hearing, as were thepresidents of Columbia and Harvard last year. They had scenarios mapped out, “like a crime board”. Lonnie Bunch, in the meantime, is holding a delicate line. On 18 December, a new letter from the White House arrived for him. The Smithsonian had fallen short in providing the information requested on 12 August, it said. “We wish to be assured,” it continued, “that none of the leadership of the Smithsonian museums is confused about the fact that the United States has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world. The American people will have no patience for any museum that is diffident about America’s founding or otherwise uncomfortable conveying a positive view of American history.” Then came the threat. “As you may know, funds apportioned for the Smithsonian Institution are only available for use in a manner consistent with Executive Order 14253, ‘Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,’ and the fulfilment of the requests set forth in our August 12, 2025 letter.”The invention of whiteness: the long history of a dangerous ideaRead moreBunch wrote a note to all his staff the following day, quietly affirming, once more, the organisation’s autonomy. “For nearly 180 years, the Smithsonian has served our country as an independent and nonpartisan institution committed to its mission – the increase and diffusion of knowledge – for all Americans. As we all know, all content, programming, and curatorial decisions are made by the Smithsonian.”WithJD Vanceon the board of regents, along with Republican members of Congress, the question hovers: how long will 73-year-old Bunch survive in his position? “Lonnie knows his time is short,” one DC museum director told me. “It’s a question of how he decides to go, and of which hill he chooses to die on.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readMuseumsDonald TrumpArtArts fundingWashington DCUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

School Ties (1992)Matt Damon is essentially a bland dish that requires the right spice truly to zing, which means he is often at his best when playing beastly. His flagrantly nasty turn as one of the antisemitic bullies who makes prep school life hell for a secretly Jewish classmate (Brendan Fraser) offers an early indication that Damon realised this, too.19. Courage Under Fire (1996)Damon lost about 25kg for a handful of scenes as the traumatised, heroin-addicted young Gulf war veteran recalling a rescue mission in which his commanding officer (Meg Ryan) was killed. The sudden weight loss left him reeling: “I was looking for something to set me apart: ‘Look what I’ll do, I’ll kill myself!’” It paid off. “Directors took note of it.”18. Syriana (2005)View image in fullscreenMoral complexity … Matt Damon and Alexander Siddig as Bryan Woodman and Prince Nasir Al-Subaai  in Syriana.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarIn this scattershot political thriller, Damon’s storyline has a crisp moral complexity. He plays Bryan Woodman, an energy analyst whose oldest son dies accidentally during a party at the home of a Middle Eastern emir. Woodman is later mollified with a lucrative contract from the emir’s family. “How much for my other kid?” he asks caustically – before accepting the offer. That’s capitalism.17. Contagion (2011)Reunited with Gwyneth Paltrow from The Talented Mr Ripley, though not for long. She plays Damon’s wife, who brings back from her Hong Kong business trip something more original than a giant Toblerone: a deadly virus. She expires messily soon after, as does their son, leaving Damon to fend for himself and their teenage daughter amid the ensuing pandemic. Steven Soderbergh’s 1970s-style all-star disaster movie was a hit on release, then found its second wind during Covid.16. Stuck on You (2003)View image in fullscreenComic sparkle … Damon and Greg Kinnear as Bob and Walt Tenor.Photograph: 20 Century Fox/AllstarTeam America: World Police is a work of genius, but it is wide of the mark in presenting Damon as a humourless lobotomised hunk. His comic sparkle is crucial to the charm of the Farrelly brothers’ Stuck on You, in which he and Greg Kinnear play conjoined twins who work harmoniously together as ice-hockey goalkeepers and short-order cooks. All is well until Kinnear’s acting ambitions lead them to Hollywood. First stop: a porn movie called Pavlov’s Dong.15. Oppenheimer (2023)Gruffness and warmth combine beautifully in Damon’s portrayal of Gen Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project, who hires J RobertOppenheimer(Cillian Murphy) to beat the Nazis in building an atomic weapon. Informed that the chances of destroying the world are near-zero, and asked what more he wants, he shoots back: “Zero would be nice.”14. Saving Private Ryan (1998)View image in fullscreenWar blockbuster … Damon as James Francis Ryan.Photograph: Dreamworks/Paramount Pictures/AllstarDamon bagged the title role of the soldier who is made the target of a rescue mission after his brothers are killed in action during the second world war. He gets a delayed and memorably casual entrance: after all the huffing and puffing that has gone into finding him in the first half of the movie, he simply pops up out of the tall grass in a field.13. The Martian (2015)View image in fullscreenOut of this world … Matt Damon as Mark Watney.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarA third Oscar nomination for acting – after Good Will Hunting and Invictus – came Damon’s way for playing astronaut and botanist Mark Watney, who is left behind on Mars and assumed dead after his colleagues flee in a storm. As he establishes his survival plans, he keeps a sassy video diary (“In your face, Neil Armstrong!”), almost as if he knows he’s a movie character. This is intercut with scenes of the frantic Nasa team 140m miles away, which weaken the picture’s sense of isolation: what with all the cutaways to Earth, Watney never seems very alone.12. The Informant! (2009)Steven Soderbergh has given Damon a diverse array of roles – larking around in the Ocean’s trilogy, cosying up to Michael Douglas inBehind the Candelabra, even a cameo (termed “inexplicable” by Empire magazine) as a priest in Che: Part Two. But the pair have never made merry like they do in The Informant!, a farcical whistleblower yarn that deliberately punctures the gravitas of films like its near-namesake The Insider. As the deluded snitch, Damon’s doofus act is a scream.11. Good Will Hunting (1997)View image in fullscreenDopey drama … Minnie Driver and Matt Damon.Photograph: George Kraychyk/Miramax/ Kobal/Rex/  ShutterstockDespairing of their faltering acting careers, Damon and Ben Affleck wrote their own ticket to the big time – and won a screenwriting Oscar – with this dopey drama about an unsung genius (played by Damon at his brattiest and sexiest) toiling as a janitor at MIT. Producer Harvey Weinstein tried to foist hack directors on the pair but Damon stood his ground and demanded the indie auteur Gus Van Sant instead. “You’re a nobody!” raged Weinstein, aghast at the actor’s impertinence. “I’m a nobody,” replied Damon, “but I’m a nobody with director approval.” How did Weinstein likethemapples? Quite a lot, probably, once Good Will Hunting became one of Miramax’s most profitable releases.10. The Bourne Identity (2002)“I don’t know who I am. I don’t know where I’m going.” The confusion expressed by amnesiac assassin Jason Bourne could double as acri de coeurfrom Damon himself, who was all at sea after flops such as The Legend of Bagger Vance and All the Pretty Horses. Despite being so mired in reshoots that the gossip mill had it pegged as a disaster, the opening instalment in the Bourne action franchise became a slow-burning hit and did for Damon what The Matrix had done for Keanu Reeves. At this point, the series hadn’t properly developed a breakneck visual style to match the neck-breaking action – the final romantic reunion at a beachfront bar looks absurdly like an outtake from an old-school Bond movie – but Damon had found the ideal vehicle for his cultivated blankness.9. Interstellar (2014)When Damon pops up unannounced, it’s usually for comic effect: in the two most recent Thor movies, he is a stage actor playing in the plays-within-the-films, while Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back finds him selling out by making Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season. Not so inInterstellar, his first film for Christopher Nolan (after turning down the role of Two-Face in The Dark Knight). Damon is the baleful Dr Mann, who leads the Lazarus expedition through a wormhole to locate habitable planets, falsifies the data to suggest he has found one, settles down in cryostasis then tries to kill the astronaut who wakes him up. Rude!8. The Departed (2006)View image in fullscreenCrime pays … Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio as Colin Sullivan and Billy Costigan.Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarDamon is usually more interesting as a traitor than a faithful, and there are few roles on his CV more treacherous than Colin, the gangster going undercover as a cop in Martin Scorsese’s remake of the Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs. Leonardo DiCaprio is his opposite number, a cop infiltrating Boston’s organised crime gang, and both are tangled up with Vera Farmiga’s police psychiatrist. She gets to console Colin about his erectile dysfunction while he seethes quietly over breakfast. Other highlights include Colin’s porn-cinema confab with his boss (Jack Nicholson), who turns up brandishing a dildo.7. The Good Shepherd (2006)Robert De Niro executes this underrated CIA origin story with surgical precision. As Edward Wilson, a fictional spy recruited to the emergent agency straight from Yale, Damon’s civilised and even anonymous persona makes Wilson’s casual betrayals feel especially chilling. The misjudged casting of Eddie Redmayne, only 11 years Damon’s junior, makes it appear initially as though they are lovers rather than father and son. On the plus side, we get to see Damon in wig, dress and makeup for a college production of HMS Pinafore.6. Behind the Candelabra (2013)View image in fullscreenFrazzled insecurity … Damon as Scott Thorson.Photograph: HBO Films/courtesy Everett ColleSporting a Farrah Fawcett feather-cut, Damon plays Scott Thorson, who chauffeurs his bejewelled, fur-swaddled lover Liberace on stage in a cream Rolls-Royce. Michael Douglas nails the entertainer’s creosoted smarm, while Damon navigates Thorson’s descent from romantic bliss to frazzled insecurity in the decade between the couple meeting and Liberace’s death in 1987 from Aids-related illness. With sweaty humping and gruesome his’n’his cosmetic surgery, the director Steven Soderbergh spares no detail, though he might have been a touch less credulous in swallowing Thorson’s side of the story.5. The Bourne Supremacy (2004)It was this second Bourne adventure, with Paul Greengrass taking over from Bourne Identity director Doug Liman, that made the series the biggest influence on action cinema since the advent of the car chase (of which there is a fine example here, with Bourne gunning an increasingly battered yellow taxi through Moscow, demolition derby-style). Damon has never looked more at home than he does as the fugitive who has little memory of his time as a CIA assassin but has deduced from the way his erstwhile employers keep trying to kill him that a reference is out of the question. The addition of Joan Allen as one of his pursuers is inspired, and makes possible Bourne’s killer final line: “Get some rest, Pam. You look tired.”4. Gerry (2003)The only Matt Damon film to feature an end-credits shout-out to the Hungarian slow-cinema god Béla Tarr (who died this week), this bare-bones experiment about two friends, both called Gerry, lost in Death Valley, tests the patience, pushes the envelope and feeds the soul. Damon co-wrote the cryptic script with his co-star Casey Affleck and director Gus Van Sant. As the two Gerrys try, and repeatedly fail, to find their way back to their vehicle, this feels less like an existential Dude, Where’s My Car? and more like an extended desecration of Damon’s A-list status: his identity gradually blurs with Affleck’s, their faces charred and roasting under the sun. The scene in which Damon weeps solemnly from behind an improvised veil is among the finest in his career.3. The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)View image in fullscreenDiscomfort zone … Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Pamela Landy (Joan Allen).Photograph: Jasin Boland/Universal Studios“Jesus Christ. That’s Jason Bourne!” So gasps the CIA boss played by David Strathairn after watching a CCTV feed of Bourne (Damon) dispensing with five assailants in a stairwell at Waterloo Station. This threequel is thene plus ultraof the whole franchise – far superior to either the Damon-less spin-off The Bourne Legacy or his 2016 return in the drably titled Jason Bourne. Director Paul Greengrass expertly finesses his kinetic visual style; the whip-pans, crash-zooms and handheld shaky-cam hurl us into the hubbub. Damon looks supremely confident, having settled fully into his character’s discomfort zone.2. Margaret (2011)Arguably the best US film of the century so far, at least in its three-hour cut, Kenneth Lonergan’s kaleidoscopic portrait of post-9/11 New York hinges on a teenage firebrand, Lisa (Anna Paquin), whose involvement in a fatal bus accident intensifies her belief that she is the centre of the universe. In a flawless cast, which also includes Jeannie Berlin, Mark Ruffalo and the Succession duo of J Smith-Cameron and Kieran Culkin, Damon shows once again that he excels at being untrustworthy or morally compromised. He plays Lisa’s initially well-meaning teacher, who, flattered by her romantic interest in him, abandons his principles and sleeps with her (“You’re a fucking idiot,” he hisses at himself). The mute panic on his face when she later confronts him, all but naming him in front of a colleague as the father of her aborted child, proves that Damon gives good squirm.1. The Talented Mr Ripley (1999)View image in fullscreenPreppy charm … Damon as Tom Ripley.Photograph: Miramax/Sportsphoto/AllstarNo one ever mistook Matt Damon for Alain Delon. But then Anthony Minghella’s radical take on Patricia Highsmith’s Ripley thrillers is as distinct from Plein Soleil as the sun is from the moon. This version of Tom Ripley is preppy, even buffoonish. Leeching on to caddish playboy Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) in sun-splashed 1950s Italy, he is no calculating psychopath but a square who stumbles into murder as rashly as he spins his innocuous fibs. So much of the film seems to reflect Damon’s struggle to establish a vivid identity. Among the first words he speaks is a lament: “If I could rub everything out, starting with myself …” Other lines seem to comment on his persona. “You’re so white,” marvels Dickie on the beach, then amends it to: “Grey, actually.” Later, he provokes Tom to violence by taunting him about how boring he is. It’s like watching the actor’s own insecurities amplified. But his nervy performance shows definitively that blandness is his camouflage. The critic Manohla Dargis noted a smile “designed to hide something sinister, frightening, deadly”. Talented indeed.The Rip is out 16 January on Netflix; The Odyssey is released 17 JulyExplore more on these topicsRankedMatt DamonContagionOppenheimerSaving Private RyanThe MartianThe Bourne SupremacyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What is certain is that this latest Schubert recording, following on from his release of the late sonatas late in 2022, reveals a rewardingly mature, un-egotistical approach to the eight Impromptus, some of the composer’s most profound music.View image in fullscreenArtwork for Schubert: Impromptus, Op 90 – Eric Lu.Photograph: Warner ClassicsLu is very much attuned to the way in which Schubert creates overarching structures, conjuring a mesmerising feeling of stasis with music that’s alive with detail under the surface – in his performances of several of them, time really does seem to stand still. Right from the lonely opening of Op 90 No 1, he draws the ear in with the scope of his phrasing: even though his playing can be weightier than some, his lines go on and on into the distance and corners are smoothly turned, with the dramatic passages growing out of what has come before. Perhaps these performances aren’t yet quite distinctive enough to make this recording top choice in a crowded field, but they certainly back up the Chopin judges’ decision: Lu is a serious talent.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

This Dantean journey through fungal hell is riveting – though frogs may disagreeCatherine SlessorThu 8 Jan 2026 09.03 ESTLast modified on Thu 8 Jan 2026 12.56 ESTShareSylvia Plath’s poem Mushrooms is a sinister paean to the natural world. Her observations on fungi are freighted with foreboding, noting how “very / Whitely, discreetly, / Very quietly” they “Take hold on the loam, / Acquire the air”. The poem ends: “We shall by morning, / Inherit the earth. / Our foot’s in the door.”Plath’s ominous ode from 1959 forms the opening salvo in an exhibition dedicated to fungi’s creepy omniscience. Far from merely getting a foot in the door, the door has been blasted off its hinges by fungi’s preternatural capacity to reproduce, spread, evolve – and annihilate. How they thrive with a perverse intensity on discarded, dead and dying things, impelling the cycle of decay and regrowth. As coprophiliacs, necrophiliacs and silent assassins, they are legion, and have been around for over a billion years.They crawl into hospital beds – and from there into our lungsFeaturing installations, films and soundscapes confected by a range of artists,Fungi: Anarchist Designersis a Dantean journey through the many circles of fungal hell, contrived to convey their terrifying ubiquity and resilience. A timelapse film of the aptly named basket stinkhorn, burgeoning from fleshy phallus into a perforated umbrella, sets the tone. The stinkhorn emits the smell of rotting flesh to attract flies, which feast on it and disperse its spores.“Fungi refuse the commands of human masters and to abide by human standards of propriety,” say the exhibition’s curators, anthropologist Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing and architect and artistFeifei Zhou. “They latch on to our worst habits, turning industrial trade into continent killing machines. They leap into commercial agriculture, wiping out vast fields. They crawl into hospital beds and from there into our lungs. We cannot ignore them.”View image in fullscreenNinety extinctions and counting … the tombstone for frog species.Photograph: Aad HoogendoornThe exhibition is not about fungi’s increasing role as a passive building material or product, exemplified by the rise of mycelium panels. Instead, its focus is on “anti-design”, highlighting their role as “co-designers of the world”, outwitting it and bending it to their will.From the sea to the stratosphere, fungi’s domain is vast. Taxonomically, it encompasses more than two million organisms, from microscopic yeasts, moulds and mildews to lichens and mushrooms, some laced with psychotropic properties or lethal toxins. Amanita phalloides, or death cap, is the principal culprit in most human deaths from mushroom poisoning, including the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. Now globally established, through the cultivation of non-native tree species, the prevalence of the death cap illustrates the unintended consequences of humans tampering with nature.Fungi thrive on our venality and shortsightedness. Monocultural forests and crop plantations, reductively cultivated for profit, are grist to their mill. The genetic sameness of industrially farmed commodities such as sweetcorn, bananas and coffee makes them especially vulnerable to fungal attack. Capable of ripping through conifer plantations, heterobasidion root rot is one of the most feared diseases. Its balefully destructive impact is crystallised in a multimedia installation by forest pathologist Matteo Garbelotto and artistKyriaki Goni, entitled: “We shall by morning, inherit the earth” after Plath’s chilling poem.View image in fullscreen‘We cannot ignore them’ … Fungi: Anarchist Designers.Photograph: Aad HoogendoornPlants and trees are not the only victims of fungi’s advances. A giant “tombstone” is inscribed with the names of assorted frog species rendered extinct by a microscopic fungus. Accompanying it is a magnified image of a fungal tube piercing the skin of a corroboree frog. It might look innocuous, but, to date,more than 90 amphibian species have been wiped outand many are still endangered.Aficionados ofThe Last of Uswill be familiar with how humanity has been reduced to mushroom-headed monstrosities through the cordyceps virus, based on an all too real type of parasitic fungus that infects insects, controls their brains, and then erupts from the host’s corpse as fungal stalks to spread its spores, an exquisitely horrific conjunction of death and sex.Humans are, indeed, susceptible to fungal infections, mainly of the prosaic kind that favour warm, moist crevices and a lack of personal hygiene. But more sinister invaders are always lurking. A mock-up of a hospital bed bay forms an impromptu shrine to the multi drug-resistant candida auris, which spreads through hospitals and can be deadly, killing as many as one in three patients who contact it.Yet fungi’s nihilistic propensities are underscored by a curiously compelling beauty. Historic architectural drawings from the Nieuwe Instituut’s archive are shown floridly mottled with fungal discoloration, like Rorschach inkblots, while Japanese artist Hajime Imamura creates “mycelial sculptures” as thin, intertwined coils, draped probingly across a ceiling.View image in fullscreenHajime Imamura’s ‘mycelial sculptures’ in Fungi: Anarchist Designers.Photograph: Aad HoogendoornLizan Freijsen’s “tufted floor objects” (ie rugs) resemble patches of dry rot, a fungus that thrives in damp houses and wooden ships. Originally, it was confined to a corner of the Himalayas, but has since made its way around the world through the conduits of colonial trade. Michael Poulsen’s towering, stalagmite-like model of a termite mound spotlights the symbiosis between fungi and termites; the fungi break down plant cell walls to provide food for the insects.After Hiroshima was obliterated by an atomic bomb, one of the first living things to emerge from the devastated landscape was the matsutake mushroom, traditionally fetishised by the Japanese as a gourmet delicacy. Shiho Satsuka and Liu Yi’s lyrical animated film illuminates the relationship between the matsutake and Japanese pine forests, showing how fungi can make places habitable for trees in terrain disturbed by the impact of people, earthquakes or war.Actual living fungi make an appearance in “architecture must rot”, an installation exploring how materials – in this case, plywood cocoons in sealed terraria – are broken down and transfigured by fungal growth. In re-imagining decay as a positive, ecologically beneficial mechanism, it questions the fiction of architecture’s physical permanence (in reality, all buildings have finite lifespans) and how fungi might mediate processes of transformation and regeneration.The Dantean journey culminates in a corridor of manifestos urging us to rethink how we live with the more-than-human world, and to envisage futures shaped by negotiation and interdependence. Enlivened by a wealth of detail, most of it deliciously disquieting, this atmospheric and engrossing exhibition ensures you’ll never look at a mushroom in the same way again.

Now back with an adventurous new album, he talks about the man who stole his identity and why he doesn’t care for ‘good taste’Thu 8 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTShareAfew years ago, a stranger stole Sébastien Tellier’s identity. The impostor – sporting the musician’s trademark sunglasses and beard – posed as the Frenchman at fancy parties, nabbed free clothes from Chanel (Tellier used to be an ambassador for the brand), and even held meetings with bosses from Hollywood studios (Tellier has dabbled in soundtrack work). “He [also] took a lot of drugs like ketamine in front of a lot of people,” Tellier continues with perfect nonchalance from his Paris home, sunglasses and beard present and correct. The crime was only rumbled when a confused woman got in touch to tell him she’d been partying with “Sébastien Tellier” in France only to see on Instagram that the real Tellier was playing a gig in Belgium.This experience has been alchemised into pop gold via Copycat, a sparkly synthpop workout on his upcoming eighth album, Kiss the Beast. “My name you steal it / Hat and success,” Tellier croons for the song’s chorus over a chunky bassline, disco strings and synths that crackle and spark like fireworks. It’s typical Tellier, mixing the serious – things got so bad with the impostor that Tellier was briefly forced to show his passport at the school gates when collecting his two small children – with the playfully naive.It’s a trait he’s employed throughout his career, be it pairing the majestic, Tony Allen-assisted dreamscape La Ritournelle, a “pop classic” according to friend Nicolas Godin of Air, with a song called Ketchup vs Genocide on 2004’s Politics; or, four years later, performing his sleek Beach Boys-meets-electropop single Divine, co-produced by Daft Punk legend Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, at Eurovision. It’s hard to imagine anyone else associated with the ultra-cool French touch scene going near the derided song contest, let alone arriving on its stage via a small golf cart.View image in fullscreenSébastien Tellier at the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games opening ceremony.Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty“I don’t want to be the slave of good taste,” he says, a plume of cigarette smoke haloing him as he holds his phone under his chin.“To be just Eurovision, it’s a nightmare,” he continues. “But to be just [fancy Parisian hotel] Plaza Athénée, it’s a nightmare also. Sometimes it’s super-good to have just a burger.”The title and artwork for Kiss the Beast, the latter shot by revered French fashion photographer Jean-Baptiste Mondino, may explore Tellier’s “paradox and deep duality” but musically it also features comical snatches of sheep baaing (on Mouton), while the lounge jazz of Loup (or “wolf’) is constantly disrupted by bursts of frantic electronic wig-outs. It’s about balance, Tellier thinks: “You know, it’s very important to feel comfortable with all the aspects of life.”My favourite album when I was 20 was Rock Bottom by Robert Wyatt. In my 50s, I really love to listen to Lionel Richie or Barbra StreisandLast year Tellier turned 50, a milestone age that seemed to unlock something in him. Aware that “the rest of the way before death is not so long”, he wanted this album to reach a bigger audience. Hence why Kiss the Beast features collaborations with the likes of Nile Rodgers and Kid Cudi, plus production input from Oscar Holter, the Max Martin affiliate whose bulging pop CV includes Blinding Lights by the Weeknd. Holter’s presence feels like an interesting mainstream move for an artist seemingly happy on the periphery of pop, I suggest to Tellier.“It’s hard to explain, but in a way I want to respect my age,” he says. “My favourite album when I was 20 was Rock Bottom by Robert Wyatt. You know, this kind of ‘I’m a crazy guy, I feel bad, I hate the world’.” He sucks deeply on his second cigarette of our time so far. “But step by step, in my 50s, now I really love to listen to Lionel Richie, or Barbra Streisand.”Tellier’s early love for Wyatt mirrored his mindset growing up in the “tough” area of Cergy-Pontoise, north-west of Paris. “I was afraid to see bad guys. I was afraid on the bus. I was afraid at the train station and all this shit,” he says, getting up and pacing around his house. A newly built city, Cergy-Pontoise offered only a concrete life. “So no culture, no soul. I was very sad. If you are in the city but near the sea, for example, you can dream with the sea. But in this new city, in the far suburbs of Paris, there were no mountains, no beautiful river, no ocean, nothing like that.”He says it felt like only he and his father listened to music, cutting them off as this strange little “island of culture”. After he moved out, into his first “shitty” apartment in Paris, he started to make his own music on a four-track recorder. He was also drinking heavily. “I had a very kind of savage life,” he says. “I partied a lot and I didn’t take care of myself at all.” One night, all that changed after he saw the music video for Air’s Kelly Watch the Stars on TV. “I felt a connection between me and their music,” he explains. “Like pop, electro, and at the same time international, but French.”Noticing that the name of Air’s then-label, Source, was shown on the screen, a few days later Tellier took his demo tape to their offices. After a short meeting, his dark-hued instrumental Fantino was added to a compilation the label was releasing, nestled alongside Phoenix and various other “cool French dudes”. Shortly after that, Air launched their own label, Record Makers, and signed Tellier. He would also support them on tour in 2001. “We played almost 2,200 times,” he says, still in awe. “This part of my life was really important because with them I discovered the world and with them I escaped my old, sad world.”View image in fullscreenSébastien Tellier in his golf cart at the 2008 Eurovision song contest final.Photograph: Andrej Isaković/AFP/Getty ImagesAcross a career that’s now spanned a quarter of a century, he’s never looked back, playfully crisscrossing genres and exploring concepts. He’s keen to clarify the latter. “Not ‘It’s a concept, oh, that will be boring,’” he smiles. “No, no, no. For me, it’s very important to bring some glamour to my concepts, because just concept, it’s too boring. Conceptual movie, conceptual everything, it’s boring!” On 2012’s My God Is Blue, for example, he mused on religion dressed like a cult leader, while 2020’s Domesticated – its title suggested by his friend, the movie director Sofia Coppola – celebrated his life with his wife, Amandine Martinon de La Richardière, and children via the prism of songs such as the hypnotic sci-fi opus Domestic Tasks.His biggest WTF moment remains that Eurovision performance, however. Not that Tellier feels any shame. He knew he wasn’t going to win (he finished 19th) and only did it because “a lot of people watch the TV show”. If anything, he wanted his performance to be weirder; his initial plan was to drive his golf cart straight off the stage.The 20 greatest French touch tracks – ranked!Read more“I had the opportunity to create something huge like an accident at the Eurovision. I thought: ‘I will be so famous with this crash that it will be great in front of millions and millions of people.’” Unsurprisingly, it was deemed too dangerous by the show’s producers. Instead, he arrived in the golf cart carrying an inflatable globe full of helium which he duly inhaled. “But nobody noticed; it was not visual enough,” he says. “Nobody saw it. Nobody talked about it.”It’s that disconnect between idea and execution, artist and audience, that Tellier can’t stand. I ask him if he agrees with Godin’s appraisal of La Ritournelle, a song that has soundtracked everything from sports montages to a L’Oréal advert to an episode of Come Dine With Me, and – at 63m plays on Spotify alone – his biggest streaming hit by far. “Yes, [it is a classic] in a way, because it’s an important song for a lot of people,” he says, briefly switching nicotine for caffeine. “They play this song at weddings, or at funerals. You know, for important moments in life. So it has a special place in the heart of the audience.”Creating a bridge to them is what he’s always tried to do. Only now it’s being done via big pop songs about impostors, wolves and sheep.Kiss the Beast is out30 January; Tellier playsKoko, London, 23 March.Explore more on these topicsMusicDance musicElectronic musicinterviewsShareReuse this content"

But in full, Girl Taken, like the 2016 book Baby Doll by Hollie Overton on which it is based, is something much better. It takes the neglected parts of such stories – the sadder, quieter, far less titillating and voyeuristic aspects of what it means to take a person out of her home, her world and her life, and away from those of the people who love her – and fleshes all that out instead. It makes for a slower burn, but a much more deeply engaging and psychologically complex thriller than we customarily expect from such a setup, and – in asking what it really means to survive an act of profound violence – harrowing in a more valuable way.Lily and Abby (played with depth and delicacy by Tallulah and Delphi Evans) are twin 17-year-olds, on the cusp of – well, everything really, as you are when you are happy teenage girls. We meet them on the last day of the summer term. Lily is set to enjoy the summer with her lovely boyfriend Wes (Levi Brown, who was so extraordinary in 2024’s This Town) and partying, and Abby is laying plans to go to university. She is the star pupil in Mr Hansen’s English class (“You can start calling me Rick now” he says as the final school bell goes) and the popular young teacher has always encouraged her ambitions.View image in fullscreen‘Played with depth and delicacy’ … Tallulah Evans as Lily in Girl Taken on Paramount+.Photograph: Clapperboard TV/Paramount + Paramount GlobalGirl Taken is a lean but unhurried six-parter and takes time to build the girls’ world in enough detail that we feel the pain when one of them is wrenched out of it by the will of one man. In the first of many upendings of expectations, Rick (Alfie Allen, in a fantastic and – given how much he clearly relishes the meaty role – fantastically restrained performance) abducts Lily. In one of several improving changes to the book (and it’s a good book), the message is that a predator does not need a connection to an individual; any momentarily vulnerable young girl will do. This adds a slightly different gloss from usual to the question of motivation and places the blame for his action more assertively on the perpetrator than usual, however much he tries to muddy the waters later on.Rick’s sexual and other violence against Lily takes place almost entirely off screen. We focus instead on the guilt consuming Abby (whose argument with Lily is what led her to be walking home alone and – it is surmised – taken by a stranger somewhere along the way) and the flailing despair of their mother, Eve (Jill Halfpenny, bringing her all to an underwritten part). In keeping with the unsensationalised mood of the drama, the refuge Eve takes in drink results in a functional rather than histrionic alcoholism and is all the sadder and more credible for that.View image in fullscreen‘We feel the pain’ … Delphi Evans as Abby, Tallulah Evans as Lily and Jill Halfpenny as Eve in Girl Taken on Paramount+.Photograph: Paramount + Paramount GlobalWe see Rick insinuating himself into the search for Lily and, in later years, keeping in touch with the family, who are grateful for his support as the rest of the town and the media move on. There is a fine depiction of the coercive control Rick exerts over his wife that again works against the idea, as a lesser thriller would have it, that such sadistic monsters hide their true selves from everyone, that they exist as outliers, eruptions of pure evil rather than as points on a continuum.It is no spoiler to say that Lily escapes. The second half of the series has her recovery – such as it is, such as it can be – and that of her family at the forefront, and the damage that a perpetrator can continue to inflict even from behind bars when he knows how to work the justice system to his advantage. The fight for legal justice is interwoven with the fight of the family to accept what has happened to Lily and to the rest of them while she was away, and to construct a new normal that will allow them to move on, one day, in relative peace. There are enough twists and reveals as the episodes unfurl to let the show retain its thriller title, but Girl Taken gives a lot more than that.Girl Taken is on Paramount+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Another woman arrives home bloodied, gasping with fear and for wine, and starts scrubbing her hands before clearing her flat of – well, everything.A female voiceover intones that there are two sides to every story. “Which means someone is always lying.” Absolute nonsense, obviously, but it sounds great and more importantly it confirms what we were hoping: that we are in the presence of a glossy, efficient adaptation of a bestselling thriller and it is time to switch off our brains and enjoy (unless you are the type who likes to try to solve the mystery before the characters do, in which case, Godspeed and let me know where you get the energy from).This particular piece of glossy efficiency is His & Hers, a six-part adaptation of Alice Feeney’s 2020 bestseller of the same name (there are two more in the works – Sometimes I Lie and Rock Paper Scissors), produced by Jessica Chastain and boasting a fine array of actors in the main parts.Jon Bernthal (The Bear, We Own This City and, for those whose memories stretch this far back, an early and much lamented loss to The Walking Dead) plays small-town detective Jack Harper, in charge of the investigation into the murder.Tessa Thompson(Westworld, Creed) is Anna, a steely former TV news anchor who gets an early sniff of the case, which has occurred in her old home town, and is keen to secure the scoop to restore her status at the station. Her position was taken by a younger, blonder rival while she was mourning the loss of her child. But we are not in the business of exploring unfathomable grief here, simply of providing motivation and narrative propulsion. So we do not dwell on sorrow but enjoy Anna taking the rival’s husband, Richard (Pablo Schreiber), with her as her cameraman and, once she has undermined his marriage and obliquely challenged his masculinity (invisible next to your celebrity wife earning five times your salary, aren’t you?), her after-hours entertainment. Anna is also the woman we saw returning panting and covered in claret at the top of the show.View image in fullscreenUnder suspicion … Jon Bernthal as Jack Harper.Photograph: NetflixThe next revelation is that Jack and Anna are estranged husband and wife. Though not estranged enough for him to be fine with the fact that she is banging the cameraman. The dead woman – I may as well fill you in on everything while I’ve got you – is Rachel Hopkins (Jamie Tisdale, Isabelle Kusman as a teen), who by all accounts, including Anna’s, was the meanest of mean girls growing up (we get a flashback scene of Anna, who was in her clique at school, watching her trick someone into drinking a glass of urine) and didn’t massively improve thereafter.Suspects accrue accordingly – including Anna. And, soon afterwards, Jack – who sure does not want to give the cheek swab required of all the officers who dealt with the discovery of Rachel’s body, so as to eliminate them from inquiries. There’s also Rachel’s cuckolded husband, Clyde (Chris Bauer, a veteran character actor rightly hired here, I suspect, for his ability to deliver a line like “She had a mercenary energy that I found intoxicating” without bringing the whole teetering edifice down), plus an unspecified number of cuckolders. And unless the girl who drank urine has moved away, I’d put her on the list, too.Further complications and potential plot lines include other girls from the clique, Jack’s alcoholic sister Zoe (Marin Ireland) and Anna’s ageing mother – neglected by her, still cared for by Jack – who is losing her grip on reality but whose porous memory I would bet still retains a vital clue or two about secrets long thought buried. The use of dementia as an acceptable form of deus ex machina in thrillers is something I would like to put in a complaint about, but I’m not sure to whom. I should wait and find out whether His & Hers is actually guilty of it first, I suppose.The twists, they are plentiful. The absurdities, they multiply. The viewerly enjoyment, it increases. The script – intoxicating mercenariness aside – is serviceable. The endeavour is bingeable. Nobody needs more, this early in the year.

Shortly after losing his job as a bathroom salesman, he learns that he and his girlfriend Harriet are being evicted from their flat. Can life get any worse? Apparently, it can. Matt finds a note from Harriet saying she has left him and that he shouldn’t contact her. But then he receives a call from a stranger offering him a job that comes with a luxury apartment, leading him to wonder if his fortunes are turning.Perhaps Harriet will come back if she knows they have a fancy new home. The third mystery novel from comedianBob Mortimercomes with his trademark quirky touches including a talking animal in the form of Matt’s cat, Goodmonson, and whimsical metaphors; for Matt, trying to place a familiar face is akin to “trying to find a mouse’s handbag in a builder’s skip”.The narrative is built around the alternating viewpoints of Matt, Harriet and their neighbour Carol, a sharp-tongued divorcee. While Mortimer reads Matt’s chapters, Arabella Weir gives voice to Carol, whose liking for a younger man frequently lands her in trouble. Harriet, who we soon discover hasn’t left Matt at all but has been the victim of a crime, is read by Diane Morgan, whose delivery is as drily funny as you’d expect from the star of Philomena Cunk.

In the 30 years since I was a student of that benign, pipe-smoking, elbow-patched man of letters Malcolm Bradbury, the private language of creative writing workshops has taken over the world.What writers used to say to small circles of students in an attempt to help them improve their storytelling technique has become a familiar way, often parodic and self-knowing, of interpreting the grand and not-so‑grand narratives of our time. “Don’t worry about Liz Truss’s YouTube series – she’s just having a main character moment.”The most intense distillation of this system of thought (if you can even call it that) has always been the craft book, the writing manual. These are sometimes written by the most successful in the profession (like Ursula K Le Guin’s Steering the Craft) or the most successful at advising the profession (Robert McKee’s Story) but most often they are put together by novelists and screenwriters towards the close of their academic careers as creative writing tutors. John Gardner’s The Art of Fiction is the grandaddy of this subgenre.With A Long Game, Elizabeth McCrackenhas come pretty late to the party. And she’s determined to liven things up. For a start, she does not agree with craft books, either their sentiments or their usual tone: “chipper, cheerleaderish, generally with an encouraging second-person narrator meant to make the whole exhausting process of writing a book seem possible”. It’s obvious she’s thinking of such motivational titles as Walter Mosley’s This Year You Write Your Novel.We know from her big entrance – sentence one, page one – that McCracken, novelist, memoirist and former tutor at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, is going to cause more than a few cocktails to be spat out or spilled. “Nobody knows how to write a book,” is how she starts. “I don’t like craft books. It’s possible that I’ve never read one through.” She proceeds to demonstrate how she has more than a few thoughts on the cosy consensus that preceded her. She’s a self-confessedly epigrammatic writer, and her quips yearn to be underlined: “To feel ashamed about writing isn’t interesting, but writing about shame is fascinating.”In this, she’s not your usual wise old literary hand. Instead, she is naughty, perverse, quietly exhibitionist and bracingly unashamed. She reminds me of the teenage older sister of one of my best friends at school. She lived in a world I didn’t. She behaved or misbehaved just as she chose; and sometimes she did the wrong thing, the bad thing, because it was more interesting.McCracken’s is the naughty older sister view of writing. And I agree with it. Writing isn’t about compiling a list of rules and then obeying them. If it were that, then none of the really great writers I’ve ever read would have been interested in it. Not for half a day. Writing is a form of sustained mischievous truancy. It’s not about being good.This attitude will be amazingly freeing for many rule-haunted writers. If you are being poisoned by a particularly cliched piece of workshop feedback, “Show, don’t tell” or “Write what you know”, McCracken will supply an antidote. It will be intense, distilled from experience, and the inoculation may cause you pain. But afterwards, you’ll stop sweating and shivering, and get on with living. Here McCracken is on that most hated and hackneyed piece of advice, “Write every day”: “Every-day writers have a clear answer to the question,How will you get your work done?Me, I harness the power of my own self-loathing.”Not your usual piece of creative writing workshop advice, but true to the particular insanity of this scribbled life.A Long Game: How to Write Fiction by Elizabeth McCracken is published by Jonathan Cape (£14.99).

A sleazy banana-republic dictator flooding the American streets with blow. The over-the-border Delta Force extraction squad sent to pluck this schmo out of his impregnable fortress. The bronzed tough-talker who’s firing an RPG up the tailpipe of the international rules-based order – but who gets the job done. Call it: Caracas Thunder.Sounds like a bit of a throwback, you might be thinking. But, judging by his press conference after the US military’s abduction of Venezuelan presidentNicolás Maduro, Donald Trump seemed to have finally achieved his dream of directing his own 80s action movie.View image in fullscreen‘An incredible, fantastic movie’ … Jean-Claude Van Damme and Bolo Yeung in Bloodsport.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyTrump packed in the important tropes. It had been “dark and deadly” out there in the field – but American kickassery prevailed easily. Why settle for just one staple 80s action bogeymen – the tinpot authoritarian (Commando;Missing in Action) or the cartel kingpin (Lethal Weapon;Cobra) – when Maduro, now perp-walking for global audiences, could double up as both? And we never knew it, but it turns out Operation Absolute Resolve is part of a franchise brought to you by Donald J Trump Productions: “We’ve done some other good ones, like the attacks on Soleimani and al-Baghdadi, and the obliteration and decimation of the Iran nuclear sites,” the US president pointed out.His incontinent blatherings don’t exactly exit with the hollow-point devastation of a Schwarzenegger quipGiven that Trump rose to full prominence during the ego joyride of the 1980s, it’s no shock that his foreign policy is donning its headband and emulating that decade’s belligerent cinema. Led by Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Chuck Norris and assorted lesser beefcakes, 80s action films were about buffing America’s self-image again after the national debacle of Vietnam (and the depressing corps of movies on that subject). The likes of Commando, the Rambo sequels and Missing in Action made unilateralism literal: a lone meathead serving American righteousness (if sometimes with an Austrian accent) to hordes of anonymous foreign goons, garnishing the mayhem with a killer payoff line when vanquishing the demonised bad guy.View image in fullscreenPresident Trump watches the arrest of Maduro from Palm Beach.Photograph: The White House/UPI/ShutterstockWith Maga Republicanism now pushing this cartoonish worldview to even more steroidal extremes, Trump is reverting to the natural frame of reference with which to package up his adventurism in digestible, memeable form. He’s hardly the first politician to lean on pop culture: after the Iran hostage crisis, Ronald Reagan once said he could take some pointers from Rambo about how to handle another such incident. But the current president trumps him for shamelessness:he has literally tweeted a picture of himself as Rocky.We’re long past irony of course. But is Trump, in customising his own 80s action flick, sincerely living out his own inner fantasies? Intel on his actual movie tastes is scant. He trotted out a placeholder set of five classics in a2012 Movieline article: Citizen Kane, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Gone with the Wind, Goodfellas and The Godfather. Last year, he was reportedly pushing for Paramountto make another Rush Hour film– though it’s not clear if it’s the franchise, or being seen as a media arbitrator, that excites him most.Step aside Thelma Schoonmaker; Trump has also apprised us of his scalpel-like use of the remote control when watching films, fast-forwarding past the boring bits to pare them down to 45 minutes max. So when he lauds Jean-Claude Van Damme’s lean, mean Bloodsportas an “incredible, fantastic movie”, it seems more in keeping with that impatience. With the film firmly part of the 80s knucklehead canon, maybe Trump watches the scene in which JCVD’s army captain/ninja does the splits tonutshot an opponentand sees a blinding metaphor for what he’s doing to the Democrat party.The would-be Badass-in-Chief still has work to do to live up to 80s style, though. His incontinent blatherings on Truth Social and on the mic don’t exactly exit with the hollow-point devastation of a Schwarzenegger quip. Probably to the satisfaction of the Austrian Oak – who actually has weathered into a fair approximation of a respectable elder.View image in fullscreenSylvester Stallone, Trump and Melania Trump at the Kennedy Center honours on 23 December 2025.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty ImagesIn fact, the angry, inflamed undertone to Trump’s politics and his base correspond more to the Stallone school (Sly now of course being one of the president’s “special envoys” to Hollywood). Reagan was right: there was a lesson in Rambo, at least the first one. That embittered, self-pitying outsiderdom was an ingrained national trait, and that the inverse of the heroic avenger was the loony apocalypse prepper, the lone gunman. Ronald would know: in March 1981, he was wounded by a failed Texan singer-songwriter inspired by Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver. And Trump, missing assassination by an earlobe’s width in July 2024, has had his own taste.Wuthering Heights, Michael Jackson and the ‘Trump effect’ – will 2026 see the end of the ‘woke’ blockbuster?Read moreSo perhaps the president isn’t starring in the movie he thinks he is. It wouldn’t exactly be news to out him as the villain. Maybe the Trump years are actually best seen as a supercharged return to 70s cinema, with its reverberating sleaze, corruption and paranoia. Venezuela as a distraction from Epstein tops anything in All the President’s Men or The Parallax View. Let alone, for the ultra-conspiracy heads, Trump as Putin’s sleeper agent in the control room of fortress America;the ultimate Manchurian Candidate. But who cares what us libtards think, when Trump, tuning into the live feed of the Caracas raid, could lap up his own private action blow-out: “You might never get to see it, but it was an incredible thing to see.” And now of course Greenland is on his radar.

The originalGreenlandwasn’t even a traditional hit; it was released in theaters and on VOD at the end of 2020, when plenty of cinemas remained closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but it garnered some attention for being an unusually sober and thoughtful apocalypse movie, especially given that Butler previously starred in the likes of Geostorm. Because Greenland was about surviving a global apocalypse rather than averting one, any sequel would have to venture into the unknown with a drastically different status quo.We Bury the Dead review – Daisy Ridley tackles the undead in solid zombie twistRead moreGreenland 2 obliges for a little while, though it also walks back some of the hope that ended the first film. The story rejoins engineer John Garrity (Gerard Butler), his administrator wife Allison (Morena Baccarin) and their now-teenage son Nathan (recast as Roman Griffin Davis) as residents of a Greenland bunker. They’re lucky to have been government-selected for entry when the Earth was rendered largely uninhabitable by comet fragments five years earlier; they’re also chafing at the loss of freedom, tough decisions and overall claustrophobia that comes with cohabitating underground with hundreds of others. (Curiously, none of them seem to have made many friends despite the close quarters.)The survivors are still down there because it turns out that the clearing of air mentioned at the end of the first film is spottier than they thought. John repeatedly ventures outside the bunker, but only with proper gear and to forage for additional resources. He also frets about a restless Nathan putting himself at risk to explore the greater world. This conflict is mooted when a series of earthquakes destroy the bunker once and for all. A small group of survivors, including the Garrity family, therefore sets out to find a rumored crater that supposedly features a large pocket of breathable air, located somewhere in France. In this case, the grass is always greener on the other side of the English Channel.This country-hopping mission lends Greenland 2 somewhat greater scope than its predecessor, even as it essentially recreates its central dynamic of John Garrity assembling a piecemeal, largely improvised path to potential safety for his family. This time, the environmental countdown clock is a little less firm – the worst of the comet’s fragments have long since smashed into the planet, but smaller fragments, radiation storms and the occasional tidal waves still abound at irregular intervals – while some added health issues try to make up for any diminished urgency.Frequent Butler director Ric Roman Waugh – this is their fourth film together, and the first of two January movies Waugh has on deck, with a Jason Statham vehicle up next – keeps the action moving, if not always especially exciting. The most directly nerve-wracking set pieces are also some of the most ridiculous, as when the family traverses a dried-up English Channel only to find themselves at the mercy of a comically rickety series of barely-there bridges. The budget seams show when wide shots paint compelling scenes of a post-apocalyptic landscape, and then the close-ups mostly involve wobbly ladders or dimly lit exchanges of gunfire.Moreover, though, this sequel doubles down on its predecessor’s earnestness, to the point of alternating between grimly offing side characters at random and then getting all maudlin about its own pitilessness. Fair enough that a post-apocalyptic story will be suffused with some sadness; the problem is, Waugh has a grasping, indelicate way with human drama that doesn’t do his star in any favors. Butler has relaxed into a dependably rumpled middle-aged presence, especially when he’s allowed to use his Scottish accent. But he veers toward good-dad bathos here.He and Waugh seem desperate to turn this 98-minute adventure into a periodic funeral dirge, all while ignoring any realities that might uncomfortably echo our own world. Initially, Greenland 2 recalls and expands on the original’s accidental status as a Covid movie, with its masking gear and justified paranoia over the radiation sickness people might contract without it. Little comes of this, though, beyond using a radiation-detecting device to assure the characters that they don’t actually need the masks after a certain point in their journey. (No need to watch masked actors, of course, but that’s also the moment when it feels like the series abandons any sense of contemporary connection.) Greenland 2: Migration takes itself seriously in all the wrong ways; it wants to maintain a safe distance from the real world, while urging the audience to shed a tear over some imagined nobility.Greenland 2: Migration is out in US cinemas on 9 January and in the UK and Australia soonExplore more on these topicsGerard ButlerAction and adventure filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s ostensibly a label, where each EP has a different named artist, and each sleeve, designed by Nick Almquist, features a different abstract expressionist monochrome doodle. But all the tracks are numbered, not named, and each EP is actually the work of just one producer, Izaak Schlossman (credited as IS), joined by a changing cast of collaborators.The music also seems to dart into the mist, not just resisting genre classification, but actually seeming to evaporate as it plays. The most obvious comparison is the microhouse scene of the early 00s, in which artists such as Vladislav Delay, Isolée and Ricardo Villalobos made softly bumping tracks with the same level of playful sonic detail you might hear in a rainforest. False Aralia tracks also have a strong dub techno flavour thanks to all the mournful hazy chords, and a track like 01 by Externalism has a skanking, loping dub rhythm, but there are none of techno’s steady four-four beats. The closest Schlossman comes is on the almost Kraftwerkian Iri.gram EP, or 03 by Borgesian Term, a finely engineered groove built from live drums, heavily warped vocals and ASMR-triggering, cochlea-tickling sound design.Vocalist Anya Prisk features on four releases, her voice so heavily treated it becomes another synthetic sonic gesture, though Schlossman’s one concession to straight songcraft, Vehicular’s stunning 01 (sung by Lucas Deleon), is like chillout music for a genuinely frigid poolside in an off-season holiday resort. False Aralia tracks seem to fold over the corners of reality with the delicacy of an origami expert, letting you peek into a soft-focus alternate world.Ben Beaumont-ThomasThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenFrances Chang.Photograph: Linnea NugentFrances Chang – I Can Feel the WavesAhead of supporting Cate Le Bon in the US, the New Yorker unleashes a gorgeous loosie, reminiscent of a more domesticated take on Astrid Sonne’s off-kilter piano and conversational musings.Robyn – SexistentialRobyn defies André 3000 saying no one would want to hear him rap about his colonoscopy with her own deliriously brash rap about the carnal rearrangements of dating while doing solo IVF.Bonnie “Prince” Billy – They Keep Trying to Find YouOn a comeback as lovely – spare and sunlit – as it is sinister, Will Oldham sings a tribute to someone who’d do anything, even “allowing isolation to fully derange”, to remain hidden.A$AP Rocky – Punk RockyRocky’s crying in his truck, drowning his sorrows and trying to write love songs even though he hates them, to a swirly psychedelic haze that threatens to drag you with him into the mire.Peter Gabriel – Been UndoneAs he did in 2023, Peter Gabriel will release a new single every full moon this year: the steady Been Undone is an affecting look at human fallibility and anxiety about the void.Doechii and SZA – Girl, Get UpDoechii’s chilling on a roof, not a care in the world … a pose that swiftly comes undone as she hits back at haters in acute detail, her vexed verses softened by SZA’s slithery chorus.Juni Habel – Evergreen in Your MindSharing the same dusky light as Jessica Pratt’s records, the Norwegian singer traces the gap between reality and memory in swaddled vocal harmonies, to a reassuring acoustic guitar motif.Laura SnapesSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify – or transfer it toApple,Tidalor other servicesExplore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is a hero, Ramza – an idealistic nobleman with luscious blond hair who cavorts about the medieval-inspired realm of Ivalice in search of high adventure. But quickly, and with narrative elegance, the picture complicates: peasant revolutionaries duke it out with gilded monarchists; machiavellian plots plunge the kingdom into chaos. Ramza must navigate this knotty political matrix, all while experiencing his own ideological awakening.There is a strong case to be made that Final Fantasy Tactics tells a better story than the landmarkFinal Fantasy VII(which saw Cloud Strife and a ragtag bunch of eco-terrorist pals taking on the shady megacorporation Shinra). And with our real-world political focus shifting from the looming threat of the climate crisis to the more pressing rise of fascism (though the two are inextricably linked), one can make the argument that Tactics is now also the more timely game.In this remastered version, the plot still sparkles. Shakespearean dialogue is now fully voice-acted with delightfully hammy performances: you can practically feel the spittle on your face as one of the game’s royalist rotters delivers an incandescent tirade against the common folk.Within this terrific political tapestry, you engage in the real meat of the game: turn-based combat of rare malleability. Each of your party – Ramza, lowborn Delita, and many more – has their own “job” (essentially, a character class), and these can be changed and subsequently remixed with few limitations (want to create a gun-toting mage? No problem!). This level of customisation, coupled with the exquisite diorama levels where the skirmishes take place, results in a symphonic take on chess.These battles aren’t just riotous fun; they are also poetic. “I’ve been dealt a hand. I simply play it,” says one foe during a dramatic showdown at a cascading waterfall. The line speaks to the tragedy that gradually surfaces as you play through these square-gridded encounters – the sense that every character has been thrust into a maelstrom of events bigger than themselves. Heroes, villains, and everyone in between are but pawns on the battlefield, hurtling towards their own prefigured date with destiny.The Ivalice Chronicles is not interested in narrative flexibility; its plot does not bend to the whims of the player likeotherRPGs. The story’s framing – recounted as a historical account in the distant future – makes this abundantly clear. As such, the game is less about fantasy and fairytales than history itself. Forget easy resolutions: here, events simply produce yet more events; trauma begets trauma. It is one battle after another for Ramza and his comrades.This might sound doom-laden, and, in truth, it frequently is. Yet there is no mistaking the moral principles that suffuse writer Yasumi Matsuno’s stirring story of inequality, division, and pig-headed elites who seek to consolidate their already mighty power. Matsuno, who studied foreign policy before becoming an economic reporter, has described Final Fantasy Tactics as a work of “class struggle”. Now, in the time ofNo Kings protestsin the US, theerosion of political rightsin the UK, and thefurther enrichingof the world’s hyperwealthy, the game feels even more resonant.Ramza offers a model for resistance, and also a commentary on the struggle of opposition in such turbulent times. He is principled, uncompromising and always seeks to do right – and his reward is to be deemed a heretic by the most powerful institutions of his time.Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is available now; £39.99Explore more on these topicsGamesFinal FantasyRole playing gamesStrategy gamesPlayStation 4PlayStation 5Nintendo SwitchreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are workmen up ladders, hammering, plastering, but I leave my muddy walking boots by the door. There’s no central heating or hot water and Banjo Beale and his husband, Ro, have been camping out here for weeks, but he greets me, dazzlingly debonair, in a burnt orange beanie and fabulous Moroccan rug coat.The 2022 winner of the BBC’s Interior Design Masters, who went on to front his own makeover showDesigning the Hebrides, Banjo’s vibe is more exuberant Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen than quizzical Kevin McCloud. His latest project with Ro, the transformation of a derelict mansion on the small Hebridean island of Ulva into a boutique hotel, is the subject of a new six-part series, airing on BBC Scotland. I’m here for a preview of the finished rooms.Ulva mapAt just 7.5 miles long by 2.5 wide, Ulva, across a narrow strait from the Isle of Mull, was privately owned until recently. When it went on the market in 2018, a community buyout was orchestrated with the aim of attracting people back to Ulva and breathing new life into the island.The first national census in 1841 recorded a population of 570 on the island, but largely owing to the brutal evictions of the Highland Clearances (when lairds forced crofting tenants off the land, replacing them with sheep), by 2015 there were just three adults and two children living here.View image in fullscreen‘Arrested decay’ is the aesthetic Beale was aiming for when restoring Ulva House.Photograph: Shelley Richmond/Hello Halo/BBC ScotlandCommunity buyouts are becoming more common across Scotland, following the example of islands such as Eigg, empowering locals to take control of their futures and save local businesses. Numbers on Ulva have since swelled to 16 – the long-term target is 50 – after an advert was posted inviting applications for settlement here. Now, two Aussies (Banjo and Ro) and their wolfhound/greyhound cross, Grampa, are shining an even brighter spotlight on this remote island and helping to turn its fortunes around.The good thing about Ulva being community owned is we’re all in this togetherBanjo BealeThere has been a house here, once the seat of Clan Macquarie, since the 17th or 18th century. The original property was replaced by a Regency-style mansion at the beginning of the 19th century and, after a fire in the 1950s, it was rebuilt on the same footprint. The elegant, Grade B-listed, modernist mansion (with a nod to Arts and Crafts and Regency-influenced interiors) “has good bones” Banjo tells me, but it was derelict when they first stumbled upon it – and decided to plunge their savings into converting it into a hotel. They have secured a rent and repair lease and part of the profits will be ploughed back into the community. “The good thing about Ulva being community owned,” Banjo explains, “is we’re all in this together.”View image in fullscreenThe couple have also taken on a restaurant, The Boathouse, on Ulva, along with their business partner SamThe pair first washed up in the Hebrides because Ro had a dream of becoming a cheesemaker and they had heard about Sgriob-ruadh (pronounced skrib-rooa), the dairy farm turned award-winning artisan cheesemaker on Mull. Ro learned how to make cheese while Banjo dipped his toe into interior design, doing up the striking Glass Barn cafe with its owner, Chris Reade; rummaging through the old farm buildings for things he could use – and sparking a new passion.The project is a coming together of our styles. We want it to feel bohemian, whimsicalIn the entrance hall of Ulva House, and curving up the grand staircase, a romantic mural features palm trees against a mountainous landscape, painted by the artist Melissa Wickham, while a profusion of towering pot plants is scattered around a bamboo-clad reception desk.“Ro loves tropical stuff,” Banjo smiles. “I’m more classical. The project is a coming together of our styles. We want it to feel bohemian, whimsical.”I follow him into the Library Bar. “I think I am a frustrated antiques dealer,” he admits as I admire the giant zinc and marble-top bar. “I’ve been collecting pieces for years; most of it’s in storage in a huge shed at the cheese farm.”View image in fullscreenBearnus Bothy is a five-mile hike from Ulva’s jetty along a coastal trackBelgium and France are his main hunting grounds; he found the Parisian pitch pine bar near Lyon, a steal at just £1,500. How they got it over from Mull on the tiny passenger ferry is another story. “It had to straddle the boat, then we used a horse float [horse trailer] to get it from the jetty (there are no cars on Ulva) and took the windows out to get it in.”The library is opulent. You can imagine nursing a negroni and thumbing through the pages of some of the old books. Above the fireplace are framed plans Banjo found in a salvage yard, the date 1827, and signed “Macquarie”. Another Macquarie, he tells me, Major General Lachlan Macquarie (1762-1824), who was born on Ulva, became governor of New South Wales.The light-infused Orangery or drawing room is a glorious space peppered with more pot plants, distressed urns, vintage rattan chairs, and unframed oils on the walls. The peeling pale green paint has been painstakingly preserved with a layer of varnish, a Miss Havisham-esque process he explains is called “arrested decay”.View image in fullscreenThe living quarters in Bearnus BothyWhen it opens later in the year, the seven-bedroom hotel will be open seasonally, with Ro doing the cooking. Until then, visitors to the island can take their pick between two off-grid bothies and a revamped hostel. Banjo’s makeover ofCragaig Bothyfor the community featured in an episode of Designing the Hebrides. In fact, the hotel is his third project on Ulva. Last summer, he and Ro, along with a young farmer, charcuterie-maker and baker, Sam, also took on the lease ofThe Boathouse, the white waterfront restaurant by the jetty.It became an instant hit, with people flocking over from Mull for platters of langoustine and lobster perched at picnic tables near the rocks, and meandering along the waymarked walking trails that crisscross the island.The pretty, whitewashed bothy above the beach is a welcome sight after a squally walk – as is the basket full of logs by the fireI’m staying inBearnus Bothyfor the weekend, a five-mile hike from the jetty along a coastal track. It’s run by Andy and Yvette Primrose, who live off-grid on the neighbouring island of Gometra – an island off an island off an island. The couple are climbers – Yvette has tackled the north side of Everest and her book Expedition from the Backdoor is the tale of her 660-mile journey on foot from Shropshire to Knoydart, on the west coast of Scotland. They also run the island’s hostel.The pretty, whitewashed bothy above the beach is a welcome sight after a squally walk – as is the basket full of logs and the pulley above the stove for drying wet clothes. There are just two rooms, a bedroom with old-fashioned twin beds topped with woollen blankets and a kitchen/diner, a bathroom with flushing toilet and Belfast sink in between. There’s also a tin bath, which can be filled with water heated on the wood-burning stove.In front of the fire are two rocking chairs with tartan blankets. Lighting is by candles, tealights and battery-operated fairy lights. There are crocs and wellies by the door. A bookcase is stacked with novels, walking and wildlife guides and games to while away long evenings.Hebridean high: joy, tears and camaraderie on a 100km trek for charity across the Isle of SkyeRead moreFlicking through the visitor book by candlelight, I read about Swallows and Amazons-style family adventures, swimming from the beach below the bothy, sailing trips and picnics. Inspired, I hike over to Gometra, accessed at low tide over the sand, at high tide over a footbridge, scouring the shoreline with binoculars and spotting seals basking on rocks and a family of otters playing in the water. Soaring high above is a hen harrier. There’s not another soul around.Solitary rambles might soon be a thing of the past, of course, now that the island is being “re-peopled”. And, with a hotel opening on the horizon, the future for Ulva is starting to look brighter and a little busier.Accommodation was provided by Bearnus Bothy (airbnb.co.uk), minimum two-night stay from £121.CalMac(calmac.co.uk) ferries sail fromLochalineon the Scottish mainland toFishnish on Mull,from £6.50 return for foot passengers, £25.60 for a car.

In the gloomiest month of the year? Are they mad?) tend to take our feet off the alcohol pedal and give our livers something of a rest.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Water, of course, is the easiest, cheapest and probably most effective way to detox; it’s also the most boring. We can zap our inner organs with herbal infusions, turmeric/kale/spirulina shots and smoothies, or with the fermented goodness of kombuchas and kefirs, but sometimes the mindful drinking halo of virtue can become too heavy to bear and we want something that feels like a “real” drink. You know, the one at the end of the day when you deserve something cheering, or when you meet your mates in some scuzzy pub or swanky wine bar, and you want a drink for relaxation and pleasure, but still steer clear of the hooch.Booze-free beer is your friend here, and the choice has never been greater. Fortunately, we have come a long way since the days of Barbican,the UK’s first non-alcoholic beerlaunched by Bass in 1979, and a sad, bitter apology for a lager. Most nolo beer (meaning it has at most a 0.5% ABV) is brewed to normal strength, and the ethanol is then removed, either by vacuum distillation or reverse osmosis. This dealcoholisation can be brutal, though, because it also strips out alcohol-soluble flavour and aroma compounds, as well as ethanol’s mouth-filling texture.But now, with the popularity of nolo drinks skyrocketing, investment in R&D has led to leaps in both technology and quality. Even so, these new methods are very expensive, which is why most nolo beers have until recently remained in the hands of the big producers. What’s exciting many brewers now, though, especially small-scale craft operations, is the introduction of cheap, hybridised yeast strains that ferment just a small percentage of the sugars in the mash, so leaving a very low ABV. These, coupled with new biotech products that add aromas, flavours and mouthfeel, make the new generation of nolo beers much more, well, beery.Some new producers such asImpossibrewgo a step further, adding so-called “functional” nootropic ingredients designed to recreate the feelings of relaxation and “beer buzz” that we get after a pint or two. Who cares if their efficacy is merely auto-suggestive? The beers taste good and are at the very least a stimulating topic of pub chat. Having said that, be aware that nolo beers are susceptible to bacterial contamination, so it’s best to stick to cans or bottles, rather than on draught in a grubby bar. Bottoms up, Britain, boozy or not. Happy 2026.Four beers to get 2026 off on a nolo noteYop Rock£3.50 (440ml) Bluntrock Brewery, 0.5%. Zippy, lemony-fresh lager with a whiff of salty sea spray.

I originally put that down to the lack of time and attention I’d given those poor plants, but I’m now starting to wonder if the soil in my raised garden beds overlooking Lyme Bay in Dorset is actually right for them.I’m not giving up just yet, though, and this year I’ll be trying different varieties in a different bed that I’ve prepared and composted over the winter with seaweed mulch. As luck would have it, however, my friend Rob Corbett came to the rescue a couple of weeks ago by giving me several specimens when he delivered some wine fromhis Castlewood vineyarda few miles away in east Devon. If you know your gourds even a little, you will also know that squashes keep for months, which is handy, because they ideally need to cure and ripen before use. Happily, that also means you can use your crop throughout the long winter months.I suppose that when you grow your own squashes and pumpkins, you potentially get stuck for what to do with them, but the possibilities are almost endless – for example, I recently made a cheesecake topped with a sweet squash relish, as well as a chocolate and pumpkin pie that’s a bit more appealing than the classic American version; I even made a squash cocktail with a new, Kentish version of the classic Italian walnut liqueur, nocino, made byPleasant Land Distillery in Aldington, just outside Ashford. As the base, I used some of the skins, seeds and trimmings left over from making a squash risotto, and added some mezcal to the mix, too – as odd as that might sound, it was really quite delicious.Buying a squash can be a little daunting, especially to the uninitiated, because some of the nice orange ones, such as crown prince and sunshine, are often huge and heavy, and definitely won’t fit into your shopping basket. I suspect that’s why so many shops and supermarkets sell mainly butternut, which is kind of the size of a large swede and will easily go in a shopping bag. Mediterranean and Turkish supermarkets have the right idea, though, because they often sell those nice big squashes in manageable, ready-cut wedges, an added bonus of which is that you can easily see what the flesh is like inside – not to mention how much skin and seeds you’re being expected to pay for.I’ve used a fair amount of squash in today’s recipe for a colourful winter salad, both roasted and shaved, which brings a lovely contrast in textures and flavours to proceedings. I used crown prince, because I had one that was ripe and ready to go, but any ripe, orange-fleshed squash, or a mixture of squashes, would work well.If you like, top the salad with a scattering of toasted reserved pumpkin seeds, or even chop some up and add them to the dressing for a bit of extra crunch.Roast pumpkin and pickled walnut saladServes4 as a side2 tbsp rapeseed oil, or olive oil400g ripe, orangesquash flesh(crown prince, sunshine or butternut), peeled and deseededSalt and black pepperA couple of handfuls small salad leaves, washed and driedA few sprigs of fresh tarragon, leaves picked (optional)4 pickled walnuts, drained (save the liquid) and cut into 1cm diceFor the dressing1 tbsp cider vinegar1 tbsp pickled walnut liquor from the jar3-4 tbsp rapeseed oil, or pumpkin seed oilToasted pumpkin seeds, whole or chopped, to finish (optional)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the oil on a roasting tray and stick it in the oven to heat up. With a vegetable peeler or on a mandoline, shave a third of the squash flesh into ribbons, put them in a bowl of iced water and put in the fridge until needed – they will curl up a little while chilling.Cut the rest of the squash into wedges or rough chunks. Season the squash chunks, then carefully toss them in the hot oil and roast for about 30 minutes, turning once halfway, until tender and lightly coloured all over.Meanwhile, drain and dry the shaved squash, then mix with the salad leaves, tarragon and pickled walnuts. In a small bowl, whisk all the ingredients for the dressing with any leftover oil from the squash roasting tray, then season to taste.Arrange everything in a large bowl or plate, or on individual plates, then spoon over the dressing and serve, perhaps topped with a few toasted pumpkin seeds.Mark Hix is a restaurateur and writer based in Lyme Regis, Dorset.
