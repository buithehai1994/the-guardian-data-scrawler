She was more than America’s sweetheart: Keaton was the sophisticated, sweet-natured, unaffectedly sensual woman with whom America was unrequitedly in love. Diane Keaton was out of America’s league.Diane Keaton: a life in picturesRead moreIn the golden age of the American New Wave in the 1970s, she was at the centre of that era’s great comedy and tragedy: as Kay, the innocent wife of Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone in Coppola’sThe Godfather(1972), she was the aghast, complicit witness to mob toxicity and murder, paralysed with disillusion and fear as she is shut out of her husband’s dealings in his private sanctum – and then, in the next film, like a modern-day Medea, Diane Keaton’s Kay reveals to the icily infuriated Michael the awful truth about her miscarriage.But in that decade it was as a comic performer of ethereally self-aware genius that she became more known. In her many films playing oppositeWoody Allen, in Sleeper, Play It Again Sam, Love and Death, Manhattan and most gloriously of all, in Annie Hall (her Oscar-winner), and in admiring Keaton’s wonderful performance in that romcom masterpiece we can appreciate that the film is the jewel of the American New Wave – in fact, with its freewheeling city life and its literary gestures and in-jokes, it is closer to the French New Wave.For a while, Keaton was almost Allen’s comedy partner, the Elaine May to his Mike Nichols or maybe the Gracie Allen to his George Burns, but none of these comparisons quite convey the romantic potency of Keaton/Hall’s screen presence: the elegant, bohemian single woman whose heedless eccentricity, sweetness and vulnerability go way beyond “kooky” or “ditsy” and certainly beyond the “manic pixie dream girl” persona that would later become fashionable. The point is that Allen’s Alvy Singer is deeply in love with Annie, and can never be with her. The chaotic scenes with the live lobsters, the first they shot together on the film, are sublimely romantic and funny. Yet Keaton could play the straight “feed” to Allen well enough, executing with faultless seriousness the setup in Love and Death, as the entrancingly lovely Sonja who is not in love with Allen’s infatuated Boris.‘God, life is so strange’: Diane Keaton on dogs, doors, wine and why she’s ‘really fancy’Read more“Sex without love is an empty experience,” she says, to which Boris helplessly replies: “Yes, but as empty experiences go, it’s one of the best.” That immortal gag wouldn’t be the same without the genuine delicacy and wisdom with which Keaton performs it. And she also nailed the broad physical comedy too.For Allen, Keaton could embody the wonderfully patrician, Waspy archetype – like the hero of Roth’s Portnoy’s Complaint, he fetishises her non-Jewishness. And in his absolutely serious film, Interiors from 1978, Allen cast her in the Chekhovian family context of sisters.Keaton’s performance in the once shocking film Looking for Mr Goodbar from 1977 is one that deserves to be better known: a minor work, maybe, but it was bold and courageous casting against type for Keaton to play the schoolteacher (a very Keatonian profession) who has a need to explore casual sexuality in the same frank if off-the-record way that men are allowed to do: this was a through-the-looking-glassAnnie Halland she is terrific in it.As the 70s turned into the 80s, and at the very height of her prestige, Keaton was in the epic Reds (1981) with her lover and co-starWarren Beatty, playing feminist activist Louise Bryant with Beatty as the US socialist journalist John Reed who chronicled the Russian revolution in his book Ten Days that Shook the World. There was, perhaps, more than a hint of worthiness about the whole film which meant Keaton couldn’t quite shine – although that wasn’t true of Alan Parker’s muscular Shoot the Moon (1982) about an unhappy couple with Keaton going head-to-head with Albert Finney and giving as good as she gets.In the 80s and 90s, directors didn’t quite find their way into Keaton’s distrait style, it was an enigma which retreated more from the lens; she continued to perform in Allen movies like Manhattan Murder Mystery, and she played comedy for lesser film-makers and in lesser (though perfectly decent) films like The First Wives Club (1996) about women determined to gain revenge on their ex-husbands for remarrying younger women. She played very serious roles, although these often had the milky glow of soap opera.But it was Nancy Meyers who found a kindred spirit in Keaton, casting her in the addictive, luxury-aspirational romantic comedies that she created with such a sure touch, perhaps most vividly in Baby Boom from 1987 as the corporate career high-flyer who finds herself in a fix when she inherits a baby. This was perhaps the last film in which the sharper edge of Keaton’s comic performing style is still visible, playing a terrific scene with the white-coated Sam Shepard, tearfully opening up to him about her lack of sex and unaware that he’s a vet, not a doctor. I always remember the fierce way she looks at herself in the ladies’ room mirror towards the end of the film when it looks as if she can reclaim her job, visibly vibrating with excitement.The high-water mark of Diane Keaton’s late period of gentler romance was in Meyers’s Something’s Gotta Give in 2003, when she finds herself being courted by two men: Jack Nicholson, the ageing roué notorious for dating younger women and humbled by a non-fatal heart attack, and by Keanu Reeves, the impossibly dishy doctor whom Keaton meets because of Nicholson’s heart scare.For a female star to be adored by these two amazing movie galacticos is a difficult look to pull off and really Keaton was the only candidate: even in middle age she has that innocence and unaffected charm – and if the focus in her performance is fuzzy, it only added to her appeal. The thought of Hollywood without Diane Keaton is unbearably sad.Explore more on these topicsDiane KeatonWoody AllenAl PacinoAnnie HallThe GodfatherWarren BeattycommentShareReuse this content"

No, there’s no punchline – it’s not that kind of anecdote. “My life has changed for ever,” Yousafzai says sadly, as we gaze at the semi-derelict structure. “Everything changed for ever, after that [night].”The shed is tucked away at the back of Lady Margaret Hall, away from the prying eyes of Oxford’s college life. You have to know how to find it. Yousafzai leads me through quadrangles and out into a hidden garden. Inside are dusty pint glasses and spiderwebs, and board games with the pieces missing.We are meeting on a bright summer afternoon, ahead of the release of her memoir, Finding My Way, a sequel to her 2013 bestseller I Am Malala. Dressed in a blue shirt, jeans and a headscarf, Yousafzai is accompanied, at a discreet distance, by two close-protection officers. The college is quiet – it’s the summer holidays – and Yousafzai attracts no attention from the few students who remain as she tramps across the grass.View image in fullscreenBlazer: Sandro. Dress: Issey Miyake. Earrings: AlighieriThis is not our first interview. Our last conversation sparked days of negative headlines for Yousafzai, back home in her nativePakistan. As we gaze at the bong-shed, I fear that round two may lead to more of the same.In 2021, I profiled a then-23-year-old Yousafzai for the cover of British Vogue. The world’s youngest Nobel laureate – she received the award at 17, for her activism for girls’ education – had recently graduated from university and was about to launch her adult life.Yousafzai began campaigning at the age of 11. Her father, Ziauddin, is an education activist and she followed in his footsteps, writing a blog for BBC Urdu about her life as theTalibanshut down girls’ schools across Pakistan’s Swat valley where she lived. When a Taliban gunman shot her in the head on her school bus when she was just 15 years old, Yousafzai was airlifted to the UK and made a remarkable recovery, resettling with her family in Birmingham, where she attended secondary school, all the while campaigning for the rights of girls around the world to receive an education.View image in fullscreenYousafzai recovering at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham 10 days after the attack.Photograph: PG P / ShutterstockWhen I met Yousafzai in April 2021, she had just got a 2.1 from Oxford in politics, philosophy and economics, and signed a deal with Apple TV+ to develop and produce her own slate of TV and films. (The deal has now ended.) We did an interview at a hotel in London before walkingaround a Covid-era St James’s Park. When I asked her if she had a romantic partner, she blanched. “I would say that I have come across people who have been great, and I hope that I do find someone,” she stuttered, visibly embarrassed.Later, she mused on marriage. “I still don’t understand why people have to get married,” she told me. “If you want to have a person in your life, why do you have to sign marriage papers, why can’t it just be a partnership?”Her comments seemed unexceptional. I was more concerned that the fact she’d told me that she frequented pubs could create controversy, given that Yousafzai is Muslim, and so when I wrote up the interview I was careful to specify that she did not drink alcohol.The article came out. Yousafzai shared it, and sent me a message of thanks. The following day, logging on to Twitter (now X), I saw that #shameonMalala was trending in Pakistan. Her comments had been widely misinterpreted to mean that she was denouncingnikah, the Islamic institution of marriage, and implicitly to suggest that she condoned premarital sex.She led Pakistan’s national newsfor days. Online commentators accused Yousafzai of betraying her religion as a result of western indoctrination. An influential cleric tagged her father on Twitter, asking him to explain his daughter’s un-Islamic remarks. (He responded, saying they had been taken out of context.) Parliamentarians in anassembly in north-west Pakistaneven debated her comments.Yousafzai maintained a dignified silence. And then, in November 2021, sheannounced hersurprise wedding to Pakistani cricket manager Asser Malik. Many, including myself, struggled to make sense of it.View image in fullscreenShirt: Stella McCartney. Skirt: Kent & Curwen. Headscarf and shoes: Gucci“Malala,what happened?!” I ask now as she walks, alone, into an empty conference room and greets me with a hug.She smiles sheepishly. “When you asked that question [about meeting someone],” she says, “I felt like I was caught. It was like, wait a second, does she know anything? I was like, no, no, no, you know, I just don’t want to get married.”In Finding My Way, Yousafzai reveals that, by the time of the Vogue interview, she and Malik were already dating. In other words, Yousafzai over-corrected to throw me off the scent.But she was sincere in having her doubts about marriage. Growing up in Pakistan, she says, it represented “a future without any opportunity, where your husband determines your life”.View image in fullscreenYousafzai with her husband Asser Malik last month.Photograph: David Fisher/ShutterstockAfter the furore, her parents, but particularly her mother, were distraught. “She was somad at me,” Yousafzai says. Family and friends kept texting articles. An imam from her village called to lecture her parents on the phone. “I was facing a lot of pressure,” she says, “from my dad, especially, and my mum, to issue a statement to clarify what my thoughts were on marriage, and I found this absurd.”And then there was Malik. Yousafzai’s parents had met him, but she hadn’t felt ready to make the relationship public. She felt guilty for disavowing him publicly, but Malik didn’t blame her, and instead stepped in to help mediate with her parents. Over the following months, Yousafzai began to interrogate her views on marriage. She asked Malik about his thoughts on women and equality, and liked what she heard. “I’m supposed to be an advocate for girls and women, and even I was limiting my own self in how I perceived marriage,” Yousafzai says.But there were other pressures, familiar to any immigrant child who has butted up against their parents’ cultural expectations. When Malik and Yousafzai left the house together, her mother would urge them to “maintain, like, a 10-foot distance”, she says.It seems from reading Finding My Way that she would not have married so young were it not for her parents. She nods. “I felt like I was sort of giving up,” she says. Refusing to marry would have led to not only interfamilial, but international, conflict. “Am I willing to fight my mum and my dad? Am I willing to start a new debate on people living together without these ceremonies and traditions?” Yousafzai realised that she couldn’t live with Malik “without getting married in the traditional way, in the religious way”.She could dig her heels in, but it would cause immense pain to her parents. And, besides, she was in love. “He’s so charming, he’s so smart, and I just could not stop thinking about him.” So she relented. On 9 November 2021, at her parents’ house in Birmingham, in an Islamic ceremony, Yousafzai married.After marriage, Yousafzai realised that “things feel sort of the same. They’re not that different.” She lives with Malik in a riverside apartment in London. They split the chores; neither cooks, instead eating out or using a meal delivery service. (Yousafzai’s mother thinks this is “a disaster. She says, ‘Your house is the only house where there’s a fridge with no vegetables!’”)It has been only four years since we met, but Yousafzai is much changed. The woman I met before appeared girlish, even a little gauche. She was visibly mortified when we spoke about relationships. Now, she is grounded and at ease. She also looks subtly different, having undergone surgery to improve the facial paralysis she suffered after the attack.At university, Yousafzai experienced the sweetness of independent adult life for the first time. When we met in 2021, she described a whirl of college balls, societies and essay crises. Now she’s more willing to share the unvarnished reality of her university experience.I thought nothing could scare me, nothing. And then I was scared of small things, and that just broke meView image in fullscreenSkirt, shirt and scarf: Jacquemus. Earrings: Pond London. Cuff: Charlotte Chesnais. Head scarf: stylist’s ownIn Finding My Way, Yousafzai writes of the pressures of having to travel internationally, maintaining the relationships critical to theMalala Fund, which supports girls’ education projects around the world, in addition to paid speaking gigs. She is the breadwinner not only for her parents and two brothers, but also for her extended family back home in Pakistan, and even family friends. (At one point, she was paying for two family friends to attend college, in the US and Canada.)Did she feel resentful of these financial obligations? “It was difficult to manage,” Yousafzai says. She “hated the experience of thinking about our expenses for the next year and [thinking], OK, I have to do this event, because otherwise we won’t be able to cover these costs.”View image in fullscreenYousafzai displays her medal during the Nobel Peace Prize awards ceremony in Norway, 2014.Photograph: Cornelius Poppe/AFP/Getty ImagesHer studies suffered. Yousafzai got a 2.2 in her first-year exams and had to seek additional support from specialist tutors, a humbling experience for the most famous education activist in the world. “I felt like an impostor,” she laughs. “I felt ashamed.” She asked her tutor to write a letter to her parents explaining that she was forbidden from working during term time because she was failing her degree. Why didn’t she tell her parents herself? “I had talked to my family many times about the pressure,” she says, “and how difficult it was to manage.”She writes of how, at home in Birmingham, “my dad treated our house like an art museum, and me like the signature piece in the collection”. She would be summoned downstairs to meet visitors keen to gawp at a Nobel laureate up close. “My dad is a very generous person,” she says, “a giving person, and he always understood what other people wanted … in his heart, he knew that they wanted to meet me.”Have there been times, I ask, where he’s pushed you too much?“Oh,” she laughs, “he hasphysicallypushed me.” When meeting well-wishers or guests at family events, Ziauddin has given her the odd shove. “You know when you have a little kid, and you sort of push the kid [to] say hello to this person? I’m, like, it’s fine when they’re little kids, you know.” But even when she’s grouching, it’s clear Yousafzai has tremendous love and respect for the man who, however inadvertently, propelled her on to the world stage. “My dad has always been supportive,” she says. “Whenever I explain something to him, he completely understands it. He is one of those cool dads, who never disagrees with me.”But I fear even the world’s most down-to-earth father may have concerns about what Yousafzai – whose new book is likely to be a bestseller (her first memoir sold nearly 2m copies) – is about to put in the public domain.And so to the bong incident. What happened that night: Yousafzai tried to walk back to her room, but she blacked out en route. A girlfriend carried her back instead. She couldn’t sleep. Her brain endlessly replayed a loop of the day the Taliban attempted to murder her. The gun. The bloodspray. Her body being carried through crowds to an ambulance.She had always thought she couldn’t remember being shot. But the bong unlocked long-submerged memories, of the attack and also of a childhood growing up under the spectre of Taliban violence. “I had never felt so close to the attack as then, in that moment,” she tells me. “I felt like I was reliving all of it, and there was a time when I just thought I was in the afterlife.” She felt she was dying, or already dead. “It’s easier to laugh about it now,” she says, with a small, tight smile.Listening to her speak, I feel deep compassion for all she went through as a young child. “I was nine or 10 when the Taliban took over control in our valley,” she says, “and they would bomb schools, they would kill or slaughter people and hang their bodies upside down.”After the bong, Yousafzai developed anxiety. “I felt numb … I couldn’t recognise myself in the mirror,” she says. The sweetness of college life fell away. She told her parents in general terms about the incident, but “they were a bit dismissive”, she says. She struggled to tell them how much it had affected her mental health. “I just could not explain to them that things are not the same any more.”Optimism is the only way you can keep going, because there’s no other optionFriends were worried about her. (Maria, her personal assistant, who lives in London, was so concerned she drove up to be with her immediately after the incident.) Yousafzai lied and told them things were fine. “I’m the girl who was shot … I’m supposed to be a brave girl,” she says. Until she couldn’t pretend any longer. “I’d be sweating and shaking and I could hear my heart beat. Then I started getting panic attacks.” She saw a therapist, and realised that her childhood, the attempted murder and exam stress were overwhelming her mental health. In the book, Yousafzai writes a list of her symptoms at the time: a racing heart, finding it hard to breathe, struggles sleeping, brain fog and a constant fear of someone she loved dying. “Normal people don’t have lists like this,” she writes, adding,“Something is wrong with me.”“I survived an attack,” she says, “and nothing happened to me, and I laughed it off. I thought nothing could scare me, nothing. My heart was so strong. And then I was scared of small things, and that just broke me. But, you know, in this journey I realised what it means to be actually brave.

She talks about how young she was when she started winning awards, and what it was like to go to ceremonies and see activists there who had spent decades fighting for a cause. It made her feel as if she needed to “spend the rest of my life campaigning for girls’ education” to show she was worthy.But no matter how many leaders she lobbied, or projects she helped to fund – Yousafzai glows when she talks about the girls’ school she opened back home – she felt it was not enough. There was “always this feeling … could I do more?” Her youthful idealism began to flake and peel off in patches, and then rub clean away. “As I was getting older,” she says, “I was realising that things are not as straightforward. Things are more complex.”As a teen, Yousafzai had seen the world as a biddable place. She would reason with world leaders! Show them girls’ education was important! As she got older, she began to see the world as it really is.You became cynical? I ask.“Yeah,” she says, “for sure.” She gives a bitter, clipped laugh. “100%.”In April 2021, the US announced it was withdrawing fromAfghanistanin August of that year. Within days of them leaving, the Taliban took over the country. “We had calls with the Afghan activists who the Malala Fund were supporting,” she says, “and it was just unbelievable. Some of them knew the worst was coming. Some of them still had faith.”Afghanistan is now the only country in the world where girls cannot go to secondary school or higher education, withthe only option availablebeing madrasas that promote an extreme interpretation of Islam. The Malala Fund continues to do what it can. “We are providing funding for alternative education right now,” she says. “There are underground schools, there are radio and television education programmes.”Yousafzai is heartbroken at what has come to pass. “I feel the world has forgotten about the women in Afghanistan,” she says. What stings is that “people were willing to trust the Taliban more than Afghan women”. Which people, I ask? “World leaders,” she says, “decision makers.”Yousafzai writes of emailing politicians, begging for their assistance in evacuating her Afghan partners to safety before the Taliban took over. “For years, I’d smiled in pictures with these leaders, shaken their hands and stood next to them at podiums – but not one of them picked up the phone, or replied to my messages. To the men who ran the world, I was just a photo op.”Who didn’t take her calls? She mentions Biden. Johnson. Macron. Trudeau. She notes, pointedly, that female politicians did. Erna Solberg, the then Norwegian prime minister, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Lolwah Al-Khater, assistant foreign minister of Qatar at the time, stepped in to help evacuate her Afghan partners to safe countries, in some instances without passports.For many years, Yousafzai pioneered a model of professional activism: cautious, consensus-driven, willing to work with institutions, rather than calling them out; one that used the photo op and the handshake, rather than the megaphone and the protest. Her detractors said she was too corporate, but Yousafzai sincerely believed it was better to work with people and make incremental change. And then Afghanistan happened. Did she feel duped?View image in fullscreenYousafzai at the White House with Barack and Michelle Obama and their daughter Malia in 2013.Photograph: Hum Images/ Universal Images Group/Getty Images“I do feel like I’m more cynical,” she says. “But, at the same time, I do my work. I know that optimism is the only way you can keep going, because there’s no other option.”There is a perception on social media that, as one of the most prominent Muslim activists in the world today, Yousafzai has not done enough tospeak out on Gaza. This perception is not entirely fair. Through the Malala Fund, and personally, Yousafzai has donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to organisations that support children and schools in Gaza. She first called for a ceasefire on 10 October 2023.Today, it is Yousafzai who brings up Gaza. “Israel has to stop this indiscriminate bombing,” she says. Humanitarian aid must be allowed in, she adds, characterising the starvation of civilians as “deliberate”. But, still, the perception lingers. Her critics, she says, “completely are dismissing or ignoring the actual work that I’m doing”.Yousafzai describes what is happening in Gaza as “a genocide”. “You look at the evidence, you look at what’s happening, you look at how they’re [the IDF] committing these actions, and it’s very clear if they’re targeting people for collecting aid, or getting water. Everyone knows children are unarmed.” She also calls for the release of the surviving hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza in appalling conditions. “I’ve been very consistent in saying that the hostages should be freed … I don’t believe in using violence for resistance.”Does she think she has done enough? “I wish I lived in a world where I could do a tweet and the world would stop the war.” After we meet, Yousafzai travels to Egypt to meet injured Palestinian child refugees, and announces a$100,000 grant from the Malala Fundto support their medical treatment and education.“There isn’t a night where I don’t think about what I can do,” she says.Throughout the 2010s, Yousafzai was the most prominent of a wave of child activists – such as the climate-change campaigners Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate, or gun-control advocate EmmaGonzález (now X González) – feted by world leaders, invited to events, on the covers of magazines, writing bestselling memoirs, delivering speeches to adoring audiences. This cultural moment has now passed. The celebrity activist feels like a relic of a different era. Many question what these activists achieved.The Malala Fund supports girls’ education projects in six countries. In order to maintain the funding streams, Yousafzai has to cultivate relationships with funders and world leaders, inevitably leading to accusations of selling out. Most of the people who slam her online will never achieve a fraction of what she has done for girls around the world. But it can at times be jarring to see Yousafzai enjoying an international jet-set lifestyle – days out at Formula One and atTaylor Swift concerts– interspersed with posts about Gaza or the plight of Afghan girls.She is often compared unfavourably by her critics, particularly those on the left, with Thunberg, who is willing to put herself in physical danger, boarding the Freedom Flotilla and setting sail for Gaza. “I really look up to Greta,” says Yousafzai, adding she checked in with her after she was detained by Israeli authorities.In April 2024, Yousafzai attended the opening night of Suffs, a Broadway musical about the suffragettes that she executive produced. Also in attendance was Hillary Clinton, a fellow executive producer. Online commentators flamed Yousafzai for being associated with the hawkish former secretary of state. In reality, Yousafzai says, she didn’t realise that Clinton was an executive producer on the project until after she had been brought on, and they did not work together on it.“People say, ‘Oh, you’re at the Suffs premiere, you are an executive producer, oh, Hillary Clinton has these views, therefore you support these views, therefore you are also complicit.”Being photographed at the same star-studded premiere as Clinton, rightly or wrongly, reinforces a persistent criticism of Yousafzai in Pakistan: that she is in the pocket of western powers; there are even longstanding rumours that she is an intelligence asset. When I ask her about this, she pushes back. “Pakistan is a part of me,” she says, “and so I get defensive when I’m asked this question. I say, no, no, no, Pakistan doesn’t hate me.”She fears that by giving succour to the view that she is unpopular in Pakistan, she feeds into broader anti-Muslim sentiment: the idea that Pakistan is a country full of backwards people who instinctively hate educated women. “I believe,” she says, “and it is deliberate, on my side, that I have a lot more love and support in Pakistan.” But, equally, she says, “I’m not going to deny there isn’t any hint [of hatred] at all. There is. There have been these campaigns from when I was, like, 12 years old.“The criticism is not against me,” she adds. “It’s more criticism against the west, criticism against these bigger narratives, and political conversations, but I am sort of attached to it.”Still, it’s clear to see it wears on her. “I do find it sad,” she admits, “that I sometimes have to read everything 10 times before I post it, because I’m, like, what is it that will get people’s attention?It is difficult. I do wish for more freedom in expressing myself.”View image in fullscreenYousafzai being presented with the United Nations Charter by the then UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon in 2013.Photograph: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter I wrap up the section of the interview on politics, Yousafzai exhales with relief and stretches her arms out in front of her, as if we are colleagues who have just finished a difficult task and can now relax with a cup of tea and a biscuit. By contrast, when it comes to talking about her family and her relationship with Malik, she speaks freely, laughing often. She is happiest when talking about her plans forRecess, an investment fund with a focus on women’s sports that she recently launched with Malik.Recess isn’t a non-profit, as I initially assumed. It’s a business, with the aim of increasing participation in women’s sports. Malik helped Yousafzai find her love of exercise. The fact that Malik is a cricket manager was part of his initial appeal, says the cricket-mad Yousafzai, even if her husband refuses to let her watch him play. “He says,” Yousafzai says, with an eye roll, “‘I used to work in cricketmanagement! I was not a professional cricketer!’ I’m, like, uh-huh. He did not explain that before marriage.” She hopes that Recess will “create more opportunities for women in sports” and help women “get a say in sports at all levels, whether that’s from the field to the owner’s box”.Before we leave, I ask Yousafzai if her parents have read Finding My Way. She says she has given them the gist of it, but they have not read it. “I have told them, ‘You will read it when it’s released, and you can pick it up from any bookshelf in any bookstore, and feel free to read it, but then you cannot make any changes.’”I understand the logic, familiar to many first- and second-generation immigrant children, including myself. Ask for forgiveness, not permission. But I’m also floored. Because Yousafzai is a global figure: the bong story will, inevitably, unleash a maelstrom of negative publicity back home.She is ready. “I am very prepared for that,” Yousafzai says, absolutely calm. “I don’t think I’m going to get defensive about it at all. I’m not going to issue any statement. If anybody has any confusion, they can read my book and decide for themselves.”It strikes me as I walk away from our interview that she never chose any of this. To be shot as a child, to be airlifted to the UK, to win the Nobel peace prize. Yousafzai seems to be someone who consistently puts others before herself, whether it’s accommodating her parents’ cultural expectations around marriage, supporting her family back home, or dedicating her life to advancing girls’ education. “I’m working so hard to learn how to say no,” she says, “and to be more direct … I do sort of overthink about other people’s feelings sometimes.”If the story of her teens and early 20s was of service to others, her late 20s are about Yousafzai choosing happiness for herself. I think she deserves it.Finding My Way by Malala Yousafzai is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson on 21 October at £25.

Crime is even being blamed – along with rising taxes – for anapparent exodus of the super-richfrom the UK.A prime property agent recalls a client’s Rolex being stolen off his wrist the first night he moved into Kensington, the west London neighbourhood that is one of the city’s most affluent.Advisers to the super-rich describe a city where “spotters” linger outside exclusive restaurants sizing up possible targets, while demand for private bodyguards grows.It is a view that Reform UK’s leader, Nigel Farage, often repeats,warning one journalist: “I dare you to walk through the West End of London after 9 o’clock of an evening wearing jewellery. You wouldn’t do it. You know that I’m right. You wouldn’t do it.”People claim London crime is rising because it suits them, Met commander saysRead moreA series of high-profile crimes has helped reinforce that view. The ex-Formula One driver Jenson Button and his wife, Brittny, had a suitcase containing £250,000 worth of valuables snatched within moments of their arrival at King’s Cross St Pancras. In January, the socialite Shafira Huang’s mansion in Primrose Hill, north London, was burgled, with thieves takingmore than £10m worthof bespoke jewellery.In November, the owners of the Sellier luxury goods store in Knightsbridge shared footage of masked men ransacking their premises, later commenting: “London has just turned into something crazy.”But is crime in the capital really “through the roof”? While statistics show crime is falling across England and Wales, with violent crime dropping dramatically over the past two decades,crime in London is up. Recorded crime has increased by 31% in the past decade in the area that the Metropolitan police covers, with violent crime up by 40%.Mobile phone theftremains a menace in London, with one ebike-riding thief jailed last year for stealing 24 phones in an hour. But there are signs that the tide is starting to turn in the capital, with violent crime falling by 6% in the year to the end of March, according to the Met police. Luxury watch theft, once a stain on London’s elite neighbourhoods of Mayfair and Knightsbridge, has massively reduced in the past two years. So why does perception not match reality?Is violent crime falling?Many crimes go unreported to the police, so the Crime Survey for England and Wales asks tens of thousands of households directly every year whether they have been the victim of a crime. The findings suggest crime has fallen dramatically over the past 20 years.Crime survey chartLast year London reported the lowest number of homicides of under-25s for more than two decades. Overall, murders are at a five-year low, and the rate is much lower than in other international cities such as New York, Paris, Brussels, Berlin and Madrid, according to analysis by Khan’s office.But knife crime has been rising in London: while the number of recorded knife crimes fell from 2012 in the run-up to 2016, it then started to rise again, hitting a peak of 15,600 incidents in 2019. There was a sharp drop during the pandemic, but it has since been closing in on its previous peak, standing at 15,000 in 2023-24. More recent statistics show knife crime in London dropping by 19% in the three months to June, compared with a year earlier.Other serious offences are dropping: in the year ending in March, there was a 6% reduction in violent crime overall, according to the Met police.And in a city that is home to about 9 million people, Londoners are less likely (26.4 offences per 1,000 people) to be a victim of violent crime than people across the rest of England and Wales (31.9 offences per 1,000 people), according to figures from the mayor’s office.So why is it that the narrative of a lawless capital is so prevalent? AYouGov survey in Septembershowed 51% of adults thought violent crime in London was increasing, against just 7% who thought it was falling.The “broken windows” idea partly explains why: this is the criminology theory that visible signs of minor crime and antisocial behaviour create an environment that encourages further crime, and normalises disorder as a part of public life.View image in fullscreenA CCTV camera captures the moment when thieves on a moped snatch a phone in London.Photograph: Metropolitan police/PATake phone theft, for example. After dropping during the pandemic, phone theft has been steadily rising since 2020, when there were 55,820 incidents reported to the Met. The figure has more than doubled, standing at 117,211 last year.These snatch thefts can cause huge distress and financial impact to victims, given the vast amount of personal data stored on phones and mobile banking apps. They are also harder to police, with criminals using ebikes and mopeds to make rapid getaways, and links to organised gangs that have sophisticated and established supply chains tosell phones abroad.Two-fifths of mobile phone thefts in Europe happen in UK, shows insurance dataRead moreIt means that in areas such as Knightsbridge, which was hit particularly hard by watch thefts in 2022, it gave residents a broader sense of lawlessness in the UK.But some of these numbers suggest police are starting to get a grip. Reports of phone theft fell by 28% to 213 in the City of London, which has its own police force, in the first four months of 2025, compared with the same period in the year prior.Outside the capital’s financial district, phone theft is still rising, but luxury watch, handbag and jewellery theft are all down in London, according to figures obtained from the Met police under a freedom of information request.There were 783 counts of stolen watches that were worth at least £3,000 in 2024, compared with 2,054 the year prior, according to the Met’s data. Counts of stolen handbags worth at least £1,000 fell from 2,324 in 2023 to 721 last year. Counts of stolen jewellery, excluding watches, worth at least £1,000 fell from 4,977 to 1,863.The sharp drop coincides with a big crackdown by the Met, with plainclothes officers baiting thieves in crime hotspots after dark. This summer three men were jailed after a Met police investigation into a series of high-value watch robberies in central London. Detectives used CCTV to identify a group of violent repeat offenders, who carried out two robberies in Mayfair on consecutive days.Theft of watches graphicDespite the big drop, the perception of danger still remains among many of the super-rich, especially when it comes to their watches. A store manager in Mayfair said that while he made his living by selling luxury watches, he now told his clients not to wear them on the street.Luxury goods thefts graphicReputations: hard-won, easily lostThe capital’s Berkeley Square, which is bordered by A-list hotspots such as Sexy Fish restaurant and Annabel’s members club, has become a hotspot for late-night watch crime, according to the Watch Register, which works and shares data with the police.The timepieces, which are easier to transport than drugs or cash, have now become an “underworld currency”, the company said. About 20% of watches that it finds are in a different country from where they were stolen.“Luxury watches have become a preferred form of criminal currency due to their high portability across borders, which makes them easier to move than drugs or cash,” said Julian Radcliffe, founder of the Watch Register. “They are small, portable, innocuous items which are only identifiable by serial number.”Not wearing a luxury watch outside is now the standard advice, says Matthew Beer, a director at the security firm King Safety and Security. “There has been a longstanding issue around opportunistic street crime,” he said. “That slowed a little bit with the Met’s response with more tactical interventions but we are still seeing a lot of electric bike-enabled phone theft and watch theft with an unpredictable level of violence associated with that.”It means that for ultra-high net worth clients, there is a greater appetite for “close protection” services – in other words, bodyguards.“Those who would have had protection in the past have a greater appetite for more security,” Beer said. “So where we once had a security driver and one close protection officer, we are now pushing that out so family members also receive protection.”Crimes graphicThe numbers suggest demand for security is growing: in 2024, there were 4,650 applications for a close protection licence from the Security Industry Authority, a 33% rise compared with the year before. Last year the regulator awarded 187,113 qualifications across the industry, an increase of 5%, which includes services such as the transport of cash and valuables, door supervision and security guarding.“More established travellers, perhaps someone who comes from an environment that is historically more dangerous, they would still view London as a relatively safe place to be,” Beer added.“Younger clients who are more engaged on social media; their understanding of it is perhaps a little clearer. You don’t need to be ultra-high net worth individual to be a target: [you are] if you have a reasonably nice watch or carrying a designer handbag.”Steven Helliwell, of the security consultants Aldermans, said: “I think the police are under strain as [political] protests continue; that is a lot of distraction. But it is during times of economic stress that is when people are motivated to turn to crime.”Even so, it has not been enough to drive off the super-rich, he said. “Some of the high net worth clients we have got like football stars, they will just strengthen the preventions that they have got. They still want to reside in London because it is a great city.”A spokesperson for the Met police said: “Tackling violent crime in all of its forms is one of the Met’s priorities and we have reduced the number of personal robberies across London by 12% since April.“Uniform and plainclothed officers proactively patrol robbery hotspots to identify offences taking place, but more importantly to help prevent and deter offenders from committing them in the first place.”Explore more on these topicsLondonCrimeThe super-richnewsShareReuse this content"

Siblings squabbling – again? Readers and experts share their tried and tested fixes to parenting nightmaresRhiannon EvansSat 11 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTShareView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Tim Alexander/The GuardianGetting out of the houseSmart speakers are a great parenting crutch, whether it be for setting a timer (kids seem to be weirdly obedient to them) or asking Alexa for homework help when the kids put you on the spot. But reader Katie Matthews has hacked the parenting matrix. “I used to have to nag repeatedly to get the kids out of the house,” she says. “Now our Google speaker announces a five-minute warning before we need to leave. They know they have to do their last bits of faffing when they hear that warning. Then the speaker announces, ‘Shoes on, let’s go!’ when it’s time to leave. It really has transformed our mornings.”Mealtime mustsGetting your child to endure thetortureof eating the food that has been lovingly prepared for them can be painful. But this sweet tip comes tried and tested from author Holly Bourne: “Making my daughter ‘ice-cream’ for breakfast – with blended avocado, banana, strawberries and full-fat Greek yoghurt – has been a gamechanger. It’s important not to ‘trick’ kids into eating healthy food, so she helps us make it and sees what goes into the blender, but doesn’t seem to mind if it’s becoming ice-cream.”While some of us fret about snacking, reader Sarah de Malplaquet says giving her six-year-old a snack plate of raw vegetables before dinner has improved mealtimes. “He happily munches through veggies he would reject at dinner, and then the pressure is off when we sit down to eat as we know he’s already had a variety of vegetables.”And if the dinner table has become a war zone, Sue from Norwich has a suggestion: “When sharing something tasty between two boys, one would cut and the other would get to choose which half they’d like.”Some parents have had great success in actually handing over the cooking responsibilities. Jo from Berkshire shares: “When my son was seven, his grandmother taught him to make a cheese omelette, and now he’ll make that for breakfast for the whole family at any opportunity, because it makes him feel responsible. There’s something about giving kids a role in the family that pushes them a bit – and they feel like it’s something grownup and maybe a bit dangerous! That’s been a real parenting win.”Day tripsNadia from London has an idea that sounds such fun you’ll be booking a day out asap. “I’ve always loved museums,” she says, “but they can be overwhelming for children. For decades now, I’ve done something called ‘playing postcards’. We do the museum backwards, visiting the gift shop first. Each child gets to choose three postcards. Then they take it in turns to find that particular artwork in the museum and give us a little information about the piece from the details on the postcard, or from any gallery plaque. At the end of this treasure-hunt-style activity, we vote for our favourite in the cafe.”Give children a choice of day trips. If you’ve got more than one child, make sure they know whose turn it is to choose and stick to that – children love fairnessIf even deciding where to go is a trial, Deb from Dorset says she gives her children a choice – and smaller kids will usually go for the last of three options, so make that your preference. “They are really happy it’s their choice,” she says. “If you’ve got more than one child, make sure they know whose turn it is to choose and be absolutely rigorous in sticking to that – children love fairness.”HygienehacksOn dealing with kids’ personal hygiene, Pip from London says, “‘Try for three, then ask for me’ is a great mantra – it’s been good for bum-wiping at least.”And when it comes to younger children, Caroline from Derby says, “When cutting a baby’s fingernails, put them in a high chair so you’ve got both arms free to hold a reluctant baby arm – it also works for brushing teeth and administering medicine.”To get kids into the bath, Anna from Manchester suggests saying something like: “I bet you can’t get into the bath by the time I count to 10 – and if you do, I’ll do a silly dance.” Battling to then get them out again? Try this from Catherine in Birmingham: “My baby hates getting out of the bath and it used to start a pre-bedtime tantrum. Now we say goodbye to the bath toys and put them away one by one as the bath water drains out. She’s eventually sitting in an empty bath and is then happy to move on to the next stage of the bedtime routine.”And if you’ve been worn down by chasing reluctant kids with SPF, reader Carly shares this genius idea: “Apply sunscreen or moisturiser with a tanning mitt. It takes 30 seconds to do a whole body and goes on more evenly.”Making playtime funView image in fullscreenIllustration: Tim Alexander/The GuardianTo break up the tedium of parenting, Julia Pegg from Sheffield suggests: “When times get tough on my 87th read of Paw Patrol: Pups Save Adventure Bay, I imagine I’m a minor celebrity on CBeebies Bedtime Story. I look into the ‘camera’ and give the performance of a lifetime. I can suddenly do voices, tone and inflection with much greater ease, and convey all the feelings I can muster. It seems silly, but it definitely lifts the monotony.”Sean, a headteacher and father of two, offers a mental shift that helps him: “I remind myself that one day they won’t ask me to play Lego or dinosaurs – that makes me enjoy it while I can.”Toothbrush troubles“My two-year-old hated having her teeth brushed,” says reader Megan. “Now, every time we brush her teeth I pretend to be a vet and she gets to choose which kind of animal she wants to be. So I brush her teeth while she roars at me like a lion or a tiger, and we have a great time!”Hannah Ostroumoff from Bristol says swapping the advised “pea-size” amount of toothpaste for “a tiny smidgen” has worked “like magic” for her son, and as he gets used to it, she slowly increases the amount.Justbehave!There are moments you feel you’d do anything to get your kids to stop fighting, screaming or causing chaos. “When the kids are driving me up the wall, I call on a piece of advice a friend gave me: take them outside or put them in water, whether that’s a bath or playing with a water gun,” says Katharine from Exeter. “The change of environment really helps with de-escalating a tantrum.”Emily from London plays “you’re not allowed to laugh” when her three children kick off. The idea is the children can be as sad or furious as they need to be, but they mustnotlaugh. “Any smile or giggle, we pounce on with ‘No laughing, you’re supposed to be cross!’ Within minutes, they’re all usually laughing hysterically. I don’t know why it works, but it’s saved me many times.”For older kids, Jo from Berkshire found her lot really took to a Dragons’ Den-style system that makes them consider their constant requests: “We bought stamps that say ‘approved’ and ‘denied’, so if the kids want something, or want to persuade us of something, they have to write a proposal – which has been really good for my son who’s dyslexic and doesn’t like writing – and submit it. Then they get a stamp whether they’re going to get it or not.”Opening upGetting your kid to communicate their worries is a constant anxiety for parents, whatever the age of their children. For teenagers, Vic from London finds this works: “When my daughters are stressed by school or friendship issues, I ask them if they’d like my advice or if they’d just like me to listen – 90% of the time, they just want me to listen. They’ve got some of it out of their system and I have a better handle on their life.”Ask, ‘How do you feel today?’ not ‘What did you do today?’ when you want to chatDuring the primary years, Ainslie from Bristol is a proponent of “golden time”. “At bedtime, after we’ve brushed teeth and read stories, there is a quieter period when we snuggle up,” she says. “This is golden time when, if they want to, the kids can say anything, ask anything, confess anything without fear of judgment or getting into trouble. They don’t always use it – but it’s there if needed.”Lorraine Candy, an author and host of the podcast Postcards from Midlife, suggests a simple swap she used when talking to teens: “Ask, ‘How do you feel today?’ not ‘What did you do today?’ when you want to chat.”Keeping in touchGetting a teenager to talk to you in person is one thing – contact outside the home is another. Candy’s trick to get her kids to reply to messages is revelatory. “They just don’t reply when you ask where they are, what they are doing, or need them to confirm anything!” she says. “The one thing that does get a response is a picture. When my eldest went Interrailing, I knew I wouldn’t hear much from her, but every time I sent a picture of the dog in her bedroom, or one of her siblings doing something daft, she replied. Questions can feel intrusive, but pictures of homelife are reassuring and comforting, reinforcing their connection to you, and it starts the conversations you want to have.”Screen-time whinesWhile some of us whip away iPads using the excuse that they “need a charge”, Chloe from London has taken this to the next level by installing a cheap wifi smart plug at the back of her TV, which she can turn off from an app on her phone. “No more physically wrestling the remote control from their fists and no more meltdowns, as it’s just ‘the TV switching itself off because it’s been on for X minutes’,” she says.Lauren from Essex advocates switching off the wifi too: “Sometimes I say it’s broken. I also change the screen-time passwords regularly as they always work them out. I often just hide the iPads – and then forget where I’ve hidden them, which is a bonus.”"

Thrill-seeking climbing influencer Hunter convinces her bestie Becky to do a little immersion therapy after her husband Dan’s sudden death during a climb leaves her fearful, depressed and suicidal. The goal: to climb a decommissioned TV transmission tower deep in the California desert that’s roughly twice the height of the Eiffel Tower. When the rickety ladder that gets them to a tiny platform at the structure’s top falls to smithereens, the women suddenly discover new meanings of SOL. The film is nothing if not an excuse to gloriously parade a series of show-stopping, sweaty-palm scenes, yet it becomes a deeply psychological, intricate twin character study as Mann gradually peels back the layers of Hunter and Becky’s up-and-down friendship, and the latter’s gradual rediscovery of her courage. With word that Fall is being made into a franchise, I am eagerly awaiting the next opportunity to send my adrenal glands into overdrive.Veronica EspositoGaslightOnly onethrillerever hit so hard that its title became apop-psych buzzwordfor a form of emotional manipulation. And, with respect to your toxic ex, no one is better at gaslighting than Charles Boyer’s villainous Gregory. In Victorian-era London, Gregory moves his new wife, Paula (Ingrid Bergman), into a sprawling gilded cage of a townhouse that just so happens to be the site of her aunt’s still-unsolved murder. There, Gregory slowly and systematically attempts to convince Paula she’s insane. George Cukor’s slow burn remains maddening as ever 80 years since its release, anchored by Bergman’s steely, Oscar-winning performance: even as she unravels, she resists shrinking into fragility. I’ve never seen Gaslight in a theater and I’m not sure if I could, because my last rewatch unnerved me so much that I had to pause the film every 10 minutes to pace around my apartment. Do not watch this one without whatever vice you need to unwind nearby. Alaina DemopoulosThe VanishingYou can forget your Ringus, your Exorcists or your 127 Hours, the film that reduced me to a quivering wreck was The Vanishing, a (now fairly obscure) low-key Dutch thriller from 1988 whose brilliance and traumatising effect have been somewhat obscured by the fact that the same director (the late George Sluizer) was persuaded to remake it in Hollywood with a ludicrously reconfigured ending. I saw it when it came out without really knowing what to expect – this was the pre-internet era, when films tended to turn up without deluges of advance information. I won’t give away the big ending, but it is the story of a man whose girlfriend goes missing at a petrol station, and after years of looking for her, confronts a man who offers him the chance to find out what happened to her if he takes a sleeping pill. Well, when he wakes up and flicks on his cigarette lighter, I absolutely lost it, like the rest of the audience. I’m not a drinker but only a bunch of whiskeys in the cinema bar after returned me to any kind of normality.Andrew PulverUncut GemsI first heard ofUncut Gems, fittingly, on Twitter, that locus for terminally anxious scrollers constantly looking for their next hit of controversy. Yet even prepped with ten versions of a tweet hailing the film’s “step on your neck” achievements, I was still stunned by the vise-like grip ofboiling anxietythat is the Safdie brothers’ 2019 magnum opus. In thefirst nine minutes and 59 secondsalone (which Netflix put on YouTube as evidence that Uncut Gems is “quite possibly the most stressful movie of all time”), Diamond District dealer Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) gets a colonoscopy, places a risky bet, gets accosted by hired goons for failing to pay back a $100,000 loan, screams at his loanshark as negotiation, screams at his mistress for no reason, and pawns something from the Weeknd for $23,500. And that is the least stressful part of the movie. The rest is an unrelenting downward spiral of bad bets, Hail Marys, high-risk bullshitting and Howie being, at minimum, incredibly pushy. My cortisol levels have never been the same.Adrian HortonFull TimeIf the sound of a morning alarm or a closing train door reliably gives you a hit of anxiety, you may need to approach this most relatable of urban thrillers with caution. Laure Calamy is superb inFull Time, brittle and grimly aware of each looming obstacle, as Julie, a single mother battling through each day, running on fumes. Her daily schedule pivots on perfect timing – the school run, to the suburban train to her cleaning job in the city – just as her household depends on that chambermaid wage and her ex’s alimony cheques. But the threads unravel – the money is late, the childminder resigns, and a strike cancels all the trains – just when Julie has the chance of an interview for a life-changing job. French-Canadian director Eric Gravel keeps the camera lurching with Julie from crisis to crisis and manipulates a score of rushing electronic beats and antagonising ambient noise, as her taxing routine turns into a desperate, dangerous race.Pamela HutchinsonHer SmellIn the first segment of Alex Ross Perry’s swirling, strange, ultimately uplifting rock-and-roll dramaHer Smell,Elisabeth Moss’s tortured frontwoman Becky Something tears around a concert venue greenroom, haranguing friends, family and collaborators in a drug-addled, mental-health-crisis frenzy. It’s utterly harrowing; Perry and Moss make us desperate for a door, a window, or some other egress through which we might escape this storm. But no such deliverance is available. We must instead sit with Becky as she hits something like rock bottom. Catharsis, even sweetness, comes later in Perry’s garrulous and lovely film. But those beginning minutes are excruciating, verging on unwatchable. What is brilliant about the film is how Perry stops just short of total alienation. And how Moss, in career-best work, allows us brief glimpses of the wounded humanity rippling underneath Becky’s horrible behavior. One hates to watch it, butHer Smelldoes eventually reward the viewer for their commitment to sticking it out. It is a beautiful metaphor for what it is to know and love an addict.Richard LawsonBaby BoyIt doesn’t matter how many more Fast & Furious movies Tyrese Gibson stars in or R&B songs he drops on the side. For those of us who opted into seeing Baby Boy when it released in 2001 or were forced into rewatching it from the endlessly replays across cable TV through the decades, he will always be Jody, the titular man child with an exasperating lack of self-awareness. Jody professes to love his girlfriend, Yvette (Taraji P Henson), but won’t give up womanizing. He takes umbrage with his mother taking in a boyfriend (Ving Rhames) even though his 20-year-old hide has no business still living at home. He takes himself for a street thug and immediately retreats into cowardice whenever he comes up against a real alpha (Snoop Dogg’s Rodney). Believe it or not Baby Boy was actually marketed as a coming-of-age film, but Jody gets scared straight instead of learning and growing on his own. And even though director John Singleton really nailed the inviolate narcissism that is seemingly at the core of every wannabe gangster, it just makes Baby Boy all the more uncomfortable to sit with.Andrew LawrenceClockwiseWhy isn’t Clockwise –Michael Frayn’s immaculate comedy in which John Cleese’s headmaster tries to get to Norwich in time to deliver a speech – more exhausting to watch? It does, after all, tap into a remarkably universal nightmare. I think it’s because Cleese absorbs the trauma on the viewer’s behalf. Brian Stimpson came six years after Basil Fawlty and, despite superficial similarities, is a sympathetic and plausible character: a martyr attempting to muzzle his bark, a man well-intentioned beneath the ramrod moustache, the victim of more than his own belligerent efficiency. Cleese is startlingly good and subtle, too – I’m now certainDaniel Day-Lewisnicked the intonation of his milkshake speech in There Will Be Blood from Stimpson’s final meltdown. A word, too, for the fringe stresses endured by Penelope Wilton (weeping kidnapped in a car stuck in a field), and by Alison Steadman and Geoffrey Palmer, both stuck at some point wrangling three elderly women with dementia. The way Palmer’s gallant patience frays into hysteria is especially great. And for the actors playing those women: Constance Chapman, who only wants to go to the loo or the hospital, Joan Hickson, who monologues constantly about an inheritance dispute involving sherry glasses, and – most wonderful – Ann Way, entirely charming and delighted regardless of circumstance. I had forgotten the moment Steadman is speaking to an irate woman on her very suburban doorstep when Way pops up to ask: “Can we see over the house? Is it open today?” I will never forget her trilling rendition of This Is My Lovely Day over the climactic car crash. Clockwise is stress elevated to pure elegance, and a really underrated breakdown.Catherine ShoardGood TimeBefore going their separate ways, theSafdie brothers(Benny and Josh) made their names synonymous with panic-inducing, anxiety-attack cinema; their films hanging to characters trapped and suffocated by their own worst impulses. The high-stakes gambling thriller Uncut Gems is the sibling duo’s most entertaining – what with the flash, the comedy and the Sandler of it all. ButGood Time, starring a fearless and magnificentRobert Pattinsonas a conman named Connie, is the one that gets under your skin; especially since skin colour is the capital Connie preys on. He flails between robbing a bank and extorting drug dealers, all in a bid to keep his developmentally delayed brother (played by co-director Benny) out of group homes or jail. Connie has our sympathy. What makes Good Time so unbearably stressful and unsettling is how he takes advantage of that. He pleads and barters, at times politely, always with a desperation that masks his own entitlement. Connie’s unfortunate circumstances outweigh the hardships of the Black people in his orbit, who he victimizes or scapegoats, in this unnerving portrait of being down and out – and clinging to white privilege when that’s all you got.Radheyan SimonpillaiPunch-Drunk LoveIn retrospect,Paul Thomas Andersondoesn’t really love to inflict suffering on his characters. More of his movies end on an optimistic note than not. But back in 2002, when he had far fewer movies under his belt, that didn’t seem quite so obvious – and moreover, his romantic comedyPunch-Drunk Lovedoes such a great job simulating the feeling of a waking nightmare or rising panic attack that during my first viewing, I watched with my fists clenched and sweaty, terrified that something tragic would befall Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), the meek but occasionally rage-prone hero of the piece, or Lena Leonard (Emily Watson), his unlikely love interest. Anderson particularly uses Sandler’s capacity for violence, played off for slapstick laughs in his broad comedies, as a constant threat; you’re not really afraid he will attack Lena, but that he’ll take an intense wrong turn off of a physical or psychological cliff without the armor a normal feelgood (or self-aggrandizing) Sandler comedy provides. Despite that weird intensity, the movie is still frequently hilarious, even romantic; it’s a high-wire act all the more impressive for still working, in its way, as a rom-com. Subsequent viewings, one you know where it is going, play a little differently. But that first time back in 2002 was a different experience entirely. Sandler, of course, would go on to star in the anxiety-inducing Uncut Gems, which I would bet good money is someone else’s choice in this roundup. Who knew the Chanukah Song guy would become such an expert in this form of cinematic stress?Jesse Hassenger4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 DaysGuardian writers on their ultimate feelgood movies: ‘Radical in its own way’Read moreI remember going to see Cristian Mungiu’s Palme d’Or winner4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Dayson a date. I was aware of its plot in the vaguest of terms but it was a choice made more as a 23-year-old trying to impress a slightly pretentious yet thoroughly handsome older academic, pretending that I had absolutely zero interest in watchingAlien vs Predator: Requieminstead. Before the film had started, we were holding hands in the dark, naively unaware of what was about to unfold, and then it began, with a ticking clock and a nosebleed and we were off to the races. What I had assumed would be a considered arthouse drama slowly morphed into one of the most uncomfortably suspenseful thrillers I had ever seen, made that much harder to watch because of how awfully naturalistic it all was. A young woman, Otilia, tries to help her friend Găbița get a black-market abortion in late 80s Romania and every stage of their potentially lethal quest is a nail-biter. But while the procedure itself is obviously a nightmare to watch, it’s the scene soon after that got me. Otilia has left Găbița alone in the hotel room to let it take hold, given impossibly strict instructions by a vile and short-tempered abortionist, and must grimly endure inane dinner talk with her boyfriend’s family, her mind visibly racing toward every awful conclusion. It was at this point that I realised my palms were sweating and, awkwardly, so did my date, gently removing his hand from mine and giving it a wipe.Benjamin LeeExplore more on these topicsFilmUncut GemsPaul Thomas AndersonDrama filmsThrillersAdam SandlerMichael FraynfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Half awake, I call out in a hoarse voice to my two sisters who are sleeping on their beds next to me: “Enas, Remas, wake up – you have school.”We were not to know it yet, but this was the day when everything would change. The day when horrific events across the border in Israel would lead to a war that became a gateway to hell itself.View image in fullscreenMalak Tantesh and her father, Amjed Tantesh, in the ruins of their home in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianI went back to sleep, not caring much whether my sisters woke up or not. My university classes started a little later at eight in the morning. Then suddenly came the sound of rockets firing. I could not tell if I was still dreaming.But soon my sisters and I were wide awake, and at first we told ourselves they were test rockets and would fall into the sea, so we didn’t care much, until the sound grew so loud it was impossible to ignore.Rumours started spreading – “maybe one of Hamas’s top leaders was assassinated, maybe Hamas was attacking Israel”, but everyone was guessing. Not comprehending what was happening, we waited for any confirmed piece of news.My uncle and his family came, still in their sleepwear and extremely agitated, since they live near the Israeli border. They were in a state of terror, their clothes messy, the interrupted sleep and their panicked departure visible on their faces.Some videos began to appear on social media showing Hamas storming into Israel and capturing dozens of people and taking them back toGaza. We could not grasp the scale of what had just happened.‘I expect to find a ghost city’: Gaza residents on the long, arduous journey back homeRead moreAnd then, the Israeli response began: a lot of bombing in all directions, the windows of the house trembling, and with them our hearts trembling, the sound of ambulances, all kinds of aircraft, and the cries of children.We have become used to war, and as in every war we have experienced, we started packing some of our belongings. We did not expect to be gone for long, so we only took the clothes we were wearing and one extra change, and gathered up the most important documents, putting them in school bags.On Friday 13 October, the pace of bombing on Beit Lahia increased. Leaflets were dropped telling us to evacuate. At that time we were afraid and reluctant to comply, but later that day, when we were making Thai food for dinner, the Israeli army started dropping smoke bombs on our houses until the city was covered with smoke. A state of terror broke out among our neighbours and everyone started running out of their homes, leaving everything behind. As for us, we left in our car, taking with us my grandfather and grandmother and our family of seven, and headed south for the first time.View image in fullscreenThe view over Beit Lahia from the roof of Tantesh’s grandfather’s house in February 2025.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianWe did not know what was waiting for us. We thought we would stay for two or three weeks and then return.We did not expect that we would face dozens of wars instead of one.The second war we faced was finding a place to stay. We didn’t know where to go, we just kept moving south with no specific destination, our feelings swinging between fear, loss and hesitation. We ended up in an apartment in Deir, where we lived for three months, sleeping on the cold floor with no blankets or bed clothes. And there were the other wars, such as getting water and food, and the short life of the tents we had to live in.Despite obeying the evacuation orders and heading south, we found nowhere was safe. Not a day passed without the sounds of explosions, the roar of warplanes, shells and bullets fired by Israeli naval boats. We always imagined waking up to find the wall of the apartment falling on us. I had visions of remaining alive, alone amid rubble, screaming for my family but getting no response. We wrote our names on a piece of paper and put it in our pockets in case the house was bombed and we all died, so that paper would serve as an identity card if our faces were erased.View image in fullscreenMalak Tantesh with family members in northern Gaza.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianWhen we felt the danger getting closer, we decided to go and live in tents in Rafah. The situation was a little better than living in an apartment, and at least those nightmares stopped. In the first week we were very happy, imagining it was our first camping trip in rainy winter weather, but what we didn’t know the challenge we would face in getting water and food, and in contending with the punishing, severe cold. We were constantly falling ill.My younger brother Ibrahim and I were infected with Hepatitis A, suffering so much that sometimes we felt as though we were dying. There was no medicine. All we could do was take strict safety and hygiene measures so that the rest of the family wouldn’t get infected.Blair, Kushner, Trump: who are the key people behind the Gaza ceasefire?Read moreWhen the ground invasion of Rafah began, we moved many times from one place to another, living in tents. It is hard to describe the feeling of being forced to live in this way. Only those who have experienced it can fully understand it.Faced with a lack of clean and safe food and water, we had to stand for hours and walk long distances to get them. We endured extreme heat in summer, turning to bitter cold in winter. On top of that were the insects, rats and stray animals. Our education and healthcare, our simplest rights, simply evaporated.During our displacement in Khan Younis, my grandmother fell ill. She struggled with the illness for weeks until it overcame her. She stayed in the hospital for a week, receiving treatment that was not sufficient due to the large number of cases, which caused dozens to die weekly, and then my grandmother was among them.View image in fullscreenPeople carry an injured man after Israeli airstrikes in Beit Lahia, Gaza, in October 2023.Photograph: Amez Habboub/Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe pain of losing her was very hard. She was a second mother to me. She had lived with us since I was born and took care of us while my mother was busy with her studies.After my grandmother’s death, we started trying to build a life in the south since hope of returning to the north had vanished. My father and uncles started planting some crops to make us feel like we were back home in Beit Lahia, and this indeed helped us move forward and gave us a little sense of security. Then came the ceasefire in January 2025. I still remember the joy of the residents returning to the north, where almost all of them returned on the first day without taking much with them. Others, out of excitement, burned their tents thinking that the suffering in the south had ended.We returned to Beit Lahia. Sadness engulfed its corners, its destroyed houses and its dry fields, the silence hanging over its streets serving to tell its returning residents what had happened after they were forced to leave.View image in fullscreenLeaflets are dropped by the Israeli military, urging evacuation in September 2025.Photograph: Omar Al-Qattaa/AFP/Getty ImagesWe began trying to rebuild, clearing the rubble and stones, putting up tents next to the destroyed houses and planting some new plants to break the grey colour and give everyone hope that life could bloom again. But that hope vanished. The war came back to burn everything once more.Palestinians displaced to southern Gaza begin journey home as ceasefire comes into effectRead moreFear and anxiety returned as we once more moved from one place to another, amid explosion after explosion, death after death. I lost my dear uncle Bahjat, killed by a tank shell while he and my father were collecting some of our possessions from an old shelter. Two weeks later, we were displaced yet again and rented an apartment in Gaza City.This was a bigger and worse siege than the one before, and we started suffering from hunger, which caused the death of hundreds – children and the elderly. We would share one loaf of bread between us all, and sometimes, when we couldn’t find any bread to eat, we went to sleep hungry, trying to stave it off by drinking water, which often came to us contaminated.View image in fullscreenAmjed Tantesh, Malak’s father, hugs the tree he planted before the beginning of the war in Beit Lahiya after finding it had grown.Photograph: Enas Tantesh/The GuardianThen, out of nowhere, came the plan to occupy Gaza City, and we were forced to evacuate to the south yet again.This week, when the ceasefire deal was announced, the streets filled with whistling and cheering and everyone started jumping and dancing with joy, hoping that this time the war would end for ever. But they remain afraid it might fail at the last moment, preparing themselves for the worst, so they are not struck down with despair if it does collapse.I look back on how my life was the day before 7 October: going to work to teach girls swimming, then celebrating my cousin’s wedding, where we had all gathered happily, wearing dresses and putting on lots of makeup. I remember my university, where I only stayed for one month. I remember my grandmother and my uncle Bahjat, whose death we sometimes envied. I am sure all the people of Gaza have such memories dancing in their minds: family meals, friends – many now dead – the normal and everyday. We all wonder if we will ever get the chance to live such lives again.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza: two years onGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineIsrael-Gaza warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has also confirmed his attendance.There was no immediate word about whether Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu would be in Sharm el-Sheikh. Hamas has said it will not take part.On Saturday, three Qatari diplomats were killed in a car crash at the Red Sea resort, two security sources told Reuters. Two diplomats were also wounded, the security sources said.The summit was arranged after Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire and prisoner-swap deal after intense indirect negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh in recent days. More than 67,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in Israel’s assault on Gaza. The war began after a Hamas-led incursion into Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.The negotiations, mediated by Egypt, Qatar and Turkey, and involving US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, precipitated the truce and subsequent increase of humanitarian aid into Gaza.The announcement came as thousands of Palestiniansjourneyed along the north of Gazaon Saturday, trekking by foot, car and cart back to what was left of their homes.“It is an indescribable feeling; praise be to God,” Nabila Basa told Reuters, as she travelled by foot with her daughter, who she said had suffered a head wound in the war. “We are very, very happy that the war has stopped, and the suffering has ended.”For many in Gaza, there is no home to return to, as the war has reduced their neighbourhoods to dust after two years of heavy bombardment.“My house, which I built 40 years ago, was gone in a moment,” said Ahmed al-Jabari, as he stood in the wreckage of a Gaza City street. “I’m happy that there is no blood, no killing (but) where will we go?

Her family want justice, but the CPS won’t charge him and the police can’t find himHannah Al-OthmanSat 11 Oct 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 11 Oct 2025 12.01 EDTShareOn 26 April 2020 Georgia Barter, a long-term victim of domestic abuse, died in hospital after taking a fatal overdose of painkillers. Last week, in an extraordinary verdict, a coroner ruled that Georgia, 32, was unlawfully killed by her abusive partner.A court heard how GPs, nurses and police officers all had chances to intervene in Thomas Bignell’s violent campaign against Georgia, but failed to do so.At the conclusion of the hearing, there were gasps in the courtroom. It is believed to be only the second time in English legal history that a coroner has reached such a conclusion in the case of a suicide following domestic abuse, and the first time without a jury.The coroner said she could not be certain whether Georgia intended to take her own life; she had told her mother that she just wanted the “physical and mental pain to stop”.The CPS has previously said there is insufficient evidence to bring charges. But Georgia’s family want this to be reconsidered following the coroner’s ruling that her death was unlawful. Bignell did not attend the inquest and when police tried to bring him in under a warrant, they couldn’t find himThis is Georgia’s story.“She had this amazing halo of golden curls,” Kay Barter says of her daughter. “Which she hated, and everybody loved. The lollipop man at primary school used to call her Shirley Temple.”As mother and daughter, they were incredibly close. Georgia, she recalls, was “very loving, very kind, and caring”.“She’d ring me every day from work, three or four times a day, to see how I was. She’d always tell me, every phone call, ‘I love you, Mum.’”Entering her early 20s, Georgia had a big group of friends, who she enjoyed going out with at night. She was close to her two sisters, and loved spending time with her family.View image in fullscreenThomas BignellGeorgia had been a painfully shy child, so, at the age of four, Barter enrolled her in dance lessons.“And she shone,” Barter says. “She loved it from the first lesson, and she gained in confidence because of that, and her happy time was being on stage and performing.“She won many, many medals over the years, but that was never who Georgia was. She just wanted to take part, she just loved being up there.”Georgia dreamed of being a professional dancer but knew the odds were against her, so she began working in recruitment instead. But, Barter says, “she always regretted not carrying on with her [dance] career”.Georgia was also generous to a fault. She once noticed lots of small transactions leaving her bank account every month, and didn’t know where the money was going, until she realised they were all the charities she had signed up to donate to.And “she was so funny”, Barter says. “She was an amazing mimic, and we used to say she could be a standup comedian. Her sense of humour was just fantastic. She used to have us all in hysterics.”When Georgia was 19, she was sexually assaulted by a man after a night out. Her attacker was later convicted and jailed, but Georgia was deeply affected by the assault, found the the trial traumatic – particularly cross-examination by his defence counsel – and was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression.Not long after, she was introduced to Bignell, then going by the name Ryan Johnson, by a friend, and the pair began a relationship, which, her mother says, quickly became very intense.The inquest at EastLondoncoroner’s court heard that throughout their 11-year on-off relationship, Georgia was subjected to domestic abuse and coercive control.“There were many, many times throughout the relationship where I noticed he had marked Georgia,” Barter told the court. “He thought nobody could see it.” Once, she says, her daughter “looked like a victim of a road traffic accident”.Barter told the court that Georgia was controlled by Bignell financially. He would move her to live in different places, she would be forced to quit jobs and he would deprive her of basic necessities, such as food, hot water and electricity.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Barter as a childEvidence from a paramedic, James Lambert, detailed how Georgia had been taken to hospital in April 2020 after she told her sister she had taken an overdose. Lambert’s notes, read to the court, said she told him Bignell had kicked her and stamped on her face; her injuries were consistent with her description, the court heard.Lambert said Georgia had bruising on her arm consistent with grab marks. Addressing Lambert, as she read from his statement, the assistant coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said: “She told you he’d done this before, and was a violent man.”It was not the first time medics had treated injuries Georgia said were caused by Bignell.A few weeks earlier, the court heard, she had arrived at a hospital in Kent bleeding, having told ambulance staff that Bignell had sexually assaulted her. Georgia left the hospital with the cannula still in her arm; it is believed she left with Bignell, the inquest heard. Hospital staff phoned Georgia and asked her to return, but she did not. The police were not informed.A nurse did make a safeguarding referral, which resulted in a call from a domestic abuse charity, but not until several weeks later. A spokesperson for East Kent hospitals said: “We offer our condolences to Georgia Barter’s family.”In 2012, Surrey police were called to reports that Bignell had hit and kicked Georgia at a hotel. He was arrested and taken into custody, but was not charged in relation to the alleged assault.A spokesperson for Surrey police said they were not a named party in the inquest but “we will review any findings from the coroner if they are shared [with] our force”.View image in fullscreenThe inquest heard the Met andEssexpolice received multiple reports about Bignall’s alleged abuse of Georgia, including once when a member of the public told Essex police that Bignell had made threats to kill Georgia.Although Bignall was arrested several times, he was never charged with any violent offences against Georgia.A spokesperson for Essex police said on one of its three contacts with Georgia “the service provided by officers did not reach the incredibly high standards we would expect”.“At the conclusion of Georgia’s inquest, the coroner did not suggest any failings by Essex police caused or contributed to her death but did highlight missed opportunities from police forces and health organisations,” the spokesperson said.“In the six years since Essex police attended the third of the three incidents, we have made significant strides in the identification, awareness and response to coercive and controlling behaviour.”Bignell had at least one conviction related to violence againstanother woman, however no disclosures were made to Georgia under Clare’s law, which allows police forces to provide women with information about a partner’s violent past.And when he was arrested in relation to alleged assaults on Georgia, officers apparently did not have either the capacity or the authorisation to check the police national database, so were not aware of the full extent of his alleged offending history across at least four police areas.After Georgia’s death, Bignell was investigated again and theMetropolitan policepassed a file to the CPS, but it declined to charge him with any offences due to insufficient evidence. After Georgia’s family requested a review of the case, again, the CPS did not authorise charges.Research found that 2024 was the second year in a row where suicides following domestic abuse outnumbered homicides by partnersAs the details of the couple’s relationship were laid out before the coroner, what appears to be a litany of missed opportunities emerged.Bignell was due to give evidence at the inquest into Georgia’s death but he did not appear. A bench warrant for his attendance was issued but, the court heard, police had not been able to find him.His mother, Lesley, gave evidence, saying she had never witnessed any abuse of Georgia by her son. “It’s shocking if it’s true,” she told the inquest. “But I can’t believe that, knowing Tom as a character and a person.”The Guardian was not able to reach Thomas Bignell for comment.Georgia had reported the domestic abuse with several different health services. At no pointin the years before her death was a multi-agency risk assessment conference referral made – a meeting of professionals designed to safeguard someone at risk from serious domestic abuse. Such referrals can be made without the consent of the person concerned.In March 2020, Georgia visited a GP, Dr Jakir Ullah, and disclosed that she had been assaulted by her boyfriend. He offered to make a safeguarding referral, he told the court, but Georgia declined, and he said he did not want to make one against her wishes.The year before, she had disclosed domestic abuse to another GP, Dr Philomina Mridha, who, again, had not made a safeguarding referral.Georgia had been referred to mental health services, but was on a waiting list for individual therapy. She had been offered group therapy, but did not feel this was suitable. “In that situation,” Barter says, “the last thing you want is to sit in a room full of strangers, and she was just put on another waiting list.“Also, she was assessed by the mental health team, and that’s when she was put on a six-month-plus waiting list, and she was advised to read a self-help book by Jeffrey Young, How to Reinvent Your Life.”A spokesperson for the East London NHS foundation trust said: “We have reviewed the coroner’s report and acknowledge matters of concern raised.“We remain fully committed to learning from lessons in relation to mental health assessments and monitoring of risk while people are awaitinginterventions.”The umbrella of public services that was meant to protect Barter’s daughter failed to do so, she says. “The failings are systemic.”Policeofficers and health professionals, she believes, failed to understand the extent of the impact that domestic abuse and coercive control can have on a woman’s life, health and presentation.Barter says that, as a result of the abuse, Georgia had turned to alcohol, and often when the police turned up, she and Bignell had been drinking. This, Barter believes, is in part why her daughter’s cries for help were dismissed.“I believe there’s a systemic failure in the police force, not just in London, everywhere, and I believe that these young women, they’re judged,” she says. “Georgia said she felt judged. She felt ashamed and judged, and this is what the police forces made these women feel like.“I still believe a lot of police officers believe these women are just as bad, because if they weren’t, why don’t they leave? If only they realised, if only they understood, the impact of coercive control on these women.”The coroner stated: “On or around 5 April 2020 [Georgia] had been assaulted by her long-term partner, who had been violent towards her on a number of occasions during their relationship.“There was clear evidence of her being an individual with a psychiatric history of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression which had been exacerbated by her partner’s behaviour.”View image in fullscreenThe order of service for Georgia Barter’s funeralInquests have a different burden of proof to criminal courts, finding on the balance of probabilities, rather than the criminal threshold of beyond reasonable doubt. There is no criminal due process and nobody is convicted or acquitted. Bignell has not been charged with or convicted of any offences in criminal court in relation to his alleged violence towards Georgia or her death.Last year, research found that for the second year in a row, suicides following domestic abuse had outnumbered homicides by partners. The Domestic Homicide Project found that in the year to March 2024, 98 people were suspected to have killed themselves after experiencing domestic abuse, while 80 people were killed by a partner during the same period.Barter wants Bignell to face criminal prosecution for the alleged abuse of Georgia and her death. And she wants police and prosecutors in all cases to make more effort to prosecute alleged perpetrators of domestic abuse before a death.“Justice hasn’t been done,” she says. “Justice hasn’t been served and he’s still a danger to women. He’s been doing this for so long, and there’s so many vulnerable young women out there, and the fact that he’s a DJ, he’ll have the opportunity to meet many young women.“The law must be changed and these suicides must be recognised for what they are. It’s not suicide. These women are crying out in pain. They need to investigate why these women have become so desperate.“I hope this brings much-needed change, and the connection between domestic abuse and coercive control and suicide. This isn’t suicide; this is manslaughter.“And there are so many women that have lost their lives, and they’re too quick to put a label of suicide; they need to look at the bigger picture.”View image in fullscreenThomas BignellThere have only been a handful of cases in which the CPS has sought to bring a prosecution for manslaughter in such circumstances. The most recent was that of Keina Dawes. The 23-year-old hairdresserkilled herself after two years of domestic abuse and violence, leaving a note on her phone that read: “I was murdered. Ryan Wellings killed me,” referring to her former partner.After a six-week trial this year, Wellings was cleared of manslaughter but found guilty of assault and coercive and controlling behaviour, and jailed for six-and-a-half years.After the case, the assistant commissioner Louisa Rolfe, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for domestic abuse, said police forces would seek to charge more domestic abusers with manslaughter after their partners took their own lives.Kate Ellis, from the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “It is suspected that more women actually take their own lives following domestic abuse than are killed by their partners – yet there is a serious failure on the part of authorities to record domestic abuse-related suicides, and there have been hardly any prosecutions for this crime.”It is believed there has only been one successful prosecution of this kind. In 2017, Nicholas Allen, then 47, was given a 15-year extended sentencefor the manslaughter of Justene Reece, 46, who took her own life. She had left a note saying she had “run out of fight” after six months of threats from Allen, who had stalked her after she left him and moved to a women’s refuge.At the conclusion of Georgia’s inquest, Radcliffe issued aprevention of future deaths report, expressing concerns about the failures in the use of the police national database.“There is difficulty for frontline officers in police forces across the country to easily access the police national database to check on individuals who are suspected of domestic abuse,” she wrote.“They are unable to easily identify if the individual has a history of reported domestic abuse in areas outside that force’s borders.”The conclusion marked a key point in the years-long battle for change and justice that Barter has shouldered since her daughter’s death.The family’s solicitor, Clare Hayes, says: “The coroner’s finding of unlawful killing makes it a matter of public record that Georgia died as a result of domestic abuse.“At the inquest, Georgia’s family endured harrowing evidence about the abuse that Georgia suffered over untold years and the barriers to escaping a coercive and controlling relationship.“It is vital that the police and other public services, including health, are galvanised into taking positive, affirmative action to disrupt domestic abuse and offer victims multi-agency support and protection and meaningful escape routes to safety from abuse.”“To everyone, it’s five years [since Georgia’s death],” says Barter. “To me, it’s yesterday. It’ll always be yesterday. It’ll always be my yesterday for the rest of my life. My daughters, they’ve not only lost their beloved sister, they’ve lost their mum, my grandsons have lost their nan. My family is broken.”Frank Mullane, the chief executive of Advocacy After Fatal Domestic Abuse, a family support charity, says: “I acknowledge Georgia’s suffering and that she tried hard to get help. And I salute Georgia’s mother, Kay, and her family for being so resolute and determined.“As is the case so often, it’s the work of a family seeking justice that ensures justice happens. Their tenacity and measured pressure on public protection services to improve will undoubtedly save lives. And they have ensured that more inquests will conclude that some suicides after domestic abuse are unlawful killings.”DCI Jim Mitchell, from the Met’s north east command unit, says: “While the coroner made no specific criticism of police actions within their findings, we are aware of their intention to write to the Home Office to understand plans to overhaul the police national database. We welcome any changes that make the system a more useful tool for police forces to share information.“As part of an investigation following Ms Barter’s death, the Met investigated all available lines of inquiry and provided a detailed file of evidence to the CPS. Ultimately, it was deemed there was insufficient evidence to pursue this case. We appealed this decision but it was upheld.”A CPS spokesperson said: “These matters underwent rigorous scrutiny by experienced prosecutors. Several offences were considered on our initial review of the evidence presented by police, but we concluded our evidential test for prosecution was not met.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our thoughts are with Georgia’s family and friends at this time.“There is currently an ongoing cross departmental review on modernising policing intelligence system, including the police national database. Our forthcoming Violence Against Women and Girls Strategy will also seek to overhaul the criminal justice response to ensure that more victims are protected and more perpetrators are punished.”The coroner’s historic verdict, says Barter, “is what I was hoping for but I never thought, never thought”. She says she hopes it will lead to greater understanding of issues around coercive control, and ultimately to more men being held accountable.“It’s about all these young women out there that are suffering this abuse,” she says. “And I know my darling Georgia, she’d want to help these women.“If there’s one thing that can come out of our horror and heartbreak, it’s change; to save these young women and girls from the epidemic of domestic abuse and coercive control, because it is, it’s an epidemic.”“All I can hope for now,” she says, “is that my beautiful girl’s death will bring change, and save women’s lives.”In the UK,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123 and thedomestic abuse helplineis 0808 2000 247.

Over the past month, the enemy has increased the number of air attack weapons and although our air defence is about 74% effective, we need to make additional efforts to cover the rear energy sector, critical infrastructure and logistics,” said Syrskyi.Earlier this week, Russia launched 465 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones, as well as 32 cruise and ballistic missiles, against Ukraine.The latest talks between Trump and Zelenskyy come amid ongoing discussions in Washington over whether to provide Ukraine with the Tomahawk cruise missiles Kyiv has long been seeking, a move Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has warned would be a “completely new, qualitatively new stage of escalation”.The phone call between the two leaders comes amid a warming of relations between the US president and Zelenskyy.The Ukrainian president said in his nightly address on Friday that Russia was taking advantage of the world being “almost entirely focused on the prospect of establishing peace in the Middle East”, and called for strengthening Ukraine’s air defence systems and tighter sanctions on Russia.“Russian assets must be fully used to strengthen our defence and ensure recovery,” he said in the video, posted to X.Meanwhile, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in a joint statement on Friday they were ready to coordinate and move toward using “the value of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine’s armed forces and thus bring Russia to the negotiation table”.They aimed to do this “in close cooperation with the United States,” the statement added.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

A man aged 48 was found with serious injuries.

Further details are not available at this time and her loved ones have asked for privacy, according to a family spokesperson.Keaton’s death came as a shock across Hollywood and the rest of the world.

I was very fond of her and the news of her leaving us has taken me totally by surprise. I was not expecting her to leave us. She will be missed. May she rest in peace.”In a statement shared with the Guardian, Meryl Streep, who starred alongside her in Marvin’s Room, called Keaton: “Our American treasure: indelible singular girl and brilliant artist.

I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. She was hilarious, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star.

Other Oscar nominations were earned for her performances in Reds (1981), Marvin’s Room (1996) and Something’s Gotta Give (2003).Meanwhile, dramas such as Looking for Mr Goodbar, Shoot the Moon and The Good Mother established her as an actor unafraid of playing difficult and unlikable women.View image in fullscreenKeaton in Love and Death.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyKeaton and Allen first collaborated on the stage version of Play It Again, Sam, for which she was Tony nominated in 1971, before going on to work together for eight films, including Sleeper (1973), Love and Death (1975) and Manhattan (1979).Diane Keaton: ‘I love Woody. And I believe my friend’Read moreIn 1993, Keaton took on the role written for Mia Farrow inManhattan Murder Mysteryand remained a staunch supporter of Allen after the accusation by Farrow that he had abused their adopted daughter, Dylan.Writing on Instagram in the wake of Keaton’s death, both of Allen’s adopted daughters with his wife, Soon-Yi Allen, posted their tributes to the actor, with Manzie saying she was “absolutely heartbroken”.Keaton went on to make a remarkable number of other popular and landmark comedies as well as those with Allen, including Baby Boom, Father of the Bride (and its sequels), The First Wives Club and Book Club.The sequel to that film, Book Club: The Next Chapter, released in 2023, looks set to be one of the last projects featuring Keaton.Speaking to the Guardian to promote it, she addressed why she chose to remain so prolific, making seven films since the start of the pandemic.“It gives me an opportunity to get to know more people in a different realm,” she said. “I love it. It’s all interesting. It’s never dull, ever, life.”She also explained her love for photographing doors and abandoned shops, which she said she found poignant “because life is haunting! You have an idea in your mind of what it is, or what it should be, or what it could be. But it’s not that at all! It’s just things going up and down!”View image in fullscreenDiane Keaton in a scene from The Godfather (1972).Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyIn 1996, Keaton adopted a daughter, Dexter (named after Cary Grant’s character in The Philadelphia Story), and, four years later, a son, Duke. “Motherhood has completely changed me,” she said. “It’s just about like the most completely humbling experience that I’ve ever had.” Despite well-publicised relationships with some of her co-stars including Pacino andWarren Beatty, she remained unmarried.Keaton cared for her own mother from her diagnosis with Alzheimer’s in 1993 until her death in 2008, and devoted much of her ownautobiographiesto recounting her mother’s life and publishing her diaries.“She was everything to me,” she said of her mother. “She was wonderful. She was my example for what you can do with life. She was the heart of everything that was best.”‘God, life is so strange’: Diane Keaton interviewed in 2023 on dogs, doors, wine and why she’s ‘really fancy’Read moreKeaton was also the chief care-giver to her brother,Randy, who died in 2021, after years of mental-health problems.As well as acting primarily for the big screen, Keaton did some TV work, including as a scheming nun in Jude Law TV series The Young Pope. She also had a sideline flipping properties in the US, as well as lending her name and creativity to ranges of homeware, clothing, glasses and wine.In 2017, she was given alifetime achievement awardby the American Film Institute, in which she thanked her collaborators and sang Seems Like Old Times, the song her character sings in Annie Hall.In 2022, she paid tribute to her parents while putting her hands into cement to be immortalised on the Hollywood walk of Fame, saying she was “still that little Dianey” who dreamed of being a movie star.“As a girl growing up in Orange County, the mere thought of Hollywood Boulevard seemed like a mysterious dream that would never come true,” she said.In December 2024, in what seems likely to be her final performance shared with the public, Keaton released her first single, a festive song calledFirst Christmas, posting the video to Instagram. An enthusiastic adopter of social media, herlast postwas in April to mark National Pet Day, and featured a photograph of the actor with her beloved golden retriever, Reggie.She is survived by her two younger sisters, Dorrie and Robin, as well as by Dexter, 29, and Duke, 25.Explore more on these topicsDiane KeatonWoody AllenAl PacinoWarren BeattyAlzheimer'sHealthDementianewsShareReuse this content"

They claimed to have seized two Pakistani border posts in the southern province of Helmand, which was confirmed by local authorities.Pakistani security officials acknowledged clashes at several border locations, stating they were responding forcefully. “Tonight, Taliban forces began firing at several border points. We retaliated with artillery at four locations along the border,” a Pakistani government official told the Guardian.“We will not tolerate any aggression from the Afghan Taliban within our territory. Pakistani forces responded with heavy fire, effectively targeting several Afghan border posts,” the official added.The Pakistan army used artillery, tanks and both light and heavy weaponry in their counterattacks.On Thursday, two explosions were reported in the Afghan capital and another in southeastern Afghanistan. The Taliban-run defence ministry subsequently accused Pakistan of “violating its sovereignty” in connection with the attacks.Analysts said recent days showed just how deep the border tensions run.Michael Kugelman, a South Asia analyst based in Washington DC, said: “Intensifying cross-border attacks on Pakistani forces, unusually intense Pakistani strikes in Afghanistan, and Taliban retaliations have created a perfect storm for trouble. If you throw in the fact that Afghanistan doesn’t recognise the border, as well as the proliferation of disinformation about the crisis, it all makes for a precarious situation.”Islamabad has expressed growing impatience with Kabul, refraining from confirming or denying involvement in the airstrikes.While Islamabad has not explicitly claimed responsibility for the attacks, it has called on Kabul to cease harbouring the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which is accused of killing hundreds of Pakistani soldiers since 2021 and is believed to have received combat training in Afghanistan, sharing ideological ties with the Afghan Taliban.“Fortunately this crisis, serious as it is, is poised to de-escalate sooner rather than later. The Taliban lack the capacity to fight the Pakistani military head-on, and once the retaliations appease public anger, they’re likely to recede,” said Kugelman.Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military spokesperson, acknowledged reports of the strikes, and said: “To protect the lives of the people of Pakistan, we are doing, and will continue to do, whatever is necessary.” He urged Afghanistan to prevent its territory from being used for terrorism against Pakistan.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst based in Islamabad, said: “I think what we have seen in these few hours is a logical conclusion of the tensions that had been brewing up between the two countries, particularly after the kinetic attacks on TTP hideouts and the continuous refusal of the Afghan regime to take demonstrable conclusive action against the TTP, which is spearheading the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.”Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have been strained in recent months due to Islamabad’s accusations that Kabul is harbouring TTP, which carried out attacks on Pakistan.Kugelman believes for Pakistan “the risk is that its recent strikes in Afghanistan will galvanise TTP to carry out reprisals, which could invite further and perhaps more intense Pakistani operations in Afghanistan.” He said: “And then the cycle could play out again. There are no winners or easy long-term solutions here.“If we see de-escalation now, we’re nowhere near being out of the woods.”The two countries share a nearly 2,600km (1,600 miles) rugged and mountainous border known as the Durand Line.Gul said: “I think Pakistan’s patience had been wearing thin. And that’s why they basically decided to take direct action themselves against TTP leaders. And now, obviously, the Taliban would say that it was a retaliatory attack, retaliatory action.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanPakistanSouth and central AsiaTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

The initial toll had been believed to be 19 people but that figure was later revised.The Humphreys county sheriff, Chris Davis, spoke to the public and media early on Saturday afternoon and revealed that authorities were assuming that anybody who was inside the building that exploded the day before was dead.View image in fullscreenSatellite imagery of Accurate Energetic Systems in McEwen, Tennessee, on 3 April 2021 (top), and on 10 October 2025 (bottom).Photograph: Vantor/AFP/Getty ImagesDavis said the tragedy was even “more devastating” than had been thought. In the close-knit community, he and other members of law enforcement and many in the community know people who were victims of the disaster.The blast was felt for miles as it leveled a building at the 1,300-acre headquarters of Accurate Energetic Systems (AES), which is located in the tiny community of Bucksnort, just south of McEwen, about an hour’s drive west of Nashville.“More than 300 people have been through almost every square inch of this facility, and at this time, we’ve recovered no survivors,” an emotional Davis told reporters early on Saturday afternoon. “It’s a great loss to our communities.”Officials did not offer a precise death toll but have previously said 18 people were unaccounted for. Davis confirmed the operation had shifted from rescue to recovery and that investigators would use DNA testing to confirm the identities of those who are assumed to have died.Investigators, including agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were still working to determine the cause of the explosion, officials said.The presence of explosives and other ordnance at the property has made searching the scene complicated. Initially, first responders were not able to get close to the scene of devastation because of secondary explosions.In a statement on Friday, the company thanked first responders but did not indicate a possible cause.View image in fullscreenHumphreys county sheriff Chris Davis tells reporters no survivors were recovered from the blast, in Bucksnort, Tennessee, on Saturday.Photograph: Obed Lamy/AP“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families, coworkers and community members affected by this incident,” the company said.AES develops, manufactures and stores explosives for “military, aerospace and commercial demolition markets”, according to the company’s website.

We’ve got these songs that we’re working on from back in the day, but it’s hard to make our times tally.View image in fullscreenRonnie Wood, right, and Rod Stewart on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury festival in June.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Hogan Media/Shutterstock“When we do get a chance to get in the studio again, we will finish off these songs. We’ve got a good body of songs going.”He went on to recall tales of when the Faces would tour, which led to them being “banned” from the Holiday Inn hotel chain.Instead, the musicians would have to book pretending to be another rock band. “We weren’t allowed in any hotels. We used to have to check in as Fleetwood Mac,” he said.“It came to a head in Detroit. Ramona her name was, behind the desk, reported us to the police and everything just because we made the hotel room out in the corridor, we just quietly arranged all the furniture out in the corridor.“And then the manager came up and the elevator door opened, and there was this room there with all the pictures on the walls, settees and slippers.“And he said, ‘It’s very nice but it better not be here when I come back’, and he got back in the elevator.”He said the standard of music being produced keeps getting higher, as the Stones prepare to release a new album. The band have released more than a dozen studio albums. The most recent,Hackney Diamonds, came out in 2023.BBC to mark the Rolling Stones’ 60th anniversary with new documentariesRead moreHe said: “We’re always raising the bar, and miraculously, the bar keeps going up and up. We just finished a new album, which is very exciting and we’re at the mixing stage … so I’d say by the end of the year, early next year.”He went on to say he gave up drugs and alcohol in 2010 but not without support from other people.“There’s a period of white knuckling where I needed encouragement and I didn’t know which way to turn and it takes a while to be able to see yourself in the light of getting better, for want of a better phrase, of staying on the path, it’s quite difficult,” he said.“And encouragement and a hand on the shoulder just before going on stage, like from Mick [Jagger] or something, saying you’ll be OK, and to let it go. And OK, let’s go for it.”Explore more on these topicsRonnie WoodRod StewartDesert Island DiscsRadio 4RadionewsShareReuse this content"

Over the past two years, outrage at Israel’s war in Gaza has erupted acrossEuropeand the US, manifesting itself in university campus protests, massive marches through countless capitals and the disruption of major sporting events.Even as hopes rise of an end to the war, international anger over Israel’s actions in Gaza, which have been deemed agenocide by a UN commission of inquiry, remains raw, as evidenced by last weekend’shuge rallies in Spain and Italy.Boycotting Israel has gone mainstream: ‘We’ve never seen such traction before’Read moreWhile the fury that fuels them has been shared and ubiquitous, the demonstrations – and the authorities’ responses to them – have varied considerably from country to country. If some of the official reactions have been draconian, there have also been exceptions, especially in countries where public opinion is more openly pro-Palestinian.Free speech on trialIn theUS, growing pro-Palestinian activism has been met with arrests, legal action and mounting threats, offeringa pretextfor the Trump administration’s unprecedented attack on free speech and catalysing what many view as the country’s descent into authoritarianism.In the early months of the war, thousands of people, many of themJewish, took part in protests. After students at Columbia University set up a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus in the spring of 2024, dozens more followed at other universities across the country. But bowing to pressure from legislators, donors, and pro-Israel critics, many universities responded harshly to the encampments, calling police on to campuses, which led tothousands of arrests.View image in fullscreenA woman shouts slogans during a pro-Palestine protest in New York.Photograph: Olga Fedorova/EPAMeanwhile, allegations of antisemitism against pro-Palestinian protests have been weaponised by the Trump administration to launch an unprecedentedassault on academic freedom, including cutting billions in funding to universities, screening thousands of visa applicants for pro-Palestinian views, and the detention andattempted deportationof foreign scholars over their political views.Policing protestsIn theUK, the Metropolitan police have so far arrested more than 1,900 people at pro-Palestinian events, the vast majority of whom have been detained for allegedly expressing support forPalestine Action, a direct action group that has been proscribed under anti-terrorism legislation. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has called for theban to be rescinded, describing it as “disproportionate and unnecessary”.Former British diplomat challenges Palestine Action ban in ScotlandRead moreThe prime minister, Keir Starmer, who described plans for protests on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel as“un-British”, has said his government will look atfurther curbs on protests, including potential powers to take action against specific chants at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Starmer also urged protesters to show respect by calling off their activities in theimmediate aftermath of the Manchester synagogue terror attack, in which two people died.View image in fullscreenThe UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has called for the UK’s ban on Palestine Action to be rescinded, describing it as “disproportionate and unnecessary”.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockHistoric tensionsInGermany, whose postwar identity has been indelibly shaped by the Nazi regime’s responsibility for the Holocaust, the protests have revealed tensions between popular feeling and the country’s longstanding solidarity withIsrael.Even aspublic opinion has turned against the Israeli government’s relentless assault on Gaza– a recent pro-Palestinian rally in Berlin attracted about100,000 demonstrators– successive German governments have reaffirmed the principle that responsibility for Israel’s security is part of Berlin’s own Staatsräson,or reason of state.Activists have repeatedly said that police tactics have been excessive, at times brutal, and in violation of constitutional protections of freedom of assembly and expression.Much of the dispute between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and German authorities has centred around which slogans are banned under the law as antisemitic.In May last year, a pro-Palestinian activist was convicted of condoning a crime for using the chant, “from the river to the sea,Palestinewill be free”, at a rally four days after the 7 October attacks. The judge said she “could not comprehend” the logic of previous German court rulings that determined the saying was “ambiguous”, and that, to her, it was clear it “denied the right of the state of Israel to exist”.This chant however hasalso been widely used to call for equal rightsboth in Israel and Palestine.When asked about crackdowns on pro-Palestinian activism afteran alleged case of brutality against an Irish protester, Berlin police this month said they had opened an investigation into the officer but denied a pattern of violence or infringement of civil rights.Artists and intellectuals have cited achilling effectin Germany around support for the Palestinian cause since the 7 October attacks, as criticism of Israeli tactics in Gaza can be quickly smeared as antisemitism, resulting in the withdrawal of prizes, positions and public funding.Meanwhile, many Jewish leaders in Germany have described a sense of isolation over the last two years and point toa sharp rise in attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions.Liberty in questionIn May this year,France’sinterior ministryannounced it would dissolve the pro-Palestinian human rights and solidarity collective, Urgence Palestine, stating that it condoned Hamas, called for intifada in France, and provoked hatred, violence and discrimination against Jewish people. Urgence Palestine has contested these allegations, saying that the move to dissolve it is politically motivated and part of a wider crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism. The collective has not yet been dissolved.Marie Laure Geoffray, freedoms advocacy officer for Amnesty InternationalFrance, said there had been “significant repression and a silencing of voices in solidarity with Palestine” and that this was ongoing.She said it had taken various forms in France, including the banning of some street demonstrations in certain cities, the decision to dissolve Urgence Palestine, as well as legal action. Geoffray said students on French campuses had also been accused of disrupting the peace or troubling the public order.Strikes and solidarityInItaly, the extent ofpublic opinion against Israel’s warbecame evident on 22 September, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets calling for an end to the conflict as part ofa general strikecoordinated by trade unions.The mostly peaceful event was overshadowed by clashes between police and masked protesters at Milan’s central train station, giving the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, an opportunity to condemn the “shameful” scenes and attack her leftwing opponents rather than show solidarity with the Palestinians.View image in fullscreenPolice said at least 250,000 people turned out for a pro-Palestine march in Rome last Saturday.Photograph: Alessandro Bremec/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe pressure on Meloni increased further when Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla triggered protests across Italy nine days later. Rome’s police said at least 250,000 people turned out for a march, which came a day aftermore than 2 million peopletook part in a one-day general strike to support Palestinians in Gaza.Meloni’s government is mindful of public opinion, and in recent months has become increasingly critical of Israel’s killing of Palestinians – even as Italy remains one of Israel’s strongest EU allies. Meloni now says Italy would recognise a Palestinian state if the remaining Israeli hostages were freed and the militant groupHamaswas out of government.‘Starting to be very afraid’: Italy’s Gaza protests raise pressure on MeloniRead more‘We steward ourselves’InIreland, which joined Spain and Norway in formally recognising a Palestinian state in May 2024, the police force, An Garda Síochána, has mostly applied a light touch to Gaza protests, which usually pass without incident.Governmentpolicyandpublic opinionare stronglypro-Palestinian, which creates a supportive atmosphere for marches and rallies.“Overall it’s kind of hands-off policing,” said Zoë Lawlor, the chair of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign. “National demonstrations pass off fine. In Limerick we have a demonstration every week and we never see the Garda unless the far right show up too. Otherwise we just steward ourselves.”View image in fullscreenIn Ireland, government policy and public opinion are strongly pro-Palestinian, which creates a supportive atmosphere for marches and rallies.Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/ReutersPolice have on occasion been “heavy-handed” when dealing with sit-ins and other acts of civil disobedience but that did not compare with the “shocking” police behaviour in some other countries, said Lawlor.Ireland enjoyed greater freedom to protest than in countries such as the UK, US and Germany, but Irish policing still required monitoring, said Joe O’Brien, the executive director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. “We have heard testimony, including allegations of unnecessary strip-searches and a cavity search, that raises serious concerns regarding Garda compliance with human rights frameworks and national law, regulations and policies governing the treatment of people in custody.”In May, the then Garda commissioner, Drew Harris, said allegations of strip-searches were inaccurate and that his force at all times had acted professionally and lawfully.A nation mobilisedSimilarly,Spainhas proved something of an exception when it comes to government support for protests.Not long after more than 100,000 pro-Palestinian demonstratorsforced a premature, scrappy and sporadically violent endto the Vuelta a España cycle race in Madrid last month, due to theparticipation of the Israel Premier Tech team, senior Spanish politicians lined up to bemoan the damage the protest had done to the country’s global reputation.Figures in the conservative People’s party called the episode “an international embarrassment” and compared scenes on the streets of Madrid to “Sarajevo during the war”.Spanish MPs back move to enshrine in law arms embargo on IsraelRead moreBut one political figure took a different line. Spain’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said he had“a deep admiration”for all those who had protested in a non-violent manner and for “a Spanish society that mobilises against injustice and defends its ideas in a peaceful manner”.Sánchez, who had already been fiercely criticised by his adversaries, also said he hoped the events in Madrid would lead others to reconsider whether Israel should be included in major sporting events.Last weekend, an estimated 200,000 people rallied across dozens of cities to show their solidarity with Palestine.Both the protests and the prime minister’s backing for them demonstrate the strength of public opinion in a country where, according toa recent poll, 82% of people believe Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Sánchez’s conservative opponents have also recently begun to step up theircriticisms of Israel’s conduct in Gaza, while King Felipe – hardly a habitual courter of controversy – used a speech before the UN last month to begIsraelto “stop the massacre” and end its “abhorrent acts” in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsProtestGazaPalestineSpainIrelandItalyFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

They were darker than the other bands and they had a command of mystique. You didn’t see a slew of interviews with them; you barely saw any at all. They famously hated Rolling Stone. The rumour was that Jimmy Page and [Rolling Stone co-founder] Jann Wenner had tangled over a girl in London. The magazine trashed their first album. I had, however, interviewed Led Zeppelin for the Los Angeles Times. It was a kind of maiden voyage into the mainstream for the band, and two years later, as they were about to release their albumPhysical Graffiti, I was invited on the road with them by Danny Goldberg, the band’s publicist and an executive at the label they’d started, Swan Song.The key to getting Zeppelin on the cover of Rolling Stone was always going to be Jimmy Page. I would interview the other members first, and if Page still refused, Robert Plant would be on the cover by himself. Surely that prospect would lure Page into the idea of a group shot. Or maybe he would scuttle the whole endeavour. That was possible too, perhaps probable.Back in San Francisco, Rolling Stone editor Ben Fong-Torres approved of the idea and cheered me on with daily phone calls asking for progress reports. I was already nearing the end of the time I’d told my parents I would be away from home, and I was dodging most of my commitments at San Diego City College, where I was taking some classes. I had managed to talk my journalism teacher into counting my road trip with Zeppelin as a class credit.After their shows, the band would return to the Ambassador hotel and regroup to go out clubbing in Chicago. Because it was known they were in town, and fans were on the prowl, Richard Cole, their mayhem-loving road manager, often slipped them into a gay bar just around the corner. It was a tradition that continued for much of the tour. Fans combing the streets looking for the band never realised they could find Jimmy Page and Robert Plant dancing together, unbothered, to a song by Gloria Gaynor or the Average White Band. I was always darting into bathrooms, making notes on little pieces of paper, often to the soundtrack of cocaine-sniffing patrons and sometimes sex on the other side of the stall door.My interview with Plant happened as planned.Time was running out on all fronts. Back home, my parents were beyond flummoxed by the delays. I had been on the road for over 10 daysHe was a music aficionado whose taste rivalled any rock critic or DJ. He can geek out over a Jefferson Airplane record from 20 years earlier, or play you a spectacularly obscure piece of world music you’ll never forget. Our chat about Zeppelin was frank and funny. Shutting off my cassette recorder, I was sure it was all going to work.The shows began to roll by. In Indianapolis, Page was friendly but distant. Each show was topping the previous one as the band found their footing with the new material. Audiences only needed one listen to appreciate Ten Years Gone and, of course, Kashmir as they heard future band classics for the first time. By Greensboro, Page had started to ignore me. By the next night, he began to look right through me. He was now aware that everyone but him had spoken to me for a potential Rolling Stone piece. Time was running out on all fronts. Back home, my parents were beyond flummoxed by the delays. I had been on the road withLed Zeppelinfor over 10 days.View image in fullscreenCrowe and Robert Plant, backstage at Chicago Stadium.Photograph: Neal PrestonSomewhere over Kansas, as we flew in their plane, dubbed the Starship,I took my shot and approached Page directly.“Why should I?” he countered instantly. Page was not only the band’s founder, he was the foremost authority on how the band should sound and be presented. Mystique and respect were not just words to him, they were essentials. “When I needed the magazine, they gave us a terrible review.” He repeated a few of the adjectives from the scalding review. “Now they need me, and I don’t need them. Why should I? For Jann Wenner? Never.”“I’m not Jann Wenner,” I continued. “I believe in the band. Let me tell the whole story for the fans.” The more I explained the plan, the more I looked like a traitor to him. But he was still listening, so I kept talking. And when he made himself some cereal, I followed him as he sat down and kept talking.“This is your chance to speak directly to the fans, and I will not let the magazine touch a word.” I foolishly kept talking. “And as far as the bad reviews go, all I can tell you is that if I bought records according to what Rolling Stone gave good reviews to, I’d have the worst record collection of anybody I know.”This Page liked.

He turned away and I caught a glimpse of mischief. I wasn’t sure if I had gained an almost unthinkable victory or was about to become the butt of an elaborate joke.The interview was planned for later that night. I rode the elevator up to Page’s room, tape recorder in hand. He opened the door, wearing his stage clothes, loose black satin trousers and a black cowboy shirt of the same material. He looked like a rumpled schoolboy as he led me into the rambling three-room suite that seemed built for a Fellini film. In the middle of the main room was a film projector. “Kenneth Anger’s coming by to show me his film,” he said, “but let’s start.”Page spilled forth details about his childhood – never shared before – and about how he felt about Plant and the tour and the band and himselfPage suggested we first listen to one of my cassettes. It was a rare interview with Joni Mitchell, one of his favourite artists. The recording was a wonderful conversation with Mitchell’s friend, the Toronto journalist Malka Marom. We were interrupted by the arrival of Anger, who’d brought the latest cut ofLucifer Rising. He’d asked Page to provide the film score. This would be the first time Page watched the film with his music attached. I sat next to Anger, the well-known occultist and author of Hollywood Babylon, as he projected his movie against the wall of Page’s hotel suite. I was now officially a long way from taking communion at Catholic school.After Anger left, we returned to the Joni Mitchell tape. We listened until two in the morning and then began the interview. Gone was all of Page’s animosity for the magazine, and for Wenner. He spilled forth details about his childhood – never shared before – and about how he felt about Plant and the tour and the band and himself. He told me that he’d never felt that he’d live past 30. But here he was, two years past his imagined expiration date, alive and thoughtful and lonely in New York City. He mused about traveling back to Los Angeles the next day, for a night, to see a girl he missed. He ended the conversation memorably and poetically, telling me, “I’m just looking for an angel with a broken wing ... ” When the powerful conversation was over, he asked if he could borrow the Joni Mitchell tape. I never saw that tape again.The article was rushed into print and the issue would be one of Rolling Stone’s biggest ever. A couple of weeks later, a box from Fong-Torres arrived. It was filled with letters to the magazine. Zeppelin fans had written from all parts of the globe. The letters were overwhelmingly filled with fantasies, questions, stories, and thank-yous for the interview. Rolling Stone had finally placed a bet on Led Zeppelin, late as they were, and the response had been a whole lotta love.The Uncoolby Cameron Crowe is published by 4th Estate on 28 October.

Small groups of soldiers pushed forward near Dobropillia and, meeting little resistance, they advanced 15 to 20 km and seized a chain of villages.It is a small pocket of land, but one that has driven perceptions of the war in the last months. At the time of the Alaska summit, it was seen as proof that Russia had momentum; asUkrainehad taken back territory – albeit in the context of Russian advances elsewhere – it may have contributed to Trump’s dismissive assessment of Moscow’s military as a “paper tiger”.View image in fullscreenSigns of destruction are prevalent in the aftermath of Russia’s offensive near Druzhkivka.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianFollowing Russia’s August breakthrough, a platoon of Ukrainian soldiers was sent to take back the villages of Hruzike and Vesele. The settlements were located at the top of a newly created Russian salient. It had two distinct prongs, thrusting deep into Ukrainian territory. The incursion was likened to a pair of rabbit ears,due to its shape when viewed on a frontline map.Video of Ukrainian tanks joining battle, shelling houses and a school in Vesele, Donetsk oblast, eastern Ukraine.Ukrainian tanks joining battle in Vesele, Donetsk oblast.First, ground robots equipped with machine guns trundled forward, firing towards concealed Russians. Loudspeakers urged them to surrender. Then, two Ukrainian tanks joined the battle. They shelled houses and a school painted with a colourful mural. The rounds shivered trees and rattled the sign on Vesele’s bus stop. “After that we went in and started clearing the area. Every house, bush and basement,” the platoon’s commander – call-sign Tarantino – said.Theoperation to recaptureHruzike went smoothly. In one building, several dazed Russians meekly raised their hands. But Vesele was tougher. After filing down the main road, past broken and burning cottages, Tarantino’s eight-person outfit came to two final houses. From a cellar inside, Russians shot at him. “A bullet hit my helmet like a fist-punch,” he said. “I was alive, thank God. The helmet saved me. I rolled away as our guys returned fire.”View image in fullscreen‘Not a big victory, but proof we are not losing’: Ukraine’s president hails the recapture of Hruzike and Vesele.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianAnother round struck Tarantino’s backpack, setting a power bank alight. He tossed the bag away and continued fighting. “Our drones arrived and destroyed the enemy. This was our first large-scale mission of this kind. Of course there was excitement but we had practised everything in training,” he said. Ten Russians were killed. There were no Ukrainian losses.Since 14 August, when Vesele was retaken, Moscow has lost about half of its new pocket.Ukraine’s commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said his forces had liberated 330 sq km (127 sq miles), with more than 170 sq km wholly secured from enemy troops. Russia suffered 3,520 casualties, with 1,988 killed. Some Russian troops were encircled, Syrskyi reported, with the operation against them ongoing.Computer-generated map of Donetsk oblast identifying regions under Russian control and the location  of Hruzike and Vesele.Ukraine’s small counteroffensive goes to the heart of how the war is perceived. During their infamous February meeting in the White House, Trump intimated to the Ukrainian president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that Russia’s victory was inevitable and told him he had “no cards”. After speaking with Zelenskyy in September at the UN general assembly in New York, Trump then said he believed Ukraine could take back all the land it has lost including Crimea, annexed in 2014 – and delivered his “paper tiger” dismissal of the Kremlin’s military forces.View image in fullscreenA new anti-drone tunnel on a road in eastern Ukraine. Russia is increasingly using different battlefield tactics as it advances in other parts of the frontline.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianZelenskyy said in Kyiv that Trump had emerged from their conversation with a better understanding of what he called the “battlefield realities”. Russian successes on the ground were often fleeting, Zelenskyy maintained, with small assault groups quickly wiped out. “It’s a temporary presence,” he stressed and hailed the recapture of Vesele and Hruzike as “not a big victory, but proof we are not losing. That’s important,” he said.It goes alongside Ukraine’s increasingly effective campaign to cripple Russian oil production, via drone attacks.In many parts of the frontline, Russia continues to advance. Over the summer its armypenetrated Dnipropetrovsk oblastandthe north-eastern city of Kupiansk.The senior officer of Tarantino’s93rd Kholodnyi Yar separate mechanised brigade, Maj Evhen Liherko, said the Kremlin did not have enough forces to make significant headway. “They have some local success. This doesn’t much change the big picture,” he argued. “The Russians don’t have a clear plan. They move forward out of inertia.”Since summer the Russians have switched tactics. Instead of using armoured vehicles that are vulnerable to drones, they deploy large numbers of small assault groups of four to six foot soldiers tasked with infiltrating Ukrainian positions, regrouping and then advancing further. “It’s easy to destroy them and hard to find them,” Liherko said. “If it’s a big attack it’s easy to see them and harder to kill them.”View image in fullscreenFootage from a Ukrainian surveillance drone shows two Russian soldiers walk past a ruined house in the occupied village of Yablunivka in Donetsk province.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianAt the brigade’s HQ, a screen showed live footage of the battlefield provided by surveillance drones. In the grey zone village of Yablunivka, two Russian soldiers in green uniforms could be seen running from a farmhouse. They hid in a patch of forest. “Zoom in!” a duty officer said. An artillery strike landed wide of their position, sending puffs of grey smoke above fields and smashed roofless cottages. The soldiers’ fate was unclear.According to Liherko, the actual situation on the battlefield looks different from maps that show Russia surging forward. He drew an alternative diagram with several small blobs representing enemy troops. “It’s more dynamic. We stay in our position. They try and go forward,” he explained.View image in fullscreenSergiy, the commander of a tank unit with Ukraine’s 93rd mechanised brigade, near the frontline in Donetsk province.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianSergiy, the head of the brigade’s tank unit, described the situation as “difficult but stable”. The 93rd’s senior sergeant, Vitalii Piasetskyi, said there were some encouraging signs that Russia’s military was beginning to struggle. It had less fuel because of Ukrainian deep strikes, and had been forced to reduce its use of armoured vehicles and artillery. In September,the pace of Russian advances slowed downwith 259 sq km captured, almost half August’s figure and the least since May. They was suffering large numbers of casualties.View image in fullscreenVitalii Piasetskyi, a senior sergeant with Ukraine’s 93rd brigade, inspects a memorial wall to fellow soldiers who have died in Russia’s war.Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The GuardianAccording to Piasetskyi, Ukrainian morale was high. “Everything depends on the commander,” he suggested. He said former prisoners who were released from jail after signing a contract with Ukraine’s armed forces,under a scheme introduced in 2024, had proven to be tough and resilient fighters. “They come from a hard school. They are very effective,” he said. Of Tarantino, he added: “There is bravery and there is Tarantino. He’s on another level.”When might the fighting stop? “The Russians are very deep in this war,” he said. “Our job is to maximise their losses. I don’t want to think about the end because I don’t want to be disappointed.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Should we all be showing more or less bush?More! I really like body hair. I like a bush. I like the whole deal. I’m sure if I didn’t have a bush, they wouldn’t have censored it. Do you know what I mean? The body hair itself, that is too scandalous.I didn’t even notice that it was censored! I was really excited. I was like, “Oh, maybe it’ll be a huge black bar.” But they just tastefully softened the area. I was really excited to play that show and I’m glad that they aired it, even though they needed to blur out my bush. I’m very pro-bush.Some people have said that youlook like Amelia Earhart. Do you think you share anything with her spiritually?Big Perfume Genius vibeshttps://t.co/3aXhsgWoti— Pero (@perochan)July 3, 2025I mean, I’d probably do what she did. I would probably die but I would do it.Sometimes I get really rough, wrong comparisons. Twinks on Twitter are so demonic. One of the comparisons was just a corpse, like a mummy with a ring on. A gay-seeming mummy.One of your albums is titled Set My Heart on Fire Immediately. Have you set anything on fire?My mum’s house. When I was living there I put a cigarette out, and it didn’t go out. I went to bed. I woke up to the neighbour knocking on my door because part of the house was on fire. I started hosing it down. The policeman came and hosed it down. I fucked up the whole house. That was pre-Perfume Genius, pre-rehab.Do you have a nemesis?The Octopus Teacher guy. And Frank Sinatra.Malcolm McDowell: ‘I would be a total disaster as a spy – I do love to gossip’Read moreThatOctopus Teacher guyframed the movie like he was doing this to work on his relationship with his family but then he just spends all the time in the ocean with an octopus. And then at the end the octopus dies because he doesn’t want to interfere with nature. But there are long scenes of him rubbing his body all up and down this octopus, which feels like interference to me.If you could change the size of any animal to keep as a pet, what would it be?I love monkeys. I don’t think it’s ethical to have a monkey of any size but I guess we’re not being ethical right now. I love gibbons. But it wouldn’t be a pet. It would be a roommate. I would want it to make its own choices. It doesn’t have to pay rent. It’ll be more like a family member.Last month youposted photosfrom your wedding. (Congratulations!) What is the best thing you’ve done for love?It’s like black magic when I’m in love with somebody, because it’s months before I even acknowledge it to them but all I can think about is them. With [my husband] Alan, it was like I was setting intentions. I was burning little pieces of paper. I was doing witchcraft. It worked. Any time I’ve ever been really into someone, it’s like a 24-hour job for me.If you had to be on a reality TV show tomorrow, which one would it be?I’d be pretty terrible at all of them. Alan would be so good, I would hand him out to all of those. I think he would win so much money. Like, Love is Blind, The Bachelor. I’m very bad at anything flirty. I fall a lot, I run into things. I can’t really be hot on purpose.It would probably be Big Brother. I would do Survivor but I burn easily and I’m a sickly little Victorian child. I’d probably get consumption or some old-timey disease. They’re kind of the same concept but you just have to be in the house.What is the strangest job you’ve ever had?Oh, I’ve had a few. I worked as a telemarketer for a mortgage bank but I’m 99% sure that it was a scam, because I was just supposed to get people’s social security numbers. That’s really all they wanted me to do. The guys who ran it had just got out of prison and my pay cheques would bounce.I also worked at a personal ads company and this was pre-iPhone, so a lot of people didn’t have scanners. They would send their pictures to me to scan and put on their profiles. I wasn’t supposed to but I took them all home, so I would have this whole box of pictures of people. I could read all their messages too. I wasn’t supposed to do any of these things but I definitely had favourite people I would check up on.You tweeted: “Two gay guys … what a combo.” Who is your favourite combo of two gay guys?Finneas and Ashe: ‘I said thanks for coming to Taylor Swift. At her own birthday party’Read moreEverybody knows that I’m a big Brokeback head. I cried for like months after Brokeback Mountain. It was very severe for me. I would be doing the dishes and just kind of fall thinking about it. Up until then, I hadn’t seen such a big-budget, beautifully produced gay movie. For a week straight I was just listening to a dance remix of the guitar riff.Who are other gay guys? This on-the-spot thinking is hard for me today. I just took Tylenol. Itmakes you autistic? Well, too late for me.If you had a sandwich named after you, what would be in it?I don’t like fussy sandwiches. I like lettuce, tomato, onion, cold cuts, mayo, some kind of Italian seasoning, oil and vinegar. It would just be a straight-up sandwich – which is kind of weird, because I’m sure people would think I would put flowers in it or something.People don’t think my name should be Mike. It should be like some something Tilda Swinton-y.

It’s so obvious that it barely feels worth laughing at its stupiditySarah DempsterSat 11 Oct 2025 16.55 EDTLast modified on Sat 11 Oct 2025 16.57 EDTShareYou wear a tightly belted beige trenchcoat and you live in a cavernous show-home bedecked with mid-century pine and fashionably inadequate lighting. You are French. You have two uncommonly beautiful teenage children and are preparing to return to your prestigious role at amaison de coutureafter the recent birth of your uncommonly beautiful baby. Butmon Dieu, you are anxious! You fear your glamorous workload will interfere with your ability to care forl’enfant. The solution? You will hire an enigmatic au pair. Alas, you have never watched television and are thus unaware that this will expose faultlines in your marriage and lead to a series of increasingly terrifying events that will threaten the very fabric of your existence. You are Paula (Mélanie Doutey), the protagonist of four-part French thriller The Intruder, and you are, ’ow you say, stuffed.To France, then, where Paula and Jérôme, her bearded shrug of a husband (Éric Caravaca), are poised to tick off the first point on their “TVThrillerThat Begins with the Ill-Advised Hiring of an Enigmatic Au Pair” checklist. To wit: the interviewing of a childminder who appears – and at this point you may wish to ready the nearest defibrillator – almost too good to be true. Enter Tess (Lucie Fagedet), who doesn’t blink but does have the ability to make baby Orso gurgle with glee, so is hired on the spot. But what is this? Within hours of her arrival Tess is tip-toeing around the family’s bewilderingly dark house, staring at Orso’s toys and pawing Jérôme’s shirts.She is also making clandestine calls to an unnamed woman, who has agreed to pose as Tess’s former employer should Paula get in touch, but is nevertheless narked with the ruse. “The principal at the college said you can’t just disappear like that,” she hisses. Tess is unperturbed. “Calm down,” she whispers. “Just say what I told you. Tell Paula I’m … [a pause, here, while the soundtrack’s hysterical string section gulps and clenches its bum cheeks] … nice.” Who is this expressionless interloper? Could she be harbouring a secret agenda that involves a) exploiting Paula’s postpartum fragility, b) gathering evidence of an apparent affair with her carefully dishevelled neighbour (Clément Sibony) and c) framing Paula for murder?View image in fullscreenÉric Caravaca and Mélanie Doutey as the hoodwinked parents in The Intruder.Photograph: BBC/Tetra Media Fiction/ITV StudiosThe awfulness mounts. Or at least, we assume it does. So fashionably inadequate is the lighting in the family’s wow-house that it is at times almost impossible to make out what is going on. I spend most of the first episode squinting into the Stygian depths of my laptop, nose flattened against the screen like a smear of pâté on the windshield of a Peugeot.Anyway. Amid the gloom, the following semi-perceptible bad stuff happens: Paula’s favourite jacket goes missing. And things have been moved around in Paula’s office.Alack, her family are too dazzled by Tess’s veal marengo to notice that the newcomer is undermining Paula at every turn. “Is she a cousin of Mary Poppins?” swoons the son, Basile (Zaccharie Heintz). “Let’s get a selfie with our great new au pair!” giggles the daughter, Camille (Hélie-Rose Dalmay).Naturally, being the main character in a poorly realised thriller, only Paula is aware of any unpleasantness. “I am,” she tells Jérôme, “uncomfortable with her.” “Maybe,” he replies slowly, “Tess isn’t the problem.” “So,” gasps Paula, “you’re saying I am the problem?” “Yes,” he responds, nodding his bearded French head sadly. “She is wonderful.”It feels important at this juncture to point out that there are three more episodes of this still to come.If The Intruder feels desperately familiar, it’s because there have been variations on the “murderous au pair” theme for as long as viewers have possessed the ability to roll their eyes. Indeed, there was a version earlier this year in the form of Channel 5’s The Au Pair, in which a homicidal nanny with a secret agenda inveigled her way into blah blah and David Suchet was horrified to find himself in chinos.It was terrible, but at least you could actually see how terrible it was. Here, we must squint through the cliches and grope our way through scenes of such underlit obviousness, it barely feels worth the energy of laughing at the stupidity of it all. If there is a dafter thriller in 2025 I will eatmon béret.The Intruder aired on BBC Four and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDramaThrillerreviewsShareReuse this content"

The gym is too far away, and the effort to get there is just too much. In short, I don’t go because I’m lazy.But what would happen if you remove the friction? What would happen if you literally moved into a gym? If youlivedat the gym? As in: you slept at the gym, socialised at the gym and ate all your meals there? Would it change anything? Would you become agym person?After a couple of months travelling where I didn’t hold back on alcohol and carbs, I decided on radical action to get over my gym-phobia.‘Inject that Stoicism into my veins!’: 10 tools of ancient philosophy that improved my lifeRead moreI flew from France to Thailand, where I moved into a four-storey gym adjoined by 17 hotel rooms. I lived there for a week, taking as many classes, ice baths, saunas and scoops of protein powder as I could handle.Unlike a wellness retreat, the gym at Action Point, in the southern tip of Phuket, is open to the public. It has a weights room, a yoga studio, sauna, cold plunge, swimming pool, cafe and cardio room. It is so close to the accommodation I was able to get out of bed at 7.20am and make it to a 7.30am class.‘Rinse and repeat, all week’A day living at Action Point looks something like this: wake up at 7.20am, grab a protein shake and drink it quickly before a 7.30am Morning Mobility (stretch and movement) class. Then it’s up to the cafe, with its swimming pool and views across Phuket. For breakfast? Eggs, of course! Or a protein hotcake as heavy as a shot put. Cross training starts at 9am, while at 10.15am – one floor up – you can take power yoga.For lunch, more protein. At 1pm there is personal training, or a one-on-one Muay Thai session. The afternoon is set aside for recovery which may involve an in-room massage, a nap, an ice bath and sauna, then an early dinner at 5pm with your training mates and, three times a week, a knowledge session on mindset or nutrition. In the evening there is yin yoga, maybe some singing bowls or meditation, and an early bedtime of 8pm. Spending 11 hours in bed at night is easy when you’re tired from all the exercise.Rinse and repeat, all week.When I arrived, my fitness was very poor. Yes, I had been biking around France, but it was an electric bike, and I was only riding to restaurants.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningSo I was always going to find the first few days a shock. My first personal training session focused on the right way to do squats. I bounced up and down, trying to get lower each time, departing from my natural sitting range (bar-stool height).The next day, I am broken! The only way I can get out of bed is to commando roll on to the ground, then hoist myself up to standing by gripping a chair. Leaving breakfast, I cling to a hand rail to go down two stairs, like an elderly person.‘I worry I am now mostly protein’But my program also included recovery. Action Point manager Chris Lawless tells me this helps prevent injuries, and I was grateful to be returning to my room for a massage. Or as Charli xcx put it on B2b: “Took a long time, breaking muscle down, building muscle up, repeating it.”Then there’s the food. This wellness retreat is not of the White Lotus variety. It’s more of the white protein variety. I try to shovel in a recommended 120g of protein a day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If I do a plank, I can taste the return of the morning’s protein shake.I never really feel hungry.“Brig! You’re going to be all protein soon!” a worried friend texts me. But I need the protein for all the exercise I’m doing.Towards the end of the week, I am exercising all the time, recovering from exercising all the time, or cramming in another protein shake trying to “hit my macros”.Staying at Action Point has definitely removed the friction of getting to the gym.Why everyone is lifting weights – and how to get started (whatever your size)Read moreInstead, I develop an inverse problem. Instead of not being bothered going to the gym, I now can’t be bothered to leave.There is lots of free time if you want to take it (after all, it’s not possible to work out 24 hours a day – or is it?) but everything is here, it’s so comfortable. I can get to my classes in less than a minute, I can train any time I want, I can go to the cafe and order a protein shake and feel confident that I am on my way to 120g.When I do leave to go to the beach, it’s unpleasant. It’s the rainy season, the water is foamy and brown and when I enter the surf, a strong current deposits me down the other end of the beach, like I am a parcel of protein.As I shake off the sand, I long to return to Action Point. Life lived according to the gym timetable doesn’t contain too many dangers or surprises.‘It’s easy to think of staying here for ever’I’m not the only one to feel this way. People keep extending their stays. One week becomes two, becomes four, becomes “I’m moving to Phuket and going to this gym all the time”.It is tempting. A storm races across the sky. You watch the rain bounce off the swimming pool as you sip your thick protein shake and contemplate an ice bath. Each day you get better at Muay Thai. You contemplate entering a seniors competition. Classes feel like a community – people are friendly, a mix of Thai and foreign – it’s easy to think of staying here for ever.Each day I get stronger, more flexible, fitter. I can walk down stairs again! But then again, I am living at the gym.The war in my head, that is always in my head – the battle to go to the gym – has quietened. Of course I will go to the gym today. I’m already here.Brigid Delaney was a guest ofAction Point. She is the author ofWellmania(A$27.99, Black Inc).

I uprooted myself from New South Wales and headed to Alice Springs to work as a GP. A year later we were all so happy we decided to stay.Three years later, in 2007, I’d made a great group of friends who were always trying to matchmake me. One suggested I meet an old friend of theirs, the mysterious “Jungle Jim”. He was ex-air force and had four children – which, to be honest, seemed a little daunting – but I was open.As the worst of the summer heat subsided, a barbecue was orchestrated for us to get acquainted.I still remember the white skirt and orange shirt I was wearing – I felt I’d made an effort – and then in walks this fella with boots and jeans carrying a big white cooler. Twenty years later he still has them all.View image in fullscreenJim and Ameeta in West MacDonnell Ranges in the early days of their relationshipWe sat down, chit-chatted and I thought he was cute; then he started talking about training for the Kokoda trail and taking two of his sons with him.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningHe told me: “I just want to smell the jungle again.” And that was the first moment I thought, “Wow, who is this guy?” He said he recalled a scent from his childhood that he longed for; it rang true for me.There was a big Australian rules football match on TV and it was all very blokey but as the night went on my friends asked him how he was getting on after his separation. When he replied that it had been a bit rough and he’d sought the help of a psychologist, I really did a double take.The moment I knew: as the countdown reached one, something instinctive pulled us togetherRead moreAs a doctor, especially back then, I knew it was rare for men to be open about mental health struggles. To me it really spoke to his self-confidence and honesty. Especially because he presented as such an alpha male. He’s loud, he’s big, he laughs a lot and yet here he was being so open about these vulnerabilities. It was a very attractive juxtaposition.As my friend and I were doing the dishes and organising the dessert I’d brought along, she asked what I thought and, before I knew what I was saying, I blurted out: “I could fall in love with this man.” This was totally out of character for me.I’d like to think I remained casual but I was bursting out of my skin. I gave him my number and waited, and waited, and waited. The following Saturday I got an invitation for a Sunday-night drink. It happened to be Mother’s Day and my parents had just flown in for their wedding anniversary. Despite the timing, I didn’t hesitate to make it work.He came striding into the pub 10 minutes late, not a worry in the world. We talked non-stop for three hours. It turned out we had so much in common, we were both born to expats, me to Indian parents in Uganda, he to Scottish parents in Papua New Guinea, both our fathers were engineers and we had arrived in Australia in the early 70s.View image in fullscreenThe couple at the Taj Mahal in India in 2011I had an early flight for work so I couldn’t get carried away, but over the next few weeks we made time to get together for a few dates and took our kids on some adventures. He met my parents too. He charmed the socks off my mother, complimenting her home cooking as he did a few handyman jobs. He even asked her for her pickle recipe – I’ve never made pickles in my life.

I also knew he held a high security clearance because of his job at Pine Gap, so I was confident I wasn’t dealing with a rogue character.Eighteen months later we took all six kids to Thailand on a family holiday and had a ball. Our international outlook so obviously informed the way we were raising our respective kids. We moved in together not long afterwards.View image in fullscreenJim and Ameeta in Cairns in December 2024.In 2011 the two of us took a trip to India and the question of marriage hung in the air. We visited the Taj Mahal in the morning and I’d made assumptions, but no proposal came. I was salty for the rest of the day. But when we went back for the sunset viewing he asked me if I wanted to be his wife.Later at dinner I asked him if he was worried I’d say no. He replied: “I was more worried about what would happen to me if I didn’t ask you.”My initial feelings for Jim were so powerful and unexpected that I didn’t really trust them; I never believed in love at first sight. But all the pieces of our puzzle fell together. Jim is still a bloke’s bloke but underneath it all it’s that softness, caring and loyalty that never fails to remind me of how I fell for him over a footy match and sticky date pudding.Tell us the moment you knewShare your love storyDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Without a major trophy in 40 years and with a litany of failures at the final hurdle, you wondered whether this talented group of players could ever shake off the tag of nearly men.Hull KR 24-6 Wigan Warriors: Super League Grand Final – as it happenedRead moreThat moment finally arrived earlier this summer when KR won the Challenge Cup but the one they really wanted was a first league title since 1985. Freed of the pressures of the past at last, Willie Peters and his side underlined in no uncertain terms on the biggest stage why Rovers are now Super League’s premier side.It is not an exaggeration to say that the Robins did to Wigan what Wigan have become accustomed to doing to opposition sides throughout their own era of dominance. After a nervy start, Rovers were far superior in almost every aspect and once they went ahead, they never looked like surrendering that advantage. Against a team as good as Wigan, that is about as high a compliment as you can pay them.View image in fullscreenWigan’s Bevan French drops the ball when over the try line as he is tackled by Hull KR’s Mikey Lewis.Photograph: Lee Parker/CameraSport/Getty ImagesThe contest had already been decided by the time Burgess seared away in the closing minutes. Peters, the man who has masterminded this remarkable turnaround to drag a club who were bottom of the Super League as recently as 2020 to the treble, hugged almost every member of staff he could lay his hands on.The Rovers substitutes fell to their knees and the 20,000-plus KR fans, many of whom could have never imagined one trophy, let alone three, were sent into delirium. They are only the fifth club to win the Grand Final, with Leeds the last team to win it for the first time in 2004.There can be no complaints about the outcome, with Rovers sensational when it mattered most: producing the kind of display Wigan have done in the biggest games in recent years. “There’s only been four teams who’ve won the treble and nobody has won the treble twice, which tells you how hard it is,” Peters said. “They have been absolutely amazing.”The contest could and perhaps should have taken a very different outlook in the first half, but for some rare profligacy from Wigan as opportunities for Liam Farrell and Bevan French came and went. There was a fair argument to say it should have been 12-0 to Wigan and with their record in finals that would have been commanding.View image in fullscreenHull KR’s Joe Burgess dives over in the corner despite Jai Field’s tackle.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAThe game swung on a pivotal moment as Wigan’s Brad O’Neill was sent to the sin-bin after a dangerous tackle on Tyrone May. Within two minutes, Hull KR went ahead as the outstanding Mikey Lewis cut through to score between the posts. With O’Neill still off the field the Robins went further in front as a fine passage of play led to the former Wigan winger Burgess touching down.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A penalty from Adam Keighran on the stroke of half-time got Wigan on the board and when Harry Smith scored shortly after the restart, a comeback appeared to be on the cards. But Hull KR quelled it as a penalty from Martin nudged their lead back out to six points.They then scored the decisive try as Jez Litten finished a fine move to leave Wigan behind by 12 and, quite frankly, shellshocked. This was an off-colour night from them, and they could have no complaints about the outcome, a point their head coach, Matt Peel, made post-match.“It’s tempting to look back on things we wish we’d done differently,” Peet said. “We didn’t do what we’d love to do but you’ve got to credit Hull KR for their energy in those periods. Full credit to them.”Wigan were bidding to secure a third successive Super League crown but this never felt like it would be their night – especially when it was revealed after the game that Hull KR’s hooker, Michael McIlorum, played through the pain with a fractured ankle.Burgess’ try with three minutes left merely confirmed what everyone had started to expect over the course of the evening: there is a new force in Super League at long last.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueRugby leagueHull KRWigan Warriorsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They must beat Armenia in Dublin on Tuesday if they are to have any hope of claiming a playoff place.View image in fullscreenCaoimhín Kelleher saves Cristiano Ronaldo’s penalty at the Estádio José Alvalade.Photograph: Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesKelleher looked to have earned Ireland a point when he brilliantly kept out Ronaldo’s penalty with his trailing leg after Francisco Trincão’s shot had hit Dara O’Shea’s arm but Neves came to his side’s rescue in the first minute of stoppage time when he headed Trincão’s cross past Kelleher.“It’s a heartbreaking result,” said Hallgrímsson. “Sometimes we coaches try to look at performance when we lose games. I think what we planned to do, our gameplan, worked. There was a lot of energy put into this match. Just being so close and ending up with nothing is painful.

The win extended the European champions’ perfect run in qualifying, their having scored 11 goals in three matches without conceding.Despite the absence of players such as Lamine Yamal, Nico Williams and Rodri due to injuries, Luis de la Fuente’s side showcased their superiority against a Georgia team that spent most of the match defending deep.Spaindominated the match with more than 80% possession and Georgia did not have one shot on target or create a scoring opportunity with only the goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili preventing a rout.Pino opened the scoring in the 24th minute from a well-executed set-piece routine and Oyarzabal secured the win in the 64th minute with a stunning free kick after Liverpool’s Mamardashvili had saved Ferran Torres’s penalty.Real Madrid’s Arda Güler was among the scorers asTurkeyreturned to winning ways with a 6-1 thrashing overBulgariato keep some pressure on Spain, but the victors sit three points behind with a goal difference of zero.Italy’shopes of at least making the playoffs were given a boost with a 3-1 win away toEstoniathanks to goals from Moise Kean, Mateo Retegui and Francesco Pio Esposito.View image in fullscreenMoise Kean scores Italy’s first goal against Estonia.Photograph: Claudio Villa/FIGC/Getty ImagesItaly failed to qualify for the last two World Cups, twice missing out in the playoffs, and the dreaded backdoor route now looks their most likely chance afterNorway’s5-0 hammering ofIsraelin Group I.

Erling Haaland stole the attention with a hat-trick on it, rendering his early double penalty miss a discordant memory, and the upshot was that Norway could look with clear heads toward a near-certain firstWorld Cupappearance in 27 years. A win over Estonia next month will confirm their presence; Egil Olsen, their manager at France 1998, watched as Israel offered scant opposition to Europe’s most ruthless attacking force.It also means Italy, already sore from successive failures to qualify, are likely to face another playoff date. Perhaps Norway’s domination of Group I should prove little surprise: theIsraelmanager, Ran Ben Shimon, said afterwards that they and Spain are the two best teams on the continent.Tight security and political tension hang over key Norway v Israel World Cup qualifierRead moreIsrael are now out of contention for next summer’s showpiece; in truth, for all the American government’s outrage about any potential ban from the tournament, it had always been a long shot. But their very presence in Oslo was highly contested, the buildup framed by the Norwegian Football Federation’s stance that they should be ejected from international football due to the war in Gaza. There will be relief that confrontations were minimal beyond a brief spate of trouble outside the Ullevaal Stadion during half-time.The day’s intensive security operation had met its first visible challenge at 2pm when a crowd of pro-Palestine protesters, cohered by the Palestine Committee inNorway, gathered at Spikersuppa in central Oslo in preparation for their march to Ullevaal. Yards away, polite applause had rippled as the swearing-in of Norway’s parliament was relayed on a big screen. The marchers, whose number swelled to around 1,500 during the 2.6 mile route, were more vigorously propelled by flares and beating drums. Red cards were distributed among attendees.View image in fullscreenA fan holds a red card as other supporters unfurl Palestinian flags at the Ullevaal Stadion.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesInger Lise, wearing a national team scarf, was one of few who had turned up to the protest in Norway’s football colours. Once a keen player, she had a match ticket but considered the occasion tainted. “It’s very frustrating,” she said while holding one end of a large “Free Palestine” banner, the other clasped by a friend. “The game shouldn’t have been played but it’s not up to us to ruin it. It’s just horrible that we are here now.”Inside Andy’s Pub, a Liverpool-themed bar near the meeting point, six supporters in their mid-50s felt the moment they could make an impact had passed. “Israel should have been banned before, we can’t do anything now,” one said. They had travelled from Tromso, inside the Arctic Circle, and wore shirts carrying names from the 1998 squad.As the march passed northwards, some residents gathered on balconies or wound down car windows to shout encouragement. The police presence, visible but never overbearing, stopped well short of confrontation at that point. The only exception came as participants prepared to depart. A handful of Israeli journalists had arrived at the protest and, apparently after being involved in an exchange with a member of the public, were escorted from the scene.The 80-minute march ended with speeches and songs at a stage opposite Ullevaal, a smaller protest arriving to swell numbers in the hour before kick-off. Nearby, a few fans bearing both Norwegian and Israeli flags were marshalled towards the ground by police officers.As the teams emerged before kick-off, supporters in the west stand unfurled a Palestine flag alongside another imploring “Let children live”. The sight will not have been lost on Fifa and Uefa. Israel’s pocket of around 100 visitors raised their own flag during the national anthem while a minority of home supporters whistled.Temperatures inside the stadium rose no higher. The only notable security lapse arose in the eighth minute when, even though the front three rows were covered, a sole protester ran on to the pitch before being wrestled to the ground by security personnel. He was named by local media as Mario Ferri, who refers to himself as “The Falcon” and has a history of such incursions in various global stadiums.View image in fullscreenA protester waves a Palestine flag as policemen stand guard outside the Ullevaal Stadion.Photograph: Javad Parsa/EPABy then Haaland had already erred from the spot, Daniel Peretz saving his first effort and a VAR-ordered retake. After play resumed Norway pulled clear against opponents let down by a nonexistent defence. Haaland made amends in between own goals by Anan Khalaili and Idan Nachmias, the latter ending up in hospital after colliding with a post. Three goals in a 10-minute spell had ended the contest.As the first half ended, around 200 protesters remained outside. In the day’s sole flashpoint, police used teargas after a barrier was pulled down near the stadium entrance. Ten arrests were made but the authorities emphasised most involved had behaved well.Haaland put himself front and centre again by finishing twice more, his third bringing up 51 in 46 caps. “Free Palestine” chanted a section of the support as proceedings wound down, reminding everyone else that the backdrop could never quite be punctured.“I didn’t feel anything extreme,” said Ben Shimon of the atmosphere. He took pains to laud Norway’s hospitality, while lamenting that of his players, and hoped a weight will lift now peace no longer looks a pipedream. “We have a big role in Israeli society, we have to stay together. I believe the national team of Israel, and other national teams, have a bigger perspective than football.” The day’s events had proved it.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupNorwayIsraelmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They are up into mid-table and if a 2-0 victory over Feyenoord in the Europa League will not quite live in the memory in the way last season’s games againstBayern Munich,JuventusandParis Saint-Germaindo, a return to Rotterdam at least evoked the glory days of 1982.It will be a while yet before the frustration at missing out on the Champions League fades, but there does now seem to be a gathering recognition that Villa have a decent chance of winning the Europa League, potentially adding Istanbul’s Besiktas Park to De Kuip as a venue where they have won a European trophy.The question, then, is where the gloom came from. Why didVilla seem so downbeatabout a squad that, at least in terms of those on permanent contracts, had essentially traded Jacob Ramsey and Leon Bailey for the promising Evann Guessand? How did Villa manage to talk themselves into such a funk that they did not win any of their first six games of the season? The answer to which, just as it was for Newcastle, who also began the season in apparent denial about the quality of the squad, isprofitability and sustainabilityrules (PSR).If you know your Lucas Neill and Mo Salah, the Guardian’s new football game is  just for youRead moreMy Guardian colleague Barney Ronay has a theory thatmanagers were essentially invented as a scapegoat, so that infuriated crowds could abuse the beleaguered figure on the touchline rather than a club’s board. The European Union used to perform a similar function for the UK government. It is useful for those in power to have something to blame, and in football that role is now performed by PSR.PSR is far from perfect. It has, surely without meaning to, created an environment in which clubs are incentivised to sell homegrown talent and to maintain a constant churn of transaction to generate, thanks to the marvels of amortisation, the book profit that gives them PSR headroom.But there are two things to be said in its defence. First, that clubs voted on it. It was not imposed from above. It is not some annoying and unavoidable quirk of nature. Clubs chose it and agreed to it. There are regular meetings at which they could propose an alternative.And some sort of check on spending is necessary, and this is the one we have got. Imagine it did not exist. Imagine if huge private equity companies or the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates could spend what they wanted. Football is financially stratified enough as it is, but the potential distortion would be grotesque: the game would, purely and simply, be about who had the richest owner. Plus there would always be the threat of that owner withdrawing with potentially devastating consequences for the club – as happened on a much lower scale to Gretna in 2008 after theirowner Brooks Milesonfell ill and seemingly lost interest.It is often forgotten that when financial fair play rules were introduced in 2011, whatever their impact since, their purpose was to protect clubs from the sort of over-ambition that had pushed Leeds to the brink.In practice, that may be frustrating for rising clubs. PSR does favour those clubs with large fanbases who attract the most lucrative sponsorship deals and can have a noodle partner in every port. But equally Villa, having gone from the Championship to the Champions League in five years, cannot really claim to have been held back. And if your wages to turnover ratio is – as Villa’s was – 91%, you are overspending.But the reason Villa are not in the Champions League this season is not PSR; it is that their goalkeeper got an entirely needless red card at Old Trafford in the final game of last season and sothey lost a game in which a drawwould have seen them finish above Newcastle in fifth.View image in fullscreenAston Villa’s Emiliano Martínez is shown a red card by the referee Thomas Bramall against Manchester United in the final game of last season, which they went on to lose 2-0.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersThere will be those who moan about the goal ruled out by a referee who incorrectly blew for a foul and did not let play run, so the video assistant referee could not make him review the decision, but glitches are part of the game. Had the goalline cameras not been blocked off by players’ bodies in 2020, Sheffield United would have taken the lead against Villa in agame that finished 0-0; defeat there would have relegated them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month saw theresignation of their sporting director Monchi– who, like gazpacho, never seems quite as effective outside Seville. Of 10 permanent signings made last season, only Amadou Onana started more than 10 league games.In January Villa gambled on the loan signings of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio to get into the Champions League. That was probably a justifiable move and nearly worked, but the nature of a gamble is that there are consequences if it goes wrong. Had they not been signed, another January arrival, Donyell Malen, might have had more opportunity to prove himself; histwo goals against Burnleylast weekend suggested he could yet have a significant role. Harvey Elliott and Jadon Sancho may not be quite at the level of Rashford and Asensio but both are intriguing loan options with points to prove.Elliott has shown evidence of great talent but appears not to be a fit for Arne Slot at Liverpool and, at 22, needs regular football. Sancho has lost his way since leaving Borussia Dortmund for Manchester United in 2021, but the basic ability is there if Unai Emery can resurrect it.View image in fullscreenOf 10 permanent signings Aston Villa made last season, only Amadou Onana started more than 10 league games.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersIf the clouds of largely self-induced despondency have cleared, if they have accepted there is no grand conspiracy against them and that PSR is not the monster it has been painted as, what can Villa realistically hope for? Three of their players, more than any other club, startedEngland’s 3-0 victoryover Wales on Thursday.Aston Villa remain a very good side. They are unlikely to be in a title race but is there any reason they could not challenge Newcastle or Tottenham for fifth?

In his first match against a top-five opponent, the Monégasque world No 204 maintained his composure as Djokovic appeared to struggle with his left gluteal muscle from early in the first set.All fluffed up: why modern balls are sparking injury worries and frustration in tennisRead moreVacherot’s tournament has been an incredible spectacle by itself, but it has been made even more remarkable by the events in the top half of the draw. His cousin Rinderknech, a more established name on the ATP tour at No 54, put together the best result of his career. The Frenchman edged past the former world No 1 Daniil Medvedev 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the second semi-final on Saturday.As Rinderknech closed out his victory, Vacherot walked on to the court holding his head in disbelief before embracing his cousin.“I can’t even say it’s a dream because I don’t think even one person in our family dreamed about it,” Rinderknech said. “We started believing it, I would say, in the quarters, maybe … Now we are here, we fought through so many matches and somehow we are the guys standing at the end. It’s just incredible.”View image in fullscreenDisbelief on the face of Valentin Vacherot after he beat Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 in the semi-final.Photograph: Lintao Zhang/Getty ImagesThe second-lowest direct entrant into the qualifying draw, Vacherot has put together one of the most surprising successes at a big tournament, winning eight matches over the past two weeks. That has included victories over the No 14 seed, Alexander Bublik, and Holger Rune, the 10th seed, alongside this giantkilling win over Djokovic, the fourth seed.“This is just crazy,” Vacherot said on court. “It was an hour and 40 minutes of pure joy, even though not many people wanted me to keep going. He’s really appreciated here. I got a bit lost in all his titles when they were announcing him, but it was an unreal experience.”While Vacherot’s career-high ranking sits at No 110, the second and third lowest-ranked Masters 1000 semi-finalists, No 191 Andrei Pavel and No 152 Borna Coric, were former top 20 players who had dropped down the rankings. Nothing like this has happened at a Masters 1000 event on the ATP tour.View image in fullscreenArthur Rinderknech battled back from a set down to claim an upset 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 win over former US Open champion and 16th seed Daniil Medvedev.Photograph: Héctor Retamal/AFP/Getty ImagesThe cousins, who played college tennis in the US for the Texas A&M Aggies, have been encouraging each other in China. After closing out the victory, Vacherot signed the a TV camera lens: “Aggies on top! Allez, Arthur!”Vacherot’s joy contrasted sharply with Djokovic’s misery as the 38-year-old continued to battle his own body. This had already been a challenging week for the Serb, who had suffered badly in the suffocating heat and humidity during the opening rounds, vomiting several times on court.It appeared he had recovered from those early difficulties, but it became clear early on that he was struggling. Djokovic took a medical time out at 3-4 in the first set and, despite the crowd urging him on, he was unable to move properly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He looked apologetic as he shook Djokovic’s hands, but the Serb admirably offered him encouragement during their embrace: “You deserve it. You deserve it, man. You played unbelievable,” he said.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic receives treatment during his semi-final loss to Valentin Vacherot.Photograph: Jade Gao/AFP/Getty ImagesDjokovic had been attempting to become the oldest Masters 1000 champion, he had already become the oldest quarter-finalist at this level. He has shown this year he is still the third-best in the world behind the untouchable duo of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. However, there is a reason why nobody at his age has achieved the milestones he continues to reach. The countless physical problems Djokovic has struggled with between his positive performances this year have further underlined the difficulty of continuing to compete at the highest level.In some ways, Djokovic may reflect even more bitterly on this result than some of his recent grand slam losses. While he has been outplayed by Alcaraz and Sinner in the past three major tournaments, things finallyseemed to line up in his favourthis week after Alcaraz withdrew because of the ankle injury he sustained during his Tokyo title run and thenSinner retired from his third-round matchagainst Tallon Griekspoor due to the punishing conditions.Djokovic has recognised Alcaraz and Sinner are levels above him at the moment, but if he continues to put himself in good positions he could give himself a few more opportunities to achieve great things. This week represented one of those opportunities for the 24-time grand slam champion, who has not won a Masters 1000 event since 2023. Instead, his body failed him again.View image in fullscreenJessica Pegula records a video with fans as she celebrates her Wuhan Open semi-final victory against the world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka.Photograph: Adek Berry/AFP/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the Wuhan Open will have an all-American final as Jessica Pegula exacted revenge for her recent US Open semi-final loss to Aryna Sabalenka, narrowly beating the world No 1 2-6, 6-4, 7-6(2).

Tammy Beaumont’s 32 was the next highest contribution.England set Sri Lanka 254 to win after Nat Sciver-Brunt century: Women’s Cricket World Cup – liveRead moreSciver-Brunt’s rescue effort enabled England to regain their spot at the top of the World Cup standings, and means she has now surpassed coach Charlotte Edwards’s record for most hundreds scored at 50-over World Cups: this was her fifth. It is also the first since her wife, Katherine Sciver-Brunt, gave birth to their son, Theo, in March, and featured the memorable sight of the England captain lofting a six over deep extra cover to bring up the milestone, then cradling her bat like a baby while looking up to Katherine and Theo in the stands in celebration.“That one was for Theo,” Sciver-Brunt said. “They’ve come out to Sri Lanka to watch me, so I thought I’d give back to them for supporting me.“It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster in terms of missing them, but I got a bit more sleep when they were at home. Katherine had to take the flight on alone with Theo, which was a lot for her to commit to, so I’m glad I made it worth her while.”Sri Lanka started positively with the bat, reaching 95 for one after 20 overs, but an extraordinary 10-over spell from Sophie Ecclestone, which included three maidens, put a wrecking ball through their chase. Hasini Perera and Harshitha Samarawickrama were caught trying to hit out, while Kavisha Dilhari was bowled by Ecclestone attempting a slog sweep.The key breakthrough came in the 29th over, when the captain, Chamari Athapaththu – returning after being stretchered off in the sixth over with cramp – was deceived by Ecclestone’s flight and bowled through the gate.View image in fullscreenSophie Ecclestone celebrates the wicket of Hasini Perera, one of four the England bowler picked up.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/AP“Sri Lanka had built a partnership. I wanted [Ecclestone] to come on and steady the ship, not necessarily take wickets, but she did that as a bonus,” Sciver-Brunt said. “Her clarity in what she wants to do is brilliant. She makes it look very simple.”Sciver-Brunt followed up her match-defining innings with a couple of scalps of her own, while Charlie Dean tossed up a beauty to Vishmi Gunaratne and held on to an excellent diving catch at midwicket to dismiss Dewmi Vihanga, as Sri Lanka collapsed to 164 all out in 45.4 overs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

First, Beaumont stitched up Amy Jones by haring off for a nonexistent single after hitting the ball straight to Dilhari at cover, leaving Jones short of her ground running to the striker’s end. Then the left-arm spinner Inoka Ranaweera took three for 33, including removing Emma Lamb and Alice Capsey in the space of five balls in the 35th over.The 39-year-old Ranaweera, now into her 13th year of international cricket, has already proved that age really is just a number at this tournament, finishing with four wickets against India – including three in the same over. She was just as dangerous against England’s right-handers, getting plenty of turn and dip to bowl Lamb behind her legs, and having Capsey stumped after sliding her back foot just out of the crease.As so often, the England captain played a lone hand, in an innings which was without extravagance until its final stages. She ground out runs – 52 of her 117 came in singles – but came alive in the last four overs of the innings, striking six boundaries and enabling England to add 44 more to their total. Had Sri Lanka held on to that early chance against her, the match might have unfolded very differently.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Cricket World CupEngland women's cricket teamSri Lanka women's cricket teamWomen's cricketCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

The American attacked from the break on the Passo della Crocetta climb and was 50 seconds in front of the chasers – and more than three minutes ahead of the peloton – by the time he hit the crest of that ascent with more than 70km remaining.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From there Pogacar slashed at Simmons’ lead and caught him some way before the summit, and from there it was a one-man procession to a historic win.Storer became only the second Australian rider in 120 years to make the podium at the Tour of Lombardy, after Phil Anderson in 1986.The 28-year-old had tried to go with Evenepoel after they had both been left for dead by Pogacar, but he was distanced by the Belgian over the final 10km and battled home for third, 25 seconds clear of Simmons.It was Storer’s maiden monument podium in a year when he also earned his first stage victory at Paris-Nice, followed by both a stage win and the overall triumph in Tour of the Alps.The Perth rider finished in the top 10 in the Giro d’Italia and recently won the prestigious Memorial Pantani race.Explore more on these topicsCyclingTadej PogacarnewsShareReuse this content"

He returned to his earlier form in no uncertain terms under a confident ride by James Doyle, who was soon settled close to the early lead before grabbing a decisive advantage with a move to the front a furlong-and-a-half out.Aidan O’Brien closes on Group One record as Precise makes it 22 in 2025Read moreGewan, who runs in the green colours of the Chinese billionaire Zhang Yuesheng, crossed the line three-quarters of a length in front of the 7-4 favourite, Gstaad, foiling Aidan O’Brien’s tilt at a record ninth Dewhurst success. That Gstaad’s main market rival, Distant Storm, was another length-and-a-half away in third, with Zavateri, a Group One winner this season, fourth also gives a solid feel to the form.Gewan’s path through his juvenile season has also been a carbon-copy of that taken by Chaldean, the2,000 Guineas winner in 2023, in his two-year-old campaign three years ago. Andrew Balding’s colt is now top-priced at 12-1 to give the trainer a third win in the colts’ Classic since 2020.“We were saying coming into the race that he was overpriced,” Balding said. “His York performance [in the Acomb Stakes] was really good and you’ve got to forgive him Doncaster. So we weren’t without hope, but he’s still got to come and do it, he was given a brilliant ride and he’s a very good horse.”Gewan’s owner bought into the colt after his impressive win in the Acomb, and took the subsequent failure at Town Moor in his stride.View image in fullscreenJames Doyle lifts the Dewhurst Stakes trophy after winning the race on Gewan.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA“They’re very straightforward and they took the defeat at Doncaster without flinching, having just bought the horse,” Balding said. “That enabled us to just kick on and stick with the plan we wanted, and that’s the reason he’s here.“The soft ground didn’t help at Doncaster, but I don’t think it was just that. For whatever reason, he wasn’t at his best, but he was today. It’s a relief, but his work at home suggested he would play a part today.”As a son of Night Of Thunder, the2014 2,000 Guineas winner, Gewan is far from guaranteed to get the Derby trip, but a mile-and-a-half at Epsom promises to be ideal for Pierre Bonnard, the winner of the 10-furlong Zetland Stakes.O’Brien’s colt is by Camelot, the2012 Derby winner, and an impressive physical specimen already with plenty of scope for further progress over the winter. The May festival at Chester is seven months away, but it is easy to see Pierre Bonnard as a leading member of O’Brien’s squad for a meeting where he trialled Lambourn and Minnie Hauk,the Derbyand Oaks winners respectively, this year.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowChepstow:1.32 Deep Purple 2.07 Settle Down Jill 2.42 Blueking D’Oroux 3.17 Celtic Dino 3.52 Saint Segal 4.27 Bubble Dubi 5.02 Cooltobecareless.Goodwood:1.52 Spiced Rum 2.27 Funlover 3.02 Crazee Icon 3.37 Righthere Rightnow (nb) 4.12 Poseidon’s Warrior 4.47 Knights Gold 5.22 Day Of Grace (nap).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“He was a little green, but Christophe [Soumillon] was very happy with him and he’s a very straightforward horse,” O’Brien said. “I think he’ll be a Derby trial horse and we’ll go from there, but I imagine he is going to really do well over the winter months.”The Zetland is the only British Group race for juveniles at a trip beyond a mile but Soumillon reported that Pierre Bonnard, a general 16-1 chance for next year’s Derby, still had plenty left at the post.“When I started to ask him to pick up at the four-furlong marker, he changed gear really easily,” Soumillon said. “He still had plenty of power after the line so I’m sure he will be some horse next season.”Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

Not for the first time this season Anthony Belleau and Edoardo Todaro, French and Italian, had the run of the place, scoring two and one tries respectively, asNorthamptonwent to the top of the table, albeit temporarily, dispatching their nearest and dearest.Theirs has been a bitter-sweet opening to the season, squandering huge leads in games one and two, but here they timed their surges to perfection to come away with the win and their third bonus point out of three.Leicesterheld the lead for large stretches of a match that only really hit its straps in the second half, but by then we had not only tries in a seesawing contest, but the customary argy-bargy. Belleau’s second try, on the hour, clinched it.Roebuck hat-trick sets up nine-try rout as Sale pile more misery on NewcastleRead more“It’s not often French internationals become available, who are willing to leave France, for financial reasons,” said the Northampton director of rugby, Phil Dowson. “The market’s slightly different over there. For somebody who wanted to push his boundaries, not from a financial point of view, but from a rugby-development one, is very refreshing.”Belleau, a fly-half, came on early in the second half at full-back, replacing Tommy Freeman, who was playing his first match of the season, his 100th for Northampton. Freeman, in turn, had moved across to cover full-back when George Hendy limped off.Lower-leg injuries were the order of the first half. Luke Pearce, the referee, was off within 10 minutes with a calf problem. Hendy followed 15 minutes later, having landed awkwardly under a high ball, which stretched Northampton’s resources out wide, already missing at least three potential starters. A few minutes before the break, Freeman seemed to break down under a high ball, as if shot. He limped on until half-time, witnessing Northampton’s third try, scored down the other wing.Quick GuideRoundup: Russell leads Bath to the top while Bristol edge out ExeterShowFinn Russell ledBathto a bonus-point 38-17 victory overGloucesteron his return to the team despite picking up a yellow card that caused a brief second-half wobble. After his watching brief in the coaches' box last weekend, the British and Irish Lions fly-half (pictured meeting fans) returned as captain and displayed his full range of skills in his team's third successive Prem victory to top the table overnight, at least.Russell's faultless kicking supplied 13 points for Bath, who scored first-half tries through Tom de Glanville, Tom Dunn, Ollie Lawrence and Ewan Richards. Gloucester, who have now lost seven matches on the bounce in all competitions against their West Country rivals, crossed three times through Will Joseph, Ollie Thorley and Ben Loader – the last two coming early in the second half when Russell was off the field to close to 28-17. But Russell returned to kick his sole penalty of the contest before converting Richards' second try of the contest.Johann van Graan, Bath's head of rugby, said: \"Defensively Finn was excellent  and his kicking game is so good that you've just got to expect that of him. He's been away from rugby for 10 weeks, on holiday and then he had to regain his fitness, and he comes and delivers that for 78 minutes.\"Bristolovercame a 20-minute red card for Scotland international Tom Jordan to record a hard-fought 18-14 victory overExeterat Ashton Gate. Jordan was dismissed for a high challenge and their already depleted side were further hit by failed head injury assessments for Josh Carrington and Jack Bates. However, they still triumphed with tries from Bill Mata and Gabriel Oghre, while Sam Worsley kicked a penalty and a conversion, with Jordan adding a penalty. Ben Hammersley and Henry Slade scored Exeter's tries, with Slade adding the extras.Rob Baxter, Exeter's director or rugby, was frustrated after seeing his side fail to take advantage of Bristol's tribulations: \"Going out in the second half, we needed to take the game by the scruff of the neck and take charge. However we were zombie-like, walking in to going behind as we gave them penalty after penalty to allow them to piggy-back up the field.\"\"That effort was almost the highlight of my time here,\" said Pat Lam, Bristol's director of rugby, on his team's fighting spirit after going a player down. \"We had to improvise throughout and there was some real steel and guts out there as we had to play 30 minutes of that game with 14.\"PA MediaPhotograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Saints have absolutely blitzed opponents in the first half of their opening two matches, only to be hauled in by dramatic comebacks in the second. This time they were more circumspect in the opening exchanges. Theirs was the first try, two more returning Lions, Alex Mitchell and Fin Smith, combining, the former’s chip ahead bouncing wickedly into his hands to set up the latter for a run to the posts.But Leicester were if anything more direct. Billy Searle had opened the scoring with a penalty in the second minute, before Freddie Steward started and finished a fine score at the end of the first quarter.View image in fullscreenNorthampton’s Edoardo Todaro finds company at Franklin’s Gardens.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesNorthampton upped the pace in the 10 minutes to half-time. Todaro, the teenage Italian winger, finished on the right after Tom Litchfield and Freeman had combined down the left to put Saints back in front. When Searle retook the lead for the visitors with a penalty two minutes before the break, Todaro broke down the left and sent Tom Pearson into the corner for Saints’ third and a 17-13 lead.Freeman returned for the start of the second half, but it took one missed tackle to convince him he could not carry on. On came Belleau, and the complexion of the game changed again.First, though, Leicester retook the lead when Harry Wells was driven over after a series of penalties to the corner. Five minutes later, Belleau struck with his first. He may have been playing in an unfamiliar position, but class is class.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fraser Dingwall and Rory Hutchinson combined to slice open the Tigers’ midfield. Belleau was in support, but Leicester scrambled to stop him that time. No matter, he was on hand again to take Mitchell’s pass and score in the corner.Searle kicked another penalty to earn Leicester the lead once more, so the Saints came again. Dingwall thought he had scored just before the hour, but a knock-on in the buildup denied him. When Leicester cleared, Belleau took the kick with aplomb on the touchline, chipped over the advancing defenders and collected another wicked bounce to stroll clear to the posts.Smith’s penalty with 10 minutes remaining took Northampton beyond a score for the first time, but James O’Connor, the Wallaby veteran making his Tigers debut, secured Leicester a bonus point with one of his own three minutes later.That was it for the scoring, but Franklin’s Gardens was by then rocking to a new rhythm. The day belonged to their new friends from the continent.Explore more on these topicsPrem RugbyNorthamptonLeicesterRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

One thing’s for sure: it’s all about himSat 11 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 11 Oct 2025 19.06 EDTShareIn this mortal existence, we all have dreams. As a child, I wanted to be an astronaut, until I found out there’s no Taco Bell on the International Space Station. That’s the thing about dreams: they often lead to cruel disappointment. Such is the fate of President Donald Trump, his hope of winning aNobel peace prizedashed – not by a lack of fast food, but by common sense.The 2025 award instead went to theVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who was barred from running for president by her nation’s courts. Machado acknowledged Trump in her acceptance of the honor, saying she appreciated his support of Venezuelan democratic reform. At least he’s keeping an eye on democracy somewhere.Trump could take that as a bit of a consolation prize and focus on next year, when the effects of a burgeoning Gaza peace deal become clear. But losing is for losers, so Maga supporters are, predictably, upset about it all. Sean Davis of the Federalist declared theNobel was actually “beneath” Trump and “a joke”. If so, I wouldn’t mind never hearing about it again.Whenever I’d get a C on a test, I’d mutter to myself about how grades are a construct of oppression and college isn’t actually important. “The Man” made me go to school and read about Kant or physics or plenary authority. Like I even care about that. Not caring is a superpower in a cruel world that cares not for our feelings or our desires. Sometimes the only power we have is to withhold our interest and project indifference. When we lose a game, it’s a lot easier to deny its legitimacy than to accept failure – like unplugging a PlayStation after getting blown up by a landmine in Call of Duty.That might be the masterstroke of the modern American conservative movement. Lose an election? Must have been cheated. Finding it hard to justify the deployment of the military on American streets? The enemy is incredibly clever and is hiding. Didn’t win the peace prize? Alfred Nobel must have been a cuck and a beta and a loser. Might as well unplug the PlayStation that is democracy.Trump’s entire worldview seems predicated on a notion that life is unfair, the system is rigged and he alone can balance the scales back toward justice. This all makes sense as a rhetorical strategy, and it has proved popular in an age in which most people deem the American government to be about as straight as a bowl of chicken noodle soup. But it doesn’t play so well when his grievances are focused almost exclusively on himself and his own personal gripes. Indicting his enemies, trying to get late-night talkshows canceled and whinging about an award that apparently has no value – it all starts to get rather tiresome, like your mom re-litigating that time Beverly forgot to send a thank-you card after her wedding. How many times can one hear about the relatively low cost of postage before it’s time to move on to a different subject?Trump’sapproval rating is in the dumpster. Granted, I can’t remember the last time a president was consistently popular since 9/11. So maybe this is just the new normal. Or maybe lots of people are tired of hearing how one specific person is having a bad day (again) because they didn’t win a medal.Frankly, I’d like to hearmore about me. I’m incredibly self-absorbed (I work in the media, after all) and desperately crave approval. Where’s my medal? When will my parade happen? Which head of state will subtly roll their eyes when I’m not looking? I wrote this in between power naps, and it was incredibly difficult to get up to work after the first one. WhenDonald Trumpgives a speech, he should be addressing me directly. I have needs, too, you know? I have done nothing to earn that attention, but I’m asking for it. When mapping out domestic policy, you should be asking yourself: “How does this affect Dave Schilling?” “What will Dave think of this?” “Can we name an aircraft carrier after someone whose father served in the air force?”And if I don’t get what I want, I’ll say it doesn’t matter. I’ll find something else to obsess about, some award that I can easily procure through intimidation or coercion. I’ll kick a child in the knees and demand their honorable mention ribbon for Little League.I think it’s finally time I get the award I don’t want, but definitely deserve.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionNobel peace prizecommentShareReuse this content"

But moderate voices are still in tune with the majorityGordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Sat 11 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 11 Oct 2025 12.37 EDTShareNigel Farage portrays his Reform UK party as a unique phenomenon that has burst on to the global stage, its meteoric rise an exceptional epochal event. But this week, in every one of Europe’s major countries and from India and Thailand to the US and Argentina, hard-right, anti-immigrant, anti-globalisation parties like his are also ahead in the opinion polls.In last Saturday’s Czech elections, the rightwing, pro-Putin populist Andrej Babištoppled prime ministerPetr Fiala.National Rally, which has just brought down yet anotherFrench prime minister, is leading the polls for both the French presidency and parliament. In Germany, thefar-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)is currently the most popular party. Hungary’s Fidesz party, Robert Fico’s pro-Russian Slovakian coalition and the Brothers of Italy are already in government, while theFreedom party of Austria(FPÖ), the Netherlands’Freedom party(PVV) and Belgium’sVlaams Belang– all hardline nationalists – are part of an international coalition of anti-internationalists, inspired by far-right propagandists likeSteve Bannon, seeking to dethrone the international rule of law, diminish human rights and destroy multilateral cooperation.The populist nationalist surge exposes a new and unavoidable truth that democrats ignore at our peril: an authoritarian ethnic nationalism – once thought toppled with the Berlin Wall – has replaced neoliberalism as the dominant ideology of our age, giving us a world of firsts: “America first”, “India first”, “China first”, “Russia first”, “my tribe first” and often “my tribe first and only” regimes. It is this ethnic nationalism that helps explain why the world is now composed of91 autocracies and only 88 democracies, and ethnic nationalism is the force behind the violations of international human rights law not just by Russia in Ukraine but in almost everyone of the world’s 59cross-border conflicts and civil wars.It is important to understand the underlying forces, common to almost every country, that have fuelled this new age of nationalism. It starts with a widely felt sense that a globalisation that was open but not inclusive has been a free for all that has not been fair to all.For more than a decade, leaders have not only been slow to respond to the millions who feel left out and left behind, but also to the changing balance of global economic power, moving us from a unipolar world once dominated by the US to a multipolar world of competing superpowers, and from a rules-based order to a power-based one. The ethnic nationalism that this has incited means free trade is giving way to protectionism. Where economics used to drive politics, the politics of nationalism is now driving economic decisions, and already more than 100 countries are running mercantilist policies marked out by reshoring and friend-shoring and by bans on cross-border trade, investment and technology transfer, sinking international cooperation to its lowest ebb since 1945.But all is not lost. The cement is still wet, and even as it hardens we can find hope in the common sense of the global public. In asurvey by Focaldatafor the Rockefeller Foundation, of 36,000 people in 34 countries we find a clear majority are more resistant to an exclusionary nationalism and more willing to embrace international cooperation than many of the leaders who rule over them.Across the world there is, perhaps surprisingly, only a small group of hardened anti-internationalists representing 16.5% of the global population (even if 25% in today’s US) who either feel coexistence between ethnic and religious groups is impossible or have a zero-sum mindset that if they or their country do well, it has to be at the expense of others doing badly.But there are another 21% at the opposite extreme, whom we might call committed internationalists, who either still see cooperation across borders through open trade as a positive sum win-win, or are what the US philosopher and writerKwame Anthony Appiahcalls “rooted cosmopolitans”.1:35Nigel Farage 'doesn't like Britain': Keir Starmer takes dig at Reform leader – videoThe vast majority of the global public are somewhere in between: not narrow, inward-looking nationalists, as “America first” ideology would suggest, or all-in cosmopolitans. They are patriotic but don’t see the world as in a never-ending struggle between the “us” and the “them”, adversaries permanently set apart from each other in an unbridgeable divide.Do the majority in the middle prefer a duty-free or a dutiful world? Are they prepared to accept obligations beyond their garden gate or city wall? Yes, under certain conditions. A first group, 22%, will back humanitarian action to relieve suffering and are prepared to act out of altruism, supporting emergency help for disaster zones. Those we might call “good cause” multilateralists feel the pain of others and believe in something bigger than themselves.A second group comprising 22% are pragmatic multilateralists who want to know that any taxes paid out for international development are spent well. And there is a third group, 21%, self-interested multilateralists, who will endorse cooperation if they can see that it benefits them and their communities, whether it be through guaranteeing them food on the table or peace and security.So a clear majority can be constructed not just for humanitarian aid if money is well spent but also for global action to deal with global problems, like climate crisis and pandemic prevention, as long as this case is argued on grounds of enlightened self-interest, and if we stress the reciprocal benefits that flow to them and their own country. And thus for those who have long wondered whether we cooperate out of need or if we have a need to cooperate, the answer is both.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because this is party conference season, when politicos always lose the plot | Simon JenkinsRead moreAnd while in-depth polls tell us that across the west, illegal immigration is currently the biggest national issue – and no one should doubt that it must quickly be brought under control – the snapshots of opinion also tell us that the public are even more concerned about what is happening in their own lives and within their own local communities. Last month, Keir Starmerspoke movinglyabout how what’s good about Britain can drive out what’s bad, doing so precisely because in most western countries, “broken” and “in decline” are the words people have for years most commonly cited when asked about both our economy and society.But as the prime minister also reminded us, the far right is more interested in exploiting grievances than ending them. Farage hailed Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget as “the best Conservative budget since 1986”. But he would also enact Truss act two – what she planned to deliver – the biggest ever cuts in public services. Reform’s plan toreduce public spending by £275bnwould not repair downtrodden communities but ravage them, turn citizen against citizen and wreck any spirit of solidarity. Under a Farage hard-right regime, you will not be able to afford to be sick, disabled, poor or vulnerable. Every day from now on, and in every constituency, Reform should be asked which hospital, which school and which public service will be the first to be cut or closed.“Faragism” is neoliberalism at its most inhumane, more destructive even than monetarism, and vindictive far beyond austerity. What the public are telling us all over the west is that they want their governments to rebuild our economies and our civic societies . “Reform” and its global allies should be exposed day after day for policies that would devastate both. And for those of us who believe our best days could be ahead of us, we can go beyond highlighting Reform’s hypocrisy by setting out a case for a better Britain that appeals not just to idealists, but to pragmatists, to self-interest, and to the everyday compassion of the British people.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Explore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageKeir StarmerLabourThe far rightFar rightcommentShareReuse this content"

They spurred me on my journey from a tough council street in the north-east all the way to the cabinet. We had no heating upstairs when I was growing up, and we struggled with damp. But that story’s not unique: it’s shared by so many working people across Britain.That’s why I have been fighting for changes that will make a difference to working families. Such as reviving Sure Start for a new generation, funding childcare from nine months old, rolling out free breakfast clubs, expanding free school meals for half a million more children and capping the branded items schools can require. Together these changes save working-class families thousands of pounds.As co-chair of the Child Poverty Taskforce, I am clear everything is on the table, including removing the two-child limit. As deputy leader I would continue fighting for policies that change the lives of working people: investment in public services, ensuring the full delivery of our employment rights bill so people get fair pay for a fair day’s work – change that makes Labour members proud of this government, proud to campaign, proud to win again.Lucy Powell:The cost of living crisis, Covid, austerity and the global financial crisis have all hit working-class communities hardest. Each has deepened inequalities in class, region, education and opportunity. Addressing this is what this Labour government is about.We have an economy that serves the few, not the many – a “trickle-down” model that needs rewiring. I want to see a much stronger sense that tackling economic inequality and fairness unites everything we do. That’s one of the reasons I strongly support lifting the two-child benefit cap at the forthcoming budget, looking at Gordon Brown’s measures on gambling taxes to pay for it.As deputy, I would help to seize back the political megaphone to set the terms of the debate, being clear about what we are doing to reshape the economy in the interests of working-class communities – buses and trains back in public hands, a new energy company, GB Energy, owned by us all, more dignity and security in work and at home with the employment bill and renters rights bill.The job of the deputy leader isn’t to write a separate budget or policy programme but to ensure that our values shine through, and what we are doing is rooted in the communities we are here to serve.Stephen Heinson:Sadly, neither candidate seems able to acknowledge that the cost of living crisis is really a crisis of our failed economic model. There’s a direct link between declining living standards and unrestrained corporate greed: the private energy companies skimming off huge profits from ballooning household bills, for instance, or the property developers and letting agents cashing in on renters’ misery in a broken housing market. Tackling this crisis meaningfully would mean defying the corporate interests of Labour’s CEO donors.How are you going to address the rise of the far right in this country?Dominique Sandring, LondonBP:The Labour movement has been defined for generations by our core values – solidarity, compassion, fairness and social justice.As deputy leader, I’d campaign with hope and optimism, underpinned always by those Labour values that mean so much to our members. We should be proud of our values – proud to stand up for them, never ashamed of them.The far right feeds off fear and negativity, exploiting the struggles of people across the country and offering false solutions and empty promises. Let me be clear: we won’t win by parroting the language of Reform UK and Nigel Farage.We are Labour and we must govern, campaign, and win as Labour. We must deliver on the change that we promised voters so we can build the society we all want to see. That means expanding free school meals, renewing Sure Start and reforming employment rights to make work pay.It is only a united Labour party, the greatest vehicle for social justice this country has ever seen, that can deliver real change in our communities and country.LP:Fighting the forces of division and hate is the challenge of our age. The future of our democracy depends on us winning the battle of hearts and minds, showing that mainstream progressive politics is a force for change. We’ve got to up our game. As deputy leader I would help Labour do that.We shouldn’t try to out-Reform Reform UK. Nigel Farage wants the country to believe that immigrants are the root cause of all our problems. I wholeheartedly reject that. Yes, we need secure and strong borders as a foundation of a secure and fair country, but the reasons for deep-seated inequalities go much deeper.We need to seize back the political megaphone and set out far more strongly our diagnosis of what is really wrong with this country, and what Labour is doing to fix it. We have an economy that hasn’t worked for ordinary people for decades. From Margaret Thatcher to austerity, Covid and the energy crisis, those with wealth and assets have done well. For everyone else, life has got harder and less secure.We need to show that every single thing we are doing is in service of addressing this – to tell our own story about how we’re fixing the real problems.Dominique Standring:Reading the answers side by side, my sense is that Lucy Powell has answered the question better in that she has identified that Reform are winning the battle of hearts and minds – and that Labour’s message is not cutting through. Bridget Phillipson talks of Labour’s values being “solidarity, compassion, fairness, and social justice”, but I have not seen much evidence of this with the Labour government: from its stance on family reunification for those with visas to the genocide in Gaza and focus on ID cards. Crucially, neither of them have answered the “how” part of my question in any detail.Why isn’t Labour adopting a wealth tax? Can you give an example of a country where such a tax has been successful?Norma Spark, LondonBP:I’ve always believed in progressive taxation – it’s at the core of building a fairer and more equal society. The nature of our economy has been changing, with more people earning money from the wealth they hold; we have started to address that through the changes on carried interest, by increasing capital gains tax. And of course through non-dom reforms – you can’t simply be allowed to opt out of paying your fair share.It’s right that we all pay a fair share to deliver a better public realm, and that the broadest shoulders carry the greater burden. In government, I’ve put those values into action already, taking on the private school lobby to end tax breaks so we can invest in state education. I’ve been pilloried for it across the rightwing press, but I’ll never back down on that. I’m not afraid to take on vested interests to improve public services.The chancellor sets and makes our policies on taxation, but with a seat at the cabinet table and as deputy leader, I’d be relentlessly focused on pushing for more investment in public services so we can fix the foundations of our society and give everyone the best chance in life.LP:Let’s be honest, we need to tell a much stronger story about fairness and addressing inequalities, and whose side we are on. That must run through everything we do, including the budget.We have an economy in which those with assets and wealth do very well, yet for ordinary working people or those on fixed incomes, life has got harder and harder. Turning that round should be at the core of what this – and any – Labour government is about.That’s why I’ve been clear that the two-child benefit cap needs to be lifted. It’s also why we need to recognise how trust in us has been damaged by mistakes on the winter fuel allowance and proposed cuts to Pip. These measures did not seem fair. We need to give a much clearer sense of whose side we are on – and in whose interests we are governing.It’s not my job to write the budget, but it will be my job to ensure that what we do is connected with the views and experiences of our broad movement and the communities we seek to serve.Norma Spark:Bridget Phillipson cites steps the Labour government has taken or is taking to address tax inequity – all of which I applaud, but I hope Labour can be bolder. Lucy Powell recognises the need for Labour to “tell a better story” and acknowledge the mistakes it has made. This doesn’t address the benefits or pitfalls of a wealth tax.Last year, the G20 leaders agreed to engage cooperatively to ensure high net-worth individuals are effectively taxed. Neil Kinnock advocates an annual wealth tax of 2% on people with wealth of more than £10m. And Gordon Brown is advocating raising tax on the UK gambling industry to lift 500,000 children out of poverty. Though the deputy leader of the Labour party does not set the budget, they do have an important seat at the table. In advocating for options for a wealth tax, both candidates could signal their commitment to a more equitable and fair societyandtell a good story!Would you tell Keir Starmer some home truths about policy, about sidelining the north-west – and about his perceived arrogance?Lee Stringfellow, BuryBP:I know this government has made mistakes – I won’t pretend otherwise, but I will promote our achievements. I have fought for policies that are true to Labour values – investing in state education by ending private schools’ tax breaks, reviving Sure Start, rolling out free breakfast clubs.I have argued for policies true to my values, to Labour’s values, and I worked with Angela Rayner doing the same. She challenged us as ministers to always go further for working people, to be impatient for the change they deserve. With my own mandate as deputy leader, I would continue that role. But I absolutely refuse to pit one area of our country against another. It’s the role of the deputy leader to bring all the parts of our party together, from every corner of our country.Last year I campaigned up and down the country to get Labour candidates elected, I’ve not stopped as education secretary and I won’t stop as deputy leader. With local elections and elections in Wales and Scotland around the corner, the role is going to be more important than ever.LP:This isn’t about personalities, it’s about how we use power effectively after 14 years out of government, and we have some achievements to shout about. The problem is they are being drowned out by unforced errors. Anyone who knows me knows I’m a straight talker, unafraid to be an honest voice. I told home truths on welfare, and maybe it wasn’t well received, but it won’t stop me speaking truth to power. But I won’t snipe from the sidelines or take to the airwaves.Discussion isn’t dissent – it’s vital if we’re to rebuild our electoral coalition. I really want this government to succeed. With the mandate of members I would have a strong, independent role, outside but alongside government. It’s a responsibility I would take very seriously and use wisely, but I think it’s self-evident that we can do better.There’s been too much groupthink, disconnected from the voices, talents and experiences of all of our broad movement, which is Labour’s strength. I’ll be that bridge with our members and elected representatives, pushing us all to be the best version of a Labour government we can be.Lee Stringfellow:All Bridget Phillipson has done with her answer is given a response Starmer would want me to hear. She has zero credibility as a serving minister to fight against the wrong decisions and actually listen to members.As for Lucy Powell: what is wrong with a little discord and actually saying what you believe – and indeed, what the party members and voters believe? This government has tied itself in knots with its no-sense fiscal rules and left itself with little room to manoeuvre; and all the while, who suffers? Normal taxpayers.We are heading for electoral oblivion sooner than we think if we do not grasp the nettle this year with some zinger policies that outflank Reform. Powell answered the better of the two – but I suspect Starmer will sideline her. Thanks for your answers, but this longtime Labour voter is now considering the Lib Dems.Why isn’t the government considering rejoining the customs union? What will you do to convince Starmer to see sense?Toby Hannam, BristolBP:Back in 2016 I argued that Brexit would inflict serious economic damage on areas such as Sunderland. No part of the UK had more at stake than the north-east of England. That’s why I campaigned for remain and was one of the first MPs to call for a second referendum on the details of the deal.But those decisions are in the past – we need to focus on the future. What businesses need most now is certainty to drive economic growth and stability. The progress we have made securing anSPS trade dealwith the EU is essential for British businesses, as are the protections secured for British steel. In my own portfolio we’re working on opportunities to once again boost educational exchange through schemes like Erasmus+, but of course there is more to do.I will say that I think we need to change this debate and challenge toxicity. Reform are far too happy to whip up anger about immigration, and I won’t do it. My family came to Britain as immigrants, and our story is shared across this country. I want to campaign and win on Labour values, not use the language of Reform.LP:I voted remain, and worked cross-party during the Brexit years on a proposal called Common Market 2.0, because I felt strongly that we needed to respect the outcome of the referendum, even though it was not what I voted for. One of the main reasons why we ended up with Boris Johnson as prime minister and a hard Brexit, losing so much of the so-called red wall, is because we didn’t listen and accept that a majority voted to leave and wanted Brexit.We shouldn’t reopen old wounds but focus on how we can make that botched Brexit deal better so ordinary people can feel the benefits – whether that’s action on e-gates to ease travel, closer ties on goods to lower food prices, or joint action on defence, security and irregular migration.People voted for Brexit, they voted for Johnson – and they voted for us in 2024 because they want change: more control over their lives and an economy that works for them, not just those at the top. The most important thing now is that we deliver the change people voted for.Toby Hannam:This is very much the party line response. The fact is we are willingly economically harming ourselves with the appalling deal Johnson and David Frost made. This idea that nothing can be done is symptomatic of the utter capitulation Labour have allowed. They’re too frightened to go near the issue due to the howling of the press and Reform – even when the benefits to the country are so clear.The deals that the government have obtained in office are such small beer. Other countries use the customs union and are not in the EU. Personally I would rejoin tomorrow. Without the significant improvement that the customs union could bring, our economy will continue to stumble on anaemically. The massive rebuilding that Labour wants to achieve won’t happen because they need at least another term.Why doesn’t Labour commit to building council houses?Sarah Woods, North YorkshireBP:Labour’s £39bn social and affordable homes programme aims to deliver 300,000 new homes, 60% of them, or 180,000, for social rent – including new council homes. This is six times more than delivered in the past decade. It’s the biggest increase to social housing in a generation.I grew up in a council house in Washington, Sunderland, raised by a single mother and reliant on free school meals. I know first-hand the importance of council housing.Angela Rayner’s sense of the urgency of this was exceptional – she knew, as I do, that children need secure, warm, dry and safe homes in order to have the childhood and the opportunities all of us deserve.The changes Angela announced to the right to buy scheme – protecting existing social housing stock to meet housing need and delivering a fairer, more sustainable scheme – are essential. Councils will be able to retain 100% of receipts from the sale of right to buy so it can be invested in delivering more social homes.I’ve secured more than £600m to boost construction skills to ensure we have the workers we need to build housing – including introducing new construction technical excellence colleges in each region of the country.LP:We have committed to building more council housing – the biggest such commitment in a generation. Maybe people don’t hear enough about the good things Labour are doing, and that’s something I will seek to put right.The legacy Angela Rayner leaves on housing is a great one. As well as being a colleague and friend, I saw up close what an effective minister she was. More social homes, changes to right to buy so we don’t lose as much stock as we have been doing, a massive housebuilding programme and much more. Having a secure home is the bedrock of everything.In government I led on legislation, and I was proud we included a strengthened renters rights bill in the king’s speech.Sarah Woods:Bridget Phillipson has helpfully provided figures, but this raises further questions. The social and affordable homes programme has a 2035 horizon. Is the intention to build 18,000 council houses a year? According to Shelter England, as of 2023-24, there are 1.33m households on the social housing waiting list. In that year, their figures show a net loss of homes for social rent of 650. I am very glad to hear of the changes to protect existing stock from right to buy, but there will still be a loss through housing stock deterioration. Unfortunately, a considerable “Brexit benefit” was to lose free movement of workers, leaving a hole in construction capacity. It is good to see that Bridget Phillipson has secured funds to boost construction skills. However, this doesn’t deal with the immediate problem.Lucy Powell raises a very valid point on Labour’s messaging. I would like to see clearer messaging – Green party leader Zack Polanski is a breath of fresh air, showing how it’s done.Both candidates agree on the importance of a secure home. My husband and many of my schoolfriends were raised in council housing. The costs to this country from the failure of successive governments to replenish this asset are immense. A Labour government should be building with the rapidity of the 1950s, when 200,000 council houses were built annually.Do the candidates agree that reports that Earth’s carbon sinks are failing should be a turning point for humanity?Sigurdur Bennett, EdinburghBP:The climate crisis is the biggest challenge facing humanity. I’m proud of the strong climate action this Labour government has taken to bring down emissions, showing leadership on a global stage.The weakening of the global consensus on the urgency of climate action is profoundly troubling, and Labour must continue to show that leadership. This is another example of where I’ll be ensuring we stay true to our values. I want the world of tomorrow to be a world worth living in, not a planet on fire, and the responsibility falls to us to make that happen today.We’re already seeing the effects of global warming – wildfires,failing carbon sinks, flooding. But with decisive action it’s not too late to turn things around. We simply must not let ourselves be blown off course by climate deniers and opponents criticising our vital net zero policies.LP:We have a strong agenda on the environment, and I’m proud to have Ed Miliband’s backing to be the next deputy leader. Ensuring there’s a just transition, tackling the climate crisis and achieving clean power by 2030 is a huge task, but one that Labour is up for.It’s not the job of the deputy leader to write an alternative policy manifesto – we were just elected with a strong programme on climate and nature. As deputy leader I would make sure that Labour is shouting about what we’re doing to improve our environment and motor ahead to net zero – and call out the backwards policies of Reform and the Tories, which would cost jobs and investment and worsen the climate and nature crisis.Sigurdur Bennett:Repeated failure of Earth’s carbon sinks now seems to be a serious possibility, which is frightening. Not that you’d know it from the candidates’ responses. Which might explain why the government may incentivise further North Sea oil drilling. What can you say about such an initiative? Only that it’s insane.Explore more on these topicsLabour party deputy leadershipThe panelLabourBridget PhillipsonLucy PowellcommentShareReuse this content"

He is also such a hate-filled little man that members of his own family are publicly rebuking him.During Donald Trump’s first term, in 2018, Miller’s uncle, Dr David Glosser, wrote apiece for Politicocalling Miller an “immigration hypocrite”. Glosser noted that if Miller’s hardline immigration policies “had been in force a century ago, our family [Jewish refugees who fled to the US from Europe to avoid persecution] would have been wiped out”.Then, in July, a woman calledAlisa Kasmer, Miller’s cousin and former babysitter, wrote a viral Facebook post calling the Trump aide “the face of evil”. Miller’s cruelty, she said, left her feeling “ashamed and shattered”.While some of his extended family can’t seem to stand him, Miller does have a very enthusiastic cheerleader in the form of the Fox News host Jesse Watters. Last October, Watters claimed that his show’s audiencebelieves thatMiller is “some sort of sexual matador” and asked Miller to comment on this. TheMaga-dorresponded by telling young men to “be the alpha … show that you are not a beta … Be a proud and loud Trump supporter and your dating life will be fantastic.” This is terrible advice for many reasons, not least of which is the fact that gen Z women are themost liberalgroup in the US.I’m afraid it doesn’t end there; a couple of weeks ago, the Fox News host had Miller’s wife,Katie(a Maga bigwig in her own right), on his show to chat about how sexy Stephen is. “What is it like being married to such a sexual matador?”Watters joked. Very inspiring, apparently; he wakes up every morning excited about how he is going to “defeat the left”.It doesn’t even endthere. This week, Watters once again sang his favourite man’s praises on TV, calling Miller a “policy savant”.He added: “Men who are high-value men, like Stephen Miller, take risks. They’re brave, they’re unafraid, they’re confident and they’re on a mission. And they have younger wives with beautiful children.”Watters went on to claim that the representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez “wants to sleep with Miller … it is so obvious”. The whole spiel was so weird that even Watters’s colleague, Greg Gutfeld, appeared disturbed. “That was pretty creepy,” Gutfeld said.While Watters doesn’t seem to need an excuse to praise Miller, this week’s episode wasn’t entirely unprompted. Rather, Watters was reacting to an Instagram video in which Ocasio-Cortez called Miller a clown and urgedpeople to laugh at Maga.“Miller looks like he is so mad that he is 4’10” that he’s taking that anger out at any other population possible,” AOC said in the video. “Laugh at them! Laugh at them!”It’s not particularly clever to mock someone’s height. (AOC hassince saidshe loves “short kings” and was talking about how “big or small someone is on the inside”.) Nevertheless, the lawmaker is absolutely correct that the way to get under the skin of people in Maga-land is to laugh at them. Ghouls like Trump and Miller don’t care if you call them evil or hypocritical. They don’t care if you use facts and logic against them. What they care about is being laughed at. What they really can’t stand is being mocked. “Humor has long been one of the most effective weapons of anti-authoritarian politics,” Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a scholar on fascism,noted last yearafter Democrats started calling Republicans “weird”.You can see how thin-skinned Maga is by the ridiculous amount of traction that AOC’s throwaway joke has had.Mediaite has reportedthat three primetime Fox News hostsfactcheckedMiller’s height: Watters, Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity. Ingraham even had Miller on her show and played the clip to him while he squirmed in discomfort. “What a train wreck, what a train wreck … that lady is a walking nightmare,” Miller replied. He also clarified that he is 5’10”. A very big boy.Steven Cheung, who is White House director of communications, also responded to Ocasio-Cortez’s commentswith a poston his official Twitter account saying: “Sounds like @AOC is often used to the shorter things in life.” He added a pinching hand emoji, which is sometimes used to suggest a small penis.The Trump administration should not be underestimated by any means. They are organized, they are ruthless, and they are proving extremely effective at implementing theiragenda. But while we shouldn’t underestimate Trumpers, it’s helpful to remember that they’re not invincible. AOC is right: we should laugh at them. It’s either laugh or cry.French appeals court increases sentence of Gisèle Pelicot rapistHusamettin Dogan contested his first conviction, telling the court Pelicot’s husband had invited him over so it was OK. The court found otherwise this week, increasing Dogan’sprison sentence to 10 years. Pelicot’s lawyer had told the court: “[C]onsent is personal, not delegated. Consent is obtained directly and not by proxy from a husband.”Women may carry a higher genetic risk of depressionNew researchpublished inNature Communicationshas found 16 genetic variants linked to depression in women, compared with eight in men.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All I need to watch movies at the cinema is darkness and quietLarry RyanCinema used to be an accessible and affordable mass pursuit. This debate about the ‘purest’ format to view certain films only risks putting off movie-goersSat 11 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 11 Oct 2025 16.38 EDTShareOn what sort of screen should you watchOne Battle After Another? Paul Thomas Anderson’s new film about revolutionary radicals in a ravaged United States comes in a plethora ofslightly different, vaguely confusingformats.It was originally shot in ultra-rare, 70-year-old VistaVision celluloid, but there are only four cinemas in the entire world that can actually accommodate this –one in London, three in the US. There is also an Imax version on 70mm celluloid film, the more common digital Imax format, and a 70mm film projection for some select cinemas. And, finally, there are the majority of currentcinemas with more standard digital projection, which also happen to have quite big screens for you to gaze up at moving pictures in the dark.With attendances falling and cinemas under threat, I understand why there has been a push to make seeing films more of an event in recent years. Since the pandemic,Tom Cruise has put himselffront and centre of a campaign to encourage people into the cinema.Christopher Nolan has also made several of his films with the grand Imax screens in mind: his upcoming The Odyssey is said to be thefirst blockbustermade entirely with Imax cameras (screenings for the film in the highest-grade formatsold out a year in advance).“Between the vision-filling screen and sound that chases you around the auditorium, it’s more like stepping into the movie than watching it at a safe distance,”purred the Odeon websitefor its Imax screenings of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.There is a clear desire to put the emphasis on an all-encompassing feast for the senses; inevitably, the cost of these special screenings is usually higher than a traditional cinema ticket.I’m breaking free from watching TV on my laptop in bed. I’m going back to the big screen | Caitlin CassidyRead moreI love going to the cinema and I try to see new films this way as much as is feasible. But I do think that the focus on seeing things in the cinema now is becoming over-egged – especially when it is given some sort of moral imperative, or if an idea forms that a certain premium version is the “true” experience. Cinema used to be a relatively accessible and affordable mass pursuit. Any move away from this, while potentially bringing short-term gain, may be a mistake in the long run. The fear lingers that by foregrounding limited and premium offerings – akin to going to the opera or a West End theatre – lesser cinemas could be further diminished, and audiences discouraged if a certain format isn’t availableor is simply too expensive.Anecdotal evidencefrom true believers (in the right locations) suggests that seeing One Battle After Another in VistaVision provides the greatest pleasure: the colours are more beautiful, the look and feel is purer, like seeing a painting in person rather than a reproduction in a book. Other cineastes (orLetterboxd bros, per modern nomenclature) say that it must be seen in Imax formats for the true thrill-ride. I personally find viewing at an Imax a little like you’re watching tennis – moving your head this way and that to follow where you should be looking, and the emphasis on immersive viewing a little too literal. A friend suggests that unless you have the perfect seat near the centre of an Imax room, the experience is actually inferior.What is it that we love about seeing a film in the cinema? I don’t think it can be defined by the dimensions of the screen alone. It’s being in a dark room, free from distractions, with a reasonably comfortable seat, surrounded by others, watching the film on a big – or big enough – screen above: sometimes it’s in a vast theatre, sometimes it’s a room for 20 people. All have their merits. And as the host of oneUS film podcast suggestedwhen asked what was the best place to see One Battle After Another: “In the movie theatre you like the most.”In the end, I saw the film on an “XL” screen at my nearest multiplex: I can’t quite figure out if that meant a bigger screen, bigger seats, or bigger buckets of popcorn. I’ll admit the thrilling visual aspects must hit well on an even more souped-up screen, but they were pretty great from my vantage point, too. As were its kinetic energy and frantic score, dragging you through a story both compellingly strange and laugh-out-loud funny. Granted, there are alsovalid criticismsto be made.One of my formative moments engaging with “serious” film was when I was aged about 14 and saw Rear Window. It made me instantly realise there could be more to a film than most of what I had seen up to that point. The fact that I happened to watch it on an early-1990s, medium-sized cathode-ray TV one bored Saturday afternoon, almost by accident, didn’t diminish the effect. A love for film can blossom in many formats. Under the right conditions,everything is cinema.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At least they will be back for ChristmasHelen Serafinowicz is the writer of Motherland and AmandalandSat 11 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 11 Oct 2025 03.33 EDTShareMotherhood has given me two kids and a TV show (and a spin-off). When I first entered Motherland, it was quite clear this was a mad world, and ripe for the picking. Trying to find your tribe when you have absolutely nothing in common with your fellow tribespeople, other than babies of the same age, is very difficult, but also rich in inspiration for comedy.Over the years, I would write down little moments or observations that made me chuckle: arriving at a kids’ party dressed exactly like one of the dads; watching in amazement as a mum asked an usher to turn the heating up in the auditorium on a school trip to see The Lion King; the mum whose advice to her children if they got lost in a crowd was “think like a paedophile” (we used this – with permission – in the Halloween episode of Motherland).My document of observations grew into the TV programmeMotherland, and, more recently,Amandaland. But now my little inspos have left, and I don’t know what to do with myself. They both started uni last week (at opposite ends of the country). I was dreading this moment, and as a single mum I’m finding it unbearable. The house is so quiet. The kitchen is permanently clean and there are no trip hazards in the hallway. Both gone. Two for none. It’s so sad.My daughter was the first to go. It was a slick operation. Three hours down the M11 and M25 with her hijacking the music and whacking me every timeshe saw a yellow car.We had a time slot to collect her keys and between the two of us we lugged her stuff up a couple of flights of stairs to her new home; a 6.5-sq metre room with the basics: a desk, chair, bed, storage and noticeboard (no drawing pins). It was quite clean apart from a Cheerio I found in the wardrobe. After I used all my God-given strength to get the single sheet to fit her small double mattress (I should have checked this) and unpacked an awful lot of my clothes and makeup that she had pilfered from my bedroom, it was time to say goodbye. The sight of her walking away (in my boots) hit me in the stomach.View image in fullscreenLucy Punch and Anna Maxwell Martin in a 2017 episode of Motherland.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyA week later, it was five hours up the M6 with an overnight stop in a fully booked budget hotel bursting with emotional families on the same path. Campus was rammed with packed cars full of duvets, air fryers and anxious students desperately trying to hide their nerves. I hadn’t learned my lesson from the previous week and almost passed out, straining like I was in labour to get another single sheet over another small double mattress. Also forgot drawing pins. I didn’t want to cramp my son’s style by hanging around, saying hello to his neighbours, so we had a solid hug and I managed to sneak in a kiss on his cheek without inflicting any embarrassment on him whatsoever. He waved, then disappeared into his building, jangling his keys like he’d just bought his first house.As I drove off, there were a bunch of students holding banners from their various societies that said things like BEEP FOR NETBALL and HONK FOR WATERSPORTS, so I honked and they cheered and I cried for most of the five-hour drive home with nobody to pass me a salt and vinegar Disco.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I felt utterly bereft, then I switched on the hall light and the bulb popped out of the socket and the cat ran in and puked up a tiny snout and a tail. I walked the dog to the pharmacy today to collect my son’s backup EpiPen for his lobster allergy. (Though I’m quite sure he’ll manage to avoid lobster for the next few years.) The walk took me past the kids’ old primary school. The sound of the little children playing in the playground started me off again and I had to dig deep to control my lip wobble as I said my son’s name, collecting his prescription.I owe so much to my children. Motherland wouldn’t exist without them. In our first Motherland Christmas special, Kevin is testing Minecraft (pronounced Mein-Kraft) to see if it’s suitable for his girls. I got most of his dialogue from my son and his experience of having his homestead set on fire and his pigs stolen by his so-called friend.I’m hoping this next chapter of parenting will deliver another wave of anecdotes I can use in my writing, although it seems the world goes quiet. The mums sign up for upholstery courses while the dads have their midlife crises.Apparently, Gordon Ramsay wore his son’s underpants after he dropped him off for the first time. I am sad but I think I’m fine not wearing my kids’ underwear. There are support groups and counsellors that specialise in empty nest syndrome but instead I’ve signed up for netball on Tuesdays and Thursdays and I’m going to have a good old sort-out of the house ready for when they’re back for Christmas.

With a laugh, he added: “It made me question, just what have we done here?”Everyone wanted to speak to him about the same thing; a town council motion, approved unanimously and across party lines, calling on the central government to push forwardwith a stalled proposalto regularise undocumented migrants in Spain.“To us, it was the most natural thing in the world,” explained Núñez Pérez, as he paused to greet residents in the town’s central plaza. In recent decades, migrants from across the globe had been atrracted to Villamalea for the many jobs on offer.The steady supply of labour had helped turn the town into an agricultural heavyweight – about 70% of the mushrooms sold in Spain come from here – while also transforming Villamalea into a rich tapestry of residents whose roots trace back to 32 countries.View image in fullscreenJosé Núñez Pérez, mayor of Villamalea: ‘We didn’t even debate it, we were all onboard right away.’Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianFor the 11 town councillors who backed the motion to grant papers to undocumented migrants – from Núñez Pérez’s People’s party to the Socialists and the United Left – this reality took precedence over party lines.“We didn’t even debate it, we were all onboard right away,” said Núñez Pérez. “There’s a lot of work to be done here. And there could be even more – the problem for these companies is that they can’t find enough people to work.”With the town’s companies weighing up whether to bring in temporary foreign workers, it only made sense to allow those who were already here a fair chance at a foothold. “It’s not just economics, it’s a question of humanity,” said the mayor.In late August, the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde,said gross domestic outputin Germany would have been about 6% lower in 2019 if it hadn’t been for foreign workers. The picture was similar across the eurozone, she said. “Although they represented only around 9% of the total labour force in 2022, foreign workers have accounted for half of its growth over the past three years.”View image in fullscreenIn recent decades, migrants have been attracted to Villamalea for the many jobs on offer.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianIn Spain, where the Socialist prime ministerhas insistedthat migration is an opportunity, a surge in arrivals has helped tomake the country a bright spotamong Europe’s plodding economies.Of late, even some of the most ardent critics of immigration have conceded its necessity; in June Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, the far-right leader whohas long calledirregular migrants a threat to Europe’s future, said her governmentwould issuenearly 500,000 new work visas for non-EU nationals in the coming years, in addition to the 450,000 handed out since she took power.While regularisation programmeshave long been usedacross the EU, with 43 put in place by more than a dozen countries between 1996 and 2008, in Villamalea the push to grant papers was also rooted in the town’s history.View image in fullscreenVenancio Cuenca Lopéz, president of the Villamalea Retirees Association: ‘We’re all human beings, we need to have some empathy.’Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianDuring much of the 20th century, the town’s residents were forced to fan out acrossEuropein search of work, said Venancio Cuenca Lopéz, the head of a local retiree association. “Some of them had papers, but some had no papers, no job offers, nothing,” he said. “We can’t say: ‘Well we did it, but now we’re against it.’ We’re all human beings, we need to have some empathy.”He pushed back against claims that regularisation would push down wages. “There are companies that take advantage of undocumented workers, forcing them to work in poor conditions and paying them little. Then Spaniards can’t work because they’re competing with people who are getting paid peanuts,” he said. “So we regularise them, everyone has the same conditions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From the pensioners who make up about a quarter of the town’s population to the around 20% who were born abroad – the majority from Morocco or Romania – residents shrugged off the far-right’s efforts to disparage diversity. “Here everyone has their life and their world, but when we get to together we all get along,” said María Anguix García.At Villamalea’s town hall, officials are swift to cite the efforts many have made to foster integration, keenly aware that they’redoing so against a backdropof swirling disinformation about migration.“There was a day when people who practise Islam went to the church and got to know the prayer space and then they did the reverse; the Catholics went to the mosque and experienced it,” said the mayor “And around two months later, the five religions we have in Villamalea came together to pray in the church.”When the flood of media requests poured in earlier this year, most wanted to know how Núñez Pérez reconciled his stance with others in the conservative People’s party, particularly as the leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, wasincreasingly linkingimmigration to insecurity.View image in fullscreen‘I’m paid by the people of this town,’ says the mayor, José Núñez Pérez.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianAcross the country, PP politicians have entered into governmentssupported bythe far-right, anti-immigrant Vox party. As a result, PP politicians have lurched further to the right, leading to motions such as the one recently seen in Jumilla, a town of about 27,000 residents, where the PP-led councilbacked a ban on religious gatheringsin public sports centres that appeared to target Muslims.Núñez Pérez bristled at the comparison. “I’ve always said that I’m not paid by my party, I’m paid by the people of this town,” he said. “In my party, as in all parties, there are differences of opinion. But if you look at the wider picture, we’re not that different.”It was, after all, the PP who had carried outmore regularisation programmes than any other partysince Spain returned to democracy.Others in the PP had also followed in Núñez Pérez’s footsteps; in late September, about 20 miles (32km) away in the town of Tarazona de la Mancha, a similar mix of councillors, though headed by a Socialist mayor, hadcome togetherto unanimously pass their own motion calling on the central government to grant papers to undocumented migrants.Even so, Núñez Pérez knew that the fact that he was a conservative mayor backing regularisation had become a “morbid” fascination for many. “But I think it’s the most natural thing; I know what happens in my town, we live quietly, we live in peace and we learn from each other,” he said. “In interviews they always ask me about my political party. But just because someone fires a shot over there, it doesn’t mean we’re all going to do the same.”Explore more on these topicsSpainMigrationEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I will not respond well to that nonsense,” she added to audience laughter.Adichie and her husband, Ivara Esege, have three children: a 10-year-old daughter, and twin sons age one and a half.The boys are “going to grow up in a world that’s quite different from the world which I grew up in, and my husband grew up in”, she said. “I think they’re fortunate to have a good father. But sometimes I think: do we have what it takes to make sure that they turn out right?

She added that “we should talk more about boys and men. It’s important. Because boysarestruggling”.Adichie appeared at the festival to collect the Sunday Times award for literary excellence, and was presented with a first edition copy of Chinua Achebe’s novel Arrow of God, which she described as his “greatest novel”. She then discussed her latest novel, Dream Count, with the Times literary critic Johanna Thomas-Corr.While Adichie spoke extensively about feminism, she did not address the backlash she has faced in recent years for her views on trans women. The criticism began in 2017 after an interview on Channel 4 in which she said that “when people talk about, you know, ‘Are trans women women?’, my feeling is that trans women are trans women”. In aninterview with the Guardianin February this year, she did not answer questions on the topic, only coming close to the subject at a later point in the interview: “What do I want to say about cancel culture? Cancel culture is bad. We should stop it. End of story.”Asked in Cheltenham what women should be doing about issues such as the rollback of reproductive rights in the US, Adichie said: “Women have really done everything they should. I want to talk about what men should be doing.“In general, women will listen to women and men, men will listen to men. So I think we need to recruit some good men to go out there and talk to other men.”Explore more on these topicsChimamanda Ngozi AdichieCheltenham literature festivalMennewsShareReuse this content"

Another 24 have left properties voluntarily after receiving a section 21 notice.Internal council documents seen by the Guardian suggest that council officials have been planning to regain possession of the properties since at least 2023, but the full implementation of the scheme was delayed until after last year’s election.An internal briefing document from March 2024 read: “Advice received from democratic and legal services [is] that this is a key decision and it is too controversial to take during the pre-election period.”Plans to evict the tenants were made despite the fact Lambeth council wrote to the Conservative government in 2019, asking it to end no-fault evictions.The tenancies were overseen by Homes for Lambeth, a group of companies wholly owned by the council. It was established in 2017 as part of an estate regeneration scheme. As part of this initiative, the local authority bought back some properties from residents who had purchased former council houses at a discount as part of the right-to-buy scheme introduced by Margaret Thatcher’s government in 1980.The council then transferred these properties to Homes for Lambeth. This meant they were able to be rented on the private market, despite ultimately being owned by the local authority. At its peak, Homes for Lambeth managed about 200 properties across six estates.However, Homes for Lambeth is now being disbanded due to concerns over poor performance after an independent review by former senior civil servant Bob Kerslake in 2022. Kerslake recommended that management of the Homes for Lambeth stock be brought back “in house” to improve efficiency.About 100 of the homes were vacated voluntarily before eviction notices were issued. The council is now using legal measures in an attempt to regain possession of the remaining properties. In internal documents, it said this would help it meet the “most urgent” housing needs in the borough, including accommodating vulnerable families who needed temporary housing after being made homeless.Some residents tried to challenge the decision in court, but in June a judge ruled that current laws do not prevent councils from setting up companies to issue private tenancies.Jules Zakolska, 27, who received a section 21 notice in April, has been at the forefront of efforts to fight the decision on behalf of the affected residents. She said some have been driven to the brink of suicide by the stress. Zakolska said she and her partner, July Kaliszewska, 24, had also suffered severe mental health issues as they faced the prospect of their home being repossessed by bailiffs.Zakolska, a university social sciences student, has lived in the property in Clapham with Kaliszewska, a bar manager, for three years. She is autistic and suffers from fibromyalgia, a chronic condition that causes pain and fatigue. She says she is “traumatised” by the prospect of ending up in temporary accommodation.She said: “Lambeth just doesn’t care. It says it wants to provide housing for the most vulnerable people, but if it makes us homeless, we will become those people. They have created this issue and traumatised us. It’s not right. I’m struggling. Who wouldn’t be, with the prospect of becoming homeless? It’s taken over my life.”A Lambeth council spokesperson said: “With almost 5,000 vulnerable homeless Lambeth families staying in often poor-quality temporary accommodation every night, there are incredibly difficult choices to be made. To do nothing would ignore their plight.“When the opportunity arose we chose, legally, to use properties we own to house the homeless rather than rent them out privately on a short-term basis.“The majority of these homes have been returned to the council. We have supported tenants who needed help through this process, while successfully giving dozens of homeless families a roof over their heads.“This situation is just one example of what long-term structural underfunding of council services, the national failure to build the homes we need, and the ongoing housing crisis looks like on the frontline.“The high cost of housing in Lambeth and across inner city London is a huge driver of deprivation – a point we are working hard to communicate to government.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing,Communitiesand Local Government said: “We need to do everything we can to support people out of homelessness and we are open to new approaches on this.“We are spending £1bn on homelessness and building 1.5m homes, so we can tackle the housing crisis we inherited and help councils like Lambeth manage housing need in their areas.”Explore more on these topicsLocal governmentLondonLocal politicsHousingCommunitiesLabournewsShareReuse this content"

Just over a year earlier he had resigned from governmenta second time amid controversy.He had described Epstein to Powell as “safe” and a “friend” in an email before the meeting.Powell is now Keir Starmer’s national security adviser. His role has been questioned in thecollapse of a Chinese spying case.Tony Blair and Nick Clegg hosted dinner giving tech bosses access to UK ministerRead moreAccording to papers released to the BBC, a briefing memo by the senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft described Epstein as a friend of Mandelson and the then US president Bill Clinton, as well as being close toPrince Andrew, the Duke of York.A spokesperson for Blair said the meeting was “long before his [Epstein’s] crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction”.A government spokesperson said Powell had only forwarded the request in his role as chief of staff.Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. He died in prison in 2019.The release of the documents had been blocked by government officials over concerns it may affect UK-US relations. However, the National Archives has now released the document as a result of a freedom of information request.The BBCreported that an email from Mandelson to Powella week before the meeting said: “Do you remember when Clinton saw TB [Tony Blair] he said he wanted to introduce his travelling friend, Jeffrey Epstein, to TB?“This was frustrated – TB said at the time – in the office for reasons (he says) he was unclear about. I think TB would be interested in meeting Jeffrey, who is also a friend of mine, because Jeffrey is an active scientific catalyst/entrepreneur as well as someone who has his finger on the pulse of many worldwide markets and currencies.“He is young and vibrant. He is safe (whatever that means) and Clinton is now doing a lot of travelling with him.”Mandelson went on: “I mentioned to TB that Jeffrey is in London next week and he said he would like to meet him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Capsat soldiersbrought the current president, Andry Rajoelina, to power in a coup in 2009.Speaking on state television on Saturday night, the prime minister, Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, said the government was “fully ready to listen and engage in dialogue with all factions – youth, unions or the military”.Rajoelina appointed Zafisambo and a new defence and security minister afterdissolving the previous government last weekin response to the protests.The soldiers’ intervention ratcheted up pressure on Rajoelina, who demonstrators have been demanding stand down. The youth-led protests broke out on 25 September, initially over water and electricity cuts. However, they quickly widened into calls for a complete overhaul of the political system, with thegen Z protesters not placated by Rajoelina firing his governmentlast week.Earlier in the day, police fired stun grenades and teargas to try to disperse the protesters. The recently appointed minister of the armed forces also called on troops to “remain calm”, at a press conference on Saturday.“We call on our brothers who disagree with us to prioritise dialogue,” minister general Deramasinjaka Manantsoa Rakotoarivelo said. “The Malagasy army remains a mediator and constitutes the nation’s last line of defence.”However, a Capsat leader accompanied by a large group of soldiers called on other military units to “refuse orders to shoot your friends”, in a video that was posted on social media before they left their barracks.“Let us join forces, military, gendarmes and police, and refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers and our sisters,” he said, also calling on soldiers at the airport to “prevent all aircraft from taking off”.“Close the gates and await our instructions,” he said. “Do not obey orders from your superiors. Point your weapons at those who order you to fire on your comrades-in-arms, because they will not take care of our families if we die.”Nothing has been posted on the president’s social media accounts since Friday evening, when he waspicturedmeeting the heads of 10 of the country’s universities to discuss improving students’ lives.An activist who attended Saturday’s demonstrations said she was concerned about the involvement of Capsat, due to their role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power. She also criticised politicians who made brief addresses to the crowds in front of the city hall as “opportunists”.“That’s why I’m not rejoicing at all, because all of those people gravitating around this ‘event’ are all dangerous,” said the activist, who didn’t want to be named for fear for her safety.A member of Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group of young people that has helped to coordinate the protests, also expressed doubts about what would happen next. “We are very happy, but a lot is happening [and] we don’t want another corrupted person to take the power here, so we will do everything to have the right to choose who to put up there,” he said.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsMadagascarAfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Hyper-focused. Single-minded. Intense. Devoted. Often single. They speak in reverent tones and hushed whispers and can walk with preternatural silence across a bed of leaves. They wield binoculars with the nonchalance of a sommelier sampling a Dom Pérignon. They can crouch in shrubbery for endless hours. They speak in code and use hand signals. They have lists and notebooks and write with lead pencils. They dress with military precision: khaki pants, fitted belt, cedar-brown shirt, wide-brimmed hat, waterproof boots. Their social calendars are governed by migration patterns and their conversations are peppered with whispered phrases like “Was that the trill of a reed warbler?”They are bearers of universal mysteries. Holders of ancient wisdom. They are birdwatchers.I’ve always admired the magpie for its beauty and spite – so much so I got one tattooed on my arm | Patrick LentonRead moreBirding isn’t merely a hobby. It’s a lifestyle, like wearing Crocs or having a Goop subscription.Birders are the world’s most unwavering optimists. They believe, against all odds, that somewhere out there is a bird they have never seen, just waiting to be discovered. And they will keep looking, one step (in a pair of sensible shoes) at a time.They are dealers in wonder and awe, masters of birds and ecosystems, and, despite the many stereotypes we can muster, one should never underestimate the power, joy and influence of the birdwatcher. Indeed, they may just be humanity’s greatest source of inspiration and hope.The birdwatcher could be anyone. The kindly neighbour who seems oddly fixated on their back yard feeders. The co-worker who goes mysteriously quiet during meetings every time a shadow flits past the window. They’re everywhere, quietly cataloguing the avian world, one robin or finch at a time.Birding is an invitation to connect with the natural world in profound and unexpected ways. And while it might start as a solitary pursuit, birding is actually an enormous community of care, a movement rooted in the simple yet transformative act of witnessing and safeguarding the world’s wonders.Few pastimes inspire more unbridled mockery than birding. It’s the Dungeons & Dragons of the natural world. And birders themselves? They occupy the curious cultural space of being both painfully earnest and entirely incomprehensible to outsiders. There are the “patch birders”, fiercely loyal to their local wetland or park, who catalogue every twig and leaf with near-pathological fervour. Then there are “twitchers” who, upon hearing the faintest whisper of a rare and exotic bird sighting, are conveyed to a fevered delirium; they will abandon weddings, careers and even newborn babies to embark on an intercontinental pursuit for a fleeting glimpse of a golden-winged warbler. There are listers and big listers; back yard birders and urban birders; ear birders, sea birders, competitive birders and social birders.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Birdwatching, as it turns out, is gloriously addictive.At its heart, birdwatching is an act of quiet rebellion. It is the gentle act of noticing – the willingness to see the world around you. And this simple act is, in itself, revolutionary. In a world that often teaches us to look past the natural world – to pave it over, cut it down or otherwise ignore it – birdwatching demands slowness and attention. It demands that we pause, that we listen, that we care, that we see.And it’s never about one single bird. It’s about everything that sustains them. The soil. The trees. The rivers. The wind. Soon, it evolves into understanding the delicate interplay of ecosystems – the leaf litter turned over by superb lyrebirds, the seeds dispersed by cassowaries, the flowers kissed into bloom by honeyeaters. A single bird becomes a prism through which to view the entire ecological web, a window into the world, a thread connecting you to nature.It’s no longer possible to see a forest as a commodity or a wetland as an inconvenience when these spaces are home to creatures whose existence depends upon them. Birders understand, perhaps better than most, the fragility of the natural world. They see it in the dwindling numbers of migratory birds, in habitats encroached upon by development, in the ghostly silence where once there was song. Yet they also see hope: in the return of the California condor from the brink of extinction, in the rise of the whooping crane after tireless conservation efforts, in the fierce resilience of nature when given the chance to heal.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Simon & SchusterTo be a birder is to fall in love. Obsessively, irrevocably and, perhaps, foolishly. This love, it creeps up on you. A wedge-tailed eagle slices through the sky. A magpie’s liquid song pierces the dawn. A snowy owl gazes unblinking across the tundra.So, here’s to the birdwatchers, those optimistic, slightly eccentric custodians of wonder and joy and passion and love. Because sometimes it is as simple as opening your eyes, stepping outside and looking upon the world around you.For once you see – once you really see – you cannot unsee. You see the beauty and destruction, the joy and the tragedy of life around you. And you fall in love. And once you are in love, there is nothing you wouldn’t do to protect this fragile, extraordinary world.This is an edited extract fromNature’s Last Danceby Natalie Kyriacou, out now through Simon & SchusterExplore more on these topicsBirdsWildlifeAustralian booksextractsShareReuse this content"

One species, theMadeiran large white(Pieris wollastoni) has now been declared extinct.“Beyond their beauty and cultural significance, pollinators like bees and butterflies are lifelines for our health, our food systems and our economies – sustaining the fruits, vegetables and seeds that nourish us,” said Grethel Aguilar, the IUCN director general. “The latest European red list assessments reveal serious challenges, with threats mounting for butterflies and crucial wild bee species.”The causes of the rapid recent declines are the continuing destruction or damage of habitats caused by agricultural intensification and land abandonment, draining wetlands, overgrazing by livestock, and the use of fertilisers and pesticides includingneonicotinoids. The fragmentation of pollinator-friendly habitat greatly increases the risk of local extinctions.Global heating is also revealed to be a major threat: 52% of all endangered butterflies in Europe are imperilled by the climate crisis – approximately twice as many as a decade ago.Up to 90% of flowering plants in Europe depend on animal pollination, according to Dr Denis Michez, lead coordinator of the wild bee assessment. “Sadly, wild bee populations are in drastic decline and cannot be easily replaced by managed colonies,” he said. “If wild bees disappear, many wild plants might be at risk too – of which flower-rich meadows and beautiful orchid species are just a few examples.”Fifteen species of bumblebee, which play a crucial role in pollinating peas, beans, peanuts and clover, and 14 species of cellophane bee, known for pollinating trees such as willows and red maples, are now classified as threatened.Simpanurgus phyllopodus, a mining bee unique to the continent and the only species of this genus in Europe, is now assessed as critically endangered – the scientific category closest to extinction in the wild.Butterflies that are only found on mountain tops are particularly vulnerable to global heating as they need to move uphill as their habitats become warmer but eventually run out of space. In southern Spain, theNevada graylingand theAndalusian anomalous blueare among more than 40% of European endemics (only found in Europe) threatened with extinction.In the Mediterranean, species such as the critically endangeredKarpathos graylingare imperilled by extremedrought and wildfires.Meanwhile, in the Arctic Circle, global heating is causing the tree line to move north by tens of metres each year, with scrub encroaching on bog and tundra. Warmer conditions also mean reindeer can no longer cross the ice to graze Arctic grasslands and keep them open. Eight butterfly species are threatened with extinction in this region, including Freyja’s fritillary and the Arctic ringlet.“The biggest habitat for all these pollinators is flower-rich grassland and that is disappearing very fast across Europe because of all these factors,” said Martin Warren, one of the lead coordinators of the butterflies assessment. “The positive thing is that so many people care now and there’s a lot more awareness. Under theEU nature restoration legislation, all member states have to reverse the decline in pollinators by 2030, and they are going to have to start doing something. There are landowners who are interested. Let’s hope they can get the incentives that will help them on their way.”According to Warren, there is “low-hanging fruit” in terms of action for pollinators which won’t reduce food production – and may enhance it – such as farmers creating flower-rich margins around their fields.Jessika Roswall, EU commissioner for environment, water resilience and a competitive circular economy, described the conservation status of wild bees, butterflies and other pollinators as “dire”.“Urgent and collective action is needed to tackle this threat. Together with member states, the European Commission has put in place an EU-wide monitoring system for pollinators based on the EU nature restoration regulation, which will help to track our progress. Now, we need to focus on implementation and cooperation with member states to protect our pollinators,” she said.The publication of the bee and butterfly assessments comes after the first Europe-wideassessment of hoverflies, another crucial pollinator group. Published in 2022, it revealed that 37% of all hoverfly species in Europe were threatened with extinction.Explore more on these topicsBeesExtinct wildlifeWildlifeInsectsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Depute leader Keith Brown, who seconded the motion, told delegates: “The only way we can achieve independence is to ask a clear question and get a clear answer.”This call to clarity is key: while independence is not high on the list of voters’ priorities, activists have unhappy memories of trying to explain what many believed was a fatally muddled independence strategy on the doorstep for the general election last year, where the SNP was humiliated by the resurgent Labour party, losing 38 of its 48 Westminster seats.A year on, the party’s pivot to its core message is a mark of renewed confidence, with the SNP once again leading the polls ahead of Scottish Labour and Reform UK, and an understanding that the battleground demographic for the coming campaign is made up of those “soft yes” independence supporters who have drifted away from the party.Speaking for the de facto amendment, veteran activist Graeme McCormick insisted that it was not proposed by “romantic nationalists”. He warned that the SNP was being “hollowed out” because it had failed to inspire its membership with a date for another referendum.The former MP Tommy Sheppard said it was “remarkable” that such a large conference was able to have such a detailed discussion in public and in front of the media, but insisted there were “no quick fixes”. “We have been chasing the next election for too long,” he said, arguing that the party needed a strategy to take it into the 2030s and deepen support for independence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The only way we could get any recourse was via the Fraud Compensation Fund, which had to take a number of years and so guaranteed the tax charge. It was inevitable because of the way the system has been set up.”The news of the probable tax bill is another blow for a family that became one of the most vocal campaigners during a long struggle to win compensation for victims.The scandal began when more than 200 peoplefell victim to a “pensions liberation fraud” during 2012 and 2013, when they were tricked into allowing about £11.5m to be transferred out of their existing retirement plans.Most of those funds were then transferred into three Norton pension schemes of which the company’s former owner Stuart Garner was a trustee. The funds subsequently vanished after being invested directly into the heritage motoring brand, which dates back to the 19th century and has boasted high-profile devotees including the revolutionaryErnesto “Che” Guevaraand the actorKeanu Reeves.In 2022, Garnerpleaded guiltyto illegally investing millions of pounds of people’s retirement savings into his own businesses. He receivedan eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. Garner has always insisted he was also a victim of the initial liberation fraud.The conviction represented a huge fall from grace for the entrepreneur, who had used Norton’s brand to secure himself a cameo role in the 2015 Bond film Spectre and travelled with a government trade mission to China on Theresa May’s jet when she was prime minister.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If someone dies before age 75, a pension lump sum death benefit can only be paid tax-free if payment is made within two years of the pension scheme being first aware of the death.“We appreciate the reasons for not meeting this condition can be outside individual control, but legislation does not provide any discretion over this charge, even in exceptional circumstances.”Explore more on these topicsHMRCPensionsTaxScamsConsumer affairsnewsShareReuse this content"

Stalls sold keffiyehs and people handed out placards that read “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, “it’s not a crime to act against genocide” and “Starmer has blood on his hands, free Palestine”.Ben Jamal, the director of the campaign group, said the march went ahead, despite a ceasefire coming into effect, because the “plan that has been laid out by Donald Trump is not a plan for enduring peace”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Yui Mok/PAHe said the plan said “nothing about the root causes of violence” nor anything “about the system of apartheid” in Palestine or the “right to self-determination” for Palestinians. He added that the group’s campaigning and protesting would not end “until the Palestinian people are finally free”.This is the 32nd national demonstration in support of Palestine since October 2023, according to PSC.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joanna Chan/APA counter-protest by the Jewish-led Stop the Hate group was expected to take place at the junction of Aldwych and the Strand, with police putting measures in place to try to prevent any clashes between the two groups.Scotland Yard said it had imposed conditions on both demonstrations under the Public Order Act to “prevent serious disruption” and had set out specific areas where protesters could gather, as well as a march route.Last weekend, the government announced that police would be given greater powers to restrict protests by allowing them to consider the “cumulative impact” of repeated demonstrations.The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, called for pro-Palestine protests scheduled to take place last weekend to be cancelled or postponed after a terrorist attack on a synagogue in Manchester in which two people were killed.On Wednesday, while on a trade mission in India, Keir Starmer saidprotest laws, including chants, were being reviewed by the government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A federal judge late Thursday ordered Ice to remove an 8ft-tall (2.4 meters) fence outside the Broadview facility after the Village of Broadview said it illegally blocks a public street.Both senators spoke to the local NBC News affiliate while there and have pushed for answers and called for oversight into the conditions inside the facility.“We just want to go in and look at the facility and see what the conditions are and they would not let us in. It is shameful,” Duckworth said.“They’ve refused to tell us this information,” Durbin stated. “I’ve done this job for a few years now, I’ve never had this stonewalling by any presidential administration.”“What are you afraid of?” Duckworth said to reporters, referring to the government. “You don’t hide, you don’t run away when you’re proud of what you’re doing.”The senators said they have congressional oversight authority.“Something is going on in there they don’t want us to see,” Durbin said. “I don’t know what it is.”To the south, inTennessee, at least nine armed guard members began their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the Pyramid, a Memphis landmark, about a mile (1.6km) from historic Beale Street and FedExForum, where the NBA’s Grizzlies play.View image in fullscreenMembers of the national guard patrol on 11 October 2025 in Memphis.Photograph: Brett Carlsen/Getty ImagesThey also were at a nearby tourist welcome center along the Mississippi River. Wearing guard fatigues and protective vests labeled “military police”, the troops were escorted by a local police officer and posed for photos with visitors.Trump has sent or discussed sending troops to other cities as well, including Baltimore; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The federal government says the troops support immigration agents and protect federal property.The guard troops inMemphisremain under the command of the Republican governor, Bill Lee, who supports their use to further a federal crackdown on crime.By contrast, Trump has attempted to deploy national guard troops – including some from Texas and California – in Portland and Chicago after taking control of them himself, over objections from state and local leaders who say such interference violates their sovereignty and federal law. Federal courts in Illinois and Oregon this week blocked Trump’s efforts to send troops out in those cities.The US district judge April Perry in Chicago said theTrump administrationhad violated the 10th amendment, which grants certain powers to states, and the 14th amendment, which assures due process and equal protection, when he ordered national guard troops to that city.In a written order Friday explaining her rationale, Perry noted the nation’s long aversion to having military involvement in domestic policing.“Not even the Founding Father most ardently in favor of a strong federal government” – referring to Alexander Hamilton – “believed that one state’s militia could be sent to another state for the purposes of political retribution,” Perry wrote.“The court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said.An earlier court battle in Oregon delayed a similar troop deployment to Portland. The 9th US circuit court of appeals heard arguments in that case Thursday.Lt Cmdr Teresa Meadows, a spokesperson for US northern command, said the troops sent to Portland and Chicago are “not conducting any operational activities at this time”.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationChicagoMemphisIllinoisTennesseeUS CongressUS SenatenewsShareReuse this content"

It said in a later statement that the shelter had been hit twice by drones and eight times by artillery shells on Friday and Saturday.Map showing drone strikes in Sudan“Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,” said the committee, which is part of a group of activists who coordinate aid and document abuses in the conflict. “The situation has gone beyond disaster and genocide inside the city, and the world remains silent.”A separate medical group, called the Sudan Doctors’ Network, gave a figure of 53 people killed in the strikes, including 14 children and 15 women.The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese Armed Forces in a civil war since April 2023. Its militants have put El Fasher under siege formore than 500 daysand families there are starving.El Fasher – home to 400,000 people – is the last state capital in the region of Darfur that has not been taken by the RSF.

Nearly 25 million people have been forced into acute hunger.Countrywide fighting,fuelled by international powers, has raged in the absence of an effective global effort to end the bloodshed.On Friday, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said he was “appalled by the RSF’s endless and wanton disregard for civilian life” in El Fasher.He said: “Despite repeated calls, including my own, for specific care to be taken to protect civilians, they continue instead to kill, injure and displace civilians, and to attack civilian objects, including [internally displaced people’s] shelters, hospitals and mosques, with total disregard for international law. This must end.”Sudan’s current conflict erupted in 2023, but is part of decades of violence.

He spent time in London that year exploring ways to pull off the flying scenes.Photograph: Jane BownThe surviving working papers for The Freak are more extensive than for any of Chaplin’s other films. They reveal that he was close to shooting it. They detail everything from scene breakdowns to special effects sessions, including wings for Sarapha. There are also financial projections, minutes of technical meetings and production schedules.David Robinson, Chaplin’s official biographer who has written the book containing the material, said: “It’s a shame that it wasn’t finished because it could have been a marvellous film.”For the role of Sarapha, Chaplin had cast his then teenage daughter Victoria, who recalled: “For hours, for weeks, for months, he [Chaplin] studied the movements of birds in flight – the living mechanics of wings. He watched films where men and women soared through the sky. But the techniques back then did not satisfy him. He wanted to find his own way – crafted, personal – a way to translate the sensation of flight on to the screen. I believe he would have found it. But time clipped his wings. Charlie Chaplin never brought his vision to life.”View image in fullscreenA sketch by Gerald Larn of the winged character, described as ‘a bird with a human body’.Photograph: Unknown/The Roy Export Company Ltd. All Rights ReservedSticking Place Books will publishThe Freak: The Story of an Unfinished Filmthis weekend.Paul Cronin, its British publisher, said Chaplin created a heroine as timeless as the Little Tramp, an outsider: “Chaplin made that very clear in his production notes.”This is the first time the script has been published in English, in its original form. It had appeared only in Italian in 2020, in a limited run by the Cineteca di Bologna, which has catalogued the entireChaplin Archive.Chaplin’s daughter Victoria is fitted with wings.Photograph: The Roy Export Company Ltd. All Rights ReservedCecilia Cenciarelli of Cineteca di Bologna, who has edited the forthcoming book in a collaboration with the Chaplin family, said The Freak had been largely unknown even to Chaplin scholars: “We found ourselves handling hundreds of pages of this film we’ve never heard anything about and turned to David [Robinson’s] ‘bible’,Chaplin: His Life and Art, for clarification, only to realise that The Freak was barely mentioned.”Among the papers are casting notes marked “confidential”, listing Robert Vaughn, James Fox and Richard Chamberlain as contenders for the lead role of an English professor who befriends Sarapha after finding her on his roof, injured and unconscious.In one scene, she tells him that she hates her wings: “I don’t like mystifying and frightening people … I am afraid of everyone and everyone is afraid of me.” In another passage, Chaplin wrote that Sarapha “loved him in spite of the fact that he was without wings”.In 1969, Chaplin was in London, exploring ways to pull off the flying scenes. There were talks with companies that created flying effects for the stage as well as film special effects experts, including those at Shepperton Studios.The new book includes an interview with one of the artists, Gerald Larn, who created 150 drawings showing the wings and Victoria in flight. He said: “Charlie was very clear and detailed about what he wanted and what he expected from us … We thought it would be a difficult project, but not impossible … The good thing was that we always got feedback from Charlie.”View image in fullscreenA page of the script.Photograph: The Roy Export Company Ltd. All Rights ReservedArnold Lozano, the manager of the Chaplin estate, described the forthcoming published script as “the first comprehensive presentation of Chaplin’s last, unfinished film project”. He added: “Drawn from nearly 3,000 pages of Chaplin’s words, photographs and designs, along with his own recorded readings and piano compositions for the score, it revealsThe Freak as perhaps his final bequest. Unique within his body of work yet still touched by unmistakable Chaplinesque elements, this publication offers a rare glimpse into one of the most remarkable projects of his 63-year creative life in cinema.”Explore more on these topicsCharlie ChaplinnewsShareReuse this content"

A work of autofiction, first published in 1997, it chronicles Kraus’s infatuation with a cultural theorist named Dick, a doomed, one-sided love affair that nonetheless pulls Kraus, a depressed, 39-year-old failing film-maker languishing in a sexless marriage, out of her personal and artistic rut. After a slow start, the book became a cult classic and in 2016 it was made into anAmazon Prime Video TV series, with Kraus played by Kathryn Hahn. “To me, success would have been like a long review in the New York Review of Books, not being a character on a sitcom,” Kraus says now. Her commercial success was a financial boon, of course. “But who can stand by a book they wrote 20 years ago? It was massively embarrassing to go out and support the book as if I’d written it last year.”She had, however, promised herself that if she ever achieved mainstream success she would write about it with the same candour that she brought to her struggles. “I’m going to write about all of it. Not just about youth, but about middle age,” she says. “Middle age is so much harder to write about, because youth is kind of like a trope. We’re very familiar with reading books about the aspirations or disappointed aspirations of youth, but middle age is much crazier ground. It’s not as sexy, it’s not as familiar. So, to write about middle age in the same way takes commitment.”Kraus is now 70 years old, frank and sharp and funny as ever. She’s speaking by video call from her home in Baja, Mexico, where she stays when she wants to escape LA to write. Her onscreen name, confusingly, comes up as Agatha. “Oh, that’s my dog’s name. My account goes under my dog’s email address,” she says, very matter-of-factly. Agatha is a chihuahua-terrier mix and somewhere in the background. “Why does your dog have an email address?” I ask, when no further information is forthcoming. It’s for spam.Who can stand by a book they wrote 20 years ago? It was massively embarrassingThe Four Spent the Day Together,Kraus’s ninth book, is another exercise in radical disclosure, this time exploring how, as Kraus’s public profile soared in her 60s, her private life fell apart once more when her second husband relapsed into drug and alcohol addiction. She chose to write about being married to an addict because the experience is “underrepresented”, she says, perhaps because there is so much shame attached to it. “I think it’s maybe more shameful for the co-addict than it is for the addict,” she observes. But Kraus, who writes unflinchingly about shame and abjection, finds writing a way to metabolise those feelings. On the page, everything becomes “material”. “My character is just a character in the book. It’s never yourself – even if you use your own material. You’re never the same person, you’re constantly changing,” she says.Kraus prefers the term “nonfiction novels” to “autofiction” because her books are as much about other people as they are about her, and she describes her approach as “reporting on experience”. “The fabulation of an entirely invented world of a novel is completely beyond me,” she says, “but transcribing and reporting to be accurate, that’s something I can do.” She changes names and details, but “I don’t invent anything. It’s more a matter of mixing, it’s a composition.” For decades, she has kept a detailed daily diary. “Just the act of writing anchors you in time and gives a reality to things that have happened that would otherwise be completely vaporous and elusive,” she says.In her novels, Kraus uses herself as a case study, digging so deeply into her own, singular story that she uncovers truths that feel closer to universal, if not for everyone then at least for other “weird girls”. To construct them, she supplements diaries with boxes of photographs, interview recordings and – in the case of her latest book – court transcripts. The Four Spent the Day Together is split into three parts: the first describes Kraus’s upbringing in blue-collar small-town Connecticut; the second covers the slow, traumatic breakup of her second marriage; and the third describes Kraus’s journalistic investigation into a brutal murder that took place close to her former summer house in Minnesota, in a working-class community ravaged by meth.View image in fullscreenKathryn Hahn in the TV adaptation of I Love Dick.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIn her more recent novels, Kraus has written about herself in the third person and used pen names, so that she can treat her characters “like clowns or puppets” and maintain enough emotional distance to write about very sensitive, personal topics. In this book, Kraus is Catt Greene and the character based on her second husband, a psychologist, is named Paul Garcia. Paul says awful things to Catt, telling her that she is old and ugly and that he only married her for her money, and she lives in fear of his rage. Late at night she Googles things like “is my partner abusive?”. The reader is desperate for Catt to leave the relationship well before she does so. “I’ve talked to other friends in this situation, who’ve been partners with addicts. And it really is like a frog in boiling water. You tend to rationalise it as not really the person, it’s the addict,” she says. She tried to find a therapist, but while there are countless therapists who specialise in supporting addicts, the only one she found who helped family members lived miles away, in Santa Barbara. She used to go to Al-Anon meetings often, but she struggled with their official position that it’s possible to carve out a healthy life for yourself while living with an addict. Ultimately, she did seek a divorce.Kraus’s writing lays bare not only her private life, but that of others. The real-life Dick, identified by New York magazine as the British academic Dick Hebdige, tried to block publication of I Love Dick. How did her ex-husband respond to his unflattering portrayal? “The publisher wanted him to write an email giving his permission, and he did that happily and gladly,” she says. “The person who Paul Garcia is based on is now in a very strong and quality recovery … and we’re still very close to each other in many ways.” Is she saying they are back together again? Kraus laughs, sounding suddenly very girlish, and either embarrassed or appalled. “I mean, who knows,” she says. “If you’ve known someone for 20 years and they are part of your permanent family, those are such flexible and relative terms: together, apart,” she adds as she recovers her poise.Anyone who has gone through a year of high school is damaged for lifeWhen it came to writing about her upbringing, Kraus held back until after her parents’ death, believing they would find it too painful. “Everything about our family was based on pretence, and pretence is the opposite, of course, of writing. I didn’t want to hurt them,” she says. Her father worked in the warehouses of the Cambridge University Press but would have everyone believe he was an editor. He was “a little bit Asperger’s”, she says, spoke with a fake British accent and had a fantasy that he was the illegitimate son of a famous Park Avenue surgeon. Her mother was “the enabler of these fantasies”.Kraus was a good student, but was bullied mercilessly at school in Milford, Connecticut. By 13, she was regularly bunking off and hitchhiking to bars to drink with older guys. She might have gone completely off the rails had her parents not decided to emigrate to New Zealand in the hope their children might be happier. “They were timid people, and this was a very bold move. It was the boldest, most radical move they had made in their lives,” she says. New Zealand in 1969 felt like the end of the world, she recalls. “Magazines came by boat, and they didn’t arrive until three months after they had been published.”The fresh start helped Kraus and her younger sister, who settled easily into school in Wellington. Her New Zealand high school was “much more interesting and challenging”, she says – you actually got to read whole books. “It wasn’t perfect, but there wasn’t the level of vicious bullying and scapegoating that there was in the US.” Why was the bullying worse in America? “I mean, it’s notorious!” she says. “Anyone who has gone through a year of high school is damaged for life!” Her first husband, the cultural critic Sylvère Lotringer, would tell her he preferred working with non-Americans “because he said there was something about the American upbringing that made people so defensive and competitive and distrustful”.Kraus worked as a journalist in New Zealand before returning to the US in her early 20s, initially in the hope of becoming an actor. She met Lotringer in 1980, when he attended a performance piece she had written and performed in New York. They married in 1988. Lotringer founded the independent publishing house Semiotext(e), where Kraus remains an editor. Although it marked the beginning of the end of their marriage, Lotringer was initially supportive of Kraus’s infatuation with Dick, pleased that she had a distraction from her struggling film career, and he wrote several letters to Dick too. Semiotext(e) published I Love Dick, as well as Kraus’s later autofiction, Aliens and Anorexia (2000), Torpor (2006) and Summer of Hate (2012). Kraus is also the author of several essay collections and a biography of the novelist Kathy Acker, whom she deeply admired and who was an ex-girlfriend of Lotringer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When, seven years later, three teenagers kidnapped another teen and shot him dead on a hiking trail near their home, Kraus drew on her journalistic background to investigate their lives. Before they killed the victim and used his meagre savings to buy junk food, the teens spent 36 hours hanging out together. What had driven them to commit such a brutal and seemingly senseless killing, she wondered? The working-class America they had grown up in – an ex-mining town torn apart by addiction, violence, family breakdown, poverty and lack of opportunity – was entirely different from the blue-collar community in which she had spent her early years, and geographically close but a world apart from Kraus’s rural bolthole. A local landlord told her that the teenagers’ thinking and worldview were “depraved” – “and I thought that was the most profound answer I got from anyone in the book, much more so than the educators, the police, the lawyers,” she says. “There’s just an inexplicable depravity at the heart of it that pretty much defines American contemporary society. It’s a nihilism and an apathy that swirls underneath everything.”Meanwhile, she watches in horror as President Donald Trump succeeds in his “flood the zone” strategy, creating endless social media diversion to distract from his power grabs and excess. She is due to travel to Mexicali, in Baja California, to visit an exhibition by a Mexican friend who, although a green card holder, no longer dares travel to the US. “Why has the resistance to Trump been so ineffective?” I ask. The Trump administration is “so well-organised now, so relentless,” she says. “They are making incursions on every single front: the gerrymandering, the culture wars, the immigration roundups. To be in a position of resistance already takes so much more. It’s so much harder to defend than attack,” she adds. “That’s compounded by the fact that there’s no political party that has any glamour or allure to lead the resistance. The Democratic party could not be lamer or less sympathetic or appealing to anyone.” One person who has the right idea is Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, she continues. “He’s obviously less than a perfect avatar of the Democratic party. He’s a billionaire, he’s an enormously privileged person like Trump, but at least he gets it. You have to play the game you’re in and the game now in American politics is just cynicism, distraction and insult.”View image in fullscreen‘Writing anchors you in time’ … Kraus.Photograph: Maggie Shannon/The GuardianKraus is similarly politically outspoken in The Four Spent the Day Together, and she’s likely to annoy some on the left, too. She believes that the#MeToo movementoverreached, for instance. “There’s so much competition within the attention economy that people push things to their absolute limits,” she says. In 2018, she wrote a controversial blogpost defending Avital Ronell, a New York University professor who was accused of sexually harassing a male grad student. She maintains that Ronell, whom she describes in the book as a “philosopher pixie”, was “completely villainised” in the New York Times piece that broke the story. “It was so clear to me that this was the next media pivot. #MeToo was already getting a little played out and stale and for a gay man to accuse a gay woman, that gave it another month of play,” she says. (The NYU investigation had found that Ronell sexually harassed the student and suspended her for an academic year.)Around this time, she became subject to much Twitter mockery and insult for being a landlord, having for decades written and spoken openly about subsidising her artistic career by buying up and managing low-value rental properties. In her new book, she recounts since-deleted tweets by book critics calling her things like a “POS slumlord”. “I understand how people see landlordism as a kind of evil,” she says, because she recognises the frustrations of young people priced out of the property market, “but it’s a good and service like any other.” And unless you are independently wealthy, she points out, most artists need another source of income.For years, Kraus has taught graduate art students at the ArtCenter in Pasadena, and she’s acutely aware of how much harder it is becoming for underrepresented artists to break through. Arts and humanities funding and scholarships that were established in the 20th century, when the economic climate demanded a global professional class, have mostly disappeared, she says, and “techno-capitalism doesn’t need that educated class any more, so it’s all shutting down”. Would someone with her background be able to make it today? “Put it this way, my students or former students who are merely the children of lawyers or architects or college professors feel that they are underprivileged, because they won’t necessarily have access to family money beyond college,” she says. In much of her work she has tried to probe unexplored aspects of the human experience, but this kind of storytelling will become harder. “There’s nothing wrong with privileged people making art – they’re great artists,” she says, “but it’s a single channel of experience that gets represented.”The Four Spent the Day Together by Chris Kraus is published by Scribe.

It’s Blackadder crossed with CSI – with a sprinkling of Philomena CunkFrances RyanSat 11 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareWitches of Essex is one of those television shows that could have been created working backwards from its title. “It sounds like Witches of Eastwick!” you can imagine a producer brainstorming. “Can we do anything with that?”Yes, yes we can. We can put together a three-part documentary about the Essex witch trials, which saw hundreds of people – the majority of them women – accused of witchcraft in the 16th and 17th centuries. Crucially, we can hire everyone’s favourite Essex boy, Rylan (though less favourite sincehis comments on immigrationsaw more than 700 Ofcom complaints last month) to present it alongside Prof Alice Roberts.“I’ve always been interested in history, but I had no idea Essex is steeped in horrific stories of persecution and death,” Rylan says to camera before the opening titles, in what can only be described as a mood killer.300 years on, will thousands of women burned as witches finally get  justice?Read moreIf you were expecting a camp and cheeky take on Elizabethan history and the supernatural in time for Halloween, you could be slightly disappointed by Witches of Essex (Tuesday 14 October, 9pm, Sky History). It’s not that Rylan doesn’t add plenty of humour to proceedings (“There were a couple of witches then,” he quips about his youthful nights out in Chelmsford) but this is a real story about real women – many of whom were killed for little more than being a widow or falling out with a neighbour. Quite rightly, the series has at least some level of respect and gravity to it, albeit one that involves dramatic re-enactments featuring actors with panto-esque colloquial accents while wearing a variety of hats.Each episode centres on a specific witch trial that took place in Essex, with Rylan and Alice opening a “cold case” of women accused more than 400 years ago, guided by original court documents and a team of historians and medical experts. Think Blackadder crossed with CSI plus a sprinkle of Philomena Cunk.Much of the action takes place in an “incident room” – AKA a budget studio in which Rylan and Alice write on a board with a big pen above mugshots of the key characters. At one point, Rylan sticks a photograph of “Attorney General Gilbert Gerard” – one of the main prosecutors to implement Elizabeth I’s 1563 law criminalising witchcraft – and Alice nods in recognition. That she is actually recognising the actor Sky has hired to play Gilbert Gerard rather than presumably congratulating Rylan for discovering the earliest known camera roll on Earth is neither here nor there. This is history coming to life! We’re in the moment!On paper, Rylan and Alice are a presenting duo that could have been made by AI. Or – more likely – a focus group trying to bring the 18- to 28-year-old demographic to the history channel. But they are a genuinely engaging team, balancing the not always easy tone of investigation into state-sponsored femicide and light entertainment. A tour of the modern-day Chelmsford courthouse that once saw women tried for witchcraft enables Rylan to respond to the detail that they would have shared the building with a market. “So you’d be getting tried for the death penalty and there’d be a cow in the background mooing?” “Possibly,” Alice nods, with a game straight face.It’s all very slight, of course, offering more of an introduction to the topic than anything armchair historians would learn much from. But that is probably its strength. Everyone involved is almost visibly working to make what is an under-discussed and shameful period in history accessible (at one point, a lecturer from the LSE describes the first depiction of a witch on a broomstick as a phallic symbol of going “off to shag the devil”.) The ongoing point about ambitious politicians using fear against one group to get control over the populace feels painfully relevant for modern audiences.When the actors re-enact a woman being hanged after being found guilty of witchcraft and Rylan places a photo of her corpse – with accompanying rope marks – on the board, you can’t help but feel moved. Rylan as the nation’s history teacher? As long as he starts withWindrush.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherRylan ClarkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At 9pm, traditionally a crucial time slot for Britain’s main broadcasters, none of their shows were able to attract an average audience of 1 million viewers.AnITV documentaryabout Madeleine McCann was the most popular in the slot, drawing a broadcast audience of less than 900,000 viewers. It happened again less than a week later when ITV’s thrillerColdwaternarrowly beat Channel 5’s Fare Dodgers: At War With the Law. The unwelcome phenomenon has since happened for a third time.TV insiders think the regular failure to breach the 1 million mark is unprecedented. “Twenty years ago, thinking about falling below a million would have been just so outlandish,” said Liam Hamilton, a former ITV executive who spotted the trend.It marks the latest decline in traditional television watching. Audiences have edged away from the shared viewing experiences of the days when the nation’s kettles switched on at the ad breaks and instant discussions took place about the unfolding storylines of Silent Witness or Cracker.View image in fullscreenAlison Steadman and Tim Stern in Abigail’s Party. The Play for Today written by Mike Leigh was watched by 18 million people on BBC2 in 1977.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy“There was a time when enough of us watched the same thing we could discuss it the following day – it was definitely a binding experience,” said Jimmy Mulville, a co-founder of Hat Trick Productions, the maker of Derry Girls and Have I Got News for You, and a presenter ofInsiders: The TV Podcast.“Abigail’s Party, a single play written by Mike Leigh, was watched on BBC2 by 18 million people [in 1977] and we all talked about it the following day. Well, those days are over,” he said.The first time this year that none of the five main channels had 1 million viewers at 9pm was on 17 September. On the same night a decade earlier, the leader in that time slot was BBC One’s Who Do You Think You Are? with4.1 million viewers. All five main channels recorded audiences of more than 1 million, according to the Digital-i agency.View image in fullscreenToby Jones as Alan Bates in Mr Bates vs the Post Office. The drama recorded a traditional audience of 3.6 million for its debut at 9pm.Photograph: ITV/Rex/ShutterstockThe rise in catchup viewing and the arrival of streaming services such as Netflix have dramatically pulled audiences away from traditional, broadcast television and divided audiences. Executives regard the “overnights” – instant ratings indicating how many people watched a show as it was broadcast – as increasingly irrelevant.Most now look at ratings after four weeks, when viewers have watched at their own pace. It means television viewing is now less of a collective endeavour.The rapid change produces mixed feelings among television’s most senior figures. “It doesn’t matter because we all watch at our own pace, in our own time, and can watch much better content as a result,” said one production company boss.“Just because something isn’t a shared viewing moment doesn’t mean it’s not a shared cultural topic of conversation. We are all watching it and commenting on it, just in our own timeframes. But it does matter – because some shows are national events.”View image in fullscreenAlison Steadman, Ruth Jones and Joanna Page in Gavin & Stacey: The Finale attracted an average of12.3 million viewerslast Christmas.Photograph: Toffee International Ltd/PAIt also means broadcasters and streamers are putting a premium on events that have to be watched there and then, explaining the huge demand for sporting rights.While traditional viewing continues to fall, hit shows can still buck the trend – and catchup viewing allows shows to reach huge audiences eventually.Mr Bates vs the Post Office, which set the political agenda, recorded a traditional audience of3.6 millionfor its debut at 9pm. It has since attracted more than 10 million viewers.Gavin & Stacey: The Finalelast Christmas attracted an average of 12.3 million viewers at a rare time when families were on the sofa watching together.Strictly Come Dancing, with its live element, still retains a large live audience, attracting more than 6 million viewers last weekend.“That joint collective experience just doesn’t seem to exist, but whether or not it means TV is failing is different,” said Steven D Wright, a formerChannel 4commissioner and producer. “Ratings don’t always prove that something’s a good show anyway. And we live in a fractured landscape now. Everybody is frantically watching TV on their own, or on their own device.”View image in fullscreenAlexis Warr and George Clarke in Strictly Come Dancing 2025. The show attracted more than 6 million viewers last weekend.Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PAThe arrival of digital platforms such as YouTube and TikTok has created yet another challenge, not only for linear TV but for streamers, too. Mulville said some social media clips from theUS version of Have I Got News for Youcould have a higher viewership than the original broadcast.Despite the fall in traditional viewing, it still plays a role for broadcasters, said the TV writer and reviewer Scott Bryan. “The conversation around the death of linear, traditional TV broadcasting has been a conversation that’s been going on now for more than 20 years,” he said. “But I think broadcasters see it as a shop window when people turn on.“And it can still have a power at certain moments to create national conversations in a way that streamers find much harder. Even if people are moving away from it, I don’t think public service broadcasters will get rid of something that is actually giving them a competitive advantage.”Explore more on these topicsTelevision industryTV ratingsTelevisionBBCBBC OneBBC TwoITV1featuresShareReuse this content"

Is this the champion the American left has been waiting for?Steve RoseSat 11 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTShareBen Meiselas is a very busy man. So busy, he has to break off halfway through our interview to conduct an interview of his own, for his next broadcast. It’s 7am Los Angeles time when we meet via video call, and Meiselas is already well into another 18-hour day of podcasting, planning, interviewing, meetings and more besides. His “pro-democracy” channel MeidasTouch, which he runs with his younger brothers Jordan and Brett, puts out 15 or more videos a day, most of them presented by Meiselas himself. “I was doing another video before this,” he says, “and so by now I’ve already released one video I did last night, which was my 4am, and now I just worked on my 7am – it’ll get released any minute now. And then I’ll have an 8.30, a 10, an 11.30 …”The prolific output is part of the reasonThe MeidasTouchhas become one of the most listened-to podcasts in the US, routinely beating the mighty Joe Rogan in bothvideoand audio, and even overtaking Fox News in YouTube views. Rogan and others in the right-leaning podcast manosphere are thought to have swung the 2024 election in Donald Trump’s favour, prompting much soul-searching on the American left about its media game, and why they need a Joe Rogan of their own; MeidasTouch seems to have stepped in to fill the void.That void extends far beyond just podcasting, in Meiselas’s view. He is appalled at how the US media has reacted since Trump came to power. “It’s a total capitulation,” he says. “They’re either corporate news – like cable news, [which is] just completely both-sides-ing the issues and intentionally ignoring critical, existential things – or they’re just outright state regime media à la North Korea and Russia: Fox News, OAN [One America News], Newsmax … All of these corporations are run by rightwing oligarchs; they are tools to ingratiate themselves with the regime for other benefits and other business interests.”The spectacle of CEOs and podcast bros alike “kissing the ring” at Trump’s inauguration cemented this impression early on. As counter-programming, Meiselas broadcast four hours ofcute puppies and kittens, raising funds for the Humane Society.View image in fullscreenThe Meiselas brothers collecting their Webby award earlier this year: from left, Jordan, Ben and Brett.Photograph: Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images for the Webby AwardsIf the left is looking for itsJoe Rogan, though, Meiselas doesn’t quite fit the bill. Where Rogan is casual, rambling and often credulous of his guests’ outlandish claims, Meiselas is focused, well-informed and disdainful. And as you’d expect of a former trial lawyer, he speaks with an off-the-cuff fluency (“no scripts, no notes – that’s part of the connection I build with the audience”), and he brings receipts. If he has a catchphrase, it’s “play this clip” – as he illustrates yet another incidence of Republican duplicity/hypocrisy/incompetence/deception/authoritarianism with video, audio, graphs or data.He can be a level-headed interviewer – this week he has spoken to Democrat leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and newly elected congresswoman Adelita Grijalva. (He breaks off from our interview to talk to a former commissioner for the Federal Communications Commission about free speech and media monopolies.) But over the course of a typical episode – which could be a 20-minute solo broadcast or a 90-minute talk with his brothers – he often becomes audibly outraged at what’s going on.We’re not talking about abstract concepts. People are waking up every day feeling that this is life or death for themPut that all together, and tonally MeidasTouch is somewhere between wartime resistance broadcast and wrestling commentary. Meiselas is not above throwing out insults: the Republican house leader is consistently referred to as “Maga Mike Johnson”, for example, and he is as merciless about Trump’s health as the rightwing media was about Joe Biden’s. He doesn’t hesitate to speak his mind: “What the hell are these people even talking about?” “Stop making up things and defrauding the American people.” “These people are sick.” And MeidasTouch’s episode titles conform to the hyperbolic YouTube vernacular: “Trump is COLLAPSING under SHUTDOWN PRESSURE!!!”, “​​Trump LOOKS AWFUL as PRESSER Goes OFF THE RAILS”. One journalist described MeidasTouch’s commentary as “seemingly calculated to appeal to those for whom [MSNBC host]Rachel Maddowis too subtle.”Meiselas makes no apologies for his house style. “I don’t curse,” he says. “I try to still keep it as much as possible appropriate for everyone. But on the other hand, I think where you have characters who are cartoonishly evil, like Maga Mike Johnson or JD Vance, framing them for the WWE cosplay characters they’ve become is actually an accurate way of describing who they are … I’m just trying to reflect the language of, truthfully, what it is that I’m seeing, and I think the growth of the network is the audience responding: ‘Yes, that’s exactly how I see it.’” He is speaking from the same home office in which his 5.5 million subscribers see him every day; it’s somewhat uncanny – as if I’m watching my own personal episode of his podcast.In his view, it’s other media outlets that are not meeting the moment. “We’re beyond a constitutional crisis. America’s living in a dictatorship right now. And the question is, how will an opposition respond to a dictatorship?” he says. “This is not a time to be playing games. People are waking up every day feeling, and rightfully so, that this is really life or death for them. We’re not talking about abstract concepts. People are saying, ‘I may not be able to afford healthcare and I’m going to die.’ So they don’t want to be lectured about, ‘Well, on the one hand; on the other hand.’ They want to be told directly, ‘What are you going to do to fight for my life? What are you going to do to fight for my healthcare? My community is under attack right now. There are masked agents who are disappearing human beings right here.’ Or, ‘I’m a member of a marginalised group’ – whether it’s a gay person, LGBTQ – ‘and I matter. I’m a human being, damn it.’ I think where we come in, very unapologetically, is we say, ‘We’re fighting for you, and we don’t waver on our values.’”This is what separates his operation from the forces they’re opposing, he says, despite their superficial resemblances. “You have to unite people with empathy and love and community and shared values as a force against the hate.” He’s all for building connections: communally, politically and internationally – given the global rise of far-right politics. “That, to me, is more important than, ‘Am I beating Joe Rogan this week or that week?’”View image in fullscreenMeiselas … ‘I don’t like politics. It distorts from what the human issues really are.’Photograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianMeiselas, 40, didn’t set out to build a media empire, nor did he really have to. Until about 2020 he was a partner in a successful law firm and his career was flying. The legal profession was in his blood, you could say. His mother practised law for a spell; his father, Kenny, is a leading entertainment lawyer whose clients include Lady Gaga, the Weeknd, Nicki Minaj and formerly Sean “Diddy” Combs, who wasrecently sentencedto more than four years in prison for prostitution-related charges. Meiselas actually interned for Combs’ Bad Boy Records for a few summers in his late teens. AVariety profilefrom 2019 claimed that Combs “took Meiselas under his wing, resulting in a precocious and priceless apprenticeship”, but he was not part of Diddy’s entourage or witness to any of wrongdoing, he stresses: “I was very low on the totem pole.” He was actually working on Diddy’sCitizen Changeinitiative, which was about voter registration for young people.He grew up on Long Island, New York, with his two brothers: Brett, who is five years younger, and Jordan, eight years younger. “We always did things together as brothers,” he says. “Like, we made videos, even in the early days of Adobe editing. We would do comedy skits together in the back yard for fun, and we would make movies together for our school projects.” Then, as now, Ben was the leader, it seems. A confident public speaker, he was president of his student government in middle school and high school, and of various undergraduate clubs. In his early 20s he interned on Capitol Hill, for New York Democrat Steve Israel, then for Hillary Clinton when she was a senator. “I would hand her the speeches before she spoke, answer constituent mail, give tours of the Capitol building – which was my favourite part about it.”He was one of the youngest students at law school, in Georgetown, Washington DC, but he only really became enthused when he began studying civil rights law. He was recruited out of college to a small law California firm and “thrown into the fire”, he says. Within three years, still in his mid-20s, he was in court handling significant cases of brutality and wrongful death at the hands of the police (he assisted the Guardian’sreporting on these issuesin 2015), and invariably winning them. That led to representing Colin Kaepernick when the San Francisco 49ers quarterback sued the NFL for excluding him for taking a knee, in what seems like a different era (they reached a confidential settlement). He went on to become a business partner with Kaepernick and they remain good friends.View image in fullscreenColin Kaepernick (right) takes the knee.Photograph: Mike McCarn/APIn retrospect, it could look as if Meiselas was destined for a career in politics, but it never really appealed. “When I became a civil rights lawyer, I actually started to not like politics, because politicians would start calling me up for money,” he says. “I still, and I say this all the time on the show, don’t like politics. To me, politics distorts from what the human issues really are.” He doesn’t quite rule it out for the future, though. “I can’t imagine it ever happening. I know it sounds like a political answer to say that, but I really have no desire at all.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Again, he doesn’t mince words. “I thought that Trump was killing people,” he says. “He would do these Covid press conferences, and it would be spewing a bunch of nonsense and disinformation. And me and my brothers were like, ‘Are you watching this? What the hell is going on? We need to do something to call this out.’”At the time Brett was a digital editor for Ellen DeGeneres’ TV show, and Jordan worked in marketing. The brothers began producing anti-Trump videos that started to go viral. One of them, with a#CreepyTrumphashtag, superimposed GOP insider Kellyanne Conway’s comments about Joe Biden being “creepy” over clips of Trump’s inappropriate comments about young women, including his daughter Ivanka. They formed a political action committee, to raise funds for Joe Biden’s campaign, but found simply placing TV attack ads to be unsatisfactory – “You’re renting space on their network, and they’re undermining your message with their both-sides-ism.”Then the January 6 attacks happened, and the brothers decided to start their own podcast in earnest. “We just said, ‘Let’s just put out our own show together, from our living rooms,” Meiselas says. “The quality wasn’t great, but the first podcast we put out, there was a decent-size audience and the feedback was great. And so we’re like, ‘There’s something there.’”Meiselas began phasing out his legal work, and fully quit the day job in 2023. As well as him and his brothers, MeidasTouch now has a whole stable of hosts, including Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer; it produces shows not just on politics but on legal and economic matters. And it is expanding internationally: in September it launched a Canada podcast. “For us, the strategy is just to try to be everywhere,” he says. And not just in the interests of expanding the brand: “It may be important in the future to have international hubs getting out the message, in the event that there’s additional kind of clampdowns here.”Is TikTok about to go full Maga? – podcastRead moreThere is no shortage of material for anti-Maga podcasting at the moment, but will the world still need such granular focus on day-to-day politics once the Trump era comes to an end in 2028 (assuming it actually does)? Even the podcast bros who supported Trump, including Rogan and Theo Von, are now turning against him over issues such as the Jeffrey Epstein saga and his brutal immigration policies. “I don’t think anybody would have signed up for [this],” Rogan said in July.“I think there’s always going to be a Trump worldview,” says Meiselas, “whether that’s embodied in Trump, or a Maga perspective, or the next generation that’s going to push these ideas. And while we’re often framed as anti-Trump or liberal or left, I don’t see it like that at all. Because to me, it’s what Trump represents, and what he does, that I’m against. It’s that he’s laundering a set of ideas that permeate internationally, that impact you in the UK, in Europe, in South and Central America, in Russia. He is a vehicle and a vessel for these concepts that I think bring us back to the dark ages.”Either way, Meiselas’s 18-hour shifts aren’t going to end any time soon – but he is fine with that, he says. At least he gets to work from home. “When I was a lawyer and I would have trials across the country, I’d be travelling for weeks and months, and I’d be in Utah or New York or San Francisco or wherever,” he says.He married last year and has a baby daughter. “She just turned one, so I’m able to do some videos, I get to walk my little girl up the block, we walk back, I do another video, we have lunch together, I do another video. So for me, it’s actually a blessing.” But he laughs as he admits that he’s never really not working. “Even when I’m doing the walks, I’m always thinking a little bit about what’s next. I’m always trying to make the connections in my mind.”But it doesn’t reallyfeellike work, he says. “I don’t wake up and I’m like, ‘Another day at work …’ I feel a broader sense of this historical moment and where the network fits into it. I feel every day is like, ‘This is what I was meant to do.’”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Down in Vauxhall in London, three artists have mashed themselves together to create the most revolting visual soup imaginable, an exhibition that isn’t so much the sum of its parts as a total negation of anything good any of them has ever done.Whatever qualities YBA kingpin Damien Hirst and street artistsShepard Faireyand Invader might have, none of them are on display in this staggeringly vast exhibition – it just goes on and on, huge room after huge room filled with aesthetic crap.View image in fullscreenTriple Trouble … collaborative works by Shepard Fairey, Damien Hirst, and Invader.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates Ltd/Artworks © the artistsThe show is made up largely of collaborations between the artists, Hirst’s dots and medical cabinets smashed brutally and heinously together with Invader’s little ceramic aliens and Fairey’s leaden posterised Photoshoppery.There’s a wall of Fairey’s Obey logo plastered over Hirst spin and flower paintings, adding nothing to something that wasn’t good to start with.My jaw dropped when I saw the huge Hirst formaldehyde case with an invader alien drowning in the blue fluid – it was like walking in on a crime scene. Why would you go to such lengths to create something that no one comes out of well, that expresses both artists’ ideas so poorly?View image in fullscreenAlien in formaldehyde … ‘my jaw dropped’.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesAnd somehow,it only gets worse. A medical cabinet filled with Obey-logo pills, diamanté-encrusted Space Invaders, grim butterfly paintings with some ludicrous Fairey propaganda woman staring out at you, countless 8-bit pixelated portraits of Lou Reed and Sid Vicious. It’s as if someone let the most annoying teenager you’ve ever met make some art. At one point there’s an enormous triple portrait featuring what might be Malala Yousafzai and Miley Cyrus plastered with scalpel blades. It’s all juvenile, dumb, silly imagery that does not work on any level.Would this have been better as solo presentations of each artist’s work? Maybe. But Invader’s work is built for the street, not the gallery, that’s where it’s meant to be, where it works best. And Fairey’s work is built for the bin. Getting up close and personal with it just rams home how ugly, one-dimensional, faux-political and stupid it is.View image in fullscreenNo power … Shepard Fairey during an exhibition photo call at Newport Street Gallery.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesIt’s all precision-engineered to sell, in vast quantities at vast prices, to people with the worst taste on Earth. And the reason this is so spectacularly naff is that Hirst is important, he’s made vital, powerful art. Regardless of whether or not you like any of these artists, all three have something that they’re good at, but no one bothered to put any of that in this show (curated by Hirst’s son Connor). Take Invader off the street, or Fairey off the front of sweatshirts, and you strip themof their power. Take the ideas out of Hirst, and you strip him of his purpose.Everyone here was so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should. And theyshouldn’t.Triple Trouble: Fairey, Hirst, Invader is at Newport Street, London, until 29 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtDamien HirstShepard FaireyPaintingGraphic designStreet artreviewsShareReuse this content"

They are namechecked early in a play about the region’s recent rugby union history to make the point that, in the early 80s,Exeterused to lose to neighbourhood clubs considered minnows.Exe Men is adapted by Ashley Pharoah from Guardian rugby writerRobert Kitson’s 2020 book. It shows how an ambitious investor, Tony Rowe, and enterprising coach, Rob Baxter, renamed the club the Exeter Chiefs and made them the best in England andthen Europe. The Chiefs were the Seabiscuit of jock-straps and scrum caps, the Leicester City of rugby.The biggest problem in sporting theatre is how to stage the games without the audience being hit by flying balls or the too obvious difference between the movement of actors and professional athletes. David Storey’s great 1971 rugby league play, The Changing Room is sensibly set around the action. As the Chiefs’ rise had so many rich onfield scenes, Pharoah and director Martin Berry really have to show some rucks, scrums and drop kicks but do so impressionistically; in the props department, the score is: rugby balls 1, giant inflatable plastic penises 2. (The latter relating to Baxter’s coaching manual containing a thick section on getting loose on the bus and in the pub.) Play is portrayed through effective tableaux created by movement director Kim Healey, the use of a community cast of volunteers allowing Berry sometimes to have two full XVs on the artificial turf covering the strip of stage between seating risers called for this show “stands”.View image in fullscreenEnterprising … Robert Shaw Cameron as coach Rob Baxter.Photograph: Craig FullerTwo other obstacles are a two-decade span and a potential lack of tension as even non-Chiefs fans know that there wouldn’t be a book and play if the team hadn’t kept winning. Pharoah, though, has a sure sense of when to cut and run from the calendar (one four-year jump), within a match or from sport to home, including a powerful scene of private grief.The biggest risk is of a local show for local people. Certainly, names of places and players drew cheers but Exe Men holds wider interest by exploring the metaphor in the Storey title: that sport changes people. The great Chiefs team – multiple squad members played by Joe Feeney, Pete Watts and Emile Ruddock with engaging versatility – were allowed a second chance, reflecting a generosity projected by Tim Hudson’s Rowe and Robert Shaw Cameron’s Baxter. Micha Colombo as the coach’s wife has a narrative subs’ bench role but, with the amateur cast, radiates an appropriate sense of team work.AtExeter Northcott theatreuntil 18 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreExeterRugby unionDevonreviewsShareReuse this content"

I’d had a long string of admin jobs that I hated. Usually, it was the case that I didn’t know what my job was and nobody else did either. When I was 29, I thought: “I haven’t really done anything creative or put myself out there. Here I am with two kids, what am I doing?” So I signed up for an open mic night. I wasn’t going into comedy for the money – I wanted to see if I could do it.What inspired your latest show, Emmaculate?People have asked: “Is it about Madonna’s Immaculate Collection album?” No, it’s not. Although, I do nod to it because when I was in an all-girls school we had a talent show one year and the girl in the year ahead of us sang Like a Virgin. She was six months pregnant and we were all very judgy. I shouldn’t have been because that was me the following year.“Immaculate”, when I was growing up, was the biggest compliment a woman could pay another woman, mother to mother. That her house was immaculate, her children were immaculate … while she was probably having a breakdown. So, that’s where it comes from and the show is all about family.You’ve just added 18 extra shows to your tour. How does it feel to see that demand for your comedy?It makes me feel sick. Basically, all I do all day is refresh ticket pages to see if it was a good idea.Any preshow rituals?I try to move my body because I’m naturally a sloth. Before gigs, I’m usually still in my coat, curled up in a ball and vaping. So I try to get up and do a few squats or something to get some blood pumping.What’s one of the strangest fan encounters you’ve had?One time, somebody took it upon themselves to come backstage and they brought cookies with my face on them. I learned from an older, more experienced comedian, that you never eat the food. So I had to bin them straight away, even though they did look nice.Actually, what happens most is somebody on the street sees me and then I have to stand there while they explain to their friend who I am – and start showing them videos. It’s very awkward.Any bugbears from the world of comedy?There’s nothing worse than a dodgy mic. If I rock up to a venue and they say, “The thing about the mic is …” I just go, “Oh, God. Here we go.” That sends me into a decline.Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?I did a gig and the MC proposed to her girlfriend just before she brought me on. It was so bizarre. I often think of that MC and how they are getting on. I don’t think they ever got married … so it was needless.What advice would you give your younger self?I wouldn’t bother because she’d probably just look at me and say, “Who is this old woman?”, and try to bum a cigarette off me. I probably would just say to her keep going with the standup. But I’m sure she’d be like, “Yeah, I was going to do that anyway.”Do you have any regrets?Loads. Even as I’m sitting here, talking to you, I regret that I didn’t wash my hair last night and I’m going around with a big greasy mop.Emma Doran: Emmaculate ison tourin the UK and Ireland until 24 AprilExplore more on these topicsStageComedy Q&AComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)featuresShareReuse this content"

The song was intended to be a rejection of the masculine influence that had unwittingly shaped the artist’s previous work, and an ode to something taboo within the female experience. Based on Molly Bloom’s soliloquy in James Joyce’s Ulysses – a stream of consciousness in which the character reflects on her experiences of nature, sex and love – Bush wanted to celebrate the experience of life inside a woman’s body, and the ways it gives her spiritual and sexual pleasure. I knew that, for someone like me, who was already being bullied, to openly love a song like this could make me an even more obvious target to those who saw femininity as a sign of weakness. More daunting than that, it might force me to confront my own repressed desires.By the time I was around 17, I had already spent most of my teenage years in a constant state of survival. I wasn’t yet out as a transgender woman; this was a part of me I could keep secret, unlike my effeminacy. I had a naturally high voice, which I tried and failed to deepen. “You sound like a girl,” was one of the daily taunts aimed at me by pupils at my school, even as I strained my vocal cords. My camp mannerisms and the way I walked were other noticeable crimes to the boys around me, who enjoyed mocking my “sassy” stride. Growing up in an environment such as this meant I never saw my femininity as something to embrace. That I was soft and girlish was a sign of a defective self. Still, it felt safer to be a feminine boy than a boy who wanted to become a woman.Her ode to womanhood invoked all the things I knew I could be: euphoric, audacious and freeThe school I attended in Plymouth was single sex, but high-achieving girls were allowed to enter its gates at sixth form, something I was grateful for. Some of the new students lived near me, by the forests surrounding the city. One morning, while we ambled along the grassland, one of the girls shared her headphones with me and played her favourite music. That’s when the discovery was made.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

On my solitary walk home, I listened to her song again under the shelter of leaves and the furry limbs of trees. I listened carefully, but most of her words appeared formless – lines sung breathlessly behind an orchestra of uilleann pipes and other traditional Irish instruments I remembered learning about in class. In certain moments, her words’ sharpness broke in again like splices of light along my trail: “to where the water and the earth caress … now I’ve powers of a woman’s body.” Moments such as these were laced throughout, often referencing nature, and culminating in postcoital bliss: “Mmh yes.” I pictured Bush dancing among trees in a state of synaesthetic ecstasy, her body lit by a neon green glow. My body swayed instinctively to the rhythm. It didn’t bother me that I must have looked like a girl doing it. I followed the flickers of emerald to the forest’s end.My cultural awakening: The Parent Trap made me reconnect with my estranged fatherRead moreSomething shifted in me that day. Bush’s ode to womanhood felt like an invocation of all the things I knew I could be: euphoric, audacious and free. I started to view my femininity not as a flaw, but as an affirmation of life; a way of indulging in the intense pleasure of the world, nature and my body.It still wasn’t safe to be my natural self in my final year of school. My transition came a couple of years later, when I moved away for university. But, from this point onwards, I knew there was a place in my mind to escape to whenever I wanted – the lush, fevered universe Bush had created – where I danced in recognition of my own sacred womanhood. And waiting patiently for that reverie to become my everyday reality, I was able to refuse the voices that told me it never would.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

With watering eyes, pumping endorphins and overactive salivary glands, I licked each mustard off a spoon, then quickly cleansed my palate with plenty of milk and water to subdue the heat. But the sandwich I had at the end, with my new favourite mustard, was worth every fiery spoonful.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Mustard is intriguingly complex in flavour – powerful, umami, hot – yet easy to make. At its simplest, it is little more than fermented mustard seeds soaked in brine until viscous and bubbling. Sadly, however, many modern brands, especially the cheaper ones, see fit to include unnecessary additives, such as xanthan gum and wheat flour. And, rather predictably, the cheaper the mustard, the less actual mustard it tends to contain.Much as withmayonnaise, many processed mustards contain spirit vinegar instead of more subtle acids, such as white-wine or cider vinegar. Spirit vinegar is harsh and sharp, dominates the overall flavour and can result in an unappealingly aerated, mousse-like texture. In fact, six of the mustards I tasted were so similar, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if they were all made in the same factory. They were essentially carbon copies of each other – sulphuric, sweet, hot and moussey – even if they did still bear the hallmark fieriness and complexity of a classic English mustard.So, when looking for a mustard that’s worth your money, seek out those with real vinegar rather than spirit vinegar, and without emulsifiers or texturing agents such as wheat flour; they’re simply unnecessary. Or, better still, make your own: you can easilyproduce a year’s worth of mustardwith just five minutes’ work.The best supermarket English mustardBestoverall:Stokes classic English mustardView image in fullscreen£2.90 for 185g at Ocado (£1.57/100g)★★★★☆Satin-sheen gold with a sweet, clean aroma.

I’m not sure why this happened, but I can tell you that I love the energy that platters give to a table, and the gentle sense of pomp and ceremony they lend even the simplest of meals. My love for the platter has dictated today’s recipe, a final fling with the very last of the summer vegetables served over whipped feta.Za’atar roast vegetables with whipped fetaYou’ll need a food processor for the whipped feta.Prep15 minCook40 minServes4400g courgettes, cut into irregular, roughly 3cm x 3cm pieces1 red onion, peeled and cut into 1½cm-thick wedges at their widest point300g fetaExtra-virgin olive oil2 tsp za’atar, plus extra for servingFine sea salt and black pepper1 small aubergine(450g), cut into irregular, roughly 5cm x 4cm shapes100g greek yoghurtFinely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon– you’ll need only ½ tbsp of the juice570g jar butter beans, drained to get 240g (save the rest for another use)20g fresh mint, leaves picked and torn, to serveHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and line two large rectangular baking trays with (ideally reusable) baking paper.Put the courgettes and onion in a bowl, break in a third of the feta in small pieces, and add three tablespoons of oil, a teaspoon of za’atar and a half-teaspoon of salt. Tip out on to one of the lined trays, making sure all the vegetables have enough legroom.Put the chopped aubergine in the now-empty bowl and add two tablespoons of oil, another teaspoon of za’atar and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Tip out on to the second tray, and save the bowl for later. Roast both trays of vegetables for 30 minutes, until tender and golden in spots.Meanwhile, put the remaining 200g feta in a food processor with the yoghurt and three tablespoons of oil, then add the lemon zest, half a tablespoon of lemon juice and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and blitz until smooth.Spread the whipped feta on to a platter big enough to hold all the vegetables. When the vegetables are out of the oven, tip them all, cooking juices included, back into the reserved bowl, stir through the butter beans and mint, and season with a little freshly ground black pepper. Check for seasoning and oil, adding both to taste, then tip on top of the whipped feta and serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodCheeseVegetarian food and drinkMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

UK supermarket cards ratedAs prices rise, we look at whether schemes such as Tesco’s Clubcard and Sainsbury’s Nectar are a good dealZoe Wood,Rupert JonesandHilary OsborneSat 11 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareGot washing to do? Would you rather pay £16 for Ariel washing pods or £8? Thirsty? How about £5 or nearly £8 for a dozen Diet Cokes. Hungry? £2.50 a pop for Pringles or £1.75?The lower prices are among the current “top picks” for Tesco Clubcard holders – and it’s a similar story in other big supermarkets. With the cost of groceries rising, it no longer makes sense to shop without joining a loyalty scheme when it is on offer.That explains why 24 million UK households now have a Clubcard. Tesco says the deals mean shoppers save up to £375 off their annual grocery bill compared with its regular prices. Sainsbury’s claims its Nectar scheme can save more than £450.The widespread use of loyalty discounts has gradually seduced even the sceptical, with 76% of consumers now in a scheme, according to Mintel. The market researcher says close to 60% of us subscribe to four or more, helping to stretch the definition of loyalty.Nick Carroll, the Mintel director of retail insight, says in the current tough economic climate “instant savings” are important. “We’re in a period of very high food inflation, and that means people want savings now, not in six months.”Carroll suggests the loyalty schemes which are a new spin on store promotions “do save customers money”. But if they weren’t there, the big supermarkets “would still need to be price competitive”.During the cost of living crisis the sudden fashion forloyalty card price cutsattracted the scrutiny of theCompetition and Markets Authority.The CMA went on to review 50,000 products with loyalty price options and found 92% offered a saving against the supermarkets’ usual price. It concluded that shoppers in supermarket loyalty schemes can make “genuine savings”.However, the watchdog also offered some advice: “Our review has shown that loyalty prices aren’t always the cheapest option, so shopping around is still key.”We’ve rated the current crop of supermarket schemes, and given them an overall score based on upfront discounts, rewards and other perks.TescoView image in fullscreenThe Tesco Clubcard works on a point-based system.Photograph: True Images/AlamyYou earn one point for every £1 spent on shopping at Tesco. You can also accrue points at its other businesses such as its fuel stations and Tesco Mobile but the qualifying spend varies. A point is worth 1p when converted into Clubcard vouchers, which can be spent in Tesco or exchanged for twice their face value at more than 100 “reward” partners, including Pizza Express and Legoland. More important these days is its “Clubcard prices” promotion. With 10,000 deals every week the offers claim to save a Tesco regular £375 on their annual grocery bill.ProsMembers-only prices include a discount on Tesco’s popular meal deal – the price recentlyincreased to £3.85but is £4.25 for non-cardholders. Tesco uses your data to serve up personalised discounts, while a new “Tesco Tuesdays” deal offers film fans up to four standard 2D Cineworld tickets for £5 each (or £2.50 in Clubcard vouchers at double their value).ConsSome would argue it is no longer in your interests to shop at Tesco without a Clubcard as it involves paying over the odds for your groceries. Also the rewards arestingier these days– at one point you could cash in vouchers for four times the face value.Overall rating8/10Sainsbury’sView image in fullscreenArgos is part of the Sainsbury’s Nectar scheme.Photograph: Michael McHugh/PAShoppers earn one Nectar point for every £1 spent in-store or online. A point is worth 0.5p and can be spent in blocks of 500 (worth £2.50). You can also collect (and spend) points elsewhere as the scheme boasts 500-plus partners including big names such as British Airways and Marriott Bonvoy.With 27 million users, Nectar has taken the fight to Clubcard. The supermarket claims that “Nectar Prices” can save you more than £450 a year. It says Nectar Prices save you £323, plus potentially another £169 based on the average weekly saving from “Your Nectar Prices”. The latter is its personalised pricing offer, providing up to 10 weekly deals based on your shopping habits.ProsSainsbury’s says Nectar Prices alone can save customers a chunky £13 on an £80 basket of shopping. Also with lots of other companies, including big high street brands such as Argos, as part of the scheme, it is possible to collect points on a big chunk of everyday spending.ConsIn the same vein as Tesco, it is mad to shop there without a Nectar card. With a Nectar point worth 0.5p to Clubcard’s 1p, you need to spend twice as much to earn vouchers. However, with lots of ways to collect points this could balance out.Overall rating8/10AsdaView image in fullscreenThe Asda Rewards app.Photograph: mundissima/AlamyFor Asda Rewards you have to download an app – there is no physical card available. Users earn pounds rather than points when they complete “missions”, which may involve shopping a certain number of times or buying particular products. (Sample missions: spend £5 on ready meals, or £7 on sports drinks, to earn £1.) These pounds go into your “cashpot” and are converted into vouchers to spend at Asda. There are about 6.4 million active customers.ProsAsda says some customers earn hundreds of pounds a year by completing all the missions, linking up their Asda credit card, using the various coupons and so on. The money can be spent on your shopping, so saves on the things you want to buy.ConsYou pay the full price upfront and get money off later rather than an immediate discount. It is only available via an app.Overall rating4/10LidlView image in fullscreenThe Lidl Plus app.Photograph: True Images/AlamyThe app-based loyalty scheme Lidl Plus gives you access to special offers that refresh weekly – current offers include 27% off Rubicon mango juice and 20% off granola. You can also get personalised coupons in the app that are based on your shopping habits – you need to opt in to these. There’s “Coupon Plus”, which unlocks rewards such as a free in-store “bakery sweet treat” when you spend £10 in a month, and 10% off your next shop (up to a maximum discount of £20) if you spend £250 in a month.ProsAs well as immediate discounts it offers “exclusive discounts and benefits” from its partners, such as £65 off holiday bookings with Jet2holidays and up to 40% off cinema tickets. In July the retailer announced it would be introducing a new self-scanning feature within the Lidl Plus app. It will let customers scan products as they shop, track their spending and savings in real time and complete their purchases at a self-checkout terminal, all through the app.ConsThe consumer group Which? is among those to have highlighted Lidl Plus as a scheme that is only accessible via an app, with an email address also required. That means the big savings available via the scheme are off-limits to those who cannot or do not wish to go digital. You have to actively opt in to get some of the savings.Overall rating7/10Co-opView image in fullscreenThe Co-op offers a membership scheme.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAYou pay £1 a year to become a member of the Co-op and get a virtual and physical card that gives you some discounts and other perks. There are some members-only prices – recent deals include 65p off Mr Kipling Lemon Slices and 70p off Co-op Fairtrade chocolate – and access to discounts that price-match 100 products to their Aldi equivalent. There are also two weekly personalised offers to choose from, based on your shopping habits. These may include £1 off your shop or money off specific items.To add some fun, there are in-app games with vouchers for prizes, as well as a monthly prize draw – you get an entry for each £5 you spend.ProsYou can save money straight away with some of the offers. You get a say in how the Co-op is run and can help choose a local charity for the business to support. It is also available to 16- and 17-year-olds, unlike other schemes.ConsIt costs £1 to join; not all Co-op societies are involved.Overall rating5/10WaitroseView image in fullscreenThere was delight among shoppers when Waitrose brought back its free hot drink offer.Photograph: David Gee 4/AlamyWith 4.6 million members, the benefits of the supermarket’s My Waitrose scheme include personalised money-saving vouchers, free hot drinks and 20% off selected service counter products such as “big cheese Thursday” and “fish Friday”.ProsFree hot drinks. It caused outrage when this element was dropped during the coronavirus pandemic and its return at thestart of this yearwas met with joy. You need to have your reusable cup on you but given the price of coffee these days it’s a freebie that’s not to be sniffed at.ConsThe proposition feels underwhelming compared with the might of Clubcard and Nectar but a current trial in 18 shops called “little treats” suggests it could be about to become more generous. The trial offers shoppers up to three “little treats”, such as a free product, or money-off voucher each month, based on how much they spend.Overall rating6/10Marks & SpencerView image in fullscreenThe Marks & Spencer Sparks storecard.Photograph: Michael Melia/AlamyMarks & Spencer says Sparks is about giving customers “treats and thank yous for shopping with us”. These include personalised offers across its clothing, home and food departments, and there is also a birthday treat that could include Percy Pigs, Swiss truffles or prosecco (if you have supplied your birthdate). There is also a coffee loyalty scheme in its cafes and a baby club called The Parent Hood with offers such as 10% off babygrows for new parents.ProsSparks clothing discounts are worth keeping an eye out for as they can result in a big saving, especially for families with growing kids, and with its womenswear feted in the fashion press, it can help bring down the cost of a new outfit. Customers can also donate to the causes they care about, with M&S donating 1p to their chosen charity every time they buy something. And come on … who doesn’t want a free bag of Percy Pigs on their birthday?Cons:On a day-to-day basis it doesn’t feel there’s a compelling reason to scan your card at the till but it’s worth checking the app and loading the latest offers as, particularly for clothing and home, these can result in welcome savings.Overall rating4/10MorrisonsView image in fullscreenEvery week Morrisons offers a range of products at a More Card price.Photograph: Mark Collinson/AlamyThe More Card offers a mixture of loyalty prices, targeted offers and the chance to earn points that are turned into vouchers once you have accrued enough – you need to build up 5,000 points, which you can then turn into £5. Every week a range of products are offered at a More Card price – some of these are straightforward price cuts, while others are multi-buy offers that only apply if you are a member. You earn five points for every product you buy and can also opt into “points boosters” so that when you buy particular products you will earn extra points towards a voucher – for example, you might be offered 400-1,200 points on spending on Branston products.ProsThere are some upfront savings, although these do not really stand out from the other offers and discounts being advertised. You can choose to donate your points to the charity Marie Curie. You can earn extra points towards vouchers when you shop with partner retailers including eBay, Dunelm and Deliveroo.ConsThere are not as many immediate discounts as available via Nectar and Clubcard – each week the number of items at More Card prices is in the hundreds rather than thousands. You have to build up £5 worth of points before you can get the money, and the points expire after 12 months.Overall rating6/10The Which? view: not all discounts are equalEvery month the consumer group Which? compares the average price of shopping across eight of the UK’s biggest supermarkets. In September the cheapest store for its shopping list of 71 items was Aldi. The discounter does not have a loyalty scheme.For a bigger trolley load of 186 items, it found that Asda continued to be cheaper than shopping at Tesco with a Clubcard and remained one of the UK’s cheapest supermarkets. (Aldi and Lidl are not included in this comparison as they have a smaller range of products compared with the other supermarkets.)Reena Sewraz, the Which? retail editor, says:“Supermarket loyalty cards can be a useful way to save money but our research shows that not all discounts are as good as they appear, and while most people have signed up to at least one, millions of people can’t access loyalty prices at all because of age limits or digital requirements. That means deals on everyday essentials aren’t always as fair or inclusive as they should be.“The best approach is to use loyalty cards where you already shop, but don’t rely on them for the lowest prices. Compare across supermarkets – Aldi and Lidl often come out cheapest – and only stock up on items you were planning to buy anyway. That way, you’ll be sure to benefit from real savings.”Explore more on these topicsShoppingSupermarketsConsumer affairsRetail industryShops and shoppingFood & drink industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Followers are urged to message the accounts privately for supplier links, as well as being provided with discount codes.Separately, there is a thriving trade onTelegram, where groups with thousands of members share “before and after” photos, injection guides and claims of next-day UK delivery. Sellers advertise the drug there before directing customers to WhatsApp for transactions.Retatrutide is an experimental injection developed by the US drugmaker Eli Lilly. The drug targets three gut hormones – GLP-1, GIP and glucagon. Early trials suggest it could help patients lose up to a quarter of their body weight. Nicknamed the “triple G”, the drug is being hailed online as the next Ozempic.However, doctors and pharmacists have warned that the sale of what is still an unlicensed drug in the UK is a cause for concern and could result in users injecting products of unknown origin.Some said the popularity of retatrutide could be linked to the rising cost of licensed weight loss products such as Mounjaro.Selling retatrutide onTikTokor Telegram is illegal in the UK, as it is an unlicensed drug that cannot be marketed or supplied for human use under the Human Medicines Regulations 2012.View image in fullscreenTikTok accounts of the influencer Jon Kluth and @MappyMyGains.Composite: TikTokSome influencers try to sidestep the rules by referring to the drug as a “research chemical” or citing it as “not for human consumption”. Retatrutide is not a controlled drug, but promotion and supply can still breach medicines, advertising, and consumer laws, risking fines, prosecution or prison.The TikTok influencer Jon Kluth, who is based in the US and has 226,500 followers, posted on the 26 June an update on his journey taking what he called “reta” for four weeks and that said followers could use “code Jon” to purchase it. He then links to an account that sells peptides called Halfnattys. When asked for a comment, Kluth did not respond and the account was taken down.Another account with a UK influencer called @MappyMyGains talks about retatrutide as a “gamechanger” on 21 September, and when followers ask where he gets the drug from he says “pm me mate”. He did not respond to a request for a comment.Another promoter called @clairejoy86 posted videos captions “day 10 of Reta … ” to the background track of the song Manchild by Sabrina Carpenter. Those who comment are told to message her for supply information. She did not respond to a request for comment and instead the account was taken down.View image in fullscreenThe TikTok account of @clairejoy86.Composite: TikTokAccording to TikTok, the social media company has removed violative content and banned associated hashtags and search suggestions. It said it was dedicated to keeping the platform safe and invest in strengthening enforcement strategies.The Guardian also found groups with up to 9,000 members selling retatrutide using Telegram’s built-in discovery tool, which works like a public directory. Typing “retatrutide” instantly brings up channels with thousands of members, filled with photos of weight loss, glowing testimonials and step-by-step guides for mixing or injecting at home.Within minutes of joining one group, a seller posted WhatsApp details, where most transactions take place. The seller sent an instruction manual and promised delivery within 48 hours. When asked whether the product was genuine, one seller said: “You can’t be sure.” Another shared a photo of a supposed laboratory certificate. None asked about weight, medical conditions or previous experience.Inside these groups, posts show black plastic parcels with Royal Mail labels, claiming to contain new batches. One message read: “It took eight of us to load them this morning.”Buyers can choose between powder vials, mixed at home with sterile water, or pre-filled pens typically sold at £160 for 20mg. When asked how long a pen should last, sellers give conflicting answers ranging from a few weeks to “depends on your body”.A spokesperson for Telegram said it actively moderated harmful content on its platform including content that encouraged the “misuse of controlled medications”. It added that it removed “millions of pieces of harmful content each day”.View image in fullscreenEli Lilly said retatrutide had not been reviewed or approved by any regulatory agency in the world.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesJason Murphy, the head of pharmacy at Chemist4U, said unregulated imports could be dangerous. “People are injecting substances they can’t verify. Even if the science behind retatrutide is sound, these online versions may not contain what they claim,” he said.Dr Crystal Wyllie of Asda Online Doctor linked the surge in demand to recent price rises for approved weight-loss drugs such as Mounjaro. “With costs increasing, patients are turning to social media. But counterfeit injections are extremely risky. You can’t be certain what’s inside or whether the environment they were made in was sterile,” she said.Her team has already seen patients harmed by self-injection from unverified sources. “We understand the frustration, but buying from Telegram or WhatsApp is gambling with your health,” said Wyllie. “These substances could be contaminated or incorrectly dosed.”A spokesperson from Eli Lilly said retatrutide was in phase 3 clinical trials and had not been reviewed or approved by any regulatory agency anywhere in the world. “Therefore at this time no one can sell [it] for human use,” they said, adding that any product “falsely representing itself as a Lilly investigational product not yet approved … may expose patients to potentially serious health risks”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

But now a new style is emerging, or is it an old one?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Goldilocks jeans – ie straight cut – have made a comeback. Think Robert Redford in Three Days of the Condor, rather than Jeremy Clarkson’s bootcutTop Gear eraor an indie band’s painted-on pip-squeezers.‘We had to kill the Wag’: nine things we learned from Victoria Beckham’s docuseriesRead moreLeon Hedgepeth, a menswear writer who coined the term “Goldilocks jeans”, describes thestyle as “not too skinny, not too baggy – just right”.Levi’s’ bestselling jeans of all time – the 501, worn by everyone from Marlon Brando to Steve Jobs and Kate Moss – best encapsulates the shape.View image in fullscreenStraight talking … the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011.Photograph: APAnne-Catherine Lepas, the vice-president of merchandising at Levi’s Europe, says the brand defines a straight cut such as the 501 as running evenly from hip to ankle, “creating a clean, effortless look that suits almost everyone”.Sales of straight-cut jeans are up 30% year on year at John Lewis, with top sellers including a £260 pair from the US label Frame. On Thursday, the British department store chainreleased a collaboration with the designer Rejina Pyo. While a cropped fluffy jacket was tipped to be a favourite from the collection, instead the straight-cut jeans in a dark-blue wash are soaring to the top of the sales chart.Elsewhere on the high street, six years after Marks & Spencer launched itsSiennastraight-cut jeans, it is once again a bestselling style. Its recentStovepipeiteration – which features a higher waist and less elastane, meaning it does not give as much, so hangs straighter – is also in demand.View image in fullscreenLights, camera, fashion … Robert Redford frequently wore straight-cut jeans on and off screen.Photograph: David Parker/AlamyThis shift to normality points to consumers’ growing fatigue with fashion’s trend cycle. Micro trends that start on social media, often with the suffix “-core” – such as “Barbiecore” and “cottagecore” – have accelerated this shift even further, with some shoppers feeling constantly outmanoeuvred.As a result, some consumers are giving their wardrobe a hard reset with a return to timeless basics. So less boom boom and more bore bore. A pair of jeans such as the 501s, which originated in 1873 and was commonly worn by miners, fulfil the brief. On Friday, Levi’s reported thatrevenues grew 7% to $1.5bn (£1.1bn)during its third fiscal quarter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They can also be sourced secondhand, which appeals to moreconscious shoppers.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Yvette Cooper.

Meanwhile, the designer Jonathan Anderson stuck to his signature style – vintage Levi’s – as he took a bow after hisDior womenswear debutat Paris fashion week. He has also included a pair of normies in his collaboration with Uniqlo, which launches next week.Alongside trend fatigue, Hedgepeth credits 90s nostalgia and economic uncertainty with driving interest in normie denims. “A sluggish economy has everyone thinking twice before dropping £500 on novelty pants. Straight-leg jeans are the antidote: timeless, unfussy, and a safe bet that won’t make you regret not buying into the next skinny v baggy denim war.”Explore more on these topicsJeansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is this the right dirt track? Is our progress going to be thwarted at any moment by an impenetrable thicket, or worse still an implacable landowner who will force a ham-fisted reverse? As it turns out, we are only temporarily stalled by two male peacocks jousting in the middle of the lane in a kaleidoscopic blur of feathers and fury. We wait for them to retire to the grass verge and continue to bounce up the track until we see a sign for our cottage pointing to the left. This leads us deeper into a woodland of oak, ash, birch and Douglas fir, until we finally see a brick-and-stone house standing in a clearing set back from the trail.From the outside, Van Cottage looks like a pioneer homestead, with a crooked stone chimney to one side and a metal-roofed veranda to the other. Around the corner there’s a wood-fired hot tub, and beyond the garden fence in a little forest glade is a small brick dunny. The house sits on a ridge, and the garden offers views over the carmine-coloured ploughed fields and billowy woodland of Herefordshire.View image in fullscreenThis pioneer spirit continues inside, where there’s a kitchen with a wood-fired range, and an oak-beamed living room with a wood burner, a comfy sofa and a range of books. A wall of old oak boards has retained remnants of the wallpaper of previous occupants, adding a patina of history. The original two-up, two-down stone cottage dates back to the 18th century and a brick extension was added in the mid 19th century. Upstairs, there are two bedrooms, a shower room and a sink overlooked by a mirror encased in an old leather horse collar, in keeping with the cottage’s farm-labourer origins. But the most recent renovation has converted it into a wood- and solar-powered off-grid escape.View image in fullscreenThe living room at Van Cottage.Photograph: Matt DaviesMy own idea of an off-grid escape has roughly conformed to the same blueprint since I read a line in Albert Bigelow Paine’s The Tent Dwellers many years ago: “Then away to the heart of the deep unknown, where the trout and the wild moose are. Where the fire burns bright, and the tents gleam white, under the northern star.”In our current deep unknown, a fleeting glimpse of a roe deer as I make my way to the outside dunny will have to make do for the wild moose. But we get the fires burning bright in the stove and the hot tub and then strike out around fields of buttercups and clover to walk down to a lake stocked with trout on the nearby Whitfield Estate. As I cast a line out over the water, a red kite circles in the thermals above and the chirrup of a redstart in an oak provides the melodic soundtrack. After thrashing the water until dusk, I walk away empty-handed but content.The only thing missing from this Disneyesque scene is a flotilla of butterfliesBack at the cottage, we lower ourselves into the outdoor hot tub, which has reached a tolerable temperature, and watch the stars gleam white as a blanket of darkness envelopes the cottage and a tawny owl hoots in the distance.The next morning, the realisation of being off-grid truly kicks in. While I wait for the kettle to boil – a full 30 minutes as I neglected to keep the stove stoked overnight – I step outside and into a cacophony of nature. My bird app identifies chiffchaffs, wrens, great tits, blackcaps, blackbirds, nuthatches and a woodpecker. A startled hare skitters beyond the garden fence and a group of female pheasants saunter by. The only thing missing from this Disneyesque scene is a flotilla of butterflies.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Matt DaviesThe thing about waiting for a kettle to boil is that it forces you to slow down. So I occupy my time by reading the cottage’s literature, in which I discover that nearby, on the A465 to Hereford, isLock’s Garage, described as “one of the great frontier stores in the whole country”. The notion of a frontier store in the UK is new to me, but it plays perfectly into my romanticised notion of backwoods living. The reality, when I arrive at Lock’s Garage later is a little more prosaic. It’s a petrol station with a Londis storefront. But I soon discover that it’s so much more besides. Outside, the fruit and veg shelves display trays of giant papaya, agave leaves, dragon fruit, lychees and nashi pears. And inside the fridges are laden with grass-fed Hereford beef and rare-breed pork, some from the owners’ own farm. There’s cheese from Hereford and Wales, and local beers and wine. We come away with sausages and steaks for the barbecue that evening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

One day, we walk down into Kilpeck village, where grotesque medieval motifs guard the porch of the Church of St Mary and St David, which architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described as “one of the most perfect Norman churches in England”. We explore the ruins of the Norman motte and bailey castle overlooking the church, and a painterly landscape beyond of barns and grazing Hereford cows. We stop for lunch atthe Kilpeck Inn, where we dine on sea bream with cauliflower and brown butter puree, and local cider, before walking it off on a stretch of theHerefordshire Trail.View image in fullscreenSkenfrith Castle is just over the border in Monmouthshire.Photograph: Maciej Olszewski/AlamyOn other days we head into Hay‑on‑Wye to browse the bookshops, and walk country lanes aroundSkenfrith Castle, just over the border in Monmouthshire. But mostly we spend the time sitting outside listening to birdsong, pulling books from the shelves and deciding our daily menu. It’s surprising how fully so little can occupy you without a television to fill in the gaps. And even though the cottage has broadband, our laptops remain unopened throughout the visit. We replace doomscrolling with keeping the home fires burning in the range and the hot tub. Each evening is spent with a saunter down to the lake in pursuit of an elusive trout. And each evening I return to the cottage with an empty net, but with a lightness of being after another day in the “heart of the deep unknown … and under the northern star”.The trip was provided byThe Cottage Company.

My wife, meanwhile, remains firmly on holidayTim DowlingSat 11 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 11 Oct 2025 11.10 EDTShareI’m sitting on a terrace overlooking a sparkling bay. Directly in front of me fishing boats rock gently on the water and tidy white houses are piled on the hill opposite. I’m looking at my phone.The video I’m watching is narrated by Michael the roofer, who has just sliced away a section of the flat roof at the top of our house.“That is roughly where your leak is, where them two dips are,” he says, indicating an area of damp, rotten wood. “Obviously there is an issue of water getting in.”It was inevitable that after delays caused by his many prior commitments, the roofer would suddenly contact me to say he could start in the morning while I was lying in a deckchair in Croatia .Another video arrives, this one just six seconds long. In it the whole flat roof has been peeled back to reveal the delaminated plywood beneath. A gloved hand pulls at the layers, as flaky as pastry. In a subsequent phone call Michael explains that we are now some way beyond the worst-case scenario laid out in his original quote.Just before lunch I get a text with a revised quote, which leaves me a little short of breathMy wife emerges from the sea, picks up her towel and climbs the stone steps to the terrace.“How’s it going?” she says.“Do you know the difference between a warm and a cold roof?” I say.“No,” she says.“Me neither,” I say. “But it’s my understanding that a cold roof requires ventilation, and a warm roof doesn’t.”“What kind have we got?” she says.“An unventilated cold roof,” I say. “The worst kind.”“The water’s lovely,” she says.“And there are other problems to do with scaffolding,” I say. “The primary one being the cost of scaffolding.”“Well, it’s got to be done,” my wife says.Just before lunch I get a text with a revised quote, which leaves me a little short of breath. My wife, meanwhile, remains firmly on holiday.“Oh well,” she says. “That’s what we thought it would cost originally.”“It’s what we thought when we were guessing,” I say. “Then when we got the first quote, that became the new what we thought.”The next day I’m again lying in a deckchair, listening to the chat floating across me. We’re on holiday with several friends, one of whom possesses first-hand knowledge regarding the true nature of famous people.“Lovely man,” he says. “Cannot be trusted.”I receive a text that says, simply, “The soffits are vented.” I think about contributing this sentence to the general conversation, but I can’t find a way in. I lean over the next deckchair and show the text to my wife. She looks at it, and then at me.“Is that good news?” she says.“What part of ‘the soffits are vented’ don’t you understand?” I say.“All of it,” she says.“Excellent actor,” our friend says. “Colossal wanker.”Later I call the roofer for an update, steering the conversation in a particular way that avoids me having to ask: what are soffits? He asks if I have any architectural plans that might indicate if, or how, the roof is meant to be ventilated.“The loft extension was done before we moved in,” I say. “So no.”“I have the plans,” my wife says when I update her. “They’re in a red folder somewhere.” She calls a son, who finds the plans, who turns them over to the roofer, who texts me to say they’re no help.On Friday morning I receive another text from Michael asking if I have time for a video call. I examine my surroundings: a boat moored off an island beach, benign clouds rising into the blue sky behind my head. I tell him I can’t ring before 3pm.In the meantime the restaurant where we have reservations cancels us. It takes a while to find another restaurant that will seat eight people at short notice, and by the time 3pm rolls around we’re only just tying up at its boat dock.We’re shown to our table on a shaded terrace. I immediately leave the restaurant in search of a less scenic backdrop. When I video call the roofer, my head is surrounded by a blank concrete wall.“How are the soffits?” I say. He shows me on his phone: vents that run along the gutter line of the roof, allowing air to travel between the joists, preventing the buildup of condensation. But he can’t find the place where the air is meant to exit. If the roof is sealed up without one, the problems may persist.“Honestly, this has been the worst job ever,” he says.Above me on the terrace, I hear the faint clinking of wine glasses.Join Tim Dowlingat a specialGuardian Live eventon Wednesday 26 November.

He was joined by three friends and, after seeing his work on display, they headed to Farol Santander, a skyscraper in the city centre housing a museum, galleries and observation deck.“The exhibition was delayed until the summer of 2021 because of the Covid pandemic, so we were living in the first moments of ‘normal’ life at the time,” Barroso says. They stopped for a snack at a cafe on the 26th floor, and Barroso recalls the atmosphere as “somewhat melancholic. Despite the large space, the feeling was one of solitude, highlighted by this woman sitting alone, and the long shadows.”‘Small wonders exist alongside our everyday lives’: Kisara Okada’s best phone pictureRead moreTo take advantage of the sunlight streaming through the windows and the shadows cast on the wall, Barroso positioned himself behind the woman; he guesses she was in her mid-20s, but didn’t speak to her.Barosso describes himself as a huge fan of American photographerWilliam Eggleston, and notes that various elements of this image, “the geometrical lines, deep shadows and colours”, speak to that.“I hope this photo makes people feel as if they have entered an intimate moment of someone’s life, like a scene from a movie,” Barroso adds. “I like to capture moments of contemplative solitude.

Cockerill ordered that PPE Medpro must return the sum of £122m, which the Department ofHealthand Social Care paid for the order of 25m sterile surgical gowns, under a contract awarded in June 2020 via the VIP lane.The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, hailed the judgment as vindication for the Labour government’sstated determinationto recover some of the billions of pounds in public moneywasted during the Covid crisisby Boris Johnson’s administration.“We want our money back. We are getting our money back,”Reeves posted on X. “And it will go where it belongs – in our schools, NHS and communities.”The June contract, and another worth £80.85m to supply face masks, also paid for by the DHSC, were granted to PPE Medpro after Mone approached the thenCabinet Office minister Michael Govein May 2020. Her offer was processed via the “VIP lane”, the system operated by Johnson’s government, giving priority to politically connected people such as Mone, treating them as more credible than experienced PPE suppliers. For years afterwards, Mone and Barrowman through their former lawyers denied involvement in PPE Medpro, until in late 2023 they acknowledged their roles andMone admitted they had lied.View image in fullscreenMichelle Mone first approached the the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, in May 2020 with an offer to supply surgical equipment.Composite: Zuma Press Wire/Rex/Shutterstock/Indigo/GettyThe gownswere rejected on inspectionin September 2020 at the NHS warehousing facilities in Daventry, Northamptonshire, because their labels were invalid, and also signalled that they had not been certified as sterile, a life-protecting requirement. Cockerill ordered that the £122m be repaid by 15 October.Yet in this apparent tale of British justice finally restoring taxpayers’ millions paid out for unsafe medical supplies, there is a looming snag. The judgment is not against Barrowman personally, but his company, which has been left with very little money or assets. In fact, on 30 September, the day before Cockerill delivered her judgment,PPE Medpro Ltd was put into insolvencyand administrators appointed.So although the company has until Wednesday to repay the £122m, there appears no realistic possibility that it can. In a series of public statements since the judgment, Mone hasaccused Reeves of inflammatory languageafter the chancellor jokingly confirmed that the government had “a vendetta” against the couple, and Barrowman has repeatedly said the judgment was wrong, “a white wash [sic] of the facts”. Neither had given any indication that they intended to fund the repayment of the money, until a new statement on Friday evening when their spokesperson said for the first time that the PPE Medpro “consortium” was prepared to discuss “a possible settlement with the government”.In November 2022, the Guardian revealed thatBarrowman had been paid at least £65mfrom PPE Medpro’s profits, then transferred £29m to a trust set up to benefit Mone and her three adult children. The couplesaid in a BBC interviewin December 2023 that Barrowman’s children were also beneficiaries of the trust.In a statement on 4 October, Barrowman’s spokesperson hit out at PPE Medpro’s supply-chain companies, saying the administrator could bring legal claims against them. It is difficult to see the basis for this, given that PPE Medpro accepted the gowns five years ago and has always argued they complied with the DHSC contract. Barrowman describes PPE Medpro and its supply-chain companies as a consortium.Barrowman’s spokesperson confirmed PPE Medpro’s profits, saying of the £203m from the DHSC, the company paid £137m to the supply-chain companies to source and buy the PPE, which left a profit of £66m for Barrowman’s company. Of that, according to the spokesperson’s figures, PPE Medpro made a £39m profit on the contract for the gowns that were never used.Michelle Mone says she has ‘no wish’ to remain a Conservative peerRead moreHowever, although Barrowman made so much from the PPE Medpro deals, and the couple have over the yearsowned luxury yachts, a private jetand prestige properties in different locations, there is no clear route to the government recovering even a penny after the judgment.The Guardian asked the couple’s spokesperson this weekif Barrowman intended to provide the £122m so that PPE Medpro could repay the DHSC. The spokesperson replied: “We are unable to comment on any matters that relate directly to PPE Medpro Ltd. This is not an attempt to avoid your questions. PPE Medpro is now in administration and only the administrators are able to comment on the company. It is vital to make clear, to avoid any misunderstanding, that the court case and subsequent ruling was against PPE Medpro, NOT Mr Barrowman.”The Guardian asked the spokesperson to clarify if that meant Barrowman and Mone did not intend to fund the return of the £122m, or repay any of the money received from PPE Medpro profits. The spokesperson replied: “This is not what my statement said at all, and is a huge leap and incorrect for you to reach this conclusion. Let me be clear: ‘At no stage have we stated that Mr Barrowman has no intention of making any payment to the DHSC. We have been clear that we cannot answer any questions regarding PPE Medpro.’”View image in fullscreenMichelle Mone and her husband, Doug Barrowman.Photograph: Jeff Moore/PA MediaThe spokesperson added: “Furthermore, you include Baroness Mone – why? She received no money from the DHSC contract. Her involvement as an introducer was fully disclosed to the DHSC … so to connect her and suggest she must repay money simply because she is married to Mr Barrowman is both unfair and disingenuous and shows that you have a personal/public agenda against her.”In the new statement sent on Friday evening, Barrowman’s spokesperson said: “The consortium partners of PPE Medpro are prepared to enter into a dialogue with the administrators of the company to discuss a possible settlement with the government.”PPE Medpro is now bust – put into administration by Perree Ptc, a private trust company linked to Barrowman registered in the British Virgin Islands tax haven, which had a mortgage-style charge against the company. Barrowman’s spokesperson did not respond to questions about Perree, or the circumstances in which it had put the company into administration.The whole legal basis for limited companies is to protect the people who have put money in from becoming personally liable for all its debts: to give the owners limited liability. If Barrowman, who described himself in the 2023 BBC interview as the ultimate beneficial owner of PPE Medpro, and who received £65m in profits, does not wish to pay the DHSC, the legal routes to enforcing the judgment appear difficult.There are only narrow circumstances in which an administrator or somebody owed money, the government in this case, can get behind a company’s limited liability – “pierce the corporate veil” in legal terminology – and enforce payment from directors or shareholders.“There is no obvious, easy route to recover money from any individuals behind the company in this case,” Simon Walsh, a commercial litigation partner atSA Law, said. “The circumstances for piercing the corporate veil can include where an administrator proves that transactions have been improper, or fraudulent. This may not apply here and investigating it will inevitably be costly, complex and time-consuming. There is a real risk of a pyrrhic victory for the government in this case.”It appears that any process for seeking repayment of the £122m is separate to the long-running investigation by the National Crime Agency into PPE Medpro and whether Mone and Barrowman may have committed criminal offences,including fraud by false representation, in the procurement of the contracts. The couple deny any criminal wrongdoing.Michelle Mone accuses Rachel Reeves of inflammatory remarks over PPE rulingRead moreThe NCA has confirmed that it began its investigation in May 2021, and in April the following year law enforcement officersraided the couple’s mansionon the Isle of Man and their London home, as well as the PPE Medpro offices. In December 2023, Mone and Barrowmanagreed to a freezing orderof more than £75m worth of assets, including bank accounts, wealth management accounts and shares held in companies owning luxury properties, after an application by the Crown Prosecution Service under the Proceeds of Crime Act.The NCA has not provided any detailed information about the time it is taking or when the CPS might decide whether there will be any criminal charges. PPE Medpro’s barrister, Charles Samek KC,complained during the high court trialthat the NCA investigation was “long-running and seemingly never-ending”, and “hanging … like Damocles’ sword” over the company “without ever seemingly being progressed”.In response to questions about how long it was taking, the NCA has said in a statement: “Investigations must pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry. In serious economic crime investigations these lines of inquiry can be incredibly complex. It can take considerable time to ensure that a thorough, independent and objective investigation is conducted.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Guardian DesignReeves has insisted the government is determined to recover money lost in failed pandemic spending, pointing to the establishment of theCovid counter-fraud commissioneramong other initiatives. In the PPE Medpro case, however, it risks having spent more millions for an expert legal team led by Paul Stanley KC to win a hard-fought £122m judgment it cannot enforce. Government sources have not provided any information about what it might do if the money is not paid on Wednesday.The DHSC has declined to expand on the comments of the health secretary, Wes Streeting, who said on the day of the judgment: “PPE Medpro must now repay the government and the taxpayer £122m. My department will work closely with PPE Medpro Limited’s administrators to recover everything we can.”Daniel Bruce, the chief executive of Transparency International UK, a key member of theUK Anti-Corruption Coalitionwhich was a core participant in the Covid public inquiry into the pandemic contracts debacle, said: “There appear to be very few levers the government has available to recover anything close to the £122m the high court has ordered PPE Medpro to repay. The whole case stands as a further indictment of the ‘VIP lane’ and the flawed, wasteful procurement of PPE during the pandemic.”This saga of the Conservative peer, her businessman husband, Johnson’s Tory government and the multimillion-pound Covid contracts has some way to run yet.Quick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Some, such as the faded one on a roundabout leading to the centre of the southern Portuguese resort city, offer sun-bleached glimpses of enticing real estate, golden beaches and vibrant nightlife. Others that have sprung up before Sunday’s local elections peddle promises of a different kind.By far the most numerous are those belonging to the far-right Chega party. Its political posters feature one-line grievances about the state of public health, education and housing and tell passing drivers that all these problems will be solved once Chega is in charge.There is a good chance that disillusioned Albufeirans – in a city that has voted for the centre-right PSD for more than two decades – will help give Chega a historic night on Sunday. After leapfrogging the socialists to take second place inMay’s general election, Chega now hopes to leverage local-level frustrations to gain dozens of municipalities across the country and position itself for the same in the next general election.The Algarve sits at the very centre of the far-right’s strategy. Chega’s leader, André Ventura, aformer football punditand columnist who left the PSD to found the new party just six years ago, has called the region the “party’s stronghold” and the starting point of Portugal’s “conquest” by the far right.View image in fullscreenAndré Ventura campaigning in Sabugal, central Portugal.Photograph: Miguel A Lopes/EPAA recent poll for the Portuguese daily Diário de Notícias put Ventura’s party in the lead for the national vote for the first time. Its cocktail of populist policies, among them stricter controls on migration and chemical castration for paedophiles, have grabbed the attention of voters who are sick of a series of corruption scandals that have dogged the two main parties over recent years. Some believe Ventura may be on the fast track to becoming prime minister.“If in two months there’s a new political scandal and new snap elections, Chega would likely win the general elections,” said António Costa Pinto, a political scientist at Lisbon University’s Institute of Social Sciences.Chega voters in the Algarve argue that the party needs to use Sunday’s elections as a springboard for a nationwide takeover. Daniel Vicente, a 30-year-old barman from Albufeira, said: “I sincerely hope Chega wins. The Algarve is collapsing … Well,Portugalis collapsing.”Housing prices are Vicente’s biggest concern. The Algarve, which faces the same consequences of overtourism as other parts ofEurope, has the second highest housing costs in Portugal after Lisbon. Rental prices in Albufeira have risen by more than 16% in the last year alone.Vicente, repeating several of Chega’s talking points and misinformation, pointed the finger at the low-wage migrants who had come to the region.“Migrants who come here have everything going for them,” he said. “They share two-bedroom flats with 10 people. They pay little rent so they have money left. I don’t know what kind of support they receive but they must be receiving some support because they open up their own stores and you wonder how they did it.“I have to pay €800 (£696) for a flat and for everything else on a little more than the minimum wage [€870 a month]. No one gives me anything, and I don’t have enough money in the bank to ask for a loan to buy a house.”That resentment was Chega’s breeding ground. The party’s meteoric rise, boosted by three snap elections in the last three years and massively disproportionate media coverage, mostly lies in Ventura’s capacity to tap into people’s unexplored anger and use it to disrupt the political conversation.Miguel Carvalho, a journalist and author of the book Por Dentro do Chega (Inside Chega), said: “In 2019, Ventura went to places where politicians hadn’t been in years. He listened to people; he was their shoulder to cry on. And he promised he would shout for them whenever he could.“When he started making these statements, which people were ashamed to make in public, and when the media gave these statements a microphone and made Chega seem much bigger than it was, people started thinking they were also entitled to talk like that. They felt represented and Chega grew.”He said the party was “based around Ventura and it runs on his intuition. That was why it grew so much, so fast.”Gone were the days when Ventura had to chase Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain’s far-right Vox party, or Italy’s Matteo Salvini for a selfie, Carvalho said. “Now he’s the one who is invited. He travels to Spain and Hungary often. Bolsonaro supporters idolise him. Now he is their star.”The stark contrast between the Algarve’s image of a seaside paradise and the realities of daily life for many of its residents has made it a perfect target for Chega and an ideal laboratory for Portugal’s rapidly shifting politics. Albufeira has a population of 40,000 and attracts about half a million visitors annually.“Most of the economy is based on low wages, tourism, and migration associated with tourism,” said Costa Pinto. “These issues make people very sensitive to Chega’s message.”View image in fullscreenA view of Albufeira and the beach, one of Portugal’s most popular destinations.Photograph: Sohadiszno/Getty Images/iStockphotoNear the popular Praia da Oura beach, three tuk-tuk drivers waiting for passengers spoke affectionately about how Ventura had been the first politician to care about them.“Ventura puts the Portuguese people first,” said Filipe Serrão, 50, who prides himself on having been one of the very first Chega activists in Albufeira.Rodney Sudário, 38, a Brazilian driver who has been in Portugal for 18 years, said he would cast his ballot for Chega. He was not bothered by Ventura’s demonisation of migrants because he thinks the problems lie with those “from non-Christian cultures” – something that his colleague Tiago Filipe, 29, agreed with.“Chega is not against migrants, only those who don’t want to work,” Filipe said. “All migrants coming from south-east Asia are unqualified. And Muslims only want subsidies. They want to take over Europe – Islamise it.”Not everyone agrees. A few metres from the tuk-tuks’ parking spot, an Indian man who has been working in Albufeira for 10 years shook his head. He worried that a Chega win would make “everything more difficult” for him and others like him.“It’s puzzling to me how the Portuguese, who have emigrated everywhere, are against migration now,” he said. “It wasn’t like this before, but Chega talks and talks and promises everything – impossible things. If Ventura wins and ends up kicking all the migrants out, where will he find the people to work at restaurants and in agriculture?” the man said.For some, however, Sunday can’t come soon enough. “If Chega wins, we’ll take our flags and go in tuk-tuks parading around,” Filipe said. “It’s going to be a party. The Algarve is Chega’s kingdom. The rest of the country will follow.”Explore more on these topicsPortugalThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That still does not make sense to me. But that might be on the previous government. This one might have inherited the situation.”1:35British-Egyptian human rights activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah: ‘I deserve to heal’  – audioHe also thanked those in the UK who had campaigned for his release and given strength to his own family, lightly referencing Margaret Thatcher’s claim that society did not exist in the UK. “It does exist and my family has experienced it,” he said.Abd el-Fattah rose to prominence as one of the most compelling voices of the Arab spring in 2011, buthas spent most of his time in prisonsince 2014, the year after President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi came to power in a military coup.In 2014,a court sentenced him to five years in prisonfor participating in a demonstration about the outlawing of protest. In September 2019, only six months after he had been released on nightly probation, he was arrested again and held in pre-trial detention for more than two years. He was convicted in December 2021 of “spreading false news” for sharing a post about a prisoner dying of torture, and handed another five-year sentence.His 69-year-old mother, Laila, based in London and Cairo, went ontwo hunger strikeslasting 287 days and was twicehospitalised in London.View image in fullscreenAbd el-Fattah and his mother at home after his release.Photograph: Sayed Hassan/Getty ImagesHe said: “There were long periods of despair when I did not think I was going to be released. Then there were long periods of despair when I was not sure whether I was going to survive and I was not sure whether my mother was going to survive, and I was not sure I would want to survive if my mother did not survive.”He said the relationship with his Brighton-based 14-year-old autistic son Khaled is his most important preoccupation. He said: “He is with me now. He has taken a few weeks off from school. We are hanging out together, we go swimming, we go rowing, we are sleeping in the same room so there is some serious bonding, trying to catch up, build a new connection. His mother has been amazing. I do not know how she did that, but he was ready for me. There was no estrangement.”For most of the time in jail, Abd el-Fattah did not see his son since the visits were short and behind glass, and it was not suitable for someone on the autism spectrum.“In the six years I have been in prison I have seen him a handful of times,” he said. “We hit it off immediately and I am looking forward to seeing him in Brighton, and understanding his world there because it is completely new to me.View image in fullscreenAbd el-Fattah said his freedom was ‘overwhelming’.Photograph: Khaled Elfiqi/AP“I was aware of the campaign and my mother’s conditions, albeit with time delays. I am candid in prison visits. My family is candid. We talked freely even though they are always listening in. It is better than having secrets.”He said he thought his mother might die, “not because either government wanted that outcome, but their sense of time has nothing to do with how time operates for people caught up in this vortex of incarceration. They were moving at a speed that had nothing to do with what was going on with me or my mother.“I was seriously worried about her. I was also worried about her sustaining some form of permanent damage that compromised her health for the future.”Asked what freedom felt like, he said: “It is overwhelming. It is also comfortable and natural, and I am immediately fitting in with them, including witnessing three family fights in two days. The usual stuff. It is wonderful to be back, and going to visit other family houses. It is wonderful to be back in that. That is what I have missed the most. This connection with family, with children, catching up on who has had how many children. And my mum, I think, is happy to open my door and see that I am sleeping there, and am just there. I don’t have to do anything.”View image in fullscreenAbd el-Fattah with his mother and sister, Sanaa Seif.Photograph: Khaled Elfiqi/APDiscussing his plans for the future and whether he will risk political activism inEgyptagain, he says: “I deserve to heal.

It is time for deep reflection and new modalities of engaging with things, and to try to find new modalities for freedom. I was stuck for too long in prison so I didn’t really get a chance to think about it… but in my last free moments I was stuck in an inherited position in which one could easily believe the road to freedom was through prison – and I don’t think that works.“What is activism without putting yourself in harm’s way? Maybe I’m middle-aged and maybe I need to admit to it, and be a dad and a dad activist. I don’t know. I need to think differently, to think less locally because I am going to be in the UK, and the deadlock in the world right now is not resolvable from a place like Egypt – though I think there is benefit in having a perspective from a place like Egypt because there is a deadlock of imagination in the global north, and a deadlock in the possibility of action in the global south.”View image in fullscreenAbd el-Fattah joined by friends and family at home.Photograph: Sayed Hassan/Getty ImagesHe stressed: “But I don’t have any notions that I am going to be a major intellectual, it’s just a question of how do I engage with the world and what’s my place in it? I am not imagining the world is waiting for me to change things. It’s possible that what I have to say is how to live with defeat, or how to live with despair, or how to champion a lost cause. I do not think there is such a thing as a victory even for the rich. They are stuck in an imaginary where we are going to cease to exist. But we are not going to cease to exist.“I think we have got to stop thinking about victories and start thinking about how the hell we are going to live with each other, how are we going to live with the world we have inherited and the world we have constructed and keep constructing. The only way to make the world a kinder place is to champion these lost causes.”He recounts how the confusion surrounding the tumultuous day of his release from jail led to him being locked out of his home. “We were being told it was a matter of days that I would be released in late July and after three weeks it became very frustrating and humiliating so I was not sure what was going on. In this world there are black boxes and elephants all the way down, not knowing what is going on.View image in fullscreenAbd el-Fattah and friends.Photograph: Sayed Hassan/Getty Images“I was cooking and apparently on the ticker on the TV screen there was an item that I had been given a presidential pardon. We did not see it until we sat down to eat. We froze the frame and called the prison guard. I was saying: ‘Call the warden, it says I am being released. I want to have a shower,’ and then they were ready and then it was process, process, waiting for my paperwork.”Cairo’sWadi al-Natrun prison complexhas many exit points and he did not know his family were already waiting outside. “I thought there was some arrangement so there was no media circus and my family would be waiting at home. The [officers] drove me to my local police station,” he said.The prison guards did not want him leaving in prison clothes so agreed to buy him some civilian clothes. “So they bought me a nice white shirt. It’s Cairo, so you can buy things at midnight.“One of the officers drove me from the station and dropped me off at the house. He asked: ‘Do you want to check if there is anyone upstairs?’ and I said: ‘No, it’s OK, I am home.’ He left. I went upstairs, and there was no one, so I hung out and talked with the shopkeepers and neighbours until I found someone with a phone to ring my family to say I was home. They were two hours away outside the prison gates. So I spent two hours talking to the pharmacist and neighbours. The Cairo street scene and the kindness of people felt like freedom. I was wearing civilian clothes among civilians. I did not have money, I did not have a phone, but I was home.”0:57Egyptian-British activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah reunited with family after release from prison – videoHe admits he cannot know what secured his release after so many reverses. “Ultimately what mattered to us was that there was a broad community in the public and it was very British and very supportive and that also inspired Egyptians to feel more bold in expressing their solidarity. Activists, artists, people in the media and MPs. It was broad and communal. I did not know it all because I was isolated but I could see its impact on my family and on the way I was treated in prison. It still took putting my own body on the line and my mother putting her own body on the line, all the way to the limit. It took a lot of brilliant organising.“We could not have done it without that support, and given the UK is still a democracy I would rather there wasn’t this very binary mentality of the state and society being two separate things – this is too partisan, talking about society, since Margaret Thatcher said society does not exist - but it does. If there was ever a question about whether British society exists, my family has experienced it in this campaign. It does exist.”Explore more on these topicsEgyptMiddle East and north AfricaAfricaAbdel Fatah al-SisiHuman rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Capsat soldiersbrought the current president, Andry Rajoelina, to power in a coup in 2009.Speaking on state television on Saturday night, the prime minister, Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo, said the government was “fully ready to listen and engage in dialogue with all factions – youth, unions or the military”.Rajoelina appointed Zafisambo and a new defence and security minister afterdissolving the previous government last weekin response to the protests.The soldiers’ intervention ratcheted up pressure on Rajoelina, who demonstrators have been demanding stand down. The youth-led protests broke out on 25 September, initially over water and electricity cuts. However, they quickly widened into calls for a complete overhaul of the political system, with thegen Z protesters not placated by Rajoelina firing his governmentlast week.Earlier in the day, police fired stun grenades and teargas to try to disperse the protesters. The recently appointed minister of the armed forces also called on troops to “remain calm”, at a press conference on Saturday.“We call on our brothers who disagree with us to prioritise dialogue,” minister general Deramasinjaka Manantsoa Rakotoarivelo said. “The Malagasy army remains a mediator and constitutes the nation’s last line of defence.”However, a Capsat leader accompanied by a large group of soldiers called on other military units to “refuse orders to shoot your friends”, in a video that was posted on social media before they left their barracks.“Let us join forces, military, gendarmes and police, and refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers and our sisters,” he said, also calling on soldiers at the airport to “prevent all aircraft from taking off”.“Close the gates and await our instructions,” he said. “Do not obey orders from your superiors. Point your weapons at those who order you to fire on your comrades-in-arms, because they will not take care of our families if we die.”Nothing has been posted on the president’s social media accounts since Friday evening, when he waspicturedmeeting the heads of 10 of the country’s universities to discuss improving students’ lives.An activist who attended Saturday’s demonstrations said she was concerned about the involvement of Capsat, due to their role in the 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power. She also criticised politicians who made brief addresses to the crowds in front of the city hall as “opportunists”.“That’s why I’m not rejoicing at all, because all of those people gravitating around this ‘event’ are all dangerous,” said the activist, who didn’t want to be named for fear for her safety.A member of Gen Z Madagascar, a leaderless group of young people that has helped to coordinate the protests, also expressed doubts about what would happen next. “We are very happy, but a lot is happening [and] we don’t want another corrupted person to take the power here, so we will do everything to have the right to choose who to put up there,” he said.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsMadagascarAfricaProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

It said in a later statement that the shelter had been hit twice by drones and eight times by artillery shells on Friday and Saturday.Map showing drone strikes in Sudan“Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,” said the committee, which is part of a group of activists who coordinate aid and document abuses in the conflict. “The situation has gone beyond disaster and genocide inside the city, and the world remains silent.”A separate medical group, called the Sudan Doctors’ Network, gave a figure of 53 people killed in the strikes, including 14 children and 15 women.The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese Armed Forces in a civil war since April 2023. Its militants have put El Fasher under siege formore than 500 daysand families there are starving.El Fasher – home to 400,000 people – is the last state capital in the region of Darfur that has not been taken by the RSF.

It did not contain credit card details, financial information or passport details.On Saturday the group marked the data as “leaked”, writing: “Don’t be the next headline, should have paid the ransom.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailJeremy Kirk, analyst at Intel 471, a cyber threat intelligence company, said 44 companies had been included in the leak including Gap, Vietnam Airlines, Toyota, Disney, McDonald’s, Ikea, and Adidas.He said the hacker group was well known and operated out of countries such as the US, UK and Australia.“This particular group is not a new threat; they’ve been around for some time,” Kirk said. “But they’re very skilled in knowing how companies have connected different systems together.”A Qantas spokesperson previously told Guardian Australia its priorities were “continued vigilance and providing ongoing support for our customers” after the June attack.“We continue to offer a 24/7 support line and specialist identity protection advice to affected customers,” the spokesperson said.A Salesforce spokesperson told Guardian Australia the company “will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand”.There was no indication the Salesforce platform had been compromised, the company said via a statement.“We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support,” it said.It is understood the global data was stolen between April 2024 and September 2025 and includes personal and contact information of the companies’ customers and employees, including dates of birth, purchase histories and passport numbers.“No company wants to see hundreds of thousands, or millions, of records of their customers just on the internet,” Kirk said. “That’s awful. It’s awful for the companies. It’s awful for the people affected.”In July, Qantas obtained an ongoing injunction from the NSW supreme court ensuring protections to prevent the stolen data being accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published by anyone, including third parties.Kirk said there was no financial data but criminals could potentially use leaked personal information to open credit cards. He said people should monitor their accounts for suspicious activity, and beware of scam emails that are personalised.“These days, a lot of threat groups are now generating personalised phishing emails,” he said. “They’re getting better and better at this – and these types of breaches help sort of fuel that economy, that underground fraudster economy.”Qantas has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsQantasCybercrimeAirline industryBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

Over the past month, the enemy has increased the number of air attack weapons and although our air defence is about 74% effective, we need to make additional efforts to cover the rear energy sector, critical infrastructure and logistics,” said Syrskyi.Earlier this week, Russia launched 465 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones, as well as 32 cruise and ballistic missiles, against Ukraine.The latest talks between Trump and Zelenskyy come amid ongoing discussions in Washington over whether to provide Ukraine with the Tomahawk cruise missiles Kyiv has long been seeking, a move Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has warned would be a “completely new, qualitatively new stage of escalation”.The phone call between the two leaders comes amid a warming of relations between the US president and Zelenskyy.The Ukrainian president said in his nightly address on Friday that Russia was taking advantage of the world being “almost entirely focused on the prospect of establishing peace in the Middle East”, and called for strengthening Ukraine’s air defence systems and tighter sanctions on Russia.“Russian assets must be fully used to strengthen our defence and ensure recovery,” he said in the video, posted to X.Meanwhile, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said in a joint statement on Friday they were ready to coordinate and move toward using “the value of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine’s armed forces and thus bring Russia to the negotiation table”.They aimed to do this “in close cooperation with the United States,” the statement added.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Over the past two years, outrage at Israel’s war in Gaza has erupted acrossEuropeand the US, manifesting itself in university campus protests, massive marches through countless capitals and the disruption of major sporting events.Even as hopes rise of an end to the war, international anger over Israel’s actions in Gaza, which have been deemed agenocide by a UN commission of inquiry, remains raw, as evidenced by last weekend’shuge rallies in Spain and Italy.Boycotting Israel has gone mainstream: ‘We’ve never seen such traction before’Read moreWhile the fury that fuels them has been shared and ubiquitous, the demonstrations – and the authorities’ responses to them – have varied considerably from country to country. If some of the official reactions have been draconian, there have also been exceptions, especially in countries where public opinion is more openly pro-Palestinian.Free speech on trialIn theUS, growing pro-Palestinian activism has been met with arrests, legal action and mounting threats, offeringa pretextfor the Trump administration’s unprecedented attack on free speech and catalysing what many view as the country’s descent into authoritarianism.In the early months of the war, thousands of people, many of themJewish, took part in protests. After students at Columbia University set up a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus in the spring of 2024, dozens more followed at other universities across the country. But bowing to pressure from legislators, donors, and pro-Israel critics, many universities responded harshly to the encampments, calling police on to campuses, which led tothousands of arrests.View image in fullscreenA woman shouts slogans during a pro-Palestine protest in New York.Photograph: Olga Fedorova/EPAMeanwhile, allegations of antisemitism against pro-Palestinian protests have been weaponised by the Trump administration to launch an unprecedentedassault on academic freedom, including cutting billions in funding to universities, screening thousands of visa applicants for pro-Palestinian views, and the detention andattempted deportationof foreign scholars over their political views.Policing protestsIn theUK, the Metropolitan police have so far arrested more than 1,900 people at pro-Palestinian events, the vast majority of whom have been detained for allegedly expressing support forPalestine Action, a direct action group that has been proscribed under anti-terrorism legislation. The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has called for theban to be rescinded, describing it as “disproportionate and unnecessary”.Former British diplomat challenges Palestine Action ban in ScotlandRead moreThe prime minister, Keir Starmer, who described plans for protests on the second anniversary of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel as“un-British”, has said his government will look atfurther curbs on protests, including potential powers to take action against specific chants at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Starmer also urged protesters to show respect by calling off their activities in theimmediate aftermath of the Manchester synagogue terror attack, in which two people died.View image in fullscreenThe UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has called for the UK’s ban on Palestine Action to be rescinded, describing it as “disproportionate and unnecessary”.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockHistoric tensionsInGermany, whose postwar identity has been indelibly shaped by the Nazi regime’s responsibility for the Holocaust, the protests have revealed tensions between popular feeling and the country’s longstanding solidarity withIsrael.Even aspublic opinion has turned against the Israeli government’s relentless assault on Gaza– a recent pro-Palestinian rally in Berlin attracted about100,000 demonstrators– successive German governments have reaffirmed the principle that responsibility for Israel’s security is part of Berlin’s own Staatsräson,or reason of state.Activists have repeatedly said that police tactics have been excessive, at times brutal, and in violation of constitutional protections of freedom of assembly and expression.Much of the dispute between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and German authorities has centred around which slogans are banned under the law as antisemitic.In May last year, a pro-Palestinian activist was convicted of condoning a crime for using the chant, “from the river to the sea,Palestinewill be free”, at a rally four days after the 7 October attacks. The judge said she “could not comprehend” the logic of previous German court rulings that determined the saying was “ambiguous”, and that, to her, it was clear it “denied the right of the state of Israel to exist”.This chant however hasalso been widely used to call for equal rightsboth in Israel and Palestine.When asked about crackdowns on pro-Palestinian activism afteran alleged case of brutality against an Irish protester, Berlin police this month said they had opened an investigation into the officer but denied a pattern of violence or infringement of civil rights.Artists and intellectuals have cited achilling effectin Germany around support for the Palestinian cause since the 7 October attacks, as criticism of Israeli tactics in Gaza can be quickly smeared as antisemitism, resulting in the withdrawal of prizes, positions and public funding.Meanwhile, many Jewish leaders in Germany have described a sense of isolation over the last two years and point toa sharp rise in attacks on Jews and Jewish institutions.Liberty in questionIn May this year,France’sinterior ministryannounced it would dissolve the pro-Palestinian human rights and solidarity collective, Urgence Palestine, stating that it condoned Hamas, called for intifada in France, and provoked hatred, violence and discrimination against Jewish people. Urgence Palestine has contested these allegations, saying that the move to dissolve it is politically motivated and part of a wider crackdown on pro-Palestinian activism. The collective has not yet been dissolved.Marie Laure Geoffray, freedoms advocacy officer for Amnesty InternationalFrance, said there had been “significant repression and a silencing of voices in solidarity with Palestine” and that this was ongoing.She said it had taken various forms in France, including the banning of some street demonstrations in certain cities, the decision to dissolve Urgence Palestine, as well as legal action. Geoffray said students on French campuses had also been accused of disrupting the peace or troubling the public order.Strikes and solidarityInItaly, the extent ofpublic opinion against Israel’s warbecame evident on 22 September, when tens of thousands of people took to the streets calling for an end to the conflict as part ofa general strikecoordinated by trade unions.The mostly peaceful event was overshadowed by clashes between police and masked protesters at Milan’s central train station, giving the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, an opportunity to condemn the “shameful” scenes and attack her leftwing opponents rather than show solidarity with the Palestinians.View image in fullscreenPolice said at least 250,000 people turned out for a pro-Palestine march in Rome last Saturday.Photograph: Alessandro Bremec/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThe pressure on Meloni increased further when Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla triggered protests across Italy nine days later. Rome’s police said at least 250,000 people turned out for a march, which came a day aftermore than 2 million peopletook part in a one-day general strike to support Palestinians in Gaza.Meloni’s government is mindful of public opinion, and in recent months has become increasingly critical of Israel’s killing of Palestinians – even as Italy remains one of Israel’s strongest EU allies. Meloni now says Italy would recognise a Palestinian state if the remaining Israeli hostages were freed and the militant groupHamaswas out of government.‘Starting to be very afraid’: Italy’s Gaza protests raise pressure on MeloniRead more‘We steward ourselves’InIreland, which joined Spain and Norway in formally recognising a Palestinian state in May 2024, the police force, An Garda Síochána, has mostly applied a light touch to Gaza protests, which usually pass without incident.Governmentpolicyandpublic opinionare stronglypro-Palestinian, which creates a supportive atmosphere for marches and rallies.“Overall it’s kind of hands-off policing,” said Zoë Lawlor, the chair of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign. “National demonstrations pass off fine. In Limerick we have a demonstration every week and we never see the Garda unless the far right show up too. Otherwise we just steward ourselves.”View image in fullscreenIn Ireland, government policy and public opinion are strongly pro-Palestinian, which creates a supportive atmosphere for marches and rallies.Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/ReutersPolice have on occasion been “heavy-handed” when dealing with sit-ins and other acts of civil disobedience but that did not compare with the “shocking” police behaviour in some other countries, said Lawlor.Ireland enjoyed greater freedom to protest than in countries such as the UK, US and Germany, but Irish policing still required monitoring, said Joe O’Brien, the executive director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. “We have heard testimony, including allegations of unnecessary strip-searches and a cavity search, that raises serious concerns regarding Garda compliance with human rights frameworks and national law, regulations and policies governing the treatment of people in custody.”In May, the then Garda commissioner, Drew Harris, said allegations of strip-searches were inaccurate and that his force at all times had acted professionally and lawfully.A nation mobilisedSimilarly,Spainhas proved something of an exception when it comes to government support for protests.Not long after more than 100,000 pro-Palestinian demonstratorsforced a premature, scrappy and sporadically violent endto the Vuelta a España cycle race in Madrid last month, due to theparticipation of the Israel Premier Tech team, senior Spanish politicians lined up to bemoan the damage the protest had done to the country’s global reputation.Figures in the conservative People’s party called the episode “an international embarrassment” and compared scenes on the streets of Madrid to “Sarajevo during the war”.Spanish MPs back move to enshrine in law arms embargo on IsraelRead moreBut one political figure took a different line. Spain’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said he had“a deep admiration”for all those who had protested in a non-violent manner and for “a Spanish society that mobilises against injustice and defends its ideas in a peaceful manner”.Sánchez, who had already been fiercely criticised by his adversaries, also said he hoped the events in Madrid would lead others to reconsider whether Israel should be included in major sporting events.Last weekend, an estimated 200,000 people rallied across dozens of cities to show their solidarity with Palestine.Both the protests and the prime minister’s backing for them demonstrate the strength of public opinion in a country where, according toa recent poll, 82% of people believe Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Sánchez’s conservative opponents have also recently begun to step up theircriticisms of Israel’s conduct in Gaza, while King Felipe – hardly a habitual courter of controversy – used a speech before the UN last month to begIsraelto “stop the massacre” and end its “abhorrent acts” in Gaza.Explore more on these topicsProtestGazaPalestineSpainIrelandItalyFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

With a laugh, he added: “It made me question, just what have we done here?”Everyone wanted to speak to him about the same thing; a town council motion, approved unanimously and across party lines, calling on the central government to push forwardwith a stalled proposalto regularise undocumented migrants in Spain.“To us, it was the most natural thing in the world,” explained Núñez Pérez, as he paused to greet residents in the town’s central plaza. In recent decades, migrants from across the globe had been atrracted to Villamalea for the many jobs on offer.The steady supply of labour had helped turn the town into an agricultural heavyweight – about 70% of the mushrooms sold in Spain come from here – while also transforming Villamalea into a rich tapestry of residents whose roots trace back to 32 countries.View image in fullscreenJosé Núñez Pérez, mayor of Villamalea: ‘We didn’t even debate it, we were all onboard right away.’Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianFor the 11 town councillors who backed the motion to grant papers to undocumented migrants – from Núñez Pérez’s People’s party to the Socialists and the United Left – this reality took precedence over party lines.“We didn’t even debate it, we were all onboard right away,” said Núñez Pérez. “There’s a lot of work to be done here. And there could be even more – the problem for these companies is that they can’t find enough people to work.”With the town’s companies weighing up whether to bring in temporary foreign workers, it only made sense to allow those who were already here a fair chance at a foothold. “It’s not just economics, it’s a question of humanity,” said the mayor.In late August, the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde,said gross domestic outputin Germany would have been about 6% lower in 2019 if it hadn’t been for foreign workers. The picture was similar across the eurozone, she said. “Although they represented only around 9% of the total labour force in 2022, foreign workers have accounted for half of its growth over the past three years.”View image in fullscreenIn recent decades, migrants have been attracted to Villamalea for the many jobs on offer.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianIn Spain, where the Socialist prime ministerhas insistedthat migration is an opportunity, a surge in arrivals has helped tomake the country a bright spotamong Europe’s plodding economies.Of late, even some of the most ardent critics of immigration have conceded its necessity; in June Italy’s Giorgia Meloni, the far-right leader whohas long calledirregular migrants a threat to Europe’s future, said her governmentwould issuenearly 500,000 new work visas for non-EU nationals in the coming years, in addition to the 450,000 handed out since she took power.While regularisation programmeshave long been usedacross the EU, with 43 put in place by more than a dozen countries between 1996 and 2008, in Villamalea the push to grant papers was also rooted in the town’s history.View image in fullscreenVenancio Cuenca Lopéz, president of the Villamalea Retirees Association: ‘We’re all human beings, we need to have some empathy.’Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianDuring much of the 20th century, the town’s residents were forced to fan out acrossEuropein search of work, said Venancio Cuenca Lopéz, the head of a local retiree association. “Some of them had papers, but some had no papers, no job offers, nothing,” he said. “We can’t say: ‘Well we did it, but now we’re against it.’ We’re all human beings, we need to have some empathy.”He pushed back against claims that regularisation would push down wages. “There are companies that take advantage of undocumented workers, forcing them to work in poor conditions and paying them little. Then Spaniards can’t work because they’re competing with people who are getting paid peanuts,” he said. “So we regularise them, everyone has the same conditions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From the pensioners who make up about a quarter of the town’s population to the around 20% who were born abroad – the majority from Morocco or Romania – residents shrugged off the far-right’s efforts to disparage diversity. “Here everyone has their life and their world, but when we get to together we all get along,” said María Anguix García.At Villamalea’s town hall, officials are swift to cite the efforts many have made to foster integration, keenly aware that they’redoing so against a backdropof swirling disinformation about migration.“There was a day when people who practise Islam went to the church and got to know the prayer space and then they did the reverse; the Catholics went to the mosque and experienced it,” said the mayor “And around two months later, the five religions we have in Villamalea came together to pray in the church.”When the flood of media requests poured in earlier this year, most wanted to know how Núñez Pérez reconciled his stance with others in the conservative People’s party, particularly as the leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, wasincreasingly linkingimmigration to insecurity.View image in fullscreen‘I’m paid by the people of this town,’ says the mayor, José Núñez Pérez.Photograph: Pablo Garcia/The GuardianAcross the country, PP politicians have entered into governmentssupported bythe far-right, anti-immigrant Vox party. As a result, PP politicians have lurched further to the right, leading to motions such as the one recently seen in Jumilla, a town of about 27,000 residents, where the PP-led councilbacked a ban on religious gatheringsin public sports centres that appeared to target Muslims.Núñez Pérez bristled at the comparison. “I’ve always said that I’m not paid by my party, I’m paid by the people of this town,” he said. “In my party, as in all parties, there are differences of opinion. But if you look at the wider picture, we’re not that different.”It was, after all, the PP who had carried outmore regularisation programmes than any other partysince Spain returned to democracy.Others in the PP had also followed in Núñez Pérez’s footsteps; in late September, about 20 miles (32km) away in the town of Tarazona de la Mancha, a similar mix of councillors, though headed by a Socialist mayor, hadcome togetherto unanimously pass their own motion calling on the central government to grant papers to undocumented migrants.Even so, Núñez Pérez knew that the fact that he was a conservative mayor backing regularisation had become a “morbid” fascination for many. “But I think it’s the most natural thing; I know what happens in my town, we live quietly, we live in peace and we learn from each other,” he said. “In interviews they always ask me about my political party. But just because someone fires a shot over there, it doesn’t mean we’re all going to do the same.”Explore more on these topicsSpainMigrationEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

One species, theMadeiran large white(Pieris wollastoni) has now been declared extinct.“Beyond their beauty and cultural significance, pollinators like bees and butterflies are lifelines for our health, our food systems and our economies – sustaining the fruits, vegetables and seeds that nourish us,” said Grethel Aguilar, the IUCN director general. “The latest European red list assessments reveal serious challenges, with threats mounting for butterflies and crucial wild bee species.”The causes of the rapid recent declines are the continuing destruction or damage of habitats caused by agricultural intensification and land abandonment, draining wetlands, overgrazing by livestock, and the use of fertilisers and pesticides includingneonicotinoids. The fragmentation of pollinator-friendly habitat greatly increases the risk of local extinctions.Global heating is also revealed to be a major threat: 52% of all endangered butterflies in Europe are imperilled by the climate crisis – approximately twice as many as a decade ago.Up to 90% of flowering plants in Europe depend on animal pollination, according to Dr Denis Michez, lead coordinator of the wild bee assessment. “Sadly, wild bee populations are in drastic decline and cannot be easily replaced by managed colonies,” he said. “If wild bees disappear, many wild plants might be at risk too – of which flower-rich meadows and beautiful orchid species are just a few examples.”Fifteen species of bumblebee, which play a crucial role in pollinating peas, beans, peanuts and clover, and 14 species of cellophane bee, known for pollinating trees such as willows and red maples, are now classified as threatened.Simpanurgus phyllopodus, a mining bee unique to the continent and the only species of this genus in Europe, is now assessed as critically endangered – the scientific category closest to extinction in the wild.Butterflies that are only found on mountain tops are particularly vulnerable to global heating as they need to move uphill as their habitats become warmer but eventually run out of space. In southern Spain, theNevada graylingand theAndalusian anomalous blueare among more than 40% of European endemics (only found in Europe) threatened with extinction.In the Mediterranean, species such as the critically endangeredKarpathos graylingare imperilled by extremedrought and wildfires.Meanwhile, in the Arctic Circle, global heating is causing the tree line to move north by tens of metres each year, with scrub encroaching on bog and tundra. Warmer conditions also mean reindeer can no longer cross the ice to graze Arctic grasslands and keep them open. Eight butterfly species are threatened with extinction in this region, including Freyja’s fritillary and the Arctic ringlet.“The biggest habitat for all these pollinators is flower-rich grassland and that is disappearing very fast across Europe because of all these factors,” said Martin Warren, one of the lead coordinators of the butterflies assessment. “The positive thing is that so many people care now and there’s a lot more awareness. Under theEU nature restoration legislation, all member states have to reverse the decline in pollinators by 2030, and they are going to have to start doing something. There are landowners who are interested. Let’s hope they can get the incentives that will help them on their way.”According to Warren, there is “low-hanging fruit” in terms of action for pollinators which won’t reduce food production – and may enhance it – such as farmers creating flower-rich margins around their fields.Jessika Roswall, EU commissioner for environment, water resilience and a competitive circular economy, described the conservation status of wild bees, butterflies and other pollinators as “dire”.“Urgent and collective action is needed to tackle this threat. Together with member states, the European Commission has put in place an EU-wide monitoring system for pollinators based on the EU nature restoration regulation, which will help to track our progress. Now, we need to focus on implementation and cooperation with member states to protect our pollinators,” she said.The publication of the bee and butterfly assessments comes after the first Europe-wideassessment of hoverflies, another crucial pollinator group. Published in 2022, it revealed that 37% of all hoverfly species in Europe were threatened with extinction.Explore more on these topicsBeesExtinct wildlifeWildlifeInsectsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Some, such as the faded one on a roundabout leading to the centre of the southern Portuguese resort city, offer sun-bleached glimpses of enticing real estate, golden beaches and vibrant nightlife. Others that have sprung up before Sunday’s local elections peddle promises of a different kind.By far the most numerous are those belonging to the far-right Chega party. Its political posters feature one-line grievances about the state of public health, education and housing and tell passing drivers that all these problems will be solved once Chega is in charge.There is a good chance that disillusioned Albufeirans – in a city that has voted for the centre-right PSD for more than two decades – will help give Chega a historic night on Sunday. After leapfrogging the socialists to take second place inMay’s general election, Chega now hopes to leverage local-level frustrations to gain dozens of municipalities across the country and position itself for the same in the next general election.The Algarve sits at the very centre of the far-right’s strategy. Chega’s leader, André Ventura, aformer football punditand columnist who left the PSD to found the new party just six years ago, has called the region the “party’s stronghold” and the starting point of Portugal’s “conquest” by the far right.View image in fullscreenAndré Ventura campaigning in Sabugal, central Portugal.Photograph: Miguel A Lopes/EPAA recent poll for the Portuguese daily Diário de Notícias put Ventura’s party in the lead for the national vote for the first time. Its cocktail of populist policies, among them stricter controls on migration and chemical castration for paedophiles, have grabbed the attention of voters who are sick of a series of corruption scandals that have dogged the two main parties over recent years. Some believe Ventura may be on the fast track to becoming prime minister.“If in two months there’s a new political scandal and new snap elections, Chega would likely win the general elections,” said António Costa Pinto, a political scientist at Lisbon University’s Institute of Social Sciences.Chega voters in the Algarve argue that the party needs to use Sunday’s elections as a springboard for a nationwide takeover. Daniel Vicente, a 30-year-old barman from Albufeira, said: “I sincerely hope Chega wins. The Algarve is collapsing … Well,Portugalis collapsing.”Housing prices are Vicente’s biggest concern. The Algarve, which faces the same consequences of overtourism as other parts ofEurope, has the second highest housing costs in Portugal after Lisbon. Rental prices in Albufeira have risen by more than 16% in the last year alone.Vicente, repeating several of Chega’s talking points and misinformation, pointed the finger at the low-wage migrants who had come to the region.“Migrants who come here have everything going for them,” he said. “They share two-bedroom flats with 10 people. They pay little rent so they have money left. I don’t know what kind of support they receive but they must be receiving some support because they open up their own stores and you wonder how they did it.“I have to pay €800 (£696) for a flat and for everything else on a little more than the minimum wage [€870 a month]. No one gives me anything, and I don’t have enough money in the bank to ask for a loan to buy a house.”That resentment was Chega’s breeding ground. The party’s meteoric rise, boosted by three snap elections in the last three years and massively disproportionate media coverage, mostly lies in Ventura’s capacity to tap into people’s unexplored anger and use it to disrupt the political conversation.Miguel Carvalho, a journalist and author of the book Por Dentro do Chega (Inside Chega), said: “In 2019, Ventura went to places where politicians hadn’t been in years. He listened to people; he was their shoulder to cry on. And he promised he would shout for them whenever he could.“When he started making these statements, which people were ashamed to make in public, and when the media gave these statements a microphone and made Chega seem much bigger than it was, people started thinking they were also entitled to talk like that. They felt represented and Chega grew.”He said the party was “based around Ventura and it runs on his intuition. That was why it grew so much, so fast.”Gone were the days when Ventura had to chase Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain’s far-right Vox party, or Italy’s Matteo Salvini for a selfie, Carvalho said. “Now he’s the one who is invited. He travels to Spain and Hungary often. Bolsonaro supporters idolise him. Now he is their star.”The stark contrast between the Algarve’s image of a seaside paradise and the realities of daily life for many of its residents has made it a perfect target for Chega and an ideal laboratory for Portugal’s rapidly shifting politics. Albufeira has a population of 40,000 and attracts about half a million visitors annually.“Most of the economy is based on low wages, tourism, and migration associated with tourism,” said Costa Pinto. “These issues make people very sensitive to Chega’s message.”View image in fullscreenA view of Albufeira and the beach, one of Portugal’s most popular destinations.Photograph: Sohadiszno/Getty Images/iStockphotoNear the popular Praia da Oura beach, three tuk-tuk drivers waiting for passengers spoke affectionately about how Ventura had been the first politician to care about them.“Ventura puts the Portuguese people first,” said Filipe Serrão, 50, who prides himself on having been one of the very first Chega activists in Albufeira.Rodney Sudário, 38, a Brazilian driver who has been in Portugal for 18 years, said he would cast his ballot for Chega. He was not bothered by Ventura’s demonisation of migrants because he thinks the problems lie with those “from non-Christian cultures” – something that his colleague Tiago Filipe, 29, agreed with.“Chega is not against migrants, only those who don’t want to work,” Filipe said. “All migrants coming from south-east Asia are unqualified. And Muslims only want subsidies. They want to take over Europe – Islamise it.”Not everyone agrees. A few metres from the tuk-tuks’ parking spot, an Indian man who has been working in Albufeira for 10 years shook his head. He worried that a Chega win would make “everything more difficult” for him and others like him.“It’s puzzling to me how the Portuguese, who have emigrated everywhere, are against migration now,” he said. “It wasn’t like this before, but Chega talks and talks and promises everything – impossible things. If Ventura wins and ends up kicking all the migrants out, where will he find the people to work at restaurants and in agriculture?” the man said.For some, however, Sunday can’t come soon enough. “If Chega wins, we’ll take our flags and go in tuk-tuks parading around,” Filipe said. “It’s going to be a party. The Algarve is Chega’s kingdom. The rest of the country will follow.”Explore more on these topicsPortugalThe far rightEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

We still have a famine to fight and diseases are spreading, so we really need that scale-up to happen quickly and efficiently.”View image in fullscreenA child carries aid supplies in Khan Younis, Gaza, on 11 October.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAIngram said Unicef was calling for all crossings from Israel into Gaza to be reopened, so that trucks were able to move through quickly “without delays or impediments”.Another UN aid agency, Unrwa, said it had enough stored food to feed every Palestinian in Gaza for three months. Its communications director, Juliette Touma, said on Saturday that the distribution of aid was “absolutely critical in controlling the spread of famine”.Tens of thousands of tonnes of supplies are positioned in neighbouring countries such as Jordan and Egypt. Underthe terms of the first phase of the deal, aid is meant to surge into Gaza, and humanitarian groups are preparing to send in about 600 truckloads of food and medical supplies a day.During the war, Israel shut down entry and exit routes, largely blocking off food and medicine, which in turn caused afamine in large parts of Gaza.Aid agencies are hoping Israel will now stick toTrump’s 20-point plan, which said the entry and distribution of aid in the Gaza Strip should “proceed without interference”.Famine deaths in gaza graphicOn Saturday, the Italian defence minister said the Rafah crossing, a crucial movement point between Gaza and Egypt for aid trucks but also people, will reopen on Tuesday. Israel took control of the border post last year.Rafah “will be opened alternately in two directions: exit towards Egypt and entry towards Gaza”, Guido Crosetto said.With the UN returning to a lead role in humanitarian assistance, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US- and Israeli-backed private contractor scheme, appeared to be winding down. The programme was widely condemned as it forced people towards food distribution sites where theywere shot in large numbersby the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). One UN official called it a “sadistic death trap”.View image in fullscreenPalestinians take aid supplies from a truck which arrived in the southern Gaza Strip on 11 October.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAThe truce is hoped to halt the famine, bring the release of hundreds of detained people and end daily Israeli bombings that often wiped out whole families. On Friday, tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians in Gazabegan to return to the ruins of their homesafter the Israeli troops withdrew to new, agreed-upon positions. According to Gaza’s civil defence agency, more than 500,000 people have returned to Gaza City since the ceasefire.Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Gaza early Saturday to observe the Israeli military redeployment, Israeli Army Radio reported, citing a security source.Still, there are concerns that the deal could break down unless pressure is kept up.‘Everyone is still afraid’: ceasefire deal brings relief to Gaza but fears remain over futureRead morePrevious ceasefires have failed, and an Israeli attack onLebanonearly on Saturday led to fears of fresh violence during a tense period. The pre-dawn airstrikes struck a building that sold construction vehicles and killed one person and wounded seven others, the Lebanese health ministry said.Israel’s military claimed it had struck a place where machinery was stored to be used to rebuild infrastructure for the militant group Hezbollah.The US-led agreement reached this week aims to end the current war in stages, delaying big issues such as the disarmament ofHamasand a clause that commits Israel to “not occupy” Gaza.According to the agreement, Hamas is obliged to release all Israeli hostages from Gaza within 72 hours of the ceasefire starting, meaning Monday morning. Israel will free 250 Palestinians serving long sentences in its prisons and 1,700 other Palestinians captured during the war and held without charge.View image in fullscreenA woman carries aid from a truck that arrived in Khan Younis on 11 October.Photograph: Haitham Imad/EPAIsrael’s prison service said on Saturday it had begun transferring prisoners from several detention facilities to two jails ahead of their release.A list published by the Israeli government’s official website on Friday excluded the names of several high-profile Palestinian prisoners, including the popular politician Marwan Barghouti.Supporters of the 66-year-old sayIsrael fears his ability to force effective change and unify Palestinians, many of whom see him as a Nelson Mandela-style figure.Mousa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, told the Al Jazeera TV network that the group insists on the release of Barghouti and other high-profile figures and that it was in discussions with mediators.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestineUnited NationsAidIsraelHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

The organization also noted that the supreme court is expected to hear arguments on 23 October, “after more than a year in which the state has been allowed to delay its response”.Since 7 October 2023, Israel has prevented international journalists from enteringGazaand reporting on the war, with the few allowed in under strict military supervision on guided tours arranged by the Israel Defense Forces.Brothers, cousins, sons: the human stories behind four of the war’s fallen journalistsRead moreThe international media has relied on Palestinian journalists and media workers in Gaza, and contact with individual Palestinian civilians, aid agency staff and medical workers. But Palestinian journalists and media workers are the most at risk in the world, with 197 killed by Israeli attacks in the past two years, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).Among those most recently killed were Mariam Dagga, who worked for the Associated Press and Independent Arabia and waskilled in an Israeli strike on Nasser hospital in Khan Younis on 25 August, and Reuters journalistHussam al-Masri, who was killed in the same attack.Israel carried out 25 targeted killings of journalists in that period, the CPJ said, describing them as murders.Israel has consistently denied that it deliberately targeted journalists in its strikes, but its military has also acknowledged killing reporters, including Al Jazeera’s Anas al-Sharif, whom the IDF described, without evidence as “the head of a terrorist cell”.A UN rapporteur on Friday said an Israeli attack in southern Lebanon on 13 October 2023 that killed Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah and wounded six others, including two AFP journalists,was a war crime. Morris Tidball-Binz, the rapporteur, described it as “a premeditated, targeted and double-tapped attack” that violated international humanitarian law.The FPA joined numerous international organizations that have demanded press access throughout the years of war. In July 2025, major news agencies including AFP, AP, BBC and Reuters releaseda joint statementemphasizing the importance of international media access for accurate reporting, and the July prior CPJ and more than 70 media and civil society organizationsurged Israelto grant independent access to international journalists.In February 2024, more than 30 news organizations, including the Guardian,signed a letterdemanding protection for Gaza journalists.This week, the Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association (AMEJA)posted a statementcalling for Israel to release detained American reporter Emily Wilder, who had been on a flotilla for media workers, healthcare workers and human rights defenders called Conscience traveling into Gaza.Explore more on these topicsPress freedomIsrael-Gaza warNewspapers & magazinesGazaPalestineIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They claimed to have seized two Pakistani border posts in the southern province of Helmand, which was confirmed by local authorities.Pakistani security officials acknowledged clashes at several border locations, stating they were responding forcefully. “Tonight, Taliban forces began firing at several border points. We retaliated with artillery at four locations along the border,” a Pakistani government official told the Guardian.“We will not tolerate any aggression from the Afghan Taliban within our territory. Pakistani forces responded with heavy fire, effectively targeting several Afghan border posts,” the official added.The Pakistan army used artillery, tanks and both light and heavy weaponry in their counterattacks.On Thursday, two explosions were reported in the Afghan capital and another in southeastern Afghanistan. The Taliban-run defence ministry subsequently accused Pakistan of “violating its sovereignty” in connection with the attacks.Analysts said recent days showed just how deep the border tensions run.Michael Kugelman, a South Asia analyst based in Washington DC, said: “Intensifying cross-border attacks on Pakistani forces, unusually intense Pakistani strikes in Afghanistan, and Taliban retaliations have created a perfect storm for trouble. If you throw in the fact that Afghanistan doesn’t recognise the border, as well as the proliferation of disinformation about the crisis, it all makes for a precarious situation.”Islamabad has expressed growing impatience with Kabul, refraining from confirming or denying involvement in the airstrikes.While Islamabad has not explicitly claimed responsibility for the attacks, it has called on Kabul to cease harbouring the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which is accused of killing hundreds of Pakistani soldiers since 2021 and is believed to have received combat training in Afghanistan, sharing ideological ties with the Afghan Taliban.“Fortunately this crisis, serious as it is, is poised to de-escalate sooner rather than later. The Taliban lack the capacity to fight the Pakistani military head-on, and once the retaliations appease public anger, they’re likely to recede,” said Kugelman.Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military spokesperson, acknowledged reports of the strikes, and said: “To protect the lives of the people of Pakistan, we are doing, and will continue to do, whatever is necessary.” He urged Afghanistan to prevent its territory from being used for terrorism against Pakistan.Imtiaz Gul, a security analyst based in Islamabad, said: “I think what we have seen in these few hours is a logical conclusion of the tensions that had been brewing up between the two countries, particularly after the kinetic attacks on TTP hideouts and the continuous refusal of the Afghan regime to take demonstrable conclusive action against the TTP, which is spearheading the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.”Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have been strained in recent months due to Islamabad’s accusations that Kabul is harbouring TTP, which carried out attacks on Pakistan.Kugelman believes for Pakistan “the risk is that its recent strikes in Afghanistan will galvanise TTP to carry out reprisals, which could invite further and perhaps more intense Pakistani operations in Afghanistan.” He said: “And then the cycle could play out again. There are no winners or easy long-term solutions here.“If we see de-escalation now, we’re nowhere near being out of the woods.”The two countries share a nearly 2,600km (1,600 miles) rugged and mountainous border known as the Durand Line.Gul said: “I think Pakistan’s patience had been wearing thin. And that’s why they basically decided to take direct action themselves against TTP leaders. And now, obviously, the Taliban would say that it was a retaliatory attack, retaliatory action.”Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanPakistanSouth and central AsiaTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

Like thousands of other young people, he had taken to the streets of the capital last month toprotest against corruptionand a draconian ban on social media.He had no idea that day in Kathmandu would escalate into what is now described as Nepal’s gen Z revolution, which saw thetoppling of the governmentwithin a day, the dissolution of parliament and appointment of a new interim prime minister, the anti-corruption hardliner Sushila Karki, by the end of the week.Bohora was outside the parliament building in Kathmandu on the morning of 8 September when he heard the sound of gunfire and felt pain in his left leg. As his friend carried him to the nearby hospital, his bloodied trainer was left behind amid the pandemonium. A photograph of the shoe later went viral, an evocative symbol of the deadliest day of protest in Nepal’s history, with 19 protesters killed.View image in fullscreenDemonstrators outside Nepal’s parliament building on 8 September. They had gathered to protest against corruption and a draconian ban on social media.Photograph: Prabin Ranabhat/AFP/Getty ImagesOne month on, Bohora is still in hospital as doctors fight to save his leg. Sitting in the trauma ward, he expressed frustration at the what he saw as the slow pace of change for Nepal since the gen Z uprising, for which he paid such a heavy price.From Colombo to Kathmandu, the furious youth movements toppling entrenched elitesRead moreHe was among those calling for the former prime minister KP Sharma Oli and the former home minister Ramesh Lekhak to be arrested for alleged corruption and their role in the shooting of protesters by police on 8 September. “It’s been a month since the movement began, yet many of our demands remain unmet,” Bohora said.Bohora had had been driven to protest in anger at a system that seemed to be making the politicians and their children wildly rich while he had faced unemployment and exploitation.Despite qualifying as a health assistant eight years ago, there was no work for Bohora in Nepal’s struggling job market and he eventually travelled to Russia for further studies. But after running out of money, he found himselfcoerced into joining the Russian army, fighting on the frontlines in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk. He saw friends killed and maimed. He finally escaped back to Nepal 18 months later.“I was lucky to return home alive,” Bohora said. “After coming back, I took to the streets hoping for a better country, free from corruption.”Many of the young people who took to the streets on 8 September say they simply wanted to raise their voice against corruption and never intended to bring about wholesale regime change – let alone be tasked with deciding the next prime minister and future of the country.Their movement hadno single leader, no manifesto and no singular set of demands, and still largely remains that way. Even the decision to champion Karki, a former chief justice, as their choice of interim prime minister came after she emerged as a favourite in online discussions and polls held by thousands of gen Z protesters on the social media platform Discord.View image in fullscreenNepal’s new interim prime minister, Sushila Karki, is an anti-corruption hardliner. The legitimacy of her government has been questioned by the country’s biggest political parties.Photograph: Monika Malla/ReutersWith elections promised for March, Karki is under mounting pressure from gen Z groups to demonstrate that she will crack down on corruption as promised. Yet major bureaucratic obstacles remain in implementing large-scale reform, and the lack of any high-profile arrests of former ministers from Oli’s government is a growing bone of contention.“Right now, our main demand is to control corruption,” said Amit Khanal, 24, of the Gen-Z Movement Alliance. While there are no gen Z figures appointed to Karki’s cabinet yet, Khanal said they remained in close talks with the government.“This government was formed under special circumstances, and it must investigate the major corruption scandals, especially those involving former top leaders,” he said. “If no investigation is carried out, the entire purpose of this massive movement will be meaningless.”Om Prakash Aryal, whom Karki appointed as home minister, said one of the interim government’s first moves had been to “remove the obstructions and disconnect the political links” that had prevented the most powerful political figures from being investigated for corruption.“The environment is being created so the commission can accept complaints about anyone and investigate,” Aryal said. He emphasised that it would take time for authorities to carry out a full independent investigation into the decades of alleged graft, but added: “At the same time, there are things that must be acted on immediately. The government will not let impunity have room.”In the backdrop are growing efforts by Nepal’s biggest political parties – Nepali Congress, the Communists and the Maoists – to question the legitimacy of Karki’s interim government. After parliament was dissolved, all three parties released statements calling the move unconstitutional and dangerous. In a notable break from tradition, none attended Karki’s swearing-in ceremony.‘This is our revolution. It’s our turn now’: Nepal’s ‘gen Z protesters’ speak out against corruptionRead moreIn an inflammatory speech this week, Oli accused Karki and the gen Z protesters of ulterior motives. “There is an attack on this country,” he said. “There is an attack on the sovereign power of this country. There is an attack on its territory. There is an attack on the country’s interests.”Analysts warned that the gulf between the interim government and the political parties could spell bad news for Nepal’s political stability and the success of its elections in March.Lok Raj Baral, a professor of political science and former ambassador to India, said that rather than casting blame, the gen Z uprising should be a moment of reckoning for Nepal’s political old guard.“This is an opportunity for old parties to correct themselves, to transfer leadership, to renew and regain their credibility,” he said. “The old leaders were busy fighting for their chairs. They should have now learned their lesson.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

I will not respond well to that nonsense,” she added to audience laughter.Adichie and her husband, Ivara Esege, have three children: a 10-year-old daughter, and twin sons age one and a half.The boys are “going to grow up in a world that’s quite different from the world which I grew up in, and my husband grew up in”, she said. “I think they’re fortunate to have a good father. But sometimes I think: do we have what it takes to make sure that they turn out right?

She added that “we should talk more about boys and men. It’s important. Because boysarestruggling”.Adichie appeared at the festival to collect the Sunday Times award for literary excellence, and was presented with a first edition copy of Chinua Achebe’s novel Arrow of God, which she described as his “greatest novel”. She then discussed her latest novel, Dream Count, with the Times literary critic Johanna Thomas-Corr.While Adichie spoke extensively about feminism, she did not address the backlash she has faced in recent years for her views on trans women. The criticism began in 2017 after an interview on Channel 4 in which she said that “when people talk about, you know, ‘Are trans women women?’, my feeling is that trans women are trans women”. In aninterview with the Guardianin February this year, she did not answer questions on the topic, only coming close to the subject at a later point in the interview: “What do I want to say about cancel culture? Cancel culture is bad. We should stop it. End of story.”Asked in Cheltenham what women should be doing about issues such as the rollback of reproductive rights in the US, Adichie said: “Women have really done everything they should. I want to talk about what men should be doing.“In general, women will listen to women and men, men will listen to men. So I think we need to recruit some good men to go out there and talk to other men.”Explore more on these topicsChimamanda Ngozi AdichieCheltenham literature festivalMennewsShareReuse this content"

A man aged 48 was found with serious injuries. Despite medical attention he was pronounced dead at the scene.“Two men aged 25 and 43 have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are currently in police custody.”He was attacked with a knife by another inmate on Saturday morning, sources confirmed to the PA news agency.A Prison Service spokesperson said they could not comment while the police investigate.Watkins waspreviously stabbed in an incident at the same prison in 2023, suffering non-life-threatening injuries after he was reportedly taken hostage by three other inmates before being freed by prison officers six hours later.When sentenced at Cardiff crown court, the singer was told he was being given an extended sentence – and a judge said his crimes “plumbed new depths of depravity”.After being caught with a mobile phone behind bars in 2019, he told a court that he was locked up with “murderers, mass murderers, rapists, paedophiles, serial killers – the worst of the worst”.PA Media contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Depute leader Keith Brown, who seconded the motion, told delegates: “The only way we can achieve independence is to ask a clear question and get a clear answer.”This call to clarity is key: while independence is not high on the list of voters’ priorities, activists have unhappy memories of trying to explain what many believed was a fatally muddled independence strategy on the doorstep for the general election last year, where the SNP was humiliated by the resurgent Labour party, losing 38 of its 48 Westminster seats.A year on, the party’s pivot to its core message is a mark of renewed confidence, with the SNP once again leading the polls ahead of Scottish Labour and Reform UK, and an understanding that the battleground demographic for the coming campaign is made up of those “soft yes” independence supporters who have drifted away from the party.Speaking for the de facto amendment, veteran activist Graeme McCormick insisted that it was not proposed by “romantic nationalists”. He warned that the SNP was being “hollowed out” because it had failed to inspire its membership with a date for another referendum.The former MP Tommy Sheppard said it was “remarkable” that such a large conference was able to have such a detailed discussion in public and in front of the media, but insisted there were “no quick fixes”. “We have been chasing the next election for too long,” he said, arguing that the party needed a strategy to take it into the 2030s and deepen support for independence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stalls sold keffiyehs and people handed out placards that read “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, “it’s not a crime to act against genocide” and “Starmer has blood on his hands, free Palestine”.Ben Jamal, the director of the campaign group, said the march went ahead, despite a ceasefire coming into effect, because the “plan that has been laid out by Donald Trump is not a plan for enduring peace”.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Yui Mok/PAHe said the plan said “nothing about the root causes of violence” nor anything “about the system of apartheid” in Palestine or the “right to self-determination” for Palestinians. He added that the group’s campaigning and protesting would not end “until the Palestinian people are finally free”.This is the 32nd national demonstration in support of Palestine since October 2023, according to PSC.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joanna Chan/APA counter-protest by the Jewish-led Stop the Hate group was expected to take place at the junction of Aldwych and the Strand, with police putting measures in place to try to prevent any clashes between the two groups.Scotland Yard said it had imposed conditions on both demonstrations under the Public Order Act to “prevent serious disruption” and had set out specific areas where protesters could gather, as well as a march route.Last weekend, the government announced that police would be given greater powers to restrict protests by allowing them to consider the “cumulative impact” of repeated demonstrations.The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, called for pro-Palestine protests scheduled to take place last weekend to be cancelled or postponed after a terrorist attack on a synagogue in Manchester in which two people were killed.On Wednesday, while on a trade mission in India, Keir Starmer saidprotest laws, including chants, were being reviewed by the government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jamal said: “For two years we have seen Israel commit a no-holds-barred genocide with the political and military support of successive UK governments.“In response, a community of resistance in this country has responded with an historic show of solidarity – actively and intensively campaigning, day in day out, to demand politicians, public bodies and corporations end their complicity with Israel’s crimes.“This is a movement supported by millions of people in this country andaround the worldwho want freedom and justice for Palestine.”As the march takes place, displaced Palestinians have started theirjourneys back to the ruins of their homesin Gaza.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warProtestLondonGazaIsraelPalestineFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

Just over a year earlier he had resigned from governmenta second time amid controversy.He had described Epstein to Powell as “safe” and a “friend” in an email before the meeting.Powell is now Keir Starmer’s national security adviser. His role has been questioned in thecollapse of a Chinese spying case.Tony Blair and Nick Clegg hosted dinner giving tech bosses access to UK ministerRead moreAccording to papers released to the BBC, a briefing memo by the senior civil servant Matthew Rycroft described Epstein as a friend of Mandelson and the then US president Bill Clinton, as well as being close toPrince Andrew, the Duke of York.A spokesperson for Blair said the meeting was “long before his [Epstein’s] crimes were known of and his subsequent conviction”.A government spokesperson said Powell had only forwarded the request in his role as chief of staff.Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. He died in prison in 2019.The release of the documents had been blocked by government officials over concerns it may affect UK-US relations. However, the National Archives has now released the document as a result of a freedom of information request.The BBCreported that an email from Mandelson to Powella week before the meeting said: “Do you remember when Clinton saw TB [Tony Blair] he said he wanted to introduce his travelling friend, Jeffrey Epstein, to TB?“This was frustrated – TB said at the time – in the office for reasons (he says) he was unclear about. I think TB would be interested in meeting Jeffrey, who is also a friend of mine, because Jeffrey is an active scientific catalyst/entrepreneur as well as someone who has his finger on the pulse of many worldwide markets and currencies.“He is young and vibrant. He is safe (whatever that means) and Clinton is now doing a lot of travelling with him.”Mandelson went on: “I mentioned to TB that Jeffrey is in London next week and he said he would like to meet him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Can you let me know?”A later briefing by Rycroft – who went on to serve as permanent secretary at the Home Office until 2025 – on the day of the meeting said about Epstein: “He is a financial adviser to the super-rich and a property developer. He is a friend of Bill Clinton andPeter Mandelson.”He added: “The background on Epstein is that he is very rich and close to the Duke of York.”He continued: “Peter says that Epstein now travels with Clinton and Clinton wants you to meet him.”A spokesperson for Blair said: “As far as he can remember, Mr Blair met with him for less than 30 minutes in Downing Street in 2002 and discussed US and UK politics.“He never met or engaged with him subsequently.

A local resident filming the incident asks her name while she is face down on the street being handcuffed.“Debbie Brockman,” she replies. “I work for WGN. Please let them know.”In another video, onlookers shout at the agents and call them “fascists”, telling them to “get out of our neighborhood, get out of our city”. The agents get in the van and scrape the side of another car, whose driver is still inside, as they speed off, tearing off part of its bumper.A homeland security official said Brockman stood accused of assaulting a federal law enforcement officer by throwing objects at a vehicle.The incident took place in Chicago’s Lincoln Square neighborhood, as immigration agents – at the behest ofTrump officials– have been scouring the city for people to deport.The ramped-up immigration enforcement inChicagohas been met with protests.Local resident Nancy Molden told the Chicago Sun-Times that “it was absolutely horrifying” to see Brockman’s arrest in person.“That was the most frightening thing I have seen in Chicago, living here 20-odd years,” Molden said.Witnesses told local media the agents were targeting a small group of landscapers, though that was not immediately confirmed. A second person, a man, also appeared to have been detained.In one video, the man can be seen handcuffed in the back of the vehicle while Brockman is being arrested. The person filming asks him in Spanish for his name.Tricia McLaughlin of the homeland security department said: “US border patrol was conducting immigration enforcement operations and when several violent agitators used their vehicles to block in agents in an effort to impede and assault federal officers.“In fear of public safety and of law enforcement, officers used their service vehicle to strike a suspect’s vehicle and create an opening. As agents were driving, Deborah Brockman, a US citizen, threw objects at border patrol’s car, and she was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer.”WGNsaidthat border patrol had released the employee from federal custody as of 3pm on Friday, and no charges have been filed in her case. The network is still in the process of searching for and obtaining video showing the moment leading up to the employee’s detainment.Brockman’s arrest came days after prosecutors were forced to drop charges against anti-Ice protesters accused of assaulting federal agents while carrying weapons outside a Chicago immigration detention facility – with the move coming after grand jurors refused to hand down an indictment in the case.On Thursday, a federal judge in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order blocking federal agents from using certain forceful tactics to suppress protests or to impede journalists from covering those protests.The order restricts federal officials from arresting, threatening to arrest or deploying physical force against journalists unless authorities have established probable cause to believe the journalists have committed a crime.Explore more on these topicsChicagoUS immigrationPress freedomNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

A federal judge late Thursday ordered Ice to remove an 8ft-tall (2.4 meters) fence outside the Broadview facility after the Village of Broadview said it illegally blocks a public street.Both senators spoke to the local NBC News affiliate while there and have pushed for answers and called for oversight into the conditions inside the facility.“We just want to go in and look at the facility and see what the conditions are and they would not let us in. It is shameful,” Duckworth said.“They’ve refused to tell us this information,” Durbin stated. “I’ve done this job for a few years now, I’ve never had this stonewalling by any presidential administration.”“What are you afraid of?” Duckworth said to reporters, referring to the government. “You don’t hide, you don’t run away when you’re proud of what you’re doing.”The senators said they have congressional oversight authority.“Something is going on in there they don’t want us to see,” Durbin said. “I don’t know what it is.”To the south, inTennessee, at least nine armed guard members began their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the Pyramid, a Memphis landmark, about a mile (1.6km) from historic Beale Street and FedExForum, where the NBA’s Grizzlies play.View image in fullscreenMembers of the national guard patrol on 11 October 2025 in Memphis.Photograph: Brett Carlsen/Getty ImagesThey also were at a nearby tourist welcome center along the Mississippi River. Wearing guard fatigues and protective vests labeled “military police”, the troops were escorted by a local police officer and posed for photos with visitors.Trump has sent or discussed sending troops to other cities as well, including Baltimore; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The federal government says the troops support immigration agents and protect federal property.The guard troops inMemphisremain under the command of the Republican governor, Bill Lee, who supports their use to further a federal crackdown on crime.By contrast, Trump has attempted to deploy national guard troops – including some from Texas and California – in Portland and Chicago after taking control of them himself, over objections from state and local leaders who say such interference violates their sovereignty and federal law. Federal courts in Illinois and Oregon this week blocked Trump’s efforts to send troops out in those cities.The US district judge April Perry in Chicago said theTrump administrationhad violated the 10th amendment, which grants certain powers to states, and the 14th amendment, which assures due process and equal protection, when he ordered national guard troops to that city.In a written order Friday explaining her rationale, Perry noted the nation’s long aversion to having military involvement in domestic policing.“Not even the Founding Father most ardently in favor of a strong federal government” – referring to Alexander Hamilton – “believed that one state’s militia could be sent to another state for the purposes of political retribution,” Perry wrote.“The court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said.An earlier court battle in Oregon delayed a similar troop deployment to Portland. The 9th US circuit court of appeals heard arguments in that case Thursday.Lt Cmdr Teresa Meadows, a spokesperson for US northern command, said the troops sent to Portland and Chicago are “not conducting any operational activities at this time”.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationChicagoMemphisIllinoisTennesseeUS CongressUS SenatenewsShareReuse this content"

The radical left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.”Democrats refuse to fold over shutdown as Republican outrage buildsRead moreThe recent federal governmentshutdownbegan on 1 October and is the first since a 35-day closure that happened in December 2018 and extended into the new year during Trump’s first presidential term. The shutdown came as Democrats were looking to regain their footing with voters, who re-elected Trump last year and relegated them to the minority in both chambers of Congress.More than 1.3 millionmilitarypersonnel across the country would not have received their first post-shutdown paychecks this month, only getting paid for the 21-30 September period. Anestimated750,000 federal employees have also beenfurloughed.As the Hillreported, however, federal workers are generally paid once a shutdown ends, whether they are furloughed or working. After the last shutdown in 2018, Congress wrote into law that federal workers must be paid once the government reopens.OnThursday, the US Senate remained deadlocked on legislation to end the shutdown, even as Trump repeated his threat to make Democrats pay for the funding lapse that has closed federal agencies and furloughed employees across the nation.Speaking to Punchbowl News, the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, expressed confidence in the strategy,saying: “Every day gets better for us.”The White Houseannouncedthe layoffs of federal workers on Friday, following through with a threat it made to initiate the mass firings of government employees.Adocument filed with a federal courton Friday evening revealed that hundreds of layoffs took place across the executive branch, including about 315 at the Department of Commerce, 466 at the Department of Education and 187 at the Department of Energy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The initial toll had been believed to be 19 people but that figure was later revised.The Humphreys county sheriff, Chris Davis, spoke to the public and media early on Saturday afternoon and revealed that authorities were assuming that anybody who was inside the building that exploded the day before was dead.View image in fullscreenSatellite imagery of Accurate Energetic Systems in McEwen, Tennessee, on 3 April 2021 (top), and on 10 October 2025 (bottom).Photograph: Vantor/AFP/Getty ImagesDavis said the tragedy was even “more devastating” than had been thought. In the close-knit community, he and other members of law enforcement and many in the community know people who were victims of the disaster.The blast was felt for miles as it leveled a building at the 1,300-acre headquarters of Accurate Energetic Systems (AES), which is located in the tiny community of Bucksnort, just south of McEwen, about an hour’s drive west of Nashville.“More than 300 people have been through almost every square inch of this facility, and at this time, we’ve recovered no survivors,” an emotional Davis told reporters early on Saturday afternoon. “It’s a great loss to our communities.”Officials did not offer a precise death toll but have previously said 18 people were unaccounted for. Davis confirmed the operation had shifted from rescue to recovery and that investigators would use DNA testing to confirm the identities of those who are assumed to have died.Investigators, including agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were still working to determine the cause of the explosion, officials said.The presence of explosives and other ordnance at the property has made searching the scene complicated. Initially, first responders were not able to get close to the scene of devastation because of secondary explosions.In a statement on Friday, the company thanked first responders but did not indicate a possible cause.View image in fullscreenHumphreys county sheriff Chris Davis tells reporters no survivors were recovered from the blast, in Bucksnort, Tennessee, on Saturday.Photograph: Obed Lamy/AP“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families, coworkers and community members affected by this incident,” the company said.AES develops, manufactures and stores explosives for “military, aerospace and commercial demolition markets”, according to the company’s website.

And every Friday, I’m just like, now what?” Xavier told the Guardian.Though headline after headline has highlighted the Trump administration’scrackdownon undocumented immigrants, Xavier said many Americans don’t realize the heightened uncertainty legal immigrants are facing – something that immigration attorneys like herself have to confront every day.“The perpetual fear that undocumented immigrants have dealt with their entire lives is now spread across the whole immigration system,” Xavier said. “This is something new, I think. This is something that a lot of people don’t understand.”Trump revives family separations amid drive to deport millions: ‘A tactic to punish’Read moreCracks and fissures have existed within the legal immigration system for years, long before Trump came into office. The last time Congress passed comprehensive immigration reform was 1986. In the nearly four decades since, those trying to immigrate legally often face ambiguous standards, outdated quotes and backlogs, along with other issues that appear administrative but can have a huge impact on a person’s ability to stay in the country.The difference seen over a generation is stark. “Even for people who have been through the immigration system, they’re like, ‘Oh, 30 years ago, I just came with a suitcase from Canada and I got my green card in three months’. It’s not like that any more,” Xavier said.The pathway to becoming a legal immigrant in the US is a narrow one. A person can get legal status through family – if a spouse, child or parent is a citizen – or through their employer, like H-1B holders, or through extraordinary talent. Though the US has offered legal status for humanitarian purposes, for asylum or refugees, the White House has dramatically cut down on these humanitarian pathways.TheTrump administrationhas emphasizedthat its crackdown on immigration is targeted toward removing undocumented immigrants from the country.“Ramped-up immigration enforcement targeting the worst of the worst is removing more and more criminal illegal aliens off our streets every day and is sending a clear message to anyone else in this country illegally: self-deport or we will arrest you,” assistant secretary for homeland security, Tricia McLaughlin, said in astatementlast month.But the administration is reportedly trying to cut down on legal immigration too. A recent Reutersreportsaid the White House is planning to cut the number of refugees the US takes in from 125,000 down to 7,500, with the majority of slots reserved for white South Africans.The administration also seems to becombing throughthe records of immigrants, including green card holders, for potential violations that weren’t considered deportable before his term. In September, an Irish green card holder living in Missouri wasdetainedat an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in Kentucky because she wrote a bad check for $25 in 2015.Immigration attorneys like Xavier, who works solely with immigrants who have gone through the process legally, have seen how the ongoing scrutiny has had a chilling effect on legal immigrants who have lived in and even started families in the US.Hanging over the head of many of these immigrants is the threat of losing their legal status, even temporarily, because of what Xavier calls “operational inefficiencies”: ambiguousdelays and unclear communication about applications have left lawyers scrambling to keep their clients’ legal status.Processing delays have been a major stress for Xavier’s clients, and can often leave legal immigrants in limbo. Lawyers don’t know when their client will hear back on an application, which can sometimes leave them stuck in the country.One client with a pending green card application applied for “advance parole”, which would allow her to leave the US and legally re-enter even as her green card application is under review. Because her father was undergoing quadruple bypass surgery, she applied for an expedited advanced parole to be with him after the procedure. But, “they still denied the emergency advanced parole,” Xavier said, so she couldn’t travel back home for his surgery.Xavier has also seen clients who have been living in the US for years and have had multiple visas get “soft denials” for renewals, meaning an application has been put on hold pending further documentary and scrutiny.Complicating the process for visa applicants is that the renewal process requires communication between two branches of the federal government: US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which is under the Department of Homeland Security, and the consulate of their home country, which falls under the Department of State. Lawyers have said there can often be a lack of communication between the two that causes delays.Delays on application decisions can outlast certain “grace periods” the federal government gives to applicants for certain visas that allow them to legally stay in the country while they await renewal. This puts them at risk of being taken into custody or put into court proceedings when the grace period is up.Trump administration to offer unaccompanied minors $2,500 to self-deport, memo revealsRead moreThe Trump administration also recentlygaveUSCIS special agents law enforcement powers, including the ability to make arrests and execute search and arrest warrants, powers that the ACLU hassaidhas never been given to the agency and is a way to “systematically restrict legal immigration and strip people of their legal status”.The added stresses and uncertainty has taken a heavy toll on both immigrants and their employers.“We hear about the erosion of legal immigrant pathways impacting Silicon Valley, but also innovative startups, it’s fashion designers who are using sustainable efforts, it’s architects. There are so many different industries that are impacted here,” Xavier said.Though the changes in immigration enforcement may seem insignificant for legal immigrants, the impact has been huge..“They seem little, they seem incremental, but it’s been a long time coming. It’s been built into the system, and now they are coming at lightning speed, often in different areas and under the radar of the mainstream public, that when taken together they are overwhelmingly detrimental,” Xavier said. “In Spanish, we have a saying that goesla gota que derramó el vaso– it’s the last drop that made the glass overflow. You have these little drops, but they’re coming, and by the time you know it, you’re flooded.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Asked at a press conference before Vought’s announcement why no layoffs had occurred, the top Senate Republican, John Thune, signaled they would happen soon.“The White House has now for 10 days laid off doing anything in hopes that enough SenateDemocratswould come to their senses and do the right thing and fund the government,” he said.View image in fullscreenCommuters near the Federal Triangle metro station at the William Jefferson Clinton federal building in Washington DC on 2 October 2025.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images“My expectation is, yes, they’re going to start making some decisions about how to move money around, which agencies and departments are going to be impacted, which programs are going to be impacted, which employees are going to be impacted. That’s what a shutdown does.”The AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US,respondedto Vought’s post on Friday, saying: “America’s unions will see you in court.”Last week, the AFGE and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed for a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from carrying out any reductions in force (RIFs) during the shutdown. The unions filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order on Friday, following Vought’s post.Lee Saunders, president of the AFSCME, said: “These mass firings are illegal and will have devastating effects on the services millions of Americans rely on every day. Whether it’s food inspectors, public safety workers, or the countless other public service workers who keep America running, federal employees should not be bargaining chips in this administration’s political games.“By illegally firing these workers, the administration isn’t just targeting federal employees, it’s hurting their families and the communities they serve every day. We will pursue every available legal avenue to stop this administration’s unlawful attacks on public service workers’ freedoms and jobs.”CongressionalDemocratshave refused to vote for a Republican-backed bill to restore funding unless it includes an array of healthcare-centered concessions. After holding seven unsuccessful votes on the parties’ spending bills, the Senate’sRepublicanleaders have put the chamber in recess until next Tuesday, meaning the standoff is unlikely to be resolved before then.The layoffs came on the same day government employees received only a partial paycheck covering the final days of September but not the beginning of October, since appropriations lapsed at the start of the month.At a Friday-morning press conference, the Republican House speaker,Mike Johnson, blasted Senate Democrats for not supporting the GOP’s bill, which passed his chamber on a near party-line vote.If the government is not reopened by next Wednesday, US military personnel are set to miss a paycheck.“This is the last paycheck that 700,000 federal workers will see until Washington Democrats decide to do their job and reopen the government,” Johnson said.View image in fullscreenMaintenance workers just after midnight at the US Capitol on 1 October 2025 in Washington DC.Photograph: Kent Nishimura/Getty Images“Starting next week, American service members, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck, are going to miss a full paycheck. If Democrats don’t end this shutdown by Monday, then that October 15 date will pass us by.”Johnson has kept the House out of session throughout the shutdown in an effort to pressure Senate Democrats into supporting the Republican funding proposal. Earlier this week, a group of House Democrats sent the speaker a letter asking him to allow a vote on legislation that would ensure US troops get paid during a shutdown, but Johnson has refused to bring lawmakers back to Washington.The Senate has become a chokepoint in the funding battle because any legislation needs at least 60 votes to advance in the chamber. In exchange for their support, Democratic senators are demanding that premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act health plans be extended beyond their end-of-the-year expiration date.They are also seeking safeguards against Donald Trump’srescissionsof congressionally approved funding, a restoration ofmoney for public mediaoutlets and an undoing of cuts to theMedicaidhealthcare program for poor and disabled Americans.Max Stier, the president and CEO of the non-profit Partnership for Public Service, condemned the gridlock’s impact on government workers.“It is wrong to make federal employees suffer because our leaders in Congress and the White House have failed to keep our government open and operational,” Stier said.“Our air traffic controllers, VA nurses, smoke jumpers and food inspectors are not responsible for this government shutdown, and they shouldn’t bear the financial burden created by the failures of our elected officials. The irony is that members of Congress and senior White House leaders are continuing to be paid.”Earlier this week, on 7 October, a federal judgeorderedthe Trump administration to provide specifics on the status of any layoff plans, the affected agencies and whether any federal employees had been recalled to work to carry out layoffs, by Friday, 10 October.Areportby the Center for American Progress on 30 September argued that a government shutdown limits the ability of the Trump administration to carry out firings, citing guidance from the office of management and budget that admitted any permanent layoffs need to have been initiated before the shutdown began.“Constraints on permanently firing federal employees during a shutdown largely exist because of theAntideficiency Actand the distinction between ‘shutdown furloughs’ that happen during a lapse in congressional appropriations and ‘administrative furloughs’, which are department and agency procedures on how to permanently let staff go, including – for example – through a RIF,” the report, authored by Greta Bedekovics, associate director of democracy policy at the Center for American Progress, states. “The Trump administration’s threats to layoff federal employees should be understood as a goal of the administration that will be pursued with or without a government shutdown and should not drive lawmakers’ decisions on whether to support government funding bills.”Shrai Popat contributed additional reportingExplore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025Mike JohnsonDonald TrumpRepublicansDemocratsHouse of RepresentativesUS SenatenewsShareReuse this content"

When her Las Vegas Acesfinished off a four-game sweep of the Phoenix Mercuryon Friday night to become only the second team in WNBA history to win three titles in a four-year span, the final horn felt less like a climax than a verdict: the best team of the era led by the best player of the era. When the dust settled the 29-year-old from Columbia, South Carolina, had achieved a quadrafecta no player in the NBA or WNBA had ever managed: winning the scoring title, the Most Valuable Player award, Defensive Player of the Year honors and MVP of the finals in the same year.Thanks to Wilson, a team who’d looked likethe next great American sports dynastybefore slipping from their perch a year ago was back at the mountaintop. But anyone who watched the front half of the season knows this was the least expected of Aces’ three banners. For most of the year Las Vegas didn’t give the appearance of a playoff team let alone a champion. They staggered through injuries and misfires, dropped coin-flip games and wore the tightness of a group playing beneath its standard. If dynasties are supposed to hum, this one coughed and sputtered.Quick GuideWNBA finals 2025ShowScheduleBest-of-seven series.Fri 3 OctGame 1:Las Vegas 89, Phoenix 86Sun 5 OctGame 2:Las Vegas 91, Phoenix 78Wed 8 OctGame 3:Las Vegas 90, Phoenix 88Fri 10 OctGame 4:Las Vegas 97, Phoenix 86Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.To understand how we got here, flash back to 2 August, when the Aceswere boat-raced by 53 pointsby the Minnesota Lynx on national television, the worst loss in franchise history and the ultimate stress test of the culture Becky Hammon has spent four seasons building. Las Vegas were a moribund 14–14 then, six weeks from the finish line and barely in the postseason frame. Wilson walked out of Michelob Ultra Arena replaying the wreckage, drafting and redrafting a message she knew had to cut through without burning down what morale remained. She workshopped it with her partner Bam Adebayo, the two-time Olympic gold medallist and Miami Heat captain and then hit send to the team chat:If you weren’t embarrassed from yesterday, don’t come into this gym. You’re not needed or wanted here. We need the mindset to shift, because that was embarrassing.The next day, Vegas routed Golden State and never lost again in the regular season, ripping off 16 straight wins to nail down the No 2 seed while Wilson sprinted past historyto a record fourth MVP trophy. Hammon matched the tone with a structural tweak that mattered: players would build and present their own scouting reports before coaches weighed in. Accountability stopped being a slogan and became the operating system. “A’ja comes in with a laptop,” Hammon told ESPN. “They’ll kick the coaches out and do their thing.”Only then does the image that will live on come into focus – two nights before the sweep, before a sold-out Phoenix crowd of 17,071 at full boil – Wilson rising, spinning and feathering home an eight-footer with 0.3 seconds left in Game 3 as DeWanna Bonner and Alyssa Thomas crowded her airspace. That shot – thought to bethe first buzzer-beater over a married couplein basketball history – didn’t just win a game. It effectively sealed the Aces’ place in WNBA lore.The sweep will be the headline, but the spine of this title is that midseason decision to choose standards over excuses. It carried through an edgy playoff run that tried to jar them loose: Seattle forced a decisive Game 3 thatneeded Jackie Young’s late put-back; Indiana dragged theminto an overtime Game 5that would have cracked lesser champions. “There were a lot of doubts besides in that locker room,” Aces point guard Chelsea Gray said. “We stayed the course and trusted the process the entire time.”Las Vegas AcesAnd always, there was Wilson: shrinking options at the rim and expanding them at the elbow, the league’s most terrifying deterrent and its cleanest late-clock answer in the same body. There’s a special joy in watching her go about her work. If her Game 3 winner was the cinematic flourish, her Game 4 closeout was the masterclass in control when the jumpers weren’t falling. On a night where she missed 14 of her 21 attempts from the floor, Wilson changed the terms instead – owning the glass, spiking shots, jumping passing lanes, making a home at the stripe and going 17-for-19 there. Possession by possession, she bent the game back to her will.This year pushes past tidy résumé-building and into something rarer. Wilson wasn’t just the best player in this series; she was the best player in the sport, shouldering into a GOAT conversation that has long begun with Cheryl Miller’s legend and Maya Moore’s incandescent peak. She bears the weight lightly, which is part of the spell. Thetambourine bit at the podiumduring the post-game presser – equal parts Baptist church joke and credo on patience and faith – landed because it sounded like her: unguarded, joyful, before quietly matter-of-fact and clear-eyed in expounding on the work it takes to win.View image in fullscreenA’ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces, left, celebrates in front of Satou Sabally of the Phoenix Mercury after making a basket during Game 2 of the WNBA finals.Photograph: Ian Maule/Getty ImagesAsked to redefine greatness now that she’s stacking championships at a historic clip, Wilson widened the lens. “Obviously I would still [say] banners, but I think greatness is … it’s who you’re around. This is greatness. This group here, we were battle-tested, top to bottom battle-tested. We showed up every single day with a mind of being great,” she said in Friday’s aftermath. “You’ve got to be great when the lights aren’t on you. You’ve got to be great when nobody’s in the gym with you. You’ve got to be great when you may not get anything on the end. That is what greatness is to me because that is consistency and that is just you doing the right things because it’s right.”Hammon’s appraisal supplied a blunt epigraph to the season: you can debate basketball’s Mount Rushmore if you want, but Wilson is “alone on Everest”. That sounds like flattery until you try to explain Wilson’s 2025 without resorting to the obvious truth that she controlled both ends of the court more completely than any of her peers. The Aces’ stars toggled roles without complaint – Young from flamethrower to rebounding guard; Gray from closer to organizer; free-agent addition Jewell Loyd (now10-0 in WNBA finals games, by the way) from gunner to grit – and the bench minutes that once felt like a liability turned into leverage thanks to Dana Evans and company. But it all orbited the same gravitational pull of their 6ft 4in talisman. The closer a series got to wobble-time, the calmer Wilson seemed to breathe.Where it goes from here is business as much as basketball. Much of the WNBA’s workforce, including key Aces, approach free agency as the deadline for a new collective bargaining agreement ticks louder. That uncertainty hovered even as the confetti fell. It also hovered over a fortnight of renewed friction between the league office and locker rooms. Reports of commentsattributed to commissioner Cathy Engelbertabout players being “on their knees” in gratitude – which the Englebert has partially disputed – landed like a cymbal crash against the reality on the floor: the players are the product. The Mortgage Matchup Center crowd underscored that pointwith a cacophony of boosduring Englebert’s trophy presentation, while Gray did it from the dais. “When you have great players, you need to treat them like that. That’s payment. That’s treatment. That’s revenue share,” she said. “There’s no league without the players.”In the end, two scenes bookend the truth of this season: an August text on the night of a 53-point embarrassment, and an October fadeaway that hushed a cauldron in the desert. The improbable midseason swerve into inevitability – the choice to recommit, then the refusal to blink – turned both into canon. The Aces rediscovered their standard at rock bottom and rode it back to the summit. Perhaps the verdict, delivered by the player who just authored a season like no other, was in from the start.Explore more on these topicsLas Vegas AcesWNBAPhoenix MercuryUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

In his first match against a top-five opponent, the Monégasque world No 204 maintained his composure as Djokovic appeared to struggle with his left gluteal muscle from early in the first set.All fluffed up: why modern balls are sparking injury worries and frustration in tennisRead moreVacherot’s tournament has been an incredible spectacle by itself, but it has been made even more remarkable by the events in the top half of the draw. His cousin Rinderknech, a more established name on the ATP tour at No 54, put together the best result of his career. The Frenchman edged past the former world No 1 Daniil Medvedev 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the second semi-final on Saturday.As Rinderknech closed out his victory, Vacherot walked on to the court holding his head in disbelief before embracing his cousin.“I can’t even say it’s a dream because I don’t think even one person in our family dreamed about it,” Rinderknech said. “We started believing it, I would say, in the quarters, maybe … Now we are here, we fought through so many matches and somehow we are the guys standing at the end. It’s just incredible.”View image in fullscreenDisbelief on the face of Valentin Vacherot after he beat Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 in the semi-final.Photograph: Lintao Zhang/Getty ImagesThe second-lowest direct entrant into the qualifying draw, Vacherot has put together one of the most surprising successes at a big tournament, winning eight matches over the past two weeks. That has included victories over the No 14 seed, Alexander Bublik, and Holger Rune, the 10th seed, alongside this giantkilling win over Djokovic, the fourth seed.“This is just crazy,” Vacherot said on court. “It was an hour and 40 minutes of pure joy, even though not many people wanted me to keep going. He’s really appreciated here. I got a bit lost in all his titles when they were announcing him, but it was an unreal experience.”While Vacherot’s career-high ranking sits at No 110, the second and third lowest-ranked Masters 1000 semi-finalists, No 191 Andrei Pavel and No 152 Borna Coric, were former top 20 players who had dropped down the rankings. Nothing like this has happened at a Masters 1000 event on the ATP tour.View image in fullscreenArthur Rinderknech battled back from a set down to claim an upset 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 win over former US Open champion and 16th seed Daniil Medvedev.Photograph: Héctor Retamal/AFP/Getty ImagesThe cousins, who played college tennis in the US for the Texas A&M Aggies, have been encouraging each other in China. After closing out the victory, Vacherot signed the a TV camera lens: “Aggies on top! Allez, Arthur!”Vacherot’s joy contrasted sharply with Djokovic’s misery as the 38-year-old continued to battle his own body. This had already been a challenging week for the Serb, who had suffered badly in the suffocating heat and humidity during the opening rounds, vomiting several times on court.It appeared he had recovered from those early difficulties, but it became clear early on that he was struggling. Djokovic took a medical time out at 3-4 in the first set and, despite the crowd urging him on, he was unable to move properly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He looked apologetic as he shook Djokovic’s hands, but the Serb admirably offered him encouragement during their embrace: “You deserve it. You deserve it, man. You played unbelievable,” he said.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic receives treatment during his semi-final loss to Valentin Vacherot.Photograph: Jade Gao/AFP/Getty ImagesDjokovic had been attempting to become the oldest Masters 1000 champion, he had already become the oldest quarter-finalist at this level. He has shown this year he is still the third-best in the world behind the untouchable duo of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. However, there is a reason why nobody at his age has achieved the milestones he continues to reach. The countless physical problems Djokovic has struggled with between his positive performances this year have further underlined the difficulty of continuing to compete at the highest level.In some ways, Djokovic may reflect even more bitterly on this result than some of his recent grand slam losses. While he has been outplayed by Alcaraz and Sinner in the past three major tournaments, things finallyseemed to line up in his favourthis week after Alcaraz withdrew because of the ankle injury he sustained during his Tokyo title run and thenSinner retired from his third-round matchagainst Tallon Griekspoor due to the punishing conditions.Djokovic has recognised Alcaraz and Sinner are levels above him at the moment, but if he continues to put himself in good positions he could give himself a few more opportunities to achieve great things. This week represented one of those opportunities for the 24-time grand slam champion, who has not won a Masters 1000 event since 2023. Instead, his body failed him again.View image in fullscreenJessica Pegula records a video with fans as she celebrates her Wuhan Open semi-final victory against the world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka.Photograph: Adek Berry/AFP/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, the Wuhan Open will have an all-American final as Jessica Pegula exacted revenge for her recent US Open semi-final loss to Aryna Sabalenka, narrowly beating the world No 1 2-6, 6-4, 7-6(2).

The cheapest face-value seat for next summer’s final, somewhere in the gods of New Jersey’s 82,500-seat MetLife Stadium where the players are specks and the football’s a rumor, comes at a cost of $2,030 (oxygen tank not included). Most upper-deck seats range from $2,790 to $4,210, according to customerswho finally glimpsed the pricesthat had been closely guarded. Themuch-touted $60 ticketsfor group-stage games, propped up by Fifa as evidence of affordability, exist only as comically tiny green smudges on the edge of digital seating maps, little more than mirages of inclusivity.Fifa had kept the costs under wraps until the very moment of sale, replacing the usual published table of price points with a digital lottery that decided who even got the chance to buy. Millions spent hours staring at a queue screen as algorithms determined their place in line. When access finally came for most, the lower-priced sections had already vanished, many presumably hoovered up by bots and bulk-buyers (and that’s before Fifa quietly raised the prices of at least nine matchesafter only one day of sales). The whole process resembled less a ticket release than a psyop to calibrate how much frustration and scarcity the public will tolerate.This, Fifa insists, is merely an adaptation to “market norms” in the United States, where most matches will be staged, as though gouging fans were a cultural practice to be respected likebanning beer at the Qatar World Cup. In a sense, they’re bang-on. Profiteering and exploitation have long served as America’s articles of faith in the absence of a national religion. In reality, what’s taking shape is less a global festival of soccer than a fintech laboratory for everything that has made contemporary entertainment so exhausting. The governing body has fused together every irritant of modern consumer life – dynamic pricing, algorithmic lotteries, endless logins, even the remnants of a failed crypto boom – into a single soul-deadening experience designed to turn access itself into a commodity. This is the World Cup re-engineered for the Ticketmaster-Live Nation monopoly era, where the thrill of fandom meets the calculus of hedge-fund speculation.The story began during the NFT craze of 2022, when Fifa launched Fifa+ Collect, promising fans “affordable ownership” of digital soccer moments – Pelé lifting the 1970 trophy, Maradona’s 1986 solo run, Kylian Mbappé’s goal in the 2018 final – each sold as a blockchain collectible. When the market collapsed (quelle surprise), Fifa reheated its own nachos by quietly rebadging the tokens as ticketing opportunities. The new scheme, marketed under the chillingly corporateRight to Buy(RTB) name, offers supporters the chance to purchase NFTs that wouldone day give them permissionto purchase an actual match ticket. ARight to Finaltoken costs up to $999 and can be redeemed only if the buyer’s chosen team reaches the final. If not, it becomes a useless JPEG. Fifa discovered how to monetize anticipation itself, a system that traffics not in tickets but in Fomo.That illusion was finally shattered this week, when Fifa Collect administrators disclosed that the vast majority of Right to Buy holderswould only be eligiblefor Category 1 and 2 seats, the priciest brackets in Fifa’s opening phase at costs far beyond the reach of the average punter. The news triggered open revolt among the NFT community: Discord threads filled with complaints of being “ripped off” and a sudden rush to resell tokens as their market value collapsed.When the real tickets finally appeared, the scale of the escalation became clear. Category 1 seats for the semi-finals approach $3,000; quarter-finals nearly $1,700. Fifa’s new dynamic pricing model means those numbers can, and surely will, rise signficantly higher. The technique, borrowed from airlines and Silicon Valley ticket platforms, now governs the world’s biggest sporting event, creating a byzantine and hierarchical marketplace carved into endless tiers of privilege.World Cup seat plansWorld Cup seat plansAt past World Cups, resale prices were capped at face value. For 2026, Fifa lifted that restriction and moved into the secondary market itself. Tickets onits official resale platformhave already appeared for tens of thousands of dollars, including a $2,030 ticket for the final was relisted the next day for $25,000. Fifa double-dips by taking a 15% commission from the sellerandanother 15% from the buyer, pocketing $300 for every $1,000 traded. Officials claim this will discourage scalpers from using outside sites such as StubHub. In practice it legitimizes them, as though the easiest way to beat the touts was simply to host them.By the time a ticket is finally scanned at the turnstile on matchday, it may have been bought, flipped and resold three or four times, every trade skimming another cut into Fifa’s coffers. It’s less a ticketing system than a financial instrument, and suddentlythat $3.017bn targetfor ticket and hospitality revenue doesn’t seem so quixotic.Supporters’ groups have responded with predictable disbelief and outrage. Thomas Concannon of England’s Fans’ Embassy called the prices “astonishing”, pointing out that following a team through the tournament on the cheapest tickets would cost more than double the equivalent journey in Qatar. Add in transatlantic travel, accommodation and visa restrictions, and the so-called “most inclusiveWorld Cupever” begins to look an awful lot like a gated community. Ronan Evain of Fans Europe called it “the privatization of what was once a tournament open to all”, arguing that Fifa is building “a World Cup for middle-class Westerners and the happy few who can enter the US”.In Mexico, where resale laws have something resembling teeth, Fifa relented to government pressure and capped prices at face value on a localized ticket exchange platform. Everywhere else, the late-stage free-market grift carries on unchecked. The logic is simple: scarcity drives profit, and even disappointment can be monetized. Fifa’s defense leans heavily on American precedent. Concert promoters and major leagues have used dynamic pricing for years and resale sites routinely charge similar fees. But invoking “market norms” misses the point. Soccer’s global ritual isn’t meant to mimic the Super Bowl or the Eras Tour by normalizing the abusive consumer practices Americans resigned themselves to years ago. It was meant to belong to everyone: the traveling supporters, the families, the people who transform neutral stadiums into carnivals of color and noise.The 2026 rollout exposes a new frontier of sports capitalism: the monetization of emotion. Fifa has built an ecosystem in which every feeling – excitement, anxiety, devotion – becomes a revenue stream. Fear of missing out? There’s a token for that. Late-stage panic? Dynamic pricing will account for it. Regret? The resale platform will take another 30%. Buying a ticket is no longer an act of fandom but of speculation, a wager placed on both your team’s fortunes and one’s own disposable income.The parallels with the spiraling economics of the live music industryare striking. With concerts, the explosion of VIP “packages” and velvet-rope pricing has turned performance into a gated spectacle and audience into clientele. With soccer, the same transformation is under way. Stadiums once defined by chaos and community are being remade as climate-controlled malls of efficiency: perfect sightlines, perfect sound and prices that erase the very imperfection that made the experience human. When ordinary fans are priced out, what’s left is a sport stripped of its edge and flattened into entertainment.Fifa says that every dollar generated by ticket sales goes back into the game, as it stressedin a recent letter to the Guardian, like that shopworn talking point were a moral shield. Yet what’s being returned to the game is a recalibrated worldview: that soccer, like every other corner of modern life, can be measured, segmented and commodified. In the process, the world’s most democratic sport becomes an exercise in exclusion, where the right to belong is determined by AI and a balance sheet.Infantino keeps repeating that 2026 will be “the biggest, best and most inclusive World Cup ever”. On the first count he’ll surely be right and on the second he may be, but a World Cup priced as a luxury brand is destined to fall spectacularly short of the third. The dream football once offered of common ground and of shared joy has been bought, repackaged and sold back at a markup. When access itself becomes an asset class, the world’s game no longer belongs to the world.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Ticket pricesFifaWorld CupFootball ticket pricesUS sportsFintechfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The American attacked from the break on the Passo della Crocetta climb and was 50 seconds in front of the chasers – and more than three minutes ahead of the peloton – by the time he hit the crest of that ascent with more than 70km remaining.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterSign up to Sport in FocusEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From there Pogacar slashed at Simmons’ lead and caught him some way before the summit, and from there it was a one-man procession to a historic win.Storer became only the second Australian rider in 120 years to make the podium at the Tour of Lombardy, after Phil Anderson in 1986.The 28-year-old had tried to go with Evenepoel after they had both been left for dead by Pogacar, but he was distanced by the Belgian over the final 10km and battled home for third, 25 seconds clear of Simmons.It was Storer’s maiden monument podium in a year when he also earned his first stage victory at Paris-Nice, followed by both a stage win and the overall triumph in Tour of the Alps.The Perth rider finished in the top 10 in the Giro d’Italia and recently won the prestigious Memorial Pantani race.Explore more on these topicsCyclingTadej PogacarnewsShareReuse this content"

What is perhaps more surprising is that more Australian football fans aren’t tuning into the league on Apple TV.“I feel like there needs to be a bit more exposure to Major League Soccer in Australia,” Socceroos and Nashville SC midfielder Patrick Yazbek said. “I still feel like a lot of Aussies have this misconception that the only alternative to watching the A-League is watching European football.”It’s a perception Yazbek is keen to change, not least because many games kick off at an ideal time for viewers in Australia. In a country where the average Uefa Champions League game kicks off at 4.30am, most Saturday nightMLSgames start at the far more palatable hour of 9.30am on a Sunday morning.“What more do you want than to sit down with a coffee and watch a game?” Yazbek said.Socceroos springboardYazbek is one of a growing number of Aussies who have used a move to North America to help bolster their national team ambitions. Of the 25 players called into the squad for this month’s clashes with World Cup hosts Canada and theUSA, three – Yazbek, DC United defender Kye Rowles and New York City FC midfielder Aiden O’Neill – play their club football in MLS. A fourth, defender Miloš Degenek – who recently captained the Socceroos against New Zealand in Canberra – was once a mainstay at Columbus Crew.Yazbek, who started his professional career with Sydney FC in Australia’s domestic A-League, trod a well-worn path to Europe when he joined Norwegian club Viking in 2023. But it was his next move that raised plenty of eyebrows in Australia, with the Sydney-born midfielder swapping the cold of Stavanger for the relative unknown of Nashville.It’s a move that has paid off for the box-to-box midfielder, with Yazbek featuring in both games for the Socceroos against New Zealand in September. He admits it was a conscious decision to move to a high-quality league where his performances were more likely to be noticed.“I honestly think MLS is on track to becoming one of the best leagues in the world in a few years,” he said. “I’ve had so many discussions with my peers and teammates and I say to them: ‘I’ve only been here 12 months and I’ve already seen so much growth’”.Folarin Balogun scores again and US improvement continues in 1-1 draw with EcuadorRead moreProfessional opportunitiesIn a league bristling with names like Lionel Messi, Son Heung-Min, Thomas Müller, Miguel Almirón and Emil Forsberg, it’s probably safe to assume it’s only Australian fans interested in how the likes of Archie Goodwin, Giuseppe Bovalina and Lucas Herrington are faring on the other side of the world.But while MLS has proved a viable launching ground for full national team honours – Goodwin, Bovalina, and Herrington are all Australia youth internationals – it has also succeeded in ways Australia’s domestic A-League has struggled to replicate.One such area is full-time coaching roles – a domain Chris Sharpe knows well.A goalkeeper by trade, Sharpe ended his playing days in Colorado in 2012 after stints in England, Denmark and his native Australia. Now in his 18th season with the club, he’s spent the past decade helping to shape the careers of a number of high-profile shot-stoppers in his role as the Rapids’ long-serving Assistant and Goalkeeper Coach.“I think it’s very uncommon in the world of football,” Sharpe said of his unusually long tenure with the Rapids. “It’s probably a bit more common with goalkeepers and goalkeeper coaches though – especially if goalkeepers are on long-term deals – because there’s a bit of a special bond between a goalkeeper and goalkeeper coach.”It’s a bond that has seen Sharpe oversee the likes of USA national team goalkeepers Tim Howard, William Yarbrough and Zack Steffen. Howard, who remains the most capped goalkeeper in US men’s national team history, even asked Sharpe to introduce him on stage when the latter was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2024.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite the presence of high-profile former internationals like Maya Yoshida and Marco Reus, it was the contributions of Joseph Paintsil, Gabriel Pec and Dejan Joveljić – who went on to join Sporting Kansas City for $4 million in the league’s first cash-for-player trade – that proved decisive.Galaxy paid around $19 million in transfer fees to acquire the relatively unheralded Pec and Paintsil, but as Waterson points out: “they won us a championship.”Nashville SC beats Austin FC 2-1 in a historic US Open Cup final triumphRead moreAnd with clubs across the league utilizing a mix of high-profile recruits and raw young talent, it’s a model that could see MLS clubs continue to sign the best young Aussies, develop them, then move them on for even higher transfer fees.“In the past, we spent money on players like Zlatan, Robbie Keane, Ashley Cole and Steven Gerrard,” Waterson said. “Now we’re moving away from that model a little bit, which could be great for young Aussie kids.”Common groundWith MLS currently home to eight Australian players – along with a trio of New Zealand internationals in Michael Boxall, Finn Surman and Bill Tuiloma – it’s hard to imagine we’ve seen the last of the arrivals from Down Under.Having recentlylifted the US Open Cupwith Nashville and with a World Cup on the horizon, Yazbek admits a shared language – and the ability to adapt to the physical demands of the league – have helped catapult him into the national team spotlight.“This is the first real year where I’ve played probably almost 40 games and it’s been really good,” he said. “I’ve been involved in a winning team, which is important, too.”While Australia coach Tony Popović can afford to experiment now that his Socceroos side has booked its spot at next year’s World Cup finals, he’s generally shown a preference to those playing regularly for their club sides. That should hold Yazbek – who played 80 minutes of the recent US Open Cup final win over Austin FC – in good stead.“Before coming to Nashville, it was certainly a consideration,” he said. “It was a question of: ‘will this facilitate my national team ambitions?’”Now, having thrust himself into the national team limelight, he’s in a good spott to book himself a spot on the plane to a World Cup played in a region he knows well.“In coming to MLS, I did feel like I was taking a bit of a leap because I was one of the first young Australian players to move here,” he said.“But I feel like having taken the leap and trusting that playing in this league regularly would help me, I think it has all worked out really well.”Explore more on these topicsAustraliaUSAMLSUS sportsAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Game 1 is scheduled for Sunday in Toronto.JP Crawford led off the bottom of the 15th with a line-drive single to right off Tommy Kahnle (0-1). Randy Arozarena was hit by a pitch before Cal Raleigh flied out, with Crawford taking third on a throwing error by center fielder Parker Meadows. After an intentional walk to Julio Rodriguez, Polanco singled on a 3-2 pitch to win it.Kerry Carpenter hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning to account for all of the Tigers’ offense.The Mariners tied it at 2-2 in the seventh on pinch hitter Leo Rivas’ RBI single.Both teams threatened repeatedly in extra innings, with the Mariners grounding into inning-ending double plays in both the 12th and 13th.Starters Tarik Skubal of Detroit and George Kirby of Seattle dueled in the early innings.Skubal, the favorite to win a second consecutive Cy Young Award, allowed one run on two hits and no walks over six innings with 13 strikeouts. He set an major league postseason record with seven consecutive strikeouts, fanning Victor Robles to end the second inning and striking out the side in both the third and fourth.The only run Skubal allowed came in the second. Josh Naylor lined a double the opposite way into the left field corner with one out, stole third and came home on Mitch Garver’s sacrifice fly to deep center.Skubal, who threw 99 pitches, retired the final 14 batters he faced before turning the ball over to the bullpen.The Mariners tied it in the seventh. Polanco drew a one-out walk off reliever Kyle Finnegan and Naylor grounded a two-out single into right, with Polanco stopping at second. After pinch hitter Dominic Canzone was announced, the Tigers turned to left-hander Tyler Holton.The Mariners countered with Rivas, who was celebrating his 28th birthday. Rivas lined a single to left to score Polanco and make it 2-2.Kirby opened with five scoreless innings before Javier Baez lined a leadoff double to center in the sixth. With the left-handed-hitting Carpenter coming to the plate, Mariners manager Dan Wilson opted to turn to Gabe Speier. That was in large part because Carpenter had five homers in his career against Kirby, including a two-run shot in the fifth inning of Game 1 – which the Tigers won 3-2 in 11 innings.Carpenter spoiled the strategy, hitting a 1-0 fastball right down the middle 411 feet into the stands in right-center field to give Detroit the lead.Kirby went five-plus innings and was charged with one run on three hits with no walks and six strikeouts.Explore more on these topicsMLBSeattle MarinersDetroit TigersBaseballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The most important place to win – in fact, theonlyimportant place to win, according to him – is at the 2026 World Cup. The results would ideally match the performances, sure, but they don’t have to. Not yet.That’s a good thing, because once again on Friday night the US performance was met with a result that was probably less than the Americans deserved. A 1-1 draw withEcuadorin Austin, Texas saw the US control the flow of the game most of the time, winning most of the individual defensive battles and on occasion constructing some truly attractive moves forward against Ecuador’s disciplined defensive shell.Ecuador’s goal came on a relatively minor mistake in the first half, pounced upon and punished by seemingly ageless veteran Enner Valencia. The US equalizer, scored by Folarin Balogun in the 71st minute, came on one of those aforementioned moves that did not usually lead to dangerous scoring chances. The looks on the faces of US players after the final whistle betrayed a sense of disappointment; a feeling that they could have, should have gotten more against the team that finished second in a stacked South American qualifying process.Defensive, wily and intense, Ecuador aim to make 2026 World Cup their bestRead moreIn this game, as in asimilarly encouraging display against Japanto close the last window, the US utilized a three-man backline (Tim Ream, Chris Richards and Miles Robinson to start) with aggressive wingbacks and a double-pivot in midfield (Tanner Tessmann and Aidan Morris, both of whom made their returns to the national team after long absences). Once again, the US looked comfortable in that shape, settling into a rhythm after Ecuador’s press caused a few nervy moments in the game’s earliest stages.Tim Weah starting at right wingback provided an interesting wrinkle – Weah has most often played that role at club level, but has done so less often with the US. He looked right at home, providing nice balance to Max Arfsten on the opposite flank, with both overlapping at will on the occasions when the US was able to progress the ball into the middle third.Valencia nonetheless opened the scoring in the 31st minute with a run and finish that belied the mileage in the 35-year-old’s legs. In his 101st appearance for his national team, the former West Ham and Everton man found himself isolated in space against US defender Chris Richards. He used a well-weighted touch to open up space, forcing Richards to chase as he ran into the penalty area. With his window closing and US goalkeeper Matt Freese shaded to his near post, Valencia fired an inch-perfect finish past Richards’ feet and the hands of Freese to open the scoring.The US defending, particularly from the otherwise solid Richards, will be questioned in that moment. But so too should the team’s midfield, who were caught upfield as Jordy Alcivar received a pass out of the back and was able to turn easily and find Valencia with little resistance.Back in form, Folarin Balogun is seeking a momentum-shifting win with the US: ‘I think we need that’Read moreRichards nearly made up for it just a few minutes later, latching on to a corner kick at the far post with a close-range effort on the ground that was saved by Ecuador goalkeeper Hernán Gilíndez – one of his five on the night.The US ended the first half with 66% of possession – a figure they maintained throughout – but very little to show for it thanks largely to unlucky moments, dogged defending from Ecuador, and a few cases of indecisive play.One such instance came in the 31st minute, the US were able to get numbers forward after turning over Ecuador in midfield. On the ball near the right touchline, Morris had four US bodies streaking into the box, each one an option for a potential cross. However, none of them came short to the ball, limiting Morris’ options. And when he did finally elect to hit Weah’s overlapping run, the pass was too heavy and rolled over the end line.The positives for the US, though, were numerous. Time and again, effective defending in space halted Ecuador’s counterattacks, including a particularly timely tackle from Miles Robinson in the 33rd minute that saved a potential 3-on-1 after a set piece.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They simply could not make those spaces count, at least not until Balogun equalized. It was the second straight US appearance with a goal for Balogun, who seems to finally be grabbing hold of the team’s starting striker spot.His goal came off bad Ecuador turnover as they attempted to play out of the back, with Tessmann able to pick up the ball with space near the top of the box and hit a well-weighted through ball to Malik Tillman, who was barely kept onside by Ecuadorian defender Joel Ordóñez, jostling for position with Balogun near the penalty spot. Tillman’s cutback found Balogun’s foot, and his finish bounced off the post and into the back of the net.The goal ended a 520-minute shutout streak for Ecuador, an indicator of the defensive mindset that helped them to their best World Cup qualifying campaign ever, and that the issues the US faced were not unprecedented.There were further near-chances, opportunities that were blocked, passes that were a few inches off the mark. Christian Pulisic, held out of the starting lineup as a precaution after suffering a knock in training, was at the center of much of those positive moments after coming on as a sub.In the end, though, the US’s obvious improvement will be a relief for fans who have been waiting for a long time to see this generation look the equals against the world’s best teams. There just won’t be a result that shows it.Explore more on these topicsUSAEcuadorUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

They are up into mid-table and if a 2-0 victory over Feyenoord in the Europa League will not quite live in the memory in the way last season’s games againstBayern Munich,JuventusandParis Saint-Germaindo, a return to Rotterdam at least evoked the glory days of 1982.It will be a while yet before the frustration at missing out on the Champions League fades, but there does now seem to be a gathering recognition that Villa have a decent chance of winning the Europa League, potentially adding Istanbul’s Besiktas Park to De Kuip as a venue where they have won a European trophy.The question, then, is where the gloom came from. Why didVilla seem so downbeatabout a squad that, at least in terms of those on permanent contracts, had essentially traded Jacob Ramsey and Leon Bailey for the promising Evann Guessand? How did Villa manage to talk themselves into such a funk that they did not win any of their first six games of the season? The answer to which, just as it was for Newcastle, who also began the season in apparent denial about the quality of the squad, isprofitability and sustainabilityrules (PSR).If you know your Lucas Neill and Mo Salah, the Guardian’s new football game is  just for youRead moreMy Guardian colleague Barney Ronay has a theory thatmanagers were essentially invented as a scapegoat, so that infuriated crowds could abuse the beleaguered figure on the touchline rather than a club’s board. The European Union used to perform a similar function for the UK government. It is useful for those in power to have something to blame, and in football that role is now performed by PSR.PSR is far from perfect. It has, surely without meaning to, created an environment in which clubs are incentivised to sell homegrown talent and to maintain a constant churn of transaction to generate, thanks to the marvels of amortisation, the book profit that gives them PSR headroom.But there are two things to be said in its defence. First, that clubs voted on it. It was not imposed from above. It is not some annoying and unavoidable quirk of nature. Clubs chose it and agreed to it. There are regular meetings at which they could propose an alternative.And some sort of check on spending is necessary, and this is the one we have got. Imagine it did not exist. Imagine if huge private equity companies or the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates could spend what they wanted. Football is financially stratified enough as it is, but the potential distortion would be grotesque: the game would, purely and simply, be about who had the richest owner. Plus there would always be the threat of that owner withdrawing with potentially devastating consequences for the club – as happened on a much lower scale to Gretna in 2008 after theirowner Brooks Milesonfell ill and seemingly lost interest.It is often forgotten that when financial fair play rules were introduced in 2011, whatever their impact since, their purpose was to protect clubs from the sort of over-ambition that had pushed Leeds to the brink.In practice, that may be frustrating for rising clubs. PSR does favour those clubs with large fanbases who attract the most lucrative sponsorship deals and can have a noodle partner in every port. But equally Villa, having gone from the Championship to the Champions League in five years, cannot really claim to have been held back. And if your wages to turnover ratio is – as Villa’s was – 91%, you are overspending.But the reason Villa are not in the Champions League this season is not PSR; it is that their goalkeeper got an entirely needless red card at Old Trafford in the final game of last season and sothey lost a game in which a drawwould have seen them finish above Newcastle in fifth.View image in fullscreenAston Villa’s Emiliano Martínez is shown a red card by the referee Thomas Bramall against Manchester United in the final game of last season, which they went on to lose 2-0.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersThere will be those who moan about the goal ruled out by a referee who incorrectly blew for a foul and did not let play run, so the video assistant referee could not make him review the decision, but glitches are part of the game. Had the goalline cameras not been blocked off by players’ bodies in 2020, Sheffield United would have taken the lead against Villa in agame that finished 0-0; defeat there would have relegated them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month saw theresignation of their sporting director Monchi– who, like gazpacho, never seems quite as effective outside Seville. Of 10 permanent signings made last season, only Amadou Onana started more than 10 league games.In January Villa gambled on the loan signings of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio to get into the Champions League. That was probably a justifiable move and nearly worked, but the nature of a gamble is that there are consequences if it goes wrong. Had they not been signed, another January arrival, Donyell Malen, might have had more opportunity to prove himself; histwo goals against Burnleylast weekend suggested he could yet have a significant role. Harvey Elliott and Jadon Sancho may not be quite at the level of Rashford and Asensio but both are intriguing loan options with points to prove.Elliott has shown evidence of great talent but appears not to be a fit for Arne Slot at Liverpool and, at 22, needs regular football. Sancho has lost his way since leaving Borussia Dortmund for Manchester United in 2021, but the basic ability is there if Unai Emery can resurrect it.View image in fullscreenOf 10 permanent signings Aston Villa made last season, only Amadou Onana started more than 10 league games.Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images/ReutersIf the clouds of largely self-induced despondency have cleared, if they have accepted there is no grand conspiracy against them and that PSR is not the monster it has been painted as, what can Villa realistically hope for?

Erling Haaland stole the attention with a hat-trick on it, rendering his early double penalty miss a discordant memory, and the upshot was that Norway could look with clear heads toward a near-certain firstWorld Cupappearance in 27 years. A win over Estonia next month will confirm their presence; Egil Olsen, their manager at France 1998, watched as Israel offered scant opposition to Europe’s most ruthless attacking force.It also means Italy, already sore from successive failures to qualify, are likely to face another playoff date. Perhaps Norway’s domination of Group I should prove little surprise: theIsraelmanager, Ran Ben Shimon, said afterwards that they and Spain are the two best teams on the continent.Tight security and political tension hang over key Norway v Israel World Cup qualifierRead moreIsrael are now out of contention for next summer’s showpiece; in truth, for all the American government’s outrage about any potential ban from the tournament, it had always been a long shot. But their very presence in Oslo was highly contested, the buildup framed by the Norwegian Football Federation’s stance that they should be ejected from international football due to the war in Gaza. There will be relief that confrontations were minimal beyond a brief spate of trouble outside the Ullevaal Stadion during half-time.The day’s intensive security operation had met its first visible challenge at 2pm when a crowd of pro-Palestine protesters, cohered by the Palestine Committee inNorway, gathered at Spikersuppa in central Oslo in preparation for their march to Ullevaal. Yards away, polite applause had rippled as the swearing-in of Norway’s parliament was relayed on a big screen. The marchers, whose number swelled to around 1,500 during the 2.6 mile route, were more vigorously propelled by flares and beating drums. Red cards were distributed among attendees.View image in fullscreenA fan holds a red card as other supporters unfurl Palestinian flags at the Ullevaal Stadion.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesInger Lise, wearing a national team scarf, was one of few who had turned up to the protest in Norway’s football colours. Once a keen player, she had a match ticket but considered the occasion tainted. “It’s very frustrating,” she said while holding one end of a large “Free Palestine” banner, the other clasped by a friend. “The game shouldn’t have been played but it’s not up to us to ruin it. It’s just horrible that we are here now.”Inside Andy’s Pub, a Liverpool-themed bar near the meeting point, six supporters in their mid-50s felt the moment they could make an impact had passed. “Israel should have been banned before, we can’t do anything now,” one said. They had travelled from Tromso, inside the Arctic Circle, and wore shirts carrying names from the 1998 squad.As the march passed northwards, some residents gathered on balconies or wound down car windows to shout encouragement. The police presence, visible but never overbearing, stopped well short of confrontation at that point. The only exception came as participants prepared to depart. A handful of Israeli journalists had arrived at the protest and, apparently after being involved in an exchange with a member of the public, were escorted from the scene.The 80-minute march ended with speeches and songs at a stage opposite Ullevaal, a smaller protest arriving to swell numbers in the hour before kick-off. Nearby, a few fans bearing both Norwegian and Israeli flags were marshalled towards the ground by police officers.As the teams emerged before kick-off, supporters in the west stand unfurled a Palestine flag alongside another imploring “Let children live”. The sight will not have been lost on Fifa and Uefa. Israel’s pocket of around 100 visitors raised their own flag during the national anthem while a minority of home supporters whistled.Temperatures inside the stadium rose no higher. The only notable security lapse arose in the eighth minute when, even though the front three rows were covered, a sole protester ran on to the pitch before being wrestled to the ground by security personnel. He was named by local media as Mario Ferri, who refers to himself as “The Falcon” and has a history of such incursions in various global stadiums.View image in fullscreenA protester waves a Palestine flag as policemen stand guard outside the Ullevaal Stadion.Photograph: Javad Parsa/EPABy then Haaland had already erred from the spot, Daniel Peretz saving his first effort and a VAR-ordered retake. After play resumed Norway pulled clear against opponents let down by a nonexistent defence. Haaland made amends in between own goals by Anan Khalaili and Idan Nachmias, the latter ending up in hospital after colliding with a post. Three goals in a 10-minute spell had ended the contest.As the first half ended, around 200 protesters remained outside. In the day’s sole flashpoint, police used teargas after a barrier was pulled down near the stadium entrance. Ten arrests were made but the authorities emphasised most involved had behaved well.Haaland put himself front and centre again by finishing twice more, his third bringing up 51 in 46 caps. “Free Palestine” chanted a section of the support as proceedings wound down, reminding everyone else that the backdrop could never quite be punctured.“I didn’t feel anything extreme,” said Ben Shimon of the atmosphere. He took pains to laud Norway’s hospitality, while lamenting that of his players, and hoped a weight will lift now peace no longer looks a pipedream. “We have a big role in Israeli society, we have to stay together. I believe the national team of Israel, and other national teams, have a bigger perspective than football.” The day’s events had proved it.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupNorwayIsraelmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Bleak, you might say. That is why their current new-manager bounce and burst of positivity is such a breath of fresh air, not only for the club but for the WSL as a whole.Under Martin Ho, Spurs have won four of their opening five WSL matches of this campaign, putting them third in the table, four points better off than neighbours Arsenal, and they could even go top on Sunday if they were to pull of a shock win at leaders and champions, Chelsea.‘Refereeing is addictive’: Emily Heaslip on going from footballer to official and dealing with abuseRead moreA team that conceded the joint-second highest number of goals last season has kept three clean sheets out of a possible five in the league, and that has come in tandem with much-improved performances from the Australia defender Clare Hunt, who has barely put a foot wrong alongside an early contender for the division’s young signing of the summer, the 19-year-old Japan centre-back Toko Koga.Tottenham fought off Champions League clubs’ interest to sign Koga from Feyenoord and, with her maturity awareness and maturity of defensive positioning, you could be forgiven for mistakenly thinking she is, at the very, least, in her late twenties. At the other end of the pitch, Spurs’s other summer signing – yes, they only made two signings this summer – Cathinka Tandberg, has scored three times and could become only the third Tottenham player to score in three or more consecutive WSL games.There isa tone of authority and confidenceabout Ho, the former Manchester United assistant manager who has handled his media duties with conviction alongside a relaxed tone that seems to be rubbing off on his team. He is also refusing to get carried away with his side’s early form. “There is still a lot of work to do; we’re only five games in,” he insisted in the buildup to the Chelsea game. “The players’ feet are very well grounded. We always look for things we can do better and we have to keep improving.”View image in fullscreenToko Koga has shown plenty of maturity in defence since joining Tottenham from Feyenoord.Photograph: Annabel Lee-Ellis/WSL/WSL Football/Getty ImagesIt is understood Tottenham had a shortlist of about 30 candidates for the head coach post this summer before eventually interviewing seven, and it was Ho’s obsessive passion for the role, combined with what were seen as glowing references, that led to him being appointed after a two-year spell at Brann in Norway.So are Tottenham the real deal or is their early success under Ho a temporary hot streak? The watching world may well find out on Sunday as they take on the toughest assignment in the WSL: facing Chelsea away from home. Sonia Bompastor’s side have won all 11 of their previous WSL meetings with Tottenham and are unbeaten in 30 consecutive league fixtures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Lewis family trust want the cash to “continue the focus on driving long-term sporting success”, and while no specific breakdown has been provided publicly regarding how much of the extra finance will go to men’s football, women’s football or the academy, Ho has spoken positively about the owners. “I’ve met them numerous times at the games. We are very well supported,” he insisted. “They are doing everything they can to make sure we evolve and we grow. I have no doubt they’ll continue to support us in the next window and beyond that; they have some really ambitious plans for this team.”This week the club also confirmed the appointment of Lawrence Shamieh, formerly Manchester United’s analyst, as first-team assistant coach. That followed September’s appointment of Adam Jeffrey as first-team coach, while Sara Cullis, who joined from Manchester City in June, is Spurs’s new head of analysis, leading on talent identification and recruitment. “You have to have people around you that you can trust and it enables the players to grow also, not just me,” Ho said. “I believe we can be pioneers in those departments which we have really strong colleagues in. It’s a really big step in the right direction.”Tottenham also won four of their first five WSL matches in 2021-22, a campaign when they went on to achieve their highest ever top-flight finish of fifth. They also started the 2023-24 campaign brightly under Ho’s predecessor, Robert Vilahamn, and the challenge now will be stretching the run. Opta predicts Spurs only maintain a 1.1% chance of finishing third but they are now deemed more likely to finish in the top half than any of the other sides outside of the WSL’s established ‘big four’. Spurs’ future – for now – certainly looks brighter.Explore more on these topicsTottenham Hotspur WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My parents would have told you that from an early age any sporting ambitions I entertained were in the area I ended up in; describing and commentating on top-level sport. I always resist any grading of goals or players or matches because I have a belief that sport belongs in its moment. Sport creates memories – we can recall vividly where we were, who we were with, what we were thinking, when our team won a trophy or an athlete won an Olympic gold medal … orShane Lowry sunk a putt to seal the Ryder Cup. Those moments are very personal, and the job of the commentator is to try to add something to the memory of those moments. And those moments are unique and should remain separate from one another.My favourite line of commentary of yours is from the final whistle of the 1992 Second Division playoff final between my beloved Blackburn Rovers and Leicester: “That’s it! Going up, going up, going up! Blackburn Rovers have made it at last, and the great Ewood gamble by Jack Walker on Kenny Dalglish has paid out the premier prize!” Did you have this or any of your other famous linesscripted, or is it all down to the moment?Dave StaintonPreparation for a commentary is partly about researching information; in the modern era that includes statistics and data. But more importantly, preparation is a journalistic process, asking yourself: “What’s the story here?” “What does it mean for Blackburn Rovers to win this match or for Leicester City to win this match?” In cup finals the commentator gets extra air time after the final whistle – during the celebrations, during the presentation of the trophy – to reflect on what they have seen, and in preparation for that I often draw up a sheet which will have, in this case, Blackburn down one side and Leicester down the other … you can’t script lines because you don’t know what the story of the game is going to be, but you can write bullet points which highlight the significance of victory or the repercussions of defeat for the two teams involved. That’s a useful reference point in those very emotional moments after a game such a playoff final. It’s then a case of finding the right words to fit the moment, and that can really only be done in the moment.After “And Solskjær has won it!” did you think:“Shit, I hope Bayern don’t score now”?David EstherbyThat’s a very good question, actually, because in saying what I said I broke the cardinal rule of commentary, the Devon Loch rule: never wave the winner across the winning line until they’re there. And if Bayern [Munich]hadgone down the other end and equalised and the game went to penalties, they would have definitely won the shootout, and then there probably would have been an effigy of me hanging on a lamp-post at the Arndale Centre by midnight. I would have been blamed for Manchester United not winning the final. When I recall that game there was a definite change in momentum when the equaliser went in; it was as if the Bayern players and fans had witnessed some sort of awful human tragedy. There was a disbelief that it was difficult for them to recover from. And therefore, when Ole [Gunnar Solskjær] reached out and diverted the ball into the roof of the net, the heart overruled the head andI said what I felt: “That’s it, that’s the winning goal.”Do you have any spare copies of the end-of-season compilation cassette you did for Radio City commemorating Liverpool’s double-winning side? My mum chucked mine out by accident (so she says).Stephen CarrSounds like you lost it yourself! I do have a box of memorabilia but I’m pretty sure a copy of that cassette is not in it. Apologies Stephen, can’t help with that one, sadly.What is your favourite ground to commentate at and why?AdamThere are certain stadiums that create an atmosphere of their own; you wouldn’t be surprised to hear me say Anfield or Celtic Park on a Champions League night. But for the commentator that’s no good if you can’t see the pitch properly. And so in terms of favourite places to broadcast from I tend to make my selection based on the height and access of the commentary position. Some of them are a long way away from the pitch, some of them are too close to the pitch … some of them are too low, some of them are too high. For many years the commentary position at Goodison Park involved walking past the roof of the Bullens Road Stand and then shinnying down a vertical ladder, none of which is preferable in preparation for a football match! At modern stadiums, like the Emirates and the Etihad, you are provided with a commentary position that is at a perfect height. Also, I was fortunate enough to commentate on a couple of Cup finals in the Cardiff era, when Wembley was being renovated, and I always felt the commentary position there [the Millennium Stadium] was what I would call a “no-excuses commentary position”.View image in fullscreen‘And Solskjær has won it!’ Manchester United seal the 1999 Treble and provide Clive Tyldesley with the platform to well and truly shine.Photograph: Colorsport/ShutterstockHas there ever been a moment in a match you’ve been commentating on that has left you speechless?Daniel RichardsonI always struggle with this question because in my job I’m always trying very hardnotto be speechless. I’ve got professional standards and hate it if I make an error, and getting lost for words would very much be an error. My great mentorReg Gutteridgeused to say: “Silent moments are not lesser moments; instead they are times during a television commentary when you don’t need to add anything and instead ask yourself whatcouldyou add next.” So silences are part of good commentary.How do you feel about where the style of modern-day commentary is heading?RobThe trend in contemporary sports media is towards conversation. We’ve seen the rise of the podcast and before that the rise of the phone-in. Even the main rights holders for live sport embroider their coverage with long discussions and debates. It’s the way we’ve consumed sport in classroom and barroom arguments and in recent times those arguments have become content and created stars, people who are genuine influencers and influence the way people consume sport. So there was an inevitability of that trend spilling into commentary; it’s become more conversational, which has been reflected in recent years with the rise of more than two people commentating on live football and other sporting events.The first priority of a commentator is to consider your audience and who your audience are. The audience for, say, a World Cup semi-final on terrestrial television is different to that for a Conference League game on TNT Sport. You need to commentate to your audience, and the danger when you have more than two people working on a live commentary is that they start talking to each other rather than to the audience. And, as the audience, you feel as if you’re eavesdropping into a conversation. That doesn’t serve an audience because it doesn’t engage and include them.“Not for me, Clive.” How many times a day do you hear that phrase?Mike CottonA lot! It’s a phrase Andy Townsend first used regularly and [Ally] McCoist has taken to a different level! In all seriousness … the relationship between a commentator and a co-commentator is traditionally, and essentially, a trained broadcaster who can recognise the players and the drama and someone who has gone across the white line and can provide an informed, professional opinion on what we’ve just seen. I always bow to the experience of a co-commentator, and so if I said something and Andy looked at me and said “Not for me, Clive”, I fully took it on board. And ultimately it was a really good friend in a really gentle and sympathetic way saying: “Shut up! What do you know?!” If I was having one of those dream supper parties that people are often asked to put together, Andy and Ally would definitely be there. Both are great pals and wonderful co-commentators to work with, on and off the mic.View image in fullscreenClive Tyldesley on commentary duty alongside his longtime co-commentator and friend Andy Townsend.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAAre there any teams you were fond of commentating on who did not win the Champions League during your time covering the tournament for ITV?Eddie MunroAs a kid I was fond of Manchester United; I’m from Bury, my dad took me to Old Trafford when I was five and throughout my youth there was only one team in the world for me. But when I started to work that feeling became diluted by the fact I was commentating on my mates; my friends were out there, people I had met through football. It’s a different feeling when you’re commentating on people who you know. In regards to that period, from basically 1999 through the noughties, Premier League clubs were among the regular contenders to win the Champions League and I guess it would have been nice to see Arsenal get over the line. I had no affinity with the club but I always had a huge amount of respect for Arsène Wenger; he was never dismissive of any inquiries, he always tried to be helpful, and that team during that era, with the likes of [Thierry] Henry, [Robert] Pires, [Dennis] Bergkamp, were certainly good enough to win a Champions League final, and in Paris [in 2006] theyvery nearly did.Did you ever imagine in early 1972, when you opened the door to Room 7 at Kirkham Grammar School, where we were having an English lesson with Mick Clarkson, and announced “Preston are playing Man United” after listening to the FA Cup draw on your radio, that you would one day commentate on all those big matches for ITV and BBC?Philip SmithAs previously touched on, I entertained ambitions of being a commentator from an early age; I wasn’t the only kid who chased a football around the park and commentated to himself, but I meant it. I wanted to do that. It was my one and only ambition. English was my favourite school subject; I was that kid who loved to write essays and poetry, and wrote the match reports for the school magazine. So English teachers were a big part of my school life and I can remember two or three who had a big influence on me. Mick Clarkson was certainly one of those. He died this year and I was fortunate to have some contact with him, after years and years and years with no contact, before he passed away. That was lovely.View image in fullscreenClive Tyldesley is supporting the Football Association’s Silent Support Weekend. ‘It’s an initiative to promote true support and encouragement. Stop moaning, start cheering!’Photograph: Alex Broadway/The FA/Getty ImagesHow do you reflect on being an early supporter of England’s women’s team? I remember you being in Sweden for the 1995 World Cup, alongside Hazel Irvine (I was England’s ­press officer).Mark SudburyI’ve only been truly drunk twice in my adult life and once was with the England women’s football team in Sweden in 1995. It was after they lost [to Germany] in the quarter-finals, I was staying in the same hotel as the team and thought I could drink the likes of Clare Taylor and Kaz [Karen] Walker under the table; I was wrong! Nobody who follows women’s football needs telling the game had a very different profile in 1995 than it does in 2025 and some of the pioneers of the success England have enjoyed in recent years were in that team. So I look back fondly at being there, especially as it’s the only women’s football I have ever covered.Are you still a big fan of Joni Mitchell? If I’m not mistaken, you once called her “the first lady of rock”.Peter Walker­I’ve got pretty eclectic musical tastes; I like a bit of everything and make a point of listening to contemporary music, and more than anything I’m in awe of anybody who can write words that take my breath away. Make me think. Make me cry. Joni Mitchell certainly had that ability, she was one of the truly great songwriters of my youth. More than anything I admired how she could – can – take men apart in two lines. She knows us much better than we know ourselves.Clive Tyldesley is raising awareness of The Football Association’s Silent Support Weekend.

Tammy Beaumont’s 32 was the next highest contribution.England set Sri Lanka 254 to win after Nat Sciver-Brunt century: Women’s Cricket World Cup – liveRead moreSciver-Brunt’s rescue effort enabled England to regain their spot at the top of the World Cup standings, and means she has now surpassed coach Charlotte Edwards’s record for most hundreds scored at 50-over World Cups: this was her fifth. It is also the first since her wife, Katherine Sciver-Brunt, gave birth to their son, Theo, in March, and featured the memorable sight of the England captain lofting a six over deep extra cover to bring up the milestone, then cradling her bat like a baby while looking up to Katherine and Theo in the stands in celebration.“That one was for Theo,” Sciver-Brunt said. “They’ve come out to Sri Lanka to watch me, so I thought I’d give back to them for supporting me.“It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster in terms of missing them, but I got a bit more sleep when they were at home. Katherine had to take the flight on alone with Theo, which was a lot for her to commit to, so I’m glad I made it worth her while.”Sri Lanka started positively with the bat, reaching 95 for one after 20 overs, but an extraordinary 10-over spell from Sophie Ecclestone, which included three maidens, put a wrecking ball through their chase. Hasini Perera and Harshitha Samarawickrama were caught trying to hit out, while Kavisha Dilhari was bowled by Ecclestone attempting a slog sweep.The key breakthrough came in the 29th over, when the captain, Chamari Athapaththu – returning after being stretchered off in the sixth over with cramp – was deceived by Ecclestone’s flight and bowled through the gate.View image in fullscreenSophie Ecclestone celebrates the wicket of Hasini Perera, one of four the England bowler picked up.Photograph: Eranga Jayawardena/AP“Sri Lanka had built a partnership. I wanted [Ecclestone] to come on and steady the ship, not necessarily take wickets, but she did that as a bonus,” Sciver-Brunt said. “Her clarity in what she wants to do is brilliant. She makes it look very simple.”Sciver-Brunt followed up her match-defining innings with a couple of scalps of her own, while Charlie Dean tossed up a beauty to Vishmi Gunaratne and held on to an excellent diving catch at midwicket to dismiss Dewmi Vihanga, as Sri Lanka collapsed to 164 all out in 45.4 overs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

First, Beaumont stitched up Amy Jones by haring off for a nonexistent single after hitting the ball straight to Dilhari at cover, leaving Jones short of her ground running to the striker’s end. Then the left-arm spinner Inoka Ranaweera took three for 33, including removing Emma Lamb and Alice Capsey in the space of five balls in the 35th over.The 39-year-old Ranaweera, now into her 13th year of international cricket, has already proved that age really is just a number at this tournament, finishing with four wickets against India – including three in the same over. She was just as dangerous against England’s right-handers, getting plenty of turn and dip to bowl Lamb behind her legs, and having Capsey stumped after sliding her back foot just out of the crease.As so often, the England captain played a lone hand, in an innings which was without extravagance until its final stages. She ground out runs – 52 of her 117 came in singles – but came alive in the last four overs of the innings, striking six boundaries and enabling England to add 44 more to their total. Had Sri Lanka held on to that early chance against her, the match might have unfolded very differently.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Cricket World CupEngland women's cricket teamSri Lanka women's cricket teamWomen's cricketCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Not for the first time this season Anthony Belleau and Edoardo Todaro, French and Italian, had the run of the place, scoring two and one tries respectively, asNorthamptonwent to the top of the table, albeit temporarily, dispatching their nearest and dearest.Theirs has been a bitter-sweet opening to the season, squandering huge leads in games one and two, but here they timed their surges to perfection to come away with the win and their third bonus point out of three.Leicesterheld the lead for large stretches of a match that only really hit its straps in the second half, but by then we had not only tries in a seesawing contest, but the customary argy-bargy. Belleau’s second try, on the hour, clinched it.Roebuck hat-trick sets up nine-try rout as Sale pile more misery on NewcastleRead more“It’s not often French internationals become available, who are willing to leave France, for financial reasons,” said the Northampton director of rugby, Phil Dowson. “The market’s slightly different over there. For somebody who wanted to push his boundaries, not from a financial point of view, but from a rugby-development one, is very refreshing.”Belleau, a fly-half, came on early in the second half at full-back, replacing Tommy Freeman, who was playing his first match of the season, his 100th for Northampton. Freeman, in turn, had moved across to cover full-back when George Hendy limped off.Lower-leg injuries were the order of the first half. Luke Pearce, the referee, was off within 10 minutes with a calf problem. Hendy followed 15 minutes later, having landed awkwardly under a high ball, which stretched Northampton’s resources out wide, already missing at least three potential starters. A few minutes before the break, Freeman seemed to break down under a high ball, as if shot. He limped on until half-time, witnessing Northampton’s third try, scored down the other wing.Quick GuideRoundup: Russell leads Bath to the top while Bristol edge out ExeterShowFinn Russell ledBathto a bonus-point 38-17 victory overGloucesteron his return to the team despite picking up a yellow card that caused a brief second-half wobble. After his watching brief in the coaches' box last weekend, the British and Irish Lions fly-half (pictured meeting fans) returned as captain and displayed his full range of skills in his team's third successive Prem victory to top the table overnight, at least.Russell's faultless kicking supplied 13 points for Bath, who scored first-half tries through Tom de Glanville, Tom Dunn, Ollie Lawrence and Ewan Richards. Gloucester, who have now lost seven matches on the bounce in all competitions against their West Country rivals, crossed three times through Will Joseph, Ollie Thorley and Ben Loader – the last two coming early in the second half when Russell was off the field to close to 28-17. But Russell returned to kick his sole penalty of the contest before converting Richards' second try of the contest.Johann van Graan, Bath's head of rugby, said: \"Defensively Finn was excellent  and his kicking game is so good that you've just got to expect that of him. He's been away from rugby for 10 weeks, on holiday and then he had to regain his fitness, and he comes and delivers that for 78 minutes.\"Bristolovercame a 20-minute red card for Scotland international Tom Jordan to record a hard-fought 18-14 victory overExeterat Ashton Gate. Jordan was dismissed for a high challenge and their already depleted side were further hit by failed head injury assessments for Josh Carrington and Jack Bates. However, they still triumphed with tries from Bill Mata and Gabriel Oghre, while Sam Worsley kicked a penalty and a conversion, with Jordan adding a penalty. Ben Hammersley and Henry Slade scored Exeter's tries, with Slade adding the extras.Rob Baxter, Exeter's director or rugby, was frustrated after seeing his side fail to take advantage of Bristol's tribulations: \"Going out in the second half, we needed to take the game by the scruff of the neck and take charge. However we were zombie-like, walking in to going behind as we gave them penalty after penalty to allow them to piggy-back up the field.\"\"That effort was almost the highlight of my time here,\" said Pat Lam, Bristol's director of rugby, on his team's fighting spirit after going a player down. \"We had to improvise throughout and there was some real steel and guts out there as we had to play 30 minutes of that game with 14.\"PA MediaPhotograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images EuropeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Saints have absolutely blitzed opponents in the first half of their opening two matches, only to be hauled in by dramatic comebacks in the second. This time they were more circumspect in the opening exchanges. Theirs was the first try, two more returning Lions, Alex Mitchell and Fin Smith, combining, the former’s chip ahead bouncing wickedly into his hands to set up the latter for a run to the posts.But Leicester were if anything more direct. Billy Searle had opened the scoring with a penalty in the second minute, before Freddie Steward started and finished a fine score at the end of the first quarter.View image in fullscreenNorthampton’s Edoardo Todaro finds company at Franklin’s Gardens.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesNorthampton upped the pace in the 10 minutes to half-time. Todaro, the teenage Italian winger, finished on the right after Tom Litchfield and Freeman had combined down the left to put Saints back in front. When Searle retook the lead for the visitors with a penalty two minutes before the break, Todaro broke down the left and sent Tom Pearson into the corner for Saints’ third and a 17-13 lead.Freeman returned for the start of the second half, but it took one missed tackle to convince him he could not carry on. On came Belleau, and the complexion of the game changed again.First, though, Leicester retook the lead when Harry Wells was driven over after a series of penalties to the corner. Five minutes later, Belleau struck with his first.

Fraser Dingwall and Rory Hutchinson combined to slice open the Tigers’ midfield. Belleau was in support, but Leicester scrambled to stop him that time. No matter, he was on hand again to take Mitchell’s pass and score in the corner.Searle kicked another penalty to earn Leicester the lead once more, so the Saints came again. Dingwall thought he had scored just before the hour, but a knock-on in the buildup denied him. When Leicester cleared, Belleau took the kick with aplomb on the touchline, chipped over the advancing defenders and collected another wicked bounce to stroll clear to the posts.Smith’s penalty with 10 minutes remaining took Northampton beyond a score for the first time, but James O’Connor, the Wallaby veteran making his Tigers debut, secured Leicester a bonus point with one of his own three minutes later.That was it for the scoring, but Franklin’s Gardens was by then rocking to a new rhythm.

He returned to his earlier form in no uncertain terms under a confident ride by James Doyle, who was soon settled close to the early lead before grabbing a decisive advantage with a move to the front a furlong-and-a-half out.Aidan O’Brien closes on Group One record as Precise makes it 22 in 2025Read moreGewan, who runs in the green colours of the Chinese billionaire Zhang Yuesheng, crossed the line three-quarters of a length in front of the 7-4 favourite, Gstaad, foiling Aidan O’Brien’s tilt at a record ninth Dewhurst success. That Gstaad’s main market rival, Distant Storm, was another length-and-a-half away in third, with Zavateri, a Group One winner this season, fourth also gives a solid feel to the form.Gewan’s path through his juvenile season has also been a carbon-copy of that taken by Chaldean, the2,000 Guineas winner in 2023, in his two-year-old campaign three years ago. Andrew Balding’s colt is now top-priced at 12-1 to give the trainer a third win in the colts’ Classic since 2020.“We were saying coming into the race that he was overpriced,” Balding said. “His York performance [in the Acomb Stakes] was really good and you’ve got to forgive him Doncaster. So we weren’t without hope, but he’s still got to come and do it, he was given a brilliant ride and he’s a very good horse.”Gewan’s owner bought into the colt after his impressive win in the Acomb, and took the subsequent failure at Town Moor in his stride.View image in fullscreenJames Doyle lifts the Dewhurst Stakes trophy after winning the race on Gewan.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA“They’re very straightforward and they took the defeat at Doncaster without flinching, having just bought the horse,” Balding said. “That enabled us to just kick on and stick with the plan we wanted, and that’s the reason he’s here.“The soft ground didn’t help at Doncaster, but I don’t think it was just that. For whatever reason, he wasn’t at his best, but he was today. It’s a relief, but his work at home suggested he would play a part today.”As a son of Night Of Thunder, the2014 2,000 Guineas winner, Gewan is far from guaranteed to get the Derby trip, but a mile-and-a-half at Epsom promises to be ideal for Pierre Bonnard, the winner of the 10-furlong Zetland Stakes.O’Brien’s colt is by Camelot, the2012 Derby winner, and an impressive physical specimen already with plenty of scope for further progress over the winter. The May festival at Chester is seven months away, but it is easy to see Pierre Bonnard as a leading member of O’Brien’s squad for a meeting where he trialled Lambourn and Minnie Hauk,the Derbyand Oaks winners respectively, this year.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowChepstow:1.32 Deep Purple 2.07 Settle Down Jill 2.42 Blueking D’Oroux 3.17 Celtic Dino 3.52 Saint Segal 4.27 Bubble Dubi 5.02 Cooltobecareless.Goodwood:1.52 Spiced Rum 2.27 Funlover 3.02 Crazee Icon 3.37 Righthere Rightnow (nb) 4.12 Poseidon’s Warrior 4.47 Knights Gold 5.22 Day Of Grace (nap).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“He was a little green, but Christophe [Soumillon] was very happy with him and he’s a very straightforward horse,” O’Brien said. “I think he’ll be a Derby trial horse and we’ll go from there, but I imagine he is going to really do well over the winter months.”The Zetland is the only British Group race for juveniles at a trip beyond a mile but Soumillon reported that Pierre Bonnard, a general 16-1 chance for next year’s Derby, still had plenty left at the post.“When I started to ask him to pick up at the four-furlong marker, he changed gear really easily,” Soumillon said. “He still had plenty of power after the line so I’m sure he will be some horse next season.”Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHorse racing tipsnewsShareReuse this content"

St Vincent’s Shafiqua Maloney (1:58.57) was third.“I’ve barely raced this season so it was probably less of a struggle for me to go out there and want to give it something,” said Hodgkinson, who claimed a bronze medal at last month’s world championships in Tokyo after her campaign was marred by a hamstring injury. “The atmosphere out there is crazy so it was really, really fun.”View image in fullscreenKeely Hodgkinson breaks the tape to win the 800m in 1:56.53.Photograph: Ishika Samant/Getty Images for AthlosThe American Brittany Brown, the 200m bronze medallist at last year’s Paris Olympics, surprised herself with the sprint double.

She finished nearly two seconds faster than the Ethiopian Gudaf Tsegay, while the American Nikki Hiltz was third in 4:32.51.In the 100m hurdles, Masai Russell wrested the lead with two barriers to go to win in 12.52, the Olympic champion ending her season on a positive note after a disappointing fourth-place finish last month in Tokyo. Her American compatriot Grace Stark, who took bronze at the worlds, finished second in 12.60, while Alaysha Johnson (12.66) was third.The gold medallist at the Paris Games, Marileidy Paulino of the Dominican Republic, broke away down the final straight to win the 400m in 50.07, with Great Britain’s Amber Anning finishing a distant sixth in 52.86. Tara Davis-Woodhall, the long jump Olympic and world champion, won with an effort of 7.13m.Meanwile, Femke Bol, twice the 400m hurdles world champion, has announced she will switch events to compete in the 800m, a move Hodgkinson responded to on social media with: “Can’t wait to share the start line.”The 25-year-old Dutch athlete has won two Olympic bronze medals and ran a memorable anchor leg of the 4x400m mixed relay to capture gold for the Netherlands at the Paris Olympics. “I’m ready for the next challenge, a new stimulus, a completely different kind of race,” Bol said in an Instagram post. “It’s different from what I’m used to in the 400m hurdles, and I’m really excited to explore that.”Explore more on these topicsAthleticsKeely HodgkinsonUS sportsSerena WilliamsnewsShareReuse this content"

Gabon’s 4-3 win over the Gambia meansIvory Coasthave to defeat Kenya at home on Tuesday despite thrashing Seychelles 7-0.EgyptMohamed Salah scored twice as Hossam Hassan’s side beat Djibouti 3-0 on Wednesday in Casablanca and made up formissing out on Qatar 2022by reaching the finals with a game in hand. This will be Egypt’s fourth finals, even though they have yet to win a game. Bizarrely, the Pharaohs did qualify for the first World Cup, in 1930, but missed their boat from Marseille to South Americaafter a storm delayed them.MoroccoThe undisputed neutrals’ favourites at the last finals became the first African nation to reach the 2026 showpiece with a 5-0 thumping of Niger on 5 September in Rabat. The Qatar 2022 semi-finalists qualified from Group E with two games to spare after Tanzania’s 1-1 draw in Congo-Brazzaville. The Atlas Lions have reached the finals six times and willco-host the 2030 editionalongside Portugal and Spain (the three opening matches will be played in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay).TunisiaLikewise, the Carthage Eagles qualified with two games to spare in Group H. Mohamed Ben Romdhane’s last-gasp winner and the defiance of the goalkeeper, Aymen Dahmen, in Malabo against Equatorial Guinea ensured Tunisia reached the finals for a seventh time, although they have yet to progress beyond the group stage.AlgeriaVladimir Petkovic’s side secured their place with a comfortable 3-0 win over Somalia on Thursday. Mohamed Amoura scored twice, taking the Wolfsburg striker’s tally in the qualifying campaign to eight, and the captain, Riyad Mahrez, added another. Victory put them four points clear of second-placed Uganda in Group G with one round of matches remaining. It will be Algeria’s fifthWorld Cupfinals appearance but first since Brazil in 2014.See the full CAF standingshere.AsiaSix of eight nations have qualified directly, with one other place up for grabs via the intercontinental playoffs after a regional playoff in November.AustraliaAustralia reached the finals in June having recovered from a goal down to beat Saudi Arabia in Jeddah. Connor Metcalfe’s first goal for his country just before half-time restored parity, before Mitch Duke’s header from Martin Boyle’s free-kick three minutes into the second half completed the Socceroos’ revival. After failing to beat Bahrain and Indonesia, Australia ended their campaign with wins over Japan and the Saudis to qualify automatically, their sixth World Cup in a row.View image in fullscreenAustralia’s Mitch Duke heads the winner against Saudi Arabia in Jeddah.Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty ImagesIranThere was no little drama as Team Melli twice came from behind to draw 2-2 with their Group A rivals Uzbekistan on 25 March thanks to a double from Mehdi Taremi. Iran first reached the finals in 1978 but in six tournaments have yet to venture beyond the group stage. Their finest hour thus far came against the USA in Lyon at the 1998 finals, a 2-1 victory sparking delirium in the streets of Tehran. They met again in Qatar, the group match ending 1-0 in the Americans’ favour after a goal from Christian Pulisic in the 38th minute.JapanThe Samurai Blue cruised through their qualifying campaign, sealing their ticket with three group games to spare. Japan became the first nation to book their place through qualifiers by beating Bahrain 2-0 in Saitama after Daichi Kamada and Takefusa Kubo scored in the second half. They will compete in their eighth successive World Cup. In Qatar, Hajime Moriyasu’s side reached the last 16 only to lose to Croatia on penalties.JordanAli Olwan’s hat-trick triggered jubilation in Jordan as the 2023 Asian Cup runners-up qualified for their first World Cup finals on 5 June after beating Oman 3-0 in Muscat as South Korea beat Iraq 2-0. Jordan’s ruler, King Abdullah II, was pictured wearing a national team jersey as he watched the game from the Jordan embassy in London, where he was on a visit.South KoreaKorea reached their 11th consecutive finals with victory over 10-man Iraq at Basra Stadium on 5 June for what is expected to be Son Heung-min’s swansong. The Tottenham great and Taegeuk Warriors captain will turn 34 during the finals and has said it will be his last tournament. Korea’s formidable qualifying record is bettered only by Brazil, Germany, Italy, Argentina and Spain, although their underwhelming exit at the 2023 Asian Cup led to Jürgen Klinsmann being replaced by Hong Myung-bo, who oversaw victories against Oman, Jordan, Iraq and Kuwait in qualifying.UzbekistanWelcome, the White Wolves, who finally reached a World Cup finalssome 2,800 miles from home with a drab 0-0 draw with the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi. The Uzbeks are finally making an impact at senior international level, having reached the quarter-finals of the Under-17 World Cup, last 16 of the global Under-20 tournament and the Paris Olympics. In Abdukodir Khusanov, who made his (albeit shaky) Manchester City debut aged just 20, and the 22-year-old winger Abbosbek Fayzullaev, Timur Kapadze has two burgeoning talents at his disposal.See the full AFC standingshere.EuropeA total of 54 nations (Russia are suspended) are slugging it out for a place at next year’s finals.

New Zealand reached the World Cup for the first time in 16 years by beating New Caledonia 3-0 at Auckland’s Eden Park, the fortress of their 15-player code cousins the All Blacks. The win didn’t come easy, however. Goalless in the first half, Darren Bazeley’s side lost their captain, Chris Wood, to a hip injury early in the second. Only after an hour did Michael Boxall end the stalemate, scoring his first international goal aged 36. Kosta Barbarouses doubled New Zealand’s lead shortly after, before Eli Just wrapped up the result in the 80th minute.See the full OFC standingshere.South AmericaThe six direct spots have all been all filled.Boliviasecured the confederation’s playoff place with a surprise 1-0 win over Brazil in El Alto.ArgentinaThe holders claimed their spot on 25 March when Bolivia drew 0-0 with Uruguay. The big question hovering over Lionel Scaloni’s world champions is whether Lionel Messi will play at the finals. The Inter Miami forward has remained coy about his intentions. “Well, it’s like I’ve said before. I don’t think I’ll play the next World Cup – not because of age, but the most logical thing is that I won’t,” said Messi after helping Argentina beat Venezuela 3-0 last month. The evergreen 38-year-old then backtracked slightly, adding: “It’s about taking it one day at a time, trying to feel good, and above all being honest with myself. When I feel good, I enjoy it. When I don’t, honestly, I suffer, and I’d rather not be there. So we’ll see.”View image in fullscreenLionel Messi celebrates his second goal in the 3-0 win against Venezuela last month.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesEcuadorLa Trireached the finals – for the fifth time this century – on 10 June, a goalless draw against Peru in Lima enough to assure Ecuador’s place with two matches to spare. Ecuador, who finished second in the standings, beat the team who finished top, Argentina, 1-0 in Guayaquil in a match that ended with both sides reduced to 10 players by red cards. Argentina’s Nicolás Otamendi was sent off in the 31st minute and the hosts capitalised on their numerical advantage when Enner Valencia scored a penalty in first-half stoppage time. Ecuador were also reduced to 10 men when the Chelsea midfielder Moisés Caicedo was dismissed in the 50th minute.ColombiaColombia are a colourful feature of any finals and, after missing out on Qatar 2022, are back after James Rodríguez led his side to a 3-0 defeat of Bolivia on 4 September, Néstor Lorenzo’s side reaching the 2026 tournament with a game to spare.La Tricolorprogressed to the quarter-finals in 2014 and in Luis Díaz boast one of the game’s most compelling talents. The winger scored 30 goals in his last two seasons at Liverpool, helping them win the Premier League, and has been in scintillating form since a summer move to Bayern Munich. One to watch: Benfica’s record signing, Richard Ríos. The 25-year-old has made a dazzling start to life at the Estádio da Luz after his move from Palmeiras.UruguayMarcelo Bielsa, once the toast of Elland Road, guidedLa Celesteto their fifth successive World Cup with an impressive 3-0 victory against Peru at the Estadio Centenario on 4 September. In a mixed campaign Uruguay still managed to beat Brazil in Montevideo and surprise Argentina in Buenos Aires. The 70-year-old former Leeds manager is set for a third World Cup as a head coach. In 2002,El Loco’s Argentina side crashed out in the group stage but he led Chile to South Africa 2010 where they were beaten in the last 16 by Brazil. Bielsa has talent at his disposal, too. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez may have gone, but the Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde brings the fire. His club manager, Xabi Alonso, has compared him with a peak Steven Gerrard, saying: “Every manager would like a Valverde on the team.”BrazilCarlo Ancelotti’s side extended Brazil’s record as the only team to play at every World Cup by beating Paraguay 1-0 on 10 June to finish fifth in the standings, their lowest qualifying position. The five-time winners will make their 23rd appearance in next year’s tournament but, with limited preparation time after arriving in May from Real Madrid, the Italian coach is relying on team spirit and individual talent. “I think more tactical work is needed to refine game strategy. All of this can be very important, but the most important part is not the strategy, it is the attitude of the players on the pitch. For that, it doesn’t take much time to prepare,” says Ancelotti.ParaguayFor the first time since 2010 Paraguay will participate in the World Cup after a tricky 0-0 draw at home against Ecuador on 4 September. Gustavo Alfaro’s side impressed by holding off their opponents to snare the crucial point they needed. Miguel Almirón, who left Newcastle in January, and the former Brighton midfielder Julio Enciso, now at Strasbourg, are two players familiar to Premier League adherents. Almirón was 16 years old in 2010 and the Atlanta United captain still recalls watching Paraguay’s first match – a 1-1 draw with Italy in Cape Town – with his friends at his home in the San Pablo neighbourhood of Asunción. “That fills you with pride, to see your country in this huge competition,” Almirón said. “You always dream of that.”See the full Conmebol standingshere.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026World Cup 2026 qualifiersWorld CupUS sportsexplainersShareReuse this content"

World football’s governing body would like to outlaw the practice but will be guided by legal opinion in its first review of the relevant regulations for 11 years.A source involved in the process said Fifa was working towards making its rulebook more robust with a view to new regulations being ready early next year. This weekUefa blamedthe “relevant Fifa regulatory framework” for its decision to allow Villarreal v Barcelona to take place in Miami in December and Milan v Como to go ahead in Perth in February. That is understood to have caused considerable irritation at Fifa because under existing regulations it is not their decision to make.Uefa gives ‘reluctant’ approval for domestic games to be played abroad this seasonRead moreThe regulations were written in 2014, when domestic leagues moving matches to overseas territories was not regarded as a live issue after thecollapse of Premier League plans for a 39th gamein 2008. The then Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore’s proposal for an “international round” was ahead of its time, but fans were outraged and it was not pursued elsewhere.Fifa can block what its rulebook refers to as an “international match” only if the correct processes are not followed. The rules state that such matches must be authorised by the football associations of the participating clubs and of the territory where a game is to be played and by the respective confederations.La Liga and Serie A gave their approval at the start of the season before passing the matter to Uefa, which provided its ruling this week. The issue now rests with the host FAs – the US Soccer Federation and Football Australia – and their respective confederations, Concacaf and the Asian Football Confederation.La Liga has scheduled Villarreal v Barcelona for Inter Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium but US Soccer’s approval is not guaranteed because there are concerns that Major League Soccer would suffer commercially if European and possibly Mexican league games could also be staged in the country.Fifa is working towards its regulations being more clearcut despite concerns over its legal position. The US-based promoter Relevent Sports brought an anti-trust lawsuit against US Soccer in 2019 after a request for Barcelona to play Girona in Miami was denied the previous year, with Fifa named as co-defendants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though she shot just 7-of-21 from the field, Wilson made 17 of 19 free throws and controlled the game at both ends, earning her second finals MVP award in three years.Quick GuideWNBA finals 2025ShowScheduleBest-of-seven series.Fri 3 OctGame 1:Las Vegas 89, Phoenix 86Sun 5 OctGame 2:Las Vegas 91, Phoenix 78Wed 8 OctGame 3:Las Vegas 90, Phoenix 88Fri 10 OctGame 4:Las Vegas 97, Phoenix 86Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Chelsea Gray and Jackie Young added 18 points apiece, combining for seven of Las Vegas’s 12 three-pointers. Jewell Loyd chipped in 12 points, and Dana Evans added 10 off the bench as the Aces displayed the depth and precision that have defined their dominant run.The Aces seized control from the opening tip, shooting 55% in a 30–21 first quarter behind Wilson’s 12 points. The Mercury rotated three defenders on her – Alyssa Thomas, DeWanna Bonner and Kalani Brown – but none could contain her blend of footwork and strength. Las Vegas quickly found rhythm from beyond the arc in the second quarter. Evans hit back-to-back threes, followed by makes from Loyd and Gray, extending the lead to 42–23. By halftime, the Aces led 54–38, having made nine of their 17 three-point attempts while committing only one turnover.Phoenix’s frustration boiled over midway through the third quarter when coach Nate Tibbetts was ejected after arguing a foul call against Monique Akoa Makani. His exit seemed to deflate the Mercury’s brief surge, and Las Vegas carried a 76–62 advantage into the final period.Phoenix opened the fourth quarter on an 8–0 run to trim the deficit to six, but Gray responded with consecutive threes to halt the momentum. The Mercury never drew closer than eight points the rest of the way. Kahleah Copper was relentless, scoring a career playoff-high 30 points on 12-of-22 shooting before fouling out in the final minutes. Thomas notched another triple-double – 17 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists – but also had nine turnovers and visibly labored after injuring her right shoulder late in the first half.The Mercury were already without Satou Sabally, their leading postseason scorer, who was sidelined with a concussion suffered late in Game 3. Her absence forced Phoenix to reshuffle their frontcourt rotation, with Bonner starting in her place and Brown seeing rare minutes early. Despite their depleted roster, the Mercury’s resilience reflected a strong playoff run that included upsets of the defending champion New York Liberty and top-seeded Minnesota Lynx.The Aces’ victory capped a dominant stretch that saw them win 25 of their final 28 games after a 53-point loss to Minnesota in early August. Las Vegas became the first team since the Houston Comets’ four straight titles from 1997 to 2000 to win three championships in a four-year span.The Aces averaged over 90 points per game in the finals, overwhelming Phoenix with spacing, ball movement and relentless pace. They never trailed in Game 4 and rarely looked threatened throughout the series.Explore more on these topicsWNBALas Vegas AcesPhoenix MercuryUS sportsShareReuse this content"

His consultancy has echoed much of this zeal through a stream of policy papers arguingthat artificial intelligenceshould be put at the heart of government.However, critics are concerned that Blair, who is known to be closeto Keir Starmer’s government, has been able to set the agenda without enough public scrutiny. There have also been questions over the reliance of Blair’s consultancy on donations from the Silicon Valley billionaire Larry Ellison, a friend of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.Ellison, who this year brieflybecame the world’s richest person, has donated or promised more than $300m to Blair’s consultancy.The documents released to the Guardian under freedom of information legislation show how the 12 diners discussed the government’s evolving policies on artificial intelligence at what was described a “salon dinner”.Do you have information about this story? Email henry.dyer@theguardian.com, or (using a non-work phone) use Signal or WhatsApp to message +44 7721 857348. For the most secure communications see theguardian.com/tipsHosted at the end of January in the five-star Corinthia hotel, the diners included Lonne Jaffe, the managing director of the US venture capital firm Insight Partners, which invests in technology companies.Also present were Alex Kendall, the chief executive of Wayve, which is seeking to develop self-driving cars; Nigel Toon, the head of Graphcore, which produces computer chips; and Marc Warner, the chief executive of Faculty AI, which published a joint document last year with TBI on how AI could be usedto improve public services.A spokesperson for Clegg, who aspresident for global affairsat Meta jointly hosted the dinner, said :“During his time at Meta Nick Clegg regularly met with government ministers and leaders from other tech companies. As the executive responsible for policy and global affairs that was literally his job.”A TBI spokesperson said: “This event was a discussion about a range of issues between tech leaders with a minister in attendance. No company paid to attend.”The companies represented at the dinner said they had not donated money to TBI, nor hired it.The dinner illustrates how Blair’s consultancy works to push his pro-technology agenda. Having rapidly expanded, TBI is activein 45 countries with its staff numbering more than 900. Its latest accounts show its income totalled $145m in 2022 from a mixture of fees for its advice and donations. The identities of many of its donors and clients are kept secret.The consultancy has drawn criticism that its policy positions have been shaped by its donors’ commercial interests – anaccusation it has denied. It was also criticised for continuing to take money from Saudi Arabia after the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Blair isin lineto play a leading role in the reconstruction of postwar Gaza.Weeks before the dinner, the government had given TBI a confidential summary of its action plan for artificial intelligence days before it was due to be published. On 9 January, Feryal Clark, then a minister in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), spoke to Jakob Mokander, TBI’s science policy director, at her instigation.The next day, an aide to Clark emailed Mokander to say: “It was great talking to you yesterday. As a follow-up please see this confidential summary of the action plan. Thank you for agreeing to amplify publication of the plan on Monday through your network and supportive quotes.” Mokander replied: “Thank you for sharing the action plan (confidentiality noted).” Blairbacked the action plan, aimed at expanding the country’s role in developing and deploying artificial intelligence, when it waspublished on 13 January.Asked why it had given early sight of this document to TBI, a spokesperson for the DSIT said: “We make no apologies for regularly engaging with stakeholders. It is standard practice to share embargoed information with them ahead of announcements.”The TBI spokesperson said: “It is standard practice for governments to consult experts and engage a wide range of stakeholders when shaping policy. The AI opportunities action plan rightly drew on our published work, as the footnotes make clear.”Quick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

When her Las Vegas Acesfinished off a four-game sweep of the Phoenix Mercuryon Friday night to become only the second team in WNBA history to win three titles in a four-year span, the final horn felt less like a climax than a verdict: the best team of the era led by the best player of the era. When the dust settled the 29-year-old from Columbia, South Carolina, had achieved a quadrafecta no player in the NBA or WNBA had ever managed: winning the scoring title, the Most Valuable Player award, Defensive Player of the Year honors and MVP of the finals in the same year.Thanks to Wilson, a team who’d looked likethe next great American sports dynastybefore slipping from their perch a year ago was back at the mountaintop. But anyone who watched the front half of the season knows this was the least expected of Aces’ three banners. For most of the year Las Vegas didn’t give the appearance of a playoff team let alone a champion. They staggered through injuries and misfires, dropped coin-flip games and wore the tightness of a group playing beneath its standard. If dynasties are supposed to hum, this one coughed and sputtered.Quick GuideWNBA finals 2025ShowScheduleBest-of-seven series.Fri 3 OctGame 1:Las Vegas 89, Phoenix 86Sun 5 OctGame 2:Las Vegas 91, Phoenix 78Wed 8 OctGame 3:Las Vegas 90, Phoenix 88Fri 10 OctGame 4:Las Vegas 97, Phoenix 86Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.To understand how we got here, flash back to 2 August, when the Aceswere boat-raced by 53 pointsby the Minnesota Lynx on national television, the worst loss in franchise history and the ultimate stress test of the culture Becky Hammon has spent four seasons building. Las Vegas were a moribund 14–14 then, six weeks from the finish line and barely in the postseason frame. Wilson walked out of Michelob Ultra Arena replaying the wreckage, drafting and redrafting a message she knew had to cut through without burning down what morale remained. She workshopped it with her partner Bam Adebayo, the two-time Olympic gold medallist and Miami Heat captain and then hit send to the team chat:If you weren’t embarrassed from yesterday, don’t come into this gym. You’re not needed or wanted here. We need the mindset to shift, because that was embarrassing.The next day, Vegas routed Golden State and never lost again in the regular season, ripping off 16 straight wins to nail down the No 2 seed while Wilson sprinted past historyto a record fourth MVP trophy. Hammon matched the tone with a structural tweak that mattered: players would build and present their own scouting reports before coaches weighed in. Accountability stopped being a slogan and became the operating system. “A’ja comes in with a laptop,” Hammon told ESPN. “They’ll kick the coaches out and do their thing.”Only then does the image that will live on come into focus – two nights before the sweep, before a sold-out Phoenix crowd of 17,071 at full boil – Wilson rising, spinning and feathering home an eight-footer with 0.3 seconds left in Game 3 as DeWanna Bonner and Alyssa Thomas crowded her airspace. That shot – thought to bethe first buzzer-beater over a married couplein basketball history – didn’t just win a game. It effectively sealed the Aces’ place in WNBA lore.The sweep will be the headline, but the spine of this title is that midseason decision to choose standards over excuses. It carried through an edgy playoff run that tried to jar them loose: Seattle forced a decisive Game 3 thatneeded Jackie Young’s late put-back; Indiana dragged theminto an overtime Game 5that would have cracked lesser champions. “There were a lot of doubts besides in that locker room,” Aces point guard Chelsea Gray said. “We stayed the course and trusted the process the entire time.”Las Vegas AcesAnd always, there was Wilson: shrinking options at the rim and expanding them at the elbow, the league’s most terrifying deterrent and its cleanest late-clock answer in the same body. There’s a special joy in watching her go about her work. If her Game 3 winner was the cinematic flourish, her Game 4 closeout was the masterclass in control when the jumpers weren’t falling. On a night where she missed 14 of her 21 attempts from the floor, Wilson changed the terms instead – owning the glass, spiking shots, jumping passing lanes, making a home at the stripe and going 17-for-19 there. Possession by possession, she bent the game back to her will.This year pushes past tidy résumé-building and into something rarer. Wilson wasn’t just the best player in this series; she was the best player in the sport, shouldering into a GOAT conversation that has long begun with Cheryl Miller’s legend and Maya Moore’s incandescent peak. She bears the weight lightly, which is part of the spell. Thetambourine bit at the podiumduring the post-game presser – equal parts Baptist church joke and credo on patience and faith – landed because it sounded like her: unguarded, joyful, before quietly matter-of-fact and clear-eyed in expounding on the work it takes to win.View image in fullscreenA’ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces, left, celebrates in front of Satou Sabally of the Phoenix Mercury after making a basket during Game 2 of the WNBA finals.Photograph: Ian Maule/Getty ImagesAsked to redefine greatness now that she’s stacking championships at a historic clip, Wilson widened the lens. “Obviously I would still [say] banners, but I think greatness is … it’s who you’re around. This is greatness. This group here, we were battle-tested, top to bottom battle-tested. We showed up every single day with a mind of being great,” she said in Friday’s aftermath. “You’ve got to be great when the lights aren’t on you. You’ve got to be great when nobody’s in the gym with you. You’ve got to be great when you may not get anything on the end. That is what greatness is to me because that is consistency and that is just you doing the right things because it’s right.”Hammon’s appraisal supplied a blunt epigraph to the season: you can debate basketball’s Mount Rushmore if you want, but Wilson is “alone on Everest”. That sounds like flattery until you try to explain Wilson’s 2025 without resorting to the obvious truth that she controlled both ends of the court more completely than any of her peers. The Aces’ stars toggled roles without complaint – Young from flamethrower to rebounding guard; Gray from closer to organizer; free-agent addition Jewell Loyd (now10-0 in WNBA finals games, by the way) from gunner to grit – and the bench minutes that once felt like a liability turned into leverage thanks to Dana Evans and company. But it all orbited the same gravitational pull of their 6ft 4in talisman. The closer a series got to wobble-time, the calmer Wilson seemed to breathe.Where it goes from here is business as much as basketball. Much of the WNBA’s workforce, including key Aces, approach free agency as the deadline for a new collective bargaining agreement ticks louder. That uncertainty hovered even as the confetti fell. It also hovered over a fortnight of renewed friction between the league office and locker rooms. Reports of commentsattributed to commissioner Cathy Engelbertabout players being “on their knees” in gratitude – which the Englebert has partially disputed – landed like a cymbal crash against the reality on the floor: the players are the product. The Mortgage Matchup Center crowd underscored that pointwith a cacophony of boosduring Englebert’s trophy presentation, while Gray did it from the dais. “When you have great players, you need to treat them like that. That’s payment. That’s treatment. That’s revenue share,” she said. “There’s no league without the players.”In the end, two scenes bookend the truth of this season: an August text on the night of a 53-point embarrassment, and an October fadeaway that hushed a cauldron in the desert. The improbable midseason swerve into inevitability – the choice to recommit, then the refusal to blink – turned both into canon. The Aces rediscovered their standard at rock bottom and rode it back to the summit. Perhaps the verdict, delivered by the player who just authored a season like no other, was in from the start.Explore more on these topicsLas Vegas AcesWNBAPhoenix MercuryUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

He is also such a hate-filled little man that members of his own family are publicly rebuking him.During Donald Trump’s first term, in 2018, Miller’s uncle, Dr David Glosser, wrote apiece for Politicocalling Miller an “immigration hypocrite”. Glosser noted that if Miller’s hardline immigration policies “had been in force a century ago, our family [Jewish refugees who fled to the US from Europe to avoid persecution] would have been wiped out”.Then, in July, a woman calledAlisa Kasmer, Miller’s cousin and former babysitter, wrote a viral Facebook post calling the Trump aide “the face of evil”. Miller’s cruelty, she said, left her feeling “ashamed and shattered”.While some of his extended family can’t seem to stand him, Miller does have a very enthusiastic cheerleader in the form of the Fox News host Jesse Watters. Last October, Watters claimed that his show’s audiencebelieves thatMiller is “some sort of sexual matador” and asked Miller to comment on this. TheMaga-dorresponded by telling young men to “be the alpha … show that you are not a beta … Be a proud and loud Trump supporter and your dating life will be fantastic.” This is terrible advice for many reasons, not least of which is the fact that gen Z women are themost liberalgroup in the US.I’m afraid it doesn’t end there; a couple of weeks ago, the Fox News host had Miller’s wife,Katie(a Maga bigwig in her own right), on his show to chat about how sexy Stephen is. “What is it like being married to such a sexual matador?”Watters joked. Very inspiring, apparently; he wakes up every morning excited about how he is going to “defeat the left”.It doesn’t even endthere. This week, Watters once again sang his favourite man’s praises on TV, calling Miller a “policy savant”.He added: “Men who are high-value men, like Stephen Miller, take risks. They’re brave, they’re unafraid, they’re confident and they’re on a mission. And they have younger wives with beautiful children.”Watters went on to claim that the representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez “wants to sleep with Miller … it is so obvious”. The whole spiel was so weird that even Watters’s colleague, Greg Gutfeld, appeared disturbed. “That was pretty creepy,” Gutfeld said.While Watters doesn’t seem to need an excuse to praise Miller, this week’s episode wasn’t entirely unprompted. Rather, Watters was reacting to an Instagram video in which Ocasio-Cortez called Miller a clown and urgedpeople to laugh at Maga.“Miller looks like he is so mad that he is 4’10” that he’s taking that anger out at any other population possible,” AOC said in the video. “Laugh at them! Laugh at them!”It’s not particularly clever to mock someone’s height. (AOC hassince saidshe loves “short kings” and was talking about how “big or small someone is on the inside”.) Nevertheless, the lawmaker is absolutely correct that the way to get under the skin of people in Maga-land is to laugh at them. Ghouls like Trump and Miller don’t care if you call them evil or hypocritical. They don’t care if you use facts and logic against them. What they care about is being laughed at. What they really can’t stand is being mocked. “Humor has long been one of the most effective weapons of anti-authoritarian politics,” Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a scholar on fascism,noted last yearafter Democrats started calling Republicans “weird”.You can see how thin-skinned Maga is by the ridiculous amount of traction that AOC’s throwaway joke has had.Mediaite has reportedthat three primetime Fox News hostsfactcheckedMiller’s height: Watters, Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity. Ingraham even had Miller on her show and played the clip to him while he squirmed in discomfort. “What a train wreck, what a train wreck … that lady is a walking nightmare,” Miller replied. He also clarified that he is 5’10”. A very big boy.Steven Cheung, who is White House director of communications, also responded to Ocasio-Cortez’s commentswith a poston his official Twitter account saying: “Sounds like @AOC is often used to the shorter things in life.” He added a pinching hand emoji, which is sometimes used to suggest a small penis.The Trump administration should not be underestimated by any means. They are organized, they are ruthless, and they are proving extremely effective at implementing theiragenda. But while we shouldn’t underestimate Trumpers, it’s helpful to remember that they’re not invincible. AOC is right: we should laugh at them. It’s either laugh or cry.French appeals court increases sentence of Gisèle Pelicot rapistHusamettin Dogan contested his first conviction, telling the court Pelicot’s husband had invited him over so it was OK. The court found otherwise this week, increasing Dogan’sprison sentence to 10 years. Pelicot’s lawyer had told the court: “[C]onsent is personal, not delegated. Consent is obtained directly and not by proxy from a husband.”Women may carry a higher genetic risk of depressionNew researchpublished inNature Communicationshas found 16 genetic variants linked to depression in women, compared with eight in men.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Week in PatriarchyFree weekly newsletterGet Arwa Mahdawi’s weekly recap of the most important stories on feminism and sexism and those fighting for equalityEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One thing’s for sure: it’s all about himSat 11 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 11 Oct 2025 19.06 EDTShareIn this mortal existence, we all have dreams. As a child, I wanted to be an astronaut, until I found out there’s no Taco Bell on the International Space Station. That’s the thing about dreams: they often lead to cruel disappointment. Such is the fate of President Donald Trump, his hope of winning aNobel peace prizedashed – not by a lack of fast food, but by common sense.The 2025 award instead went to theVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who was barred from running for president by her nation’s courts. Machado acknowledged Trump in her acceptance of the honor, saying she appreciated his support of Venezuelan democratic reform. At least he’s keeping an eye on democracy somewhere.Trump could take that as a bit of a consolation prize and focus on next year, when the effects of a burgeoning Gaza peace deal become clear. But losing is for losers, so Maga supporters are, predictably, upset about it all. Sean Davis of the Federalist declared theNobel was actually “beneath” Trump and “a joke”. If so, I wouldn’t mind never hearing about it again.Whenever I’d get a C on a test, I’d mutter to myself about how grades are a construct of oppression and college isn’t actually important. “The Man” made me go to school and read about Kant or physics or plenary authority. Like I even care about that. Not caring is a superpower in a cruel world that cares not for our feelings or our desires. Sometimes the only power we have is to withhold our interest and project indifference. When we lose a game, it’s a lot easier to deny its legitimacy than to accept failure – like unplugging a PlayStation after getting blown up by a landmine in Call of Duty.That might be the masterstroke of the modern American conservative movement. Lose an election? Must have been cheated. Finding it hard to justify the deployment of the military on American streets? The enemy is incredibly clever and is hiding. Didn’t win the peace prize? Alfred Nobel must have been a cuck and a beta and a loser. Might as well unplug the PlayStation that is democracy.Trump’s entire worldview seems predicated on a notion that life is unfair, the system is rigged and he alone can balance the scales back toward justice. This all makes sense as a rhetorical strategy, and it has proved popular in an age in which most people deem the American government to be about as straight as a bowl of chicken noodle soup. But it doesn’t play so well when his grievances are focused almost exclusively on himself and his own personal gripes. Indicting his enemies, trying to get late-night talkshows canceled and whinging about an award that apparently has no value – it all starts to get rather tiresome, like your mom re-litigating that time Beverly forgot to send a thank-you card after her wedding. How many times can one hear about the relatively low cost of postage before it’s time to move on to a different subject?Trump’sapproval rating is in the dumpster. Granted, I can’t remember the last time a president was consistently popular since 9/11. So maybe this is just the new normal. Or maybe lots of people are tired of hearing how one specific person is having a bad day (again) because they didn’t win a medal.Frankly, I’d like to hearmore about me. I’m incredibly self-absorbed (I work in the media, after all) and desperately crave approval. Where’s my medal? When will my parade happen? Which head of state will subtly roll their eyes when I’m not looking? I wrote this in between power naps, and it was incredibly difficult to get up to work after the first one. WhenDonald Trumpgives a speech, he should be addressing me directly. I have needs, too, you know? I have done nothing to earn that attention, but I’m asking for it. When mapping out domestic policy, you should be asking yourself: “How does this affect Dave Schilling?” “What will Dave think of this?” “Can we name an aircraft carrier after someone whose father served in the air force?”And if I don’t get what I want, I’ll say it doesn’t matter. I’ll find something else to obsess about, some award that I can easily procure through intimidation or coercion. I’ll kick a child in the knees and demand their honorable mention ribbon for Little League.I think it’s finally time I get the award I don’t want, but definitely deserve.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionNobel peace prizecommentShareReuse this content"

News is even more transient than it was in the days when it became tomorrow’s fish and chips wrapper.Easier to not worry,she’ll be right.When Anthony Albanese reiterated his commitmentnot to have another referendumin his term in office, after his “splendid” lunch with King Charles at Balmoral Castle, he effectively closed the door on a final resolution to the debate about the sort of society Australians want in the 21st century.Two years on it is clearer than ever that the conduct of the 2023Indigenous voice to parliamentreferendum was damaging, brutal and divisive, based on encouraging ignorance and apathy –if you don’t know, vote no.Yet more than 6 million Australians found out and voted to begin righting an historic wrong.Since then, a few tentative moves, but virtual silence. First Nations leaders – representatives of the bottom million – have not even been noticeably present in the big policy forums focused on the hot buttons of “cost of living” or “productivity” or “housing”. It’s comfier under the “white blanket of forgetfulness”.In her snappy little book When Australia Became a Republic, Esther Anatolitis documents the long, slow history of political change; of the times when the powers-that-be resisted transformation until it was inevitable and normal – and no one really noticed.As co-chair of the Australian Republican Movement, the change Anatolitis focuses on is tied to relations with Britain: the painful process of separation in the 19th century, the battles over the constitution both in the colonies and in negotiation with Britain, the appointment by the prime minister of an Australian governor general despite the objections of the palace, the dismissal, bicentenary, and Mabo and Tony Abbott’s ill-fated awarding of imperial honours.It might work out in the end, but is near enough good enough? What is there to be afraid of in re-examining a 19th-century document?Australians are rightly proud of their robust electoral processes: the secret ballot, compulsory voting, an independent Australian Electoral Commission. But survey after survey shows that they are woefully ignorant of political history and civics.As the US president takes a sledgehammer to many established institutions and norms in his country, the first response of opponents is that “it’s against the constitution”. As of August, 384 legal challenges had been mounted against his executive orders, 130 upheld so far. (One exception has stood out: a legal resistance led by a patchwork coalition of lawyers, public interest groups, Democratic state attorneys general, and unions has frustrated Trump’s ambitions. Hundreds of attorneys and plaintiffs have stood up to him, feeding a steady assembly line of setbacks and judicial reprimands for a president who has systematically sought to break down limits on his own power.)‘Don’t panic’ could be Albanese’s mantra but that doesn’t mean we aren’t concerned about life, the universe and everything | Peter LewisRead moreAustralians are woefully ill-informed about the nation’s founding document yet still wrap it in aspic.Blackfella Films tackles this in the new series The Idea of Australia, based on my book of the same name,broadcast on SBS this week.The second episode focuses on the making of the nation and features a series of vox pops at the Federation Dome in Sydney’s Centennial Park.The interviews were shot less than a year after the 2023 referendum, but even in this most affluent and highly educated part of Australia, those walking in the park that day knew little about the constitution or federation. “I don’t know much about that stuff,” one young man said suggesting “Captain Cook invaded Australia with a bunch of convicts at Port Botany”.I don’t blame him or the others interviewed. Civic education in Australia is slapdash at best, and the incentives to not pay attention are seductive. This is why the community independents movement is such a threat to the status quo, as it demands people accept responsibility locally and personally, and imagine and exercise their political agency.Conservative political leaders like to talk about rightsandresponsibilities. The primary responsibility of any citizen is to pay attention – only then can informed decisions be made and change occur.She may be right, but as we are witnessing in the US, there are no guarantees.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of Australia, and an executive producer of the SBS/Blackfella Films television series of the same name, hosted by Rachel GriffithsExplore more on these topicsIndigenous voice to parliamentOpinionAnthony AlbaneseAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

This debate about the ‘purest’ format to view certain films only risks putting off movie-goersSat 11 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 11 Oct 2025 16.38 EDTShareOn what sort of screen should you watchOne Battle After Another? Paul Thomas Anderson’s new film about revolutionary radicals in a ravaged United States comes in a plethora ofslightly different, vaguely confusingformats.It was originally shot in ultra-rare, 70-year-old VistaVision celluloid, but there are only four cinemas in the entire world that can actually accommodate this –one in London, three in the US. There is also an Imax version on 70mm celluloid film, the more common digital Imax format, and a 70mm film projection for some select cinemas. And, finally, there are the majority of currentcinemas with more standard digital projection, which also happen to have quite big screens for you to gaze up at moving pictures in the dark.With attendances falling and cinemas under threat, I understand why there has been a push to make seeing films more of an event in recent years. Since the pandemic,Tom Cruise has put himselffront and centre of a campaign to encourage people into the cinema.Christopher Nolan has also made several of his films with the grand Imax screens in mind: his upcoming The Odyssey is said to be thefirst blockbustermade entirely with Imax cameras (screenings for the film in the highest-grade formatsold out a year in advance).“Between the vision-filling screen and sound that chases you around the auditorium, it’s more like stepping into the movie than watching it at a safe distance,”purred the Odeon websitefor its Imax screenings of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.There is a clear desire to put the emphasis on an all-encompassing feast for the senses; inevitably, the cost of these special screenings is usually higher than a traditional cinema ticket.I’m breaking free from watching TV on my laptop in bed. I’m going back to the big screen | Caitlin CassidyRead moreI love going to the cinema and I try to see new films this way as much as is feasible. But I do think that the focus on seeing things in the cinema now is becoming over-egged – especially when it is given some sort of moral imperative, or if an idea forms that a certain premium version is the “true” experience. Cinema used to be a relatively accessible and affordable mass pursuit. Any move away from this, while potentially bringing short-term gain, may be a mistake in the long run. The fear lingers that by foregrounding limited and premium offerings – akin to going to the opera or a West End theatre – lesser cinemas could be further diminished, and audiences discouraged if a certain format isn’t availableor is simply too expensive.Anecdotal evidencefrom true believers (in the right locations) suggests that seeing One Battle After Another in VistaVision provides the greatest pleasure: the colours are more beautiful, the look and feel is purer, like seeing a painting in person rather than a reproduction in a book. Other cineastes (orLetterboxd bros, per modern nomenclature) say that it must be seen in Imax formats for the true thrill-ride. I personally find viewing at an Imax a little like you’re watching tennis – moving your head this way and that to follow where you should be looking, and the emphasis on immersive viewing a little too literal. A friend suggests that unless you have the perfect seat near the centre of an Imax room, the experience is actually inferior.What is it that we love about seeing a film in the cinema? I don’t think it can be defined by the dimensions of the screen alone. It’s being in a dark room, free from distractions, with a reasonably comfortable seat, surrounded by others, watching the film on a big – or big enough – screen above: sometimes it’s in a vast theatre, sometimes it’s a room for 20 people. All have their merits. And as the host of oneUS film podcast suggestedwhen asked what was the best place to see One Battle After Another: “In the movie theatre you like the most.”In the end, I saw the film on an “XL” screen at my nearest multiplex: I can’t quite figure out if that meant a bigger screen, bigger seats, or bigger buckets of popcorn. I’ll admit the thrilling visual aspects must hit well on an even more souped-up screen, but they were pretty great from my vantage point, too. As were its kinetic energy and frantic score, dragging you through a story both compellingly strange and laugh-out-loud funny. Granted, there are alsovalid criticismsto be made.One of my formative moments engaging with “serious” film was when I was aged about 14 and saw Rear Window. It made me instantly realise there could be more to a film than most of what I had seen up to that point. The fact that I happened to watch it on an early-1990s, medium-sized cathode-ray TV one bored Saturday afternoon, almost by accident, didn’t diminish the effect. A love for film can blossom in many formats. Under the right conditions,everything is cinema.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But moderate voices are still in tune with the majorityGordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Sat 11 Oct 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 11 Oct 2025 12.37 EDTShareNigel Farage portrays his Reform UK party as a unique phenomenon that has burst on to the global stage, its meteoric rise an exceptional epochal event. But this week, in every one of Europe’s major countries and from India and Thailand to the US and Argentina, hard-right, anti-immigrant, anti-globalisation parties like his are also ahead in the opinion polls.In last Saturday’s Czech elections, the rightwing, pro-Putin populist Andrej Babištoppled prime ministerPetr Fiala.National Rally, which has just brought down yet anotherFrench prime minister, is leading the polls for both the French presidency and parliament. In Germany, thefar-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)is currently the most popular party. Hungary’s Fidesz party, Robert Fico’s pro-Russian Slovakian coalition and the Brothers of Italy are already in government, while theFreedom party of Austria(FPÖ), the Netherlands’Freedom party(PVV) and Belgium’sVlaams Belang– all hardline nationalists – are part of an international coalition of anti-internationalists, inspired by far-right propagandists likeSteve Bannon, seeking to dethrone the international rule of law, diminish human rights and destroy multilateral cooperation.The populist nationalist surge exposes a new and unavoidable truth that democrats ignore at our peril: an authoritarian ethnic nationalism – once thought toppled with the Berlin Wall – has replaced neoliberalism as the dominant ideology of our age, giving us a world of firsts: “America first”, “India first”, “China first”, “Russia first”, “my tribe first” and often “my tribe first and only” regimes. It is this ethnic nationalism that helps explain why the world is now composed of91 autocracies and only 88 democracies, and ethnic nationalism is the force behind the violations of international human rights law not just by Russia in Ukraine but in almost everyone of the world’s 59cross-border conflicts and civil wars.It is important to understand the underlying forces, common to almost every country, that have fuelled this new age of nationalism. It starts with a widely felt sense that a globalisation that was open but not inclusive has been a free for all that has not been fair to all.For more than a decade, leaders have not only been slow to respond to the millions who feel left out and left behind, but also to the changing balance of global economic power, moving us from a unipolar world once dominated by the US to a multipolar world of competing superpowers, and from a rules-based order to a power-based one. The ethnic nationalism that this has incited means free trade is giving way to protectionism. Where economics used to drive politics, the politics of nationalism is now driving economic decisions, and already more than 100 countries are running mercantilist policies marked out by reshoring and friend-shoring and by bans on cross-border trade, investment and technology transfer, sinking international cooperation to its lowest ebb since 1945.But all is not lost. The cement is still wet, and even as it hardens we can find hope in the common sense of the global public. In asurvey by Focaldatafor the Rockefeller Foundation, of 36,000 people in 34 countries we find a clear majority are more resistant to an exclusionary nationalism and more willing to embrace international cooperation than many of the leaders who rule over them.Across the world there is, perhaps surprisingly, only a small group of hardened anti-internationalists representing 16.5% of the global population (even if 25% in today’s US) who either feel coexistence between ethnic and religious groups is impossible or have a zero-sum mindset that if they or their country do well, it has to be at the expense of others doing badly.But there are another 21% at the opposite extreme, whom we might call committed internationalists, who either still see cooperation across borders through open trade as a positive sum win-win, or are what the US philosopher and writerKwame Anthony Appiahcalls “rooted cosmopolitans”.1:35Nigel Farage 'doesn't like Britain': Keir Starmer takes dig at Reform leader – videoThe vast majority of the global public are somewhere in between: not narrow, inward-looking nationalists, as “America first” ideology would suggest, or all-in cosmopolitans. They are patriotic but don’t see the world as in a never-ending struggle between the “us” and the “them”, adversaries permanently set apart from each other in an unbridgeable divide.Do the majority in the middle prefer a duty-free or a dutiful world? Are they prepared to accept obligations beyond their garden gate or city wall? Yes, under certain conditions. A first group, 22%, will back humanitarian action to relieve suffering and are prepared to act out of altruism, supporting emergency help for disaster zones. Those we might call “good cause” multilateralists feel the pain of others and believe in something bigger than themselves.A second group comprising 22% are pragmatic multilateralists who want to know that any taxes paid out for international development are spent well. And there is a third group, 21%, self-interested multilateralists, who will endorse cooperation if they can see that it benefits them and their communities, whether it be through guaranteeing them food on the table or peace and security.So a clear majority can be constructed not just for humanitarian aid if money is well spent but also for global action to deal with global problems, like climate crisis and pandemic prevention, as long as this case is argued on grounds of enlightened self-interest, and if we stress the reciprocal benefits that flow to them and their own country. And thus for those who have long wondered whether we cooperate out of need or if we have a need to cooperate, the answer is both.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because this is party conference season, when politicos always lose the plot | Simon JenkinsRead moreAnd while in-depth polls tell us that across the west, illegal immigration is currently the biggest national issue – and no one should doubt that it must quickly be brought under control – the snapshots of opinion also tell us that the public are even more concerned about what is happening in their own lives and within their own local communities. Last month, Keir Starmerspoke movinglyabout how what’s good about Britain can drive out what’s bad, doing so precisely because in most western countries, “broken” and “in decline” are the words people have for years most commonly cited when asked about both our economy and society.But as the prime minister also reminded us, the far right is more interested in exploiting grievances than ending them. Farage hailed Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget as “the best Conservative budget since 1986”. But he would also enact Truss act two – what she planned to deliver – the biggest ever cuts in public services. Reform’s plan toreduce public spending by £275bnwould not repair downtrodden communities but ravage them, turn citizen against citizen and wreck any spirit of solidarity. Under a Farage hard-right regime, you will not be able to afford to be sick, disabled, poor or vulnerable. Every day from now on, and in every constituency, Reform should be asked which hospital, which school and which public service will be the first to be cut or closed.“Faragism” is neoliberalism at its most inhumane, more destructive even than monetarism, and vindictive far beyond austerity. What the public are telling us all over the west is that they want their governments to rebuild our economies and our civic societies . “Reform” and its global allies should be exposed day after day for policies that would devastate both. And for those of us who believe our best days could be ahead of us, we can go beyond highlighting Reform’s hypocrisy by setting out a case for a better Britain that appeals not just to idealists, but to pragmatists, to self-interest, and to the everyday compassion of the British people.Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010Explore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageKeir StarmerLabourThe far rightFar rightcommentShareReuse this content"

At least they will be back for ChristmasHelen Serafinowicz is the writer of Motherland and AmandalandSat 11 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 11 Oct 2025 03.33 EDTShareMotherhood has given me two kids and a TV show (and a spin-off). When I first entered Motherland, it was quite clear this was a mad world, and ripe for the picking. Trying to find your tribe when you have absolutely nothing in common with your fellow tribespeople, other than babies of the same age, is very difficult, but also rich in inspiration for comedy.Over the years, I would write down little moments or observations that made me chuckle: arriving at a kids’ party dressed exactly like one of the dads; watching in amazement as a mum asked an usher to turn the heating up in the auditorium on a school trip to see The Lion King; the mum whose advice to her children if they got lost in a crowd was “think like a paedophile” (we used this – with permission – in the Halloween episode of Motherland).My document of observations grew into the TV programmeMotherland, and, more recently,Amandaland. But now my little inspos have left, and I don’t know what to do with myself. They both started uni last week (at opposite ends of the country). I was dreading this moment, and as a single mum I’m finding it unbearable. The house is so quiet. The kitchen is permanently clean and there are no trip hazards in the hallway. Both gone. Two for none. It’s so sad.My daughter was the first to go. It was a slick operation. Three hours down the M11 and M25 with her hijacking the music and whacking me every timeshe saw a yellow car.We had a time slot to collect her keys and between the two of us we lugged her stuff up a couple of flights of stairs to her new home; a 6.5-sq metre room with the basics: a desk, chair, bed, storage and noticeboard (no drawing pins). It was quite clean apart from a Cheerio I found in the wardrobe. After I used all my God-given strength to get the single sheet to fit her small double mattress (I should have checked this) and unpacked an awful lot of my clothes and makeup that she had pilfered from my bedroom, it was time to say goodbye. The sight of her walking away (in my boots) hit me in the stomach.View image in fullscreenLucy Punch and Anna Maxwell Martin in a 2017 episode of Motherland.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyA week later, it was five hours up the M6 with an overnight stop in a fully booked budget hotel bursting with emotional families on the same path. Campus was rammed with packed cars full of duvets, air fryers and anxious students desperately trying to hide their nerves. I hadn’t learned my lesson from the previous week and almost passed out, straining like I was in labour to get another single sheet over another small double mattress. Also forgot drawing pins. I didn’t want to cramp my son’s style by hanging around, saying hello to his neighbours, so we had a solid hug and I managed to sneak in a kiss on his cheek without inflicting any embarrassment on him whatsoever. He waved, then disappeared into his building, jangling his keys like he’d just bought his first house.As I drove off, there were a bunch of students holding banners from their various societies that said things like BEEP FOR NETBALL and HONK FOR WATERSPORTS, so I honked and they cheered and I cried for most of the five-hour drive home with nobody to pass me a salt and vinegar Disco.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I felt utterly bereft, then I switched on the hall light and the bulb popped out of the socket and the cat ran in and puked up a tiny snout and a tail. I walked the dog to the pharmacy today to collect my son’s backup EpiPen for his lobster allergy. (Though I’m quite sure he’ll manage to avoid lobster for the next few years.) The walk took me past the kids’ old primary school. The sound of the little children playing in the playground started me off again and I had to dig deep to control my lip wobble as I said my son’s name, collecting his prescription.I owe so much to my children. Motherland wouldn’t exist without them. In our first Motherland Christmas special, Kevin is testing Minecraft (pronounced Mein-Kraft) to see if it’s suitable for his girls. I got most of his dialogue from my son and his experience of having his homestead set on fire and his pigs stolen by his so-called friend.I’m hoping this next chapter of parenting will deliver another wave of anecdotes I can use in my writing, although it seems the world goes quiet. The mums sign up for upholstery courses while the dads have their midlife crises.Apparently, Gordon Ramsay wore his son’s underpants after he dropped him off for the first time. I am sad but I think I’m fine not wearing my kids’ underwear. There are support groups and counsellors that specialise in empty nest syndrome but instead I’ve signed up for netball on Tuesdays and Thursdays and I’m going to have a good old sort-out of the house ready for when they’re back for Christmas.

They spurred me on my journey from a tough council street in the north-east all the way to the cabinet. We had no heating upstairs when I was growing up, and we struggled with damp. But that story’s not unique: it’s shared by so many working people across Britain.That’s why I have been fighting for changes that will make a difference to working families. Such as reviving Sure Start for a new generation, funding childcare from nine months old, rolling out free breakfast clubs, expanding free school meals for half a million more children and capping the branded items schools can require. Together these changes save working-class families thousands of pounds.As co-chair of the Child Poverty Taskforce, I am clear everything is on the table, including removing the two-child limit. As deputy leader I would continue fighting for policies that change the lives of working people: investment in public services, ensuring the full delivery of our employment rights bill so people get fair pay for a fair day’s work – change that makes Labour members proud of this government, proud to campaign, proud to win again.Lucy Powell:The cost of living crisis, Covid, austerity and the global financial crisis have all hit working-class communities hardest. Each has deepened inequalities in class, region, education and opportunity. Addressing this is what this Labour government is about.We have an economy that serves the few, not the many – a “trickle-down” model that needs rewiring. I want to see a much stronger sense that tackling economic inequality and fairness unites everything we do. That’s one of the reasons I strongly support lifting the two-child benefit cap at the forthcoming budget, looking at Gordon Brown’s measures on gambling taxes to pay for it.As deputy, I would help to seize back the political megaphone to set the terms of the debate, being clear about what we are doing to reshape the economy in the interests of working-class communities – buses and trains back in public hands, a new energy company, GB Energy, owned by us all, more dignity and security in work and at home with the employment bill and renters rights bill.The job of the deputy leader isn’t to write a separate budget or policy programme but to ensure that our values shine through, and what we are doing is rooted in the communities we are here to serve.Stephen Heinson:Sadly, neither candidate seems able to acknowledge that the cost of living crisis is really a crisis of our failed economic model. There’s a direct link between declining living standards and unrestrained corporate greed: the private energy companies skimming off huge profits from ballooning household bills, for instance, or the property developers and letting agents cashing in on renters’ misery in a broken housing market. Tackling this crisis meaningfully would mean defying the corporate interests of Labour’s CEO donors.How are you going to address the rise of the far right in this country?Dominique Sandring, LondonBP:The Labour movement has been defined for generations by our core values – solidarity, compassion, fairness and social justice.As deputy leader, I’d campaign with hope and optimism, underpinned always by those Labour values that mean so much to our members. We should be proud of our values – proud to stand up for them, never ashamed of them.The far right feeds off fear and negativity, exploiting the struggles of people across the country and offering false solutions and empty promises. Let me be clear: we won’t win by parroting the language of Reform UK and Nigel Farage.We are Labour and we must govern, campaign, and win as Labour. We must deliver on the change that we promised voters so we can build the society we all want to see. That means expanding free school meals, renewing Sure Start and reforming employment rights to make work pay.It is only a united Labour party, the greatest vehicle for social justice this country has ever seen, that can deliver real change in our communities and country.LP:Fighting the forces of division and hate is the challenge of our age. The future of our democracy depends on us winning the battle of hearts and minds, showing that mainstream progressive politics is a force for change. We’ve got to up our game. As deputy leader I would help Labour do that.We shouldn’t try to out-Reform Reform UK. Nigel Farage wants the country to believe that immigrants are the root cause of all our problems. I wholeheartedly reject that. Yes, we need secure and strong borders as a foundation of a secure and fair country, but the reasons for deep-seated inequalities go much deeper.We need to seize back the political megaphone and set out far more strongly our diagnosis of what is really wrong with this country, and what Labour is doing to fix it. We have an economy that hasn’t worked for ordinary people for decades. From Margaret Thatcher to austerity, Covid and the energy crisis, those with wealth and assets have done well. For everyone else, life has got harder and less secure.We need to show that every single thing we are doing is in service of addressing this – to tell our own story about how we’re fixing the real problems.Dominique Standring:Reading the answers side by side, my sense is that Lucy Powell has answered the question better in that she has identified that Reform are winning the battle of hearts and minds – and that Labour’s message is not cutting through. Bridget Phillipson talks of Labour’s values being “solidarity, compassion, fairness, and social justice”, but I have not seen much evidence of this with the Labour government: from its stance on family reunification for those with visas to the genocide in Gaza and focus on ID cards. Crucially, neither of them have answered the “how” part of my question in any detail.Why isn’t Labour adopting a wealth tax? Can you give an example of a country where such a tax has been successful?Norma Spark, LondonBP:I’ve always believed in progressive taxation – it’s at the core of building a fairer and more equal society. The nature of our economy has been changing, with more people earning money from the wealth they hold; we have started to address that through the changes on carried interest, by increasing capital gains tax. And of course through non-dom reforms – you can’t simply be allowed to opt out of paying your fair share.It’s right that we all pay a fair share to deliver a better public realm, and that the broadest shoulders carry the greater burden. In government, I’ve put those values into action already, taking on the private school lobby to end tax breaks so we can invest in state education. I’ve been pilloried for it across the rightwing press, but I’ll never back down on that. I’m not afraid to take on vested interests to improve public services.The chancellor sets and makes our policies on taxation, but with a seat at the cabinet table and as deputy leader, I’d be relentlessly focused on pushing for more investment in public services so we can fix the foundations of our society and give everyone the best chance in life.LP:Let’s be honest, we need to tell a much stronger story about fairness and addressing inequalities, and whose side we are on. That must run through everything we do, including the budget.We have an economy in which those with assets and wealth do very well, yet for ordinary working people or those on fixed incomes, life has got harder and harder. Turning that round should be at the core of what this – and any – Labour government is about.That’s why I’ve been clear that the two-child benefit cap needs to be lifted. It’s also why we need to recognise how trust in us has been damaged by mistakes on the winter fuel allowance and proposed cuts to Pip. These measures did not seem fair. We need to give a much clearer sense of whose side we are on – and in whose interests we are governing.It’s not my job to write the budget, but it will be my job to ensure that what we do is connected with the views and experiences of our broad movement and the communities we seek to serve.Norma Spark:Bridget Phillipson cites steps the Labour government has taken or is taking to address tax inequity – all of which I applaud, but I hope Labour can be bolder. Lucy Powell recognises the need for Labour to “tell a better story” and acknowledge the mistakes it has made. This doesn’t address the benefits or pitfalls of a wealth tax.Last year, the G20 leaders agreed to engage cooperatively to ensure high net-worth individuals are effectively taxed. Neil Kinnock advocates an annual wealth tax of 2% on people with wealth of more than £10m. And Gordon Brown is advocating raising tax on the UK gambling industry to lift 500,000 children out of poverty. Though the deputy leader of the Labour party does not set the budget, they do have an important seat at the table. In advocating for options for a wealth tax, both candidates could signal their commitment to a more equitable and fair societyandtell a good story!Would you tell Keir Starmer some home truths about policy, about sidelining the north-west – and about his perceived arrogance?Lee Stringfellow, BuryBP:I know this government has made mistakes – I won’t pretend otherwise, but I will promote our achievements. I have fought for policies that are true to Labour values – investing in state education by ending private schools’ tax breaks, reviving Sure Start, rolling out free breakfast clubs.I have argued for policies true to my values, to Labour’s values, and I worked with Angela Rayner doing the same. She challenged us as ministers to always go further for working people, to be impatient for the change they deserve. With my own mandate as deputy leader, I would continue that role. But I absolutely refuse to pit one area of our country against another. It’s the role of the deputy leader to bring all the parts of our party together, from every corner of our country.Last year I campaigned up and down the country to get Labour candidates elected, I’ve not stopped as education secretary and I won’t stop as deputy leader. With local elections and elections in Wales and Scotland around the corner, the role is going to be more important than ever.LP:This isn’t about personalities, it’s about how we use power effectively after 14 years out of government, and we have some achievements to shout about. The problem is they are being drowned out by unforced errors. Anyone who knows me knows I’m a straight talker, unafraid to be an honest voice. I told home truths on welfare, and maybe it wasn’t well received, but it won’t stop me speaking truth to power. But I won’t snipe from the sidelines or take to the airwaves.Discussion isn’t dissent – it’s vital if we’re to rebuild our electoral coalition. I really want this government to succeed. With the mandate of members I would have a strong, independent role, outside but alongside government. It’s a responsibility I would take very seriously and use wisely, but I think it’s self-evident that we can do better.There’s been too much groupthink, disconnected from the voices, talents and experiences of all of our broad movement, which is Labour’s strength. I’ll be that bridge with our members and elected representatives, pushing us all to be the best version of a Labour government we can be.Lee Stringfellow:All Bridget Phillipson has done with her answer is given a response Starmer would want me to hear. She has zero credibility as a serving minister to fight against the wrong decisions and actually listen to members.As for Lucy Powell: what is wrong with a little discord and actually saying what you believe – and indeed, what the party members and voters believe? This government has tied itself in knots with its no-sense fiscal rules and left itself with little room to manoeuvre; and all the while, who suffers? Normal taxpayers.We are heading for electoral oblivion sooner than we think if we do not grasp the nettle this year with some zinger policies that outflank Reform. Powell answered the better of the two – but I suspect Starmer will sideline her. Thanks for your answers, but this longtime Labour voter is now considering the Lib Dems.Why isn’t the government considering rejoining the customs union? What will you do to convince Starmer to see sense?Toby Hannam, BristolBP:Back in 2016 I argued that Brexit would inflict serious economic damage on areas such as Sunderland. No part of the UK had more at stake than the north-east of England. That’s why I campaigned for remain and was one of the first MPs to call for a second referendum on the details of the deal.But those decisions are in the past – we need to focus on the future. What businesses need most now is certainty to drive economic growth and stability. The progress we have made securing anSPS trade dealwith the EU is essential for British businesses, as are the protections secured for British steel. In my own portfolio we’re working on opportunities to once again boost educational exchange through schemes like Erasmus+, but of course there is more to do.I will say that I think we need to change this debate and challenge toxicity. Reform are far too happy to whip up anger about immigration, and I won’t do it. My family came to Britain as immigrants, and our story is shared across this country. I want to campaign and win on Labour values, not use the language of Reform.LP:I voted remain, and worked cross-party during the Brexit years on a proposal called Common Market 2.0, because I felt strongly that we needed to respect the outcome of the referendum, even though it was not what I voted for. One of the main reasons why we ended up with Boris Johnson as prime minister and a hard Brexit, losing so much of the so-called red wall, is because we didn’t listen and accept that a majority voted to leave and wanted Brexit.We shouldn’t reopen old wounds but focus on how we can make that botched Brexit deal better so ordinary people can feel the benefits – whether that’s action on e-gates to ease travel, closer ties on goods to lower food prices, or joint action on defence, security and irregular migration.People voted for Brexit, they voted for Johnson – and they voted for us in 2024 because they want change: more control over their lives and an economy that works for them, not just those at the top. The most important thing now is that we deliver the change people voted for.Toby Hannam:This is very much the party line response. The fact is we are willingly economically harming ourselves with the appalling deal Johnson and David Frost made. This idea that nothing can be done is symptomatic of the utter capitulation Labour have allowed. They’re too frightened to go near the issue due to the howling of the press and Reform – even when the benefits to the country are so clear.The deals that the government have obtained in office are such small beer. Other countries use the customs union and are not in the EU. Personally I would rejoin tomorrow. Without the significant improvement that the customs union could bring, our economy will continue to stumble on anaemically. The massive rebuilding that Labour wants to achieve won’t happen because they need at least another term.Why doesn’t Labour commit to building council houses?Sarah Woods, North YorkshireBP:Labour’s £39bn social and affordable homes programme aims to deliver 300,000 new homes, 60% of them, or 180,000, for social rent – including new council homes. This is six times more than delivered in the past decade. It’s the biggest increase to social housing in a generation.I grew up in a council house in Washington, Sunderland, raised by a single mother and reliant on free school meals. I know first-hand the importance of council housing.Angela Rayner’s sense of the urgency of this was exceptional – she knew, as I do, that children need secure, warm, dry and safe homes in order to have the childhood and the opportunities all of us deserve.The changes Angela announced to the right to buy scheme – protecting existing social housing stock to meet housing need and delivering a fairer, more sustainable scheme – are essential. Councils will be able to retain 100% of receipts from the sale of right to buy so it can be invested in delivering more social homes.I’ve secured more than £600m to boost construction skills to ensure we have the workers we need to build housing – including introducing new construction technical excellence colleges in each region of the country.LP:We have committed to building more council housing – the biggest such commitment in a generation. Maybe people don’t hear enough about the good things Labour are doing, and that’s something I will seek to put right.The legacy Angela Rayner leaves on housing is a great one. As well as being a colleague and friend, I saw up close what an effective minister she was. More social homes, changes to right to buy so we don’t lose as much stock as we have been doing, a massive housebuilding programme and much more. Having a secure home is the bedrock of everything.In government I led on legislation, and I was proud we included a strengthened renters rights bill in the king’s speech.Sarah Woods:Bridget Phillipson has helpfully provided figures, but this raises further questions. The social and affordable homes programme has a 2035 horizon. Is the intention to build 18,000 council houses a year? According to Shelter England, as of 2023-24, there are 1.33m households on the social housing waiting list. In that year, their figures show a net loss of homes for social rent of 650. I am very glad to hear of the changes to protect existing stock from right to buy, but there will still be a loss through housing stock deterioration. Unfortunately, a considerable “Brexit benefit” was to lose free movement of workers, leaving a hole in construction capacity. It is good to see that Bridget Phillipson has secured funds to boost construction skills. However, this doesn’t deal with the immediate problem.Lucy Powell raises a very valid point on Labour’s messaging. I would like to see clearer messaging – Green party leader Zack Polanski is a breath of fresh air, showing how it’s done.Both candidates agree on the importance of a secure home. My husband and many of my schoolfriends were raised in council housing. The costs to this country from the failure of successive governments to replenish this asset are immense. A Labour government should be building with the rapidity of the 1950s, when 200,000 council houses were built annually.Do the candidates agree that reports that Earth’s carbon sinks are failing should be a turning point for humanity?Sigurdur Bennett, EdinburghBP:The climate crisis is the biggest challenge facing humanity. I’m proud of the strong climate action this Labour government has taken to bring down emissions, showing leadership on a global stage.The weakening of the global consensus on the urgency of climate action is profoundly troubling, and Labour must continue to show that leadership. This is another example of where I’ll be ensuring we stay true to our values. I want the world of tomorrow to be a world worth living in, not a planet on fire, and the responsibility falls to us to make that happen today.We’re already seeing the effects of global warming – wildfires,failing carbon sinks, flooding. But with decisive action it’s not too late to turn things around. We simply must not let ourselves be blown off course by climate deniers and opponents criticising our vital net zero policies.LP:We have a strong agenda on the environment, and I’m proud to have Ed Miliband’s backing to be the next deputy leader. Ensuring there’s a just transition, tackling the climate crisis and achieving clean power by 2030 is a huge task, but one that Labour is up for.It’s not the job of the deputy leader to write an alternative policy manifesto – we were just elected with a strong programme on climate and nature. As deputy leader I would make sure that Labour is shouting about what we’re doing to improve our environment and motor ahead to net zero – and call out the backwards policies of Reform and the Tories, which would cost jobs and investment and worsen the climate and nature crisis.Sigurdur Bennett:Repeated failure of Earth’s carbon sinks now seems to be a serious possibility, which is frightening. Not that you’d know it from the candidates’ responses. Which might explain why the government may incentivise further North Sea oil drilling. What can you say about such an initiative? Only that it’s insane.Explore more on these topicsLabour party deputy leadershipThe panelLabourBridget PhillipsonLucy PowellcommentShareReuse this content"

Further details are not available at this time and her loved ones have asked for privacy, according to a family spokesperson.Keaton’s death came as a shock across Hollywood and the rest of the world. The actor had not been in the public eye for some months, but no illness had been announced.An ethereally self-aware comedy genius: the loss of Diane Keaton is devastating | Peter BradshawRead morePeoplequotesa source close to the actor saying that Keaton’s health had “declined very suddenly” over the past months, adding that even many of her longtime friends “weren’t fully aware of what was happening”.Her frequent co-star De Niro told the Hollywood Reporter: “I am very sad to hear of Diane’s passing. I was very fond of her and the news of her leaving us has taken me totally by surprise. I was not expecting her to leave us. She will be missed. May she rest in peace.”In a statement shared with the Guardian, Meryl Streep, who starred alongside her in Marvin’s Room, called Keaton: “Our American treasure: indelible singular girl and brilliant artist. Crushing news that she is gone, but her smile and her style and antic spirit will live on film and in our hearts forever.”View image in fullscreenKeaton and DiCaprio in Marvin’s Room.Photograph: Tribeca Productions/AllstarLeonardo DiCaprio, who acted alongside both women in the film, called Keaton “brilliant, funny, and unapologetically herself” on Instagram stories. “A legend, an icon, and a truly kind human being.”Bette Midler, Keaton’s co-star in The First Wives Club,said on Instagram: “The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. She was hilarious, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!”Mary Steenburgen toldDeadlinethat her co-star in the Book Club films was “magic. There was no one, nor will there ever be, anyone like her.

And, though she didn’t know it or wouldn’t admit it, man she was a fine actress!”Keaton directed two music videos for the singer Belinda Carlisle, who wrote on X that she was “kind and eccentric and I was blessed to know her”.Also posting on X, the actor Ben StillercalledKeaton “One of the greatest film actors ever. An icon of style, humor and comedy. Brilliant. What a person.” Director Paul Feigpostedthat he was “so honored to call Diane Keaton a friend.

She was a very special person and an incredibly gifted actor, who made each of her roles unforgettable.”Viola Davis, meanwhile, who did not share a screen credit with Keaton, although they were both originally slated to star in 2019’s Otherhood, posted to Instagram: “No!! No!!! No!! God, not yet, NO!!! Man… you defined womanhood. The pathos, humor, levity, your ever-present youthfulness and vulnerability — you tattooed your SOUL into every role, making it impossible to imagine anyone else inhabiting them. You were undeniably, unapologetically YOU!!! Loved you. Man… rest well. God bless your family, and I know angels are flying you home.”View image in fullscreenWith Allen in Annie Hall.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyAn enduring and singular icon of cinema since her Oscar-winning turn in 1977’s Annie Hall – which her director, writer, co-star and former boyfriendWoody Allenbased heavily on her own life – Keaton starred in some of the key movies of the last half century.Her keen self-deprecation, gift for comedy and distinctive dress sense – rarely seen without a hat, turtleneck or man’s tie and wide trousers – made her both highly distinctive and impossible to emulate.Her first major film role was oppositeAl Pacinoin Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather – she reprised the role of Michael Corleone’s wife in the two sequels. Other Oscar nominations were earned for her performances in Reds (1981), Marvin’s Room (1996) and Something’s Gotta Give (2003).Meanwhile, dramas such as Looking for Mr Goodbar, Shoot the Moon and The Good Mother established her as an actor unafraid of playing difficult and unlikable women.View image in fullscreenKeaton in Love and Death.Photograph: ZUMA Press, Inc./AlamyKeaton and Allen first collaborated on the stage version of Play It Again, Sam, for which she was Tony nominated in 1971, before going on to work together for eight films, including Sleeper (1973), Love and Death (1975) and Manhattan (1979).Diane Keaton: ‘I love Woody. And I believe my friend’Read moreIn 1993, Keaton took on the role written for Mia Farrow inManhattan Murder Mysteryand remained a staunch supporter of Allen after the accusation by Farrow that he had abused their adopted daughter, Dylan.Writing on Instagram in the wake of Keaton’s death, both of Allen’s adopted daughters with his wife, Soon-Yi Allen, posted their tributes to the actor, with Manzie saying she was “absolutely heartbroken”.Keaton went on to make a remarkable number of other popular and landmark comedies as well as those with Allen, including Baby Boom, Father of the Bride (and its sequels), The First Wives Club and Book Club.The sequel to that film, Book Club: The Next Chapter, released in 2023, looks set to be one of the last projects featuring Keaton.Speaking to the Guardian to promote it, she addressed why she chose to remain so prolific, making seven films since the start of the pandemic.“It gives me an opportunity to get to know more people in a different realm,” she said. “I love it. It’s all interesting. It’s never dull, ever, life.”She also explained her love for photographing doors and abandoned shops, which she said she found poignant “because life is haunting! You have an idea in your mind of what it is, or what it should be, or what it could be. But it’s not that at all! It’s just things going up and down!”View image in fullscreenDiane Keaton in a scene from The Godfather (1972).Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyIn 1996, Keaton adopted a daughter, Dexter (named after Cary Grant’s character in The Philadelphia Story), and, four years later, a son, Duke. “Motherhood has completely changed me,” she said. “It’s just about like the most completely humbling experience that I’ve ever had.” Despite well-publicised relationships with some of her co-stars including Pacino andWarren Beatty, she remained unmarried.Keaton cared for her own mother from her diagnosis with Alzheimer’s in 1993 until her death in 2008, and devoted much of her ownautobiographiesto recounting her mother’s life and publishing her diaries.“She was everything to me,” she said of her mother. “She was wonderful. She was my example for what you can do with life. She was the heart of everything that was best.”‘God, life is so strange’: Diane Keaton interviewed in 2023 on dogs, doors, wine and why she’s ‘really fancy’Read moreKeaton was also the chief care-giver to her brother,Randy, who died in 2021, after years of mental-health problems.As well as acting primarily for the big screen, Keaton did some TV work, including as a scheming nun in Jude Law TV series The Young Pope. She also had a sideline flipping properties in the US, as well as lending her name and creativity to ranges of homeware, clothing, glasses and wine.In 2017, she was given alifetime achievement awardby the American Film Institute, in which she thanked her collaborators and sang Seems Like Old Times, the song her character sings in Annie Hall.In 2022, she paid tribute to her parents while putting her hands into cement to be immortalised on the Hollywood walk of Fame, saying she was “still that little Dianey” who dreamed of being a movie star.“As a girl growing up in Orange County, the mere thought of Hollywood Boulevard seemed like a mysterious dream that would never come true,” she said.In December 2024, in what seems likely to be her final performance shared with the public, Keaton released her first single, a festive song calledFirst Christmas, posting the video to Instagram. An enthusiastic adopter of social media, herlast postwas in April to mark National Pet Day, and featured a photograph of the actor with her beloved golden retriever, Reggie.She is survived by her two younger sisters, Dorrie and Robin, as well as by Dexter, 29, and Duke, 25.Explore more on these topicsDiane KeatonWoody AllenAl PacinoWarren BeattyAlzheimer'sHealthDementianewsShareReuse this content"

It was the summer of 1999 and he was back in his home city of San Diego, on the same streets where he had spent his surreal teenage years, flitting between suburban domesticity and his new life as a prodigious music writer, spending long weeks in the company of such 1970s gods asDavid Bowie,Fleetwood Mac, the Allman Brothers andLed Zeppelin.Shooting was about to begin on a scene in which his 15-year-old self – renamed “William Miller” and played by the unknown actor Patrick Fugit – receives career advice from Lester Bangs, the legendary music writer who was Crowe’s hero and mentor, played byPhilip Seymour Hoffman. “It’s gonna get ugly, man,” he says. “They’re gonna buy you drinks, you’re gonna meet girls, they’re gonna try and fly you places for free, offer you drugs – I know, it sounds great. But these people are not your friends.”As everything was set up, Crowe says, he felt a sudden pang of emotion, so strong that he decided he needed to speak to one of the prime movers at DreamWorks, the studio that had come up with the movie’s $60m budget.“I was justgiddy,” he says. “So I picked up the phone and I called the office. I said, ‘I wanna talk to David Geffen’ who was one of the founders of DreamWorks. And so he gets on the phone and is like [deadpan], ‘Hello.’”He recalls the next bit in the most corny, aw-shucks voice he can muster. “I said, ‘Hello! David Geffen! I’m standing here, and I’m looking at Philip Seymour Hoffman … and he’s playing Lester Bangs … and it’s my home town … and we’re making this movie … and, you know, I just can’t help but say:How did this happen?’”Geffen, he says, gave him a somewhat crushing response. “He said, ‘How did this happen?Jerry Maguire.’ And he hung up. He hung up!”To some extent, it was an accurate answer: the success of Crowe’s third film as a director – which starred Tom Cruise, received five Academy Award nominations and won Cuba Gooding Jr an Oscar – had indeed opened the way to the movie that would be titled Almost Famous. But there was also an undeniable magic at work, to do with the dizzying tale this new film told, and how it brought the romance and excitement of the best rock music to life. The right people had recognised this straight away: when Geffen’s fellow DreamWorks founderSteven Spielbergfirst read Crowe’s script, Crowe tells me, he simply said, “Shoot every word.”And here we are, a quarter-century later. Almost Famous is one of those rare films parents show their kids as a rite of passage. Its cast – Fugit, Hoffman,Kate Hudson, Billy Crudup,Frances McDormand– contribute to a viewing experience where warmth and charm never seem to fade. In a modern context, it has arguably taken on a subtle new meaning, evoking an increasingly distant America full of hope – and how much the country’s fragile connections to that past are being severed by its current mood of discord and nastiness.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Billy Crudup, Patrick Fugit and Crowe  on the set of Almost Famous, 2000.Photograph: Cinematic/AlamyView image in fullscreenCuba Gooding Jr and Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire.Photograph: Tristar Pictures/AllstarCrowe is now about to publish a memoir, The Uncool, which recounts the real-life experiences that inspired and informed the film. Its pages are full of famous musicians and the alluring portrayal of a music business that was still in its naive infancy. But it is also built around two more emotional themes: the very moving tale of Crowe’s damaged, driven family, and the solace and refuge he found in three-minute songs.Crowe is 68 and instantly recognisable: tousled, centre-parted hair that has seemingly evolved from the style he sported in the mid- to late 70s, casual attire and the air of someone still brimming with enthusiasm. He talks to me for nearly two hours via Zoom, from a barely furnished house he and his new family – in 2024, he became a father for the third time with his partner Anais Smith – have been living in while their home in Pacific Palisades recovers from the effects of the fires that raged through that part of Los Angeles earlier this year. “It all came 100ft from our front door, and everything got marinated in deep, dark mesquite smoke,” he says. “But so many people had it worse than us.” His conversational style is like this: evocative, self-deprecating and full of a palpably Californian sense of optimism and redemption, even when he is remembering difficult and traumatic experiences.Crowe was born in 1957, and raised in Palm Springs, before his family relocated first to the desert city of Indio – now the home of the Coachella festival – then San Diego. His mother, Alice, was a college teacher and “unstoppable force”. His father, who went by the rather unfortunate name of Jim Crowe, served in the US army and then worked as an estate agent. Crowe had two older sisters, Cathy and Cindy.As McDormand’s brilliant performance in the movie shows, his mother was a fierce, obstinate presence, with such belief in her son that she accelerated his education, putting him in school a year early and then allowing him to skip fifth grade, the last phase of primary school. He ended up graduating from high school three years early, with a deep sense of being an awkward outsider (hence the title of the book). When he was taunted by his peers, she would offer words of encouragement that must have sounded like very cold comfort: “One day you’ll be a great success, and those kids will be in the dustbin of your memory.”As Crowe became obsessed with rock music, she was horrified – and though that feeling eventually receded, it seems to have never completely gone away. Throughout her life, she hung on to the idea that, at some point, he would call time on his creative life and do something much more respectable. The night he won his Oscar for the Almost Famous screenplay, for example, her first response was, “It’s not too late to go to law school.”“I think she felt, ‘This movie thing – it’s done,’” he says. “‘Let’s get back to what’s real: finishing education, becoming a lawyer, it’s important.’ That was the rudder that never quite came out of the water.” He smiles. “There was no irony when she said that, by the way. She was like, ‘You’re still young enough. Let’s do this.’”She died in 2019, having lived long enough to witness most of Donald Trump’s first term as president – which, he says, both fascinated and appalled her. “It was a cultural thing, which rock was part of,” he says. “Like … the erosion of what it is to honour goodness. She felt it had been eroding and eroding, and then Trump showed up and it was like, God help us, where is it all going? But she had a teacher’s optimism that with good, hard work we could restore what’s important.” A telling part of her character, he says, was her fondness for aphorisms, one of which begins the book: “The only true satisfaction comes from doing good.”She and her family also had to deal with profound tragedy. In the summer of 1967, Crowe’s eldest sister, Cathy, ended her life by overdosing on barbiturates. At different points in her life, her parents had been told she was “emotionally disturbed” and even schizophrenic. She was only 19. For a long time afterwards, his mother would not discuss the details of her death, while his father seemed to offer only the most simple explanation: “She was in pain.” It was, Crowe writes, “the only time I’d ever seen him cry”.He has never written or spoken about any of this before. So why now? “I did it for me,” he says. “I just had some time on my hands and the tech had gotten better, so I could get into some archives.” The most revelatory, he says, were those of the Desert Sun, a local newspaper. “I started seeing tiny mentions of her: even some photos of a birthday party she had. And there was this book that she loved, The Fairy Doll, in a news report. And when I read that, it was like meeting her.”In The Uncool, he describes The Fairy Doll’s principal character as being “unlike the others in her family. They were skinny; she was plump. They could ride a bike; she could not. They recited math problems; she got confused.” In hindsight, does he now have a better understanding of what Cathy was going through?View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianThe loss of my oldest sister was an unresolved pain in our family. I never wanted to pull the scab from that. But over time you’re like, ‘Wow, show me the scab’“The doctors were flummoxed at the time. They would swing from really dire diagnosis ideas to, hey, give it some time. But she was bipolar, without a proper diagnosis to really deal with it.”A few minutes later, he says this: “The loss of my oldest sister was an unresolved pain in our family. I never wanted to, like, pull the scab from that … but over time you become the person who’s the same age as your parents when a lot of this happened. And you’re like, wow, show me the scab. Let’s do it. And with my sister Cindy’s help, I did it. And the more I learned about my sister, the more it linked up with my memories of her, because she was trying to give me pop as a manifesto. It ended up influencing my whole life. So that was important to write, just for me.”There are two striking bits of symbolism in the story of Cathy’s death and how it affected the family. One is the empty chair that was always left in the kitchen, because “nobody wanted to be the one to remove it”. It was copied over into Almost Famous, as a representation of a fictional dead father. “It was turquoise, and I’ve never forgotten it,” he says.The other was about her love of music. Crowe associates one particular song with his sister: the version ofSilence Is Goldenby the British band the Tremeloes, a hit single from 1967 that hints at jealousy, unrequited love and a sadness so deep that it sounds completely tragic. He also has an indelible memory of two Beach Boys singles Cathy had ordered just before her death, which his dad had to pick up from the local record store the next weekend: California Girls and Don’t Worry Baby.Both are perfect examples of something that recurs throughout the book: the kind of happy/sad music that conveys something ordinary language can’t express; a kind of sadness that’s somehow enjoyable. At one point, he describes it as the cure for the “strange itch of not belonging” that he felt throughout his youth and beyond. And it was Cathy who introduced him to it. “She might have been the most organic and true music fan in our family,” he says.Which brings us to the most spectacular period of Crowe’s early life. Four years after Cathy’s death, he had become acquainted with the people who ran a countercultural San Diego publication called the Door, who were open to the idea of him becoming a contributor. In a single evening at the city’s sports arena – and with no advance notice – he interviewed a long-lost band called Wild Turkey, Black Sabbath and the progressive rock titans Yes, simply by summoning up the chutzpah to hustle his way into their dressing rooms. He was 14 years old.“There was no stopping me once I walked in the door,” he says. “It was so arduous getting into the arena that by the time I was there, it was like Disneyland plus. And I just felt like … all things were possible.”View image in fullscreenCrowe with Jimmy Page on Led Zeppelin’s plane Starship, 1973.Photograph: Neal PrestonIf his time at school had constantly involved the disorientation of being the youngest person in the room, here was a way to turn that experience to his advantage. Does he look back and marvel at his sheer front? “It was do or die, in a way. I didn’t know if I was ever going to get backstage again. But also, we have a different idea of what backstage would be, based on today – where there’s likearmiesmoving you from room to room. Then, it was like the band and a road manager – so if you said, ‘I’m here and I’ve got all these questions, can you get me into the room?’ the guy would be like, ‘Well, they’re just hanging around doing nothing – I’ll ask.’ And then it’d be, ‘Yeah, bring the kid in.’”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

In Almost Famous, the principal character’s writing career threatens to implode before it has even begun, when the lead singer of the fictional band Stillwater falsely tells the magazine’s factcheckers that his quotes have been made up. This is a rewritten version of something much more surreal, which happened when Crowe was sent to go on tour with the Allman Brothers Band, the pioneers of so-called southern rock who were then at the height of their success, despite a run of catastrophes.In San Francisco, Crowe did his second, amazingly candid interview with Gregg Allman, who was still reeling from the recent deaths of two bandmates, including his brother Duane. But at 2am on the same night, he was summoned back into Allman’s company and subjected to an unsettling tirade: “Sixteen! You’re underage. How do I know you aren’t with the FBI?”Allman told Crowe the ghost of his dead brother was in a nearby chair, laughing at him. He then demanded the tapes of their conversation and the interviews Crowe had done with the rest of the band, an instruction Crowe complied with. For four days, he was convinced he had blown the most important opportunity of his life.What was all this about? “Being older now, and having seen Gregg before he died, I’ll give you my theory,” he says. “I think he got very high and realised I had not done drugs. I had been asking very personal questions that sometimes involve that level of hijinks. People had obviously come to Gregg and said, ‘I talked to that kid and I told him some stuff … ’ I wasn’t there to party and suddenly, maybe to a slightly paranoid mind, that made me a cop.”A pause. “I thought I might get beaten up. Not by him, but anything could have happened. This was the middle of the night. My dad was in the army and I’d never heard him talking like that. So it was hardcore.”What did he think would happen to the tapes? “Oh, they weren’t going to come back. I knew this was the end of a dream. It was that feeling of the mask being ripped from your eyes and seeing it: ‘Oh, this is what life really is. Wow. OK. This is where all those songs come from where people are really sad.’”Bowie was really warm. He knew I didn’t have a driver’s licence. He gave me rides from the studio back to my place cos I didn’t know how to driveLess than a week later, thanks to “shame that lived in him somewhere”, Allman returned the tapes, and Crowe’s career resumed. Part of his role at Rolling Stone was about covering bands and artists that the magazine – staffed by people, he says, who revered Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and John Lennon – tended to think were beyond the critical pale, which is essentially how he came to write about Led Zeppelin. But he was also known as that rare interviewer who could put musicians at their ease and instinctively get inside their heads.There is no better illustration of this than the time he spent in Los Angeles with Bowie between 1974 and 1976 – a period when, as well as creating such albums as Young Americans and Station to Station, he was largely living on a diet of peppers, milk and cocaine, developing an interest in the occult and exhibiting signs of obsessive-compulsive behaviour and paranoia.Crowe spent a huge amount of time with him. “I don’t think you spend a year and a half around a kid unless you’re interested in what is gonna come out of it,” he says. “He said, ‘I want you to hold up a mirror to me and I wanna see what you write.’ And I think he really enjoyed throwing all kinds of crazy stuff at me.”For all the frazzled quotes Bowie came out with (“I think I might have been a bloody good Hitler … I’d be an excellent dictator … very eccentric and quite mad”), Crowe insists he observed someone very different from the impenetrable Thin White Duke of legend. “He was reallywarm. He knew I didn’t have a driver’s licence. He gave me rides from the studio back to the place where I was living, cos I didn’t know how to drive. He would bop around LA traffic early in the morning in a yellow VW and nobody recognised him. He was talking about music and he was talking about life, and I was recording constantly. And I didn’t even have an assignment.”Crowe watched him write two songs, neither of which was ever released. He also witnessed the recording of Wild Is the Wind – the classic ballad most closely associated with Nina Simone that Bowie included on Station to Station. He still sounds awestruck at the memory: not for the first time, he got the sense that Bowie was trying on a new persona, right in front of his eyes. “He was Frank Sinatra for an audience of three. And with the lighting and the cigarette, it was a performance. I thought, ‘This guy does not fuck around. He’s putting on an audiovisual presentation of a possible new direction live in real time. He’s going to try this out and I get to be there.’”In 2006, Crowe was asked by Rolling Stone to look back at the landmark piece that all these encounters eventually produced, and to interview Bowie on the phone. But as soon as their conversation began, he knew their respective views of the time were going to be very different: whereas he recalled Bowie being constantly fascinating and personable, Bowie regretfully spoke of the “morbid, misdirected enthusiasm of a young man with too much time on his hands and too many grams of amphetamine or PCP or cocaine, and maybe all three, in his system”.He paraphrases what Bowie told him: “I had no friends. I knew you. Drug dealers were the people who mostly populated my life. You know what? I’m really glad I survived. I could have died very easily and here I am. I’m with a family that I love and a life that I love, and …Good luck.”Crowe in a shot from 1978 and recreating the image last month (below).Photograph: Bonnie Schiffman Photography/ Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianBy 1977, Crowe was a comparatively ancient 20 and had begun to get the strong feeling that he had already reached the end of his career as a music writer. Rolling Stone had moved from San Francisco to New York, and punk rock was in full effect. He was also suffering simple burnout. “I had a feeling I’ve had a few times: ‘What am I putting in the reserve tank to write about in the future?’ I took so many assignments that I would go and meet another band in the airport, and go off on another tour, and never even come home.”In 1981, he published Fast Times at Ridgemont High, the product of the time he spent undercover at a school in San Diego: he then turned that book into a screenplay for the movie of the same name that was released a year later, prophetically looking ahead to a Hollywood decade that would be dominated by the onscreen teenager. The first movie he both wrote and directed was 1989’s Say Anything, a romantic comedy that starred a young John Cusack; the last – to date – wasAloha, released in 2015, whose cast included Bill Murray and Alec Baldwin. “I haven’t directed a movie in 10 years,” Crowe says, sounding slightly surprised at himself. “I’ve done documentaries and written a lot … but I can’t wait to direct a movie again.”He says he feels a nagging itch to make another film about journalism – which, in the Trump era, sounds like an expression of belief in civic virtue very like his mother’s. “I hate seeing journalism marginalised – you know, ‘Can we get rid of these journalists, they’re the enemy of the people?’ No, theyarethe people, and if a young writer thinks for one second that journalism isn’t as important in our current environment, I’ll shove my book into their hand and I’ll say, ‘This is what journalism did for me. Journalism gave me a voice in the world.’”In the meantime, he is about to start directing a biopic about Joni Mitchell. There are strong rumours that it will star both Meryl Streep and Anya Taylor-Joy, but Crowe is reluctant to give away any details. The little he can say arrives five minutes after our interview has ended, in an email: “We start next year. It’s Joni Mitchell’s story from her point of view, and it’s been a delight because her music is already so cinematic.”Almost Famous at 20: Cameron Crowe’s warm-hearted ode to music journalismRead moreHe also sends me an answer to a question about music biopics so often going wrong, and how to do it right. “Most biopics about musicians are scary because they are usually so solemn and Wikipedia-like,” he says.He then names three of his favourites: the Joy Division filmControl, The Buddy Holly Story and Coal Miner’s Daughter, the movie about country singer Loretta Lynn.He nails what they have in common in a single sentence, which captures his two sides, as writer and director, and lifelong fan. The words could easily have come from the script of Almost Famous. “They never forget the elixir of the subject,” he says. “It’spure heaven.”The Uncoolby Cameron Crowe is published by 4th Estate on 28 October.

Thrill-seeking climbing influencer Hunter convinces her bestie Becky to do a little immersion therapy after her husband Dan’s sudden death during a climb leaves her fearful, depressed and suicidal. The goal: to climb a decommissioned TV transmission tower deep in the California desert that’s roughly twice the height of the Eiffel Tower. When the rickety ladder that gets them to a tiny platform at the structure’s top falls to smithereens, the women suddenly discover new meanings of SOL. The film is nothing if not an excuse to gloriously parade a series of show-stopping, sweaty-palm scenes, yet it becomes a deeply psychological, intricate twin character study as Mann gradually peels back the layers of Hunter and Becky’s up-and-down friendship, and the latter’s gradual rediscovery of her courage. With word that Fall is being made into a franchise, I am eagerly awaiting the next opportunity to send my adrenal glands into overdrive.Veronica EspositoGaslightOnly onethrillerever hit so hard that its title became apop-psych buzzwordfor a form of emotional manipulation. And, with respect to your toxic ex, no one is better at gaslighting than Charles Boyer’s villainous Gregory. In Victorian-era London, Gregory moves his new wife, Paula (Ingrid Bergman), into a sprawling gilded cage of a townhouse that just so happens to be the site of her aunt’s still-unsolved murder. There, Gregory slowly and systematically attempts to convince Paula she’s insane. George Cukor’s slow burn remains maddening as ever 80 years since its release, anchored by Bergman’s steely, Oscar-winning performance: even as she unravels, she resists shrinking into fragility. I’ve never seen Gaslight in a theater and I’m not sure if I could, because my last rewatch unnerved me so much that I had to pause the film every 10 minutes to pace around my apartment. Do not watch this one without whatever vice you need to unwind nearby. Alaina DemopoulosThe VanishingYou can forget your Ringus, your Exorcists or your 127 Hours, the film that reduced me to a quivering wreck was The Vanishing, a (now fairly obscure) low-key Dutch thriller from 1988 whose brilliance and traumatising effect have been somewhat obscured by the fact that the same director (the late George Sluizer) was persuaded to remake it in Hollywood with a ludicrously reconfigured ending. I saw it when it came out without really knowing what to expect – this was the pre-internet era, when films tended to turn up without deluges of advance information. I won’t give away the big ending, but it is the story of a man whose girlfriend goes missing at a petrol station, and after years of looking for her, confronts a man who offers him the chance to find out what happened to her if he takes a sleeping pill. Well, when he wakes up and flicks on his cigarette lighter, I absolutely lost it, like the rest of the audience. I’m not a drinker but only a bunch of whiskeys in the cinema bar after returned me to any kind of normality.Andrew PulverUncut GemsI first heard ofUncut Gems, fittingly, on Twitter, that locus for terminally anxious scrollers constantly looking for their next hit of controversy. Yet even prepped with ten versions of a tweet hailing the film’s “step on your neck” achievements, I was still stunned by the vise-like grip ofboiling anxietythat is the Safdie brothers’ 2019 magnum opus. In thefirst nine minutes and 59 secondsalone (which Netflix put on YouTube as evidence that Uncut Gems is “quite possibly the most stressful movie of all time”), Diamond District dealer Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) gets a colonoscopy, places a risky bet, gets accosted by hired goons for failing to pay back a $100,000 loan, screams at his loanshark as negotiation, screams at his mistress for no reason, and pawns something from the Weeknd for $23,500. And that is the least stressful part of the movie. The rest is an unrelenting downward spiral of bad bets, Hail Marys, high-risk bullshitting and Howie being, at minimum, incredibly pushy. My cortisol levels have never been the same.Adrian HortonFull TimeIf the sound of a morning alarm or a closing train door reliably gives you a hit of anxiety, you may need to approach this most relatable of urban thrillers with caution. Laure Calamy is superb inFull Time, brittle and grimly aware of each looming obstacle, as Julie, a single mother battling through each day, running on fumes. Her daily schedule pivots on perfect timing – the school run, to the suburban train to her cleaning job in the city – just as her household depends on that chambermaid wage and her ex’s alimony cheques. But the threads unravel – the money is late, the childminder resigns, and a strike cancels all the trains – just when Julie has the chance of an interview for a life-changing job. French-Canadian director Eric Gravel keeps the camera lurching with Julie from crisis to crisis and manipulates a score of rushing electronic beats and antagonising ambient noise, as her taxing routine turns into a desperate, dangerous race.Pamela HutchinsonHer SmellIn the first segment of Alex Ross Perry’s swirling, strange, ultimately uplifting rock-and-roll dramaHer Smell,Elisabeth Moss’s tortured frontwoman Becky Something tears around a concert venue greenroom, haranguing friends, family and collaborators in a drug-addled, mental-health-crisis frenzy. It’s utterly harrowing; Perry and Moss make us desperate for a door, a window, or some other egress through which we might escape this storm. But no such deliverance is available. We must instead sit with Becky as she hits something like rock bottom. Catharsis, even sweetness, comes later in Perry’s garrulous and lovely film. But those beginning minutes are excruciating, verging on unwatchable. What is brilliant about the film is how Perry stops just short of total alienation. And how Moss, in career-best work, allows us brief glimpses of the wounded humanity rippling underneath Becky’s horrible behavior. One hates to watch it, butHer Smelldoes eventually reward the viewer for their commitment to sticking it out. It is a beautiful metaphor for what it is to know and love an addict.Richard LawsonBaby BoyIt doesn’t matter how many more Fast & Furious movies Tyrese Gibson stars in or R&B songs he drops on the side. For those of us who opted into seeing Baby Boy when it released in 2001 or were forced into rewatching it from the endlessly replays across cable TV through the decades, he will always be Jody, the titular man child with an exasperating lack of self-awareness. Jody professes to love his girlfriend, Yvette (Taraji P Henson), but won’t give up womanizing. He takes umbrage with his mother taking in a boyfriend (Ving Rhames) even though his 20-year-old hide has no business still living at home. He takes himself for a street thug and immediately retreats into cowardice whenever he comes up against a real alpha (Snoop Dogg’s Rodney). Believe it or not Baby Boy was actually marketed as a coming-of-age film, but Jody gets scared straight instead of learning and growing on his own. And even though director John Singleton really nailed the inviolate narcissism that is seemingly at the core of every wannabe gangster, it just makes Baby Boy all the more uncomfortable to sit with.Andrew LawrenceClockwiseWhy isn’t Clockwise –Michael Frayn’s immaculate comedy in which John Cleese’s headmaster tries to get to Norwich in time to deliver a speech – more exhausting to watch? It does, after all, tap into a remarkably universal nightmare. I think it’s because Cleese absorbs the trauma on the viewer’s behalf. Brian Stimpson came six years after Basil Fawlty and, despite superficial similarities, is a sympathetic and plausible character: a martyr attempting to muzzle his bark, a man well-intentioned beneath the ramrod moustache, the victim of more than his own belligerent efficiency. Cleese is startlingly good and subtle, too – I’m now certainDaniel Day-Lewisnicked the intonation of his milkshake speech in There Will Be Blood from Stimpson’s final meltdown. A word, too, for the fringe stresses endured by Penelope Wilton (weeping kidnapped in a car stuck in a field), and by Alison Steadman and Geoffrey Palmer, both stuck at some point wrangling three elderly women with dementia. The way Palmer’s gallant patience frays into hysteria is especially great. And for the actors playing those women: Constance Chapman, who only wants to go to the loo or the hospital, Joan Hickson, who monologues constantly about an inheritance dispute involving sherry glasses, and – most wonderful – Ann Way, entirely charming and delighted regardless of circumstance. I had forgotten the moment Steadman is speaking to an irate woman on her very suburban doorstep when Way pops up to ask: “Can we see over the house? Is it open today?” I will never forget her trilling rendition of This Is My Lovely Day over the climactic car crash. Clockwise is stress elevated to pure elegance, and a really underrated breakdown.Catherine ShoardGood TimeBefore going their separate ways, theSafdie brothers(Benny and Josh) made their names synonymous with panic-inducing, anxiety-attack cinema; their films hanging to characters trapped and suffocated by their own worst impulses. The high-stakes gambling thriller Uncut Gems is the sibling duo’s most entertaining – what with the flash, the comedy and the Sandler of it all. ButGood Time, starring a fearless and magnificentRobert Pattinsonas a conman named Connie, is the one that gets under your skin; especially since skin colour is the capital Connie preys on. He flails between robbing a bank and extorting drug dealers, all in a bid to keep his developmentally delayed brother (played by co-director Benny) out of group homes or jail. Connie has our sympathy. What makes Good Time so unbearably stressful and unsettling is how he takes advantage of that. He pleads and barters, at times politely, always with a desperation that masks his own entitlement. Connie’s unfortunate circumstances outweigh the hardships of the Black people in his orbit, who he victimizes or scapegoats, in this unnerving portrait of being down and out – and clinging to white privilege when that’s all you got.Radheyan SimonpillaiPunch-Drunk LoveIn retrospect,Paul Thomas Andersondoesn’t really love to inflict suffering on his characters. More of his movies end on an optimistic note than not. But back in 2002, when he had far fewer movies under his belt, that didn’t seem quite so obvious – and moreover, his romantic comedyPunch-Drunk Lovedoes such a great job simulating the feeling of a waking nightmare or rising panic attack that during my first viewing, I watched with my fists clenched and sweaty, terrified that something tragic would befall Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), the meek but occasionally rage-prone hero of the piece, or Lena Leonard (Emily Watson), his unlikely love interest. Anderson particularly uses Sandler’s capacity for violence, played off for slapstick laughs in his broad comedies, as a constant threat; you’re not really afraid he will attack Lena, but that he’ll take an intense wrong turn off of a physical or psychological cliff without the armor a normal feelgood (or self-aggrandizing) Sandler comedy provides. Despite that weird intensity, the movie is still frequently hilarious, even romantic; it’s a high-wire act all the more impressive for still working, in its way, as a rom-com. Subsequent viewings, one you know where it is going, play a little differently. But that first time back in 2002 was a different experience entirely. Sandler, of course, would go on to star in the anxiety-inducing Uncut Gems, which I would bet good money is someone else’s choice in this roundup. Who knew the Chanukah Song guy would become such an expert in this form of cinematic stress?Jesse Hassenger4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 DaysGuardian writers on their ultimate feelgood movies: ‘Radical in its own way’Read moreI remember going to see Cristian Mungiu’s Palme d’Or winner4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Dayson a date. I was aware of its plot in the vaguest of terms but it was a choice made more as a 23-year-old trying to impress a slightly pretentious yet thoroughly handsome older academic, pretending that I had absolutely zero interest in watchingAlien vs Predator: Requieminstead. Before the film had started, we were holding hands in the dark, naively unaware of what was about to unfold, and then it began, with a ticking clock and a nosebleed and we were off to the races. What I had assumed would be a considered arthouse drama slowly morphed into one of the most uncomfortably suspenseful thrillers I had ever seen, made that much harder to watch because of how awfully naturalistic it all was. A young woman, Otilia, tries to help her friend Găbița get a black-market abortion in late 80s Romania and every stage of their potentially lethal quest is a nail-biter. But while the procedure itself is obviously a nightmare to watch, it’s the scene soon after that got me. Otilia has left Găbița alone in the hotel room to let it take hold, given impossibly strict instructions by a vile and short-tempered abortionist, and must grimly endure inane dinner talk with her boyfriend’s family, her mind visibly racing toward every awful conclusion. It was at this point that I realised my palms were sweating and, awkwardly, so did my date, gently removing his hand from mine and giving it a wipe.Benjamin LeeExplore more on these topicsFilmUncut GemsPaul Thomas AndersonDrama filmsThrillersAdam SandlerMichael FraynfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Down in Vauxhall in London, three artists have mashed themselves together to create the most revolting visual soup imaginable, an exhibition that isn’t so much the sum of its parts as a total negation of anything good any of them has ever done.Whatever qualities YBA kingpin Damien Hirst and street artistsShepard Faireyand Invader might have, none of them are on display in this staggeringly vast exhibition – it just goes on and on, huge room after huge room filled with aesthetic crap.View image in fullscreenTriple Trouble … collaborative works by Shepard Fairey, Damien Hirst, and Invader.Photograph: Prudence Cuming Associates Ltd/Artworks © the artistsThe show is made up largely of collaborations between the artists, Hirst’s dots and medical cabinets smashed brutally and heinously together with Invader’s little ceramic aliens and Fairey’s leaden posterised Photoshoppery.There’s a wall of Fairey’s Obey logo plastered over Hirst spin and flower paintings, adding nothing to something that wasn’t good to start with.My jaw dropped when I saw the huge Hirst formaldehyde case with an invader alien drowning in the blue fluid – it was like walking in on a crime scene. Why would you go to such lengths to create something that no one comes out of well, that expresses both artists’ ideas so poorly?View image in fullscreenAlien in formaldehyde … ‘my jaw dropped’.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesAnd somehow,it only gets worse. A medical cabinet filled with Obey-logo pills, diamanté-encrusted Space Invaders, grim butterfly paintings with some ludicrous Fairey propaganda woman staring out at you, countless 8-bit pixelated portraits of Lou Reed and Sid Vicious. It’s as if someone let the most annoying teenager you’ve ever met make some art. At one point there’s an enormous triple portrait featuring what might be Malala Yousafzai and Miley Cyrus plastered with scalpel blades. It’s all juvenile, dumb, silly imagery that does not work on any level.Would this have been better as solo presentations of each artist’s work? Maybe. But Invader’s work is built for the street, not the gallery, that’s where it’s meant to be, where it works best. And Fairey’s work is built for the bin. Getting up close and personal with it just rams home how ugly, one-dimensional, faux-political and stupid it is.View image in fullscreenNo power … Shepard Fairey during an exhibition photo call at Newport Street Gallery.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesIt’s all precision-engineered to sell, in vast quantities at vast prices, to people with the worst taste on Earth. And the reason this is so spectacularly naff is that Hirst is important, he’s made vital, powerful art. Regardless of whether or not you like any of these artists, all three have something that they’re good at, but no one bothered to put any of that in this show (curated by Hirst’s son Connor). Take Invader off the street, or Fairey off the front of sweatshirts, and you strip themof their power. Take the ideas out of Hirst, and you strip him of his purpose.Everyone here was so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.

The song was intended to be a rejection of the masculine influence that had unwittingly shaped the artist’s previous work, and an ode to something taboo within the female experience. Based on Molly Bloom’s soliloquy in James Joyce’s Ulysses – a stream of consciousness in which the character reflects on her experiences of nature, sex and love – Bush wanted to celebrate the experience of life inside a woman’s body, and the ways it gives her spiritual and sexual pleasure. I knew that, for someone like me, who was already being bullied, to openly love a song like this could make me an even more obvious target to those who saw femininity as a sign of weakness. More daunting than that, it might force me to confront my own repressed desires.By the time I was around 17, I had already spent most of my teenage years in a constant state of survival. I wasn’t yet out as a transgender woman; this was a part of me I could keep secret, unlike my effeminacy. I had a naturally high voice, which I tried and failed to deepen. “You sound like a girl,” was one of the daily taunts aimed at me by pupils at my school, even as I strained my vocal cords. My camp mannerisms and the way I walked were other noticeable crimes to the boys around me, who enjoyed mocking my “sassy” stride. Growing up in an environment such as this meant I never saw my femininity as something to embrace. That I was soft and girlish was a sign of a defective self. Still, it felt safer to be a feminine boy than a boy who wanted to become a woman.Her ode to womanhood invoked all the things I knew I could be: euphoric, audacious and freeThe school I attended in Plymouth was single sex, but high-achieving girls were allowed to enter its gates at sixth form, something I was grateful for. Some of the new students lived near me, by the forests surrounding the city. One morning, while we ambled along the grassland, one of the girls shared her headphones with me and played her favourite music. That’s when the discovery was made.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

On my solitary walk home, I listened to her song again under the shelter of leaves and the furry limbs of trees. I listened carefully, but most of her words appeared formless – lines sung breathlessly behind an orchestra of uilleann pipes and other traditional Irish instruments I remembered learning about in class. In certain moments, her words’ sharpness broke in again like splices of light along my trail: “to where the water and the earth caress … now I’ve powers of a woman’s body.” Moments such as these were laced throughout, often referencing nature, and culminating in postcoital bliss: “Mmh yes.” I pictured Bush dancing among trees in a state of synaesthetic ecstasy, her body lit by a neon green glow. My body swayed instinctively to the rhythm. It didn’t bother me that I must have looked like a girl doing it. I followed the flickers of emerald to the forest’s end.My cultural awakening: The Parent Trap made me reconnect with my estranged fatherRead moreSomething shifted in me that day. Bush’s ode to womanhood felt like an invocation of all the things I knew I could be: euphoric, audacious and free. I started to view my femininity not as a flaw, but as an affirmation of life; a way of indulging in the intense pleasure of the world, nature and my body.It still wasn’t safe to be my natural self in my final year of school. My transition came a couple of years later, when I moved away for university. But, from this point onwards, I knew there was a place in my mind to escape to whenever I wanted – the lush, fevered universe Bush had created – where I danced in recognition of my own sacred womanhood. And waiting patiently for that reverie to become my everyday reality, I was able to refuse the voices that told me it never would.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

He spent time in London that year exploring ways to pull off the flying scenes.Photograph: Jane BownThe surviving working papers for The Freak are more extensive than for any of Chaplin’s other films. They reveal that he was close to shooting it. They detail everything from scene breakdowns to special effects sessions, including wings for Sarapha. There are also financial projections, minutes of technical meetings and production schedules.David Robinson, Chaplin’s official biographer who has written the book containing the material, said: “It’s a shame that it wasn’t finished because it could have been a marvellous film.”For the role of Sarapha, Chaplin had cast his then teenage daughter Victoria, who recalled: “For hours, for weeks, for months, he [Chaplin] studied the movements of birds in flight – the living mechanics of wings. He watched films where men and women soared through the sky. But the techniques back then did not satisfy him. He wanted to find his own way – crafted, personal – a way to translate the sensation of flight on to the screen. I believe he would have found it. But time clipped his wings. Charlie Chaplin never brought his vision to life.”View image in fullscreenA sketch by Gerald Larn of the winged character, described as ‘a bird with a human body’.Photograph: Unknown/The Roy Export Company Ltd. All Rights ReservedSticking Place Books will publishThe Freak: The Story of an Unfinished Filmthis weekend.Paul Cronin, its British publisher, said Chaplin created a heroine as timeless as the Little Tramp, an outsider: “Chaplin made that very clear in his production notes.”This is the first time the script has been published in English, in its original form. It had appeared only in Italian in 2020, in a limited run by the Cineteca di Bologna, which has catalogued the entireChaplin Archive.Chaplin’s daughter Victoria is fitted with wings.Photograph: The Roy Export Company Ltd. All Rights ReservedCecilia Cenciarelli of Cineteca di Bologna, who has edited the forthcoming book in a collaboration with the Chaplin family, said The Freak had been largely unknown even to Chaplin scholars: “We found ourselves handling hundreds of pages of this film we’ve never heard anything about and turned to David [Robinson’s] ‘bible’,Chaplin: His Life and Art, for clarification, only to realise that The Freak was barely mentioned.”Among the papers are casting notes marked “confidential”, listing Robert Vaughn, James Fox and Richard Chamberlain as contenders for the lead role of an English professor who befriends Sarapha after finding her on his roof, injured and unconscious.In one scene, she tells him that she hates her wings: “I don’t like mystifying and frightening people … I am afraid of everyone and everyone is afraid of me.” In another passage, Chaplin wrote that Sarapha “loved him in spite of the fact that he was without wings”.In 1969, Chaplin was in London, exploring ways to pull off the flying scenes. There were talks with companies that created flying effects for the stage as well as film special effects experts, including those at Shepperton Studios.The new book includes an interview with one of the artists, Gerald Larn, who created 150 drawings showing the wings and Victoria in flight. He said: “Charlie was very clear and detailed about what he wanted and what he expected from us … We thought it would be a difficult project, but not impossible … The good thing was that we always got feedback from Charlie.”View image in fullscreenA page of the script.Photograph: The Roy Export Company Ltd. All Rights ReservedArnold Lozano, the manager of the Chaplin estate, described the forthcoming published script as “the first comprehensive presentation of Chaplin’s last, unfinished film project”. He added: “Drawn from nearly 3,000 pages of Chaplin’s words, photographs and designs, along with his own recorded readings and piano compositions for the score, it revealsThe Freak as perhaps his final bequest. Unique within his body of work yet still touched by unmistakable Chaplinesque elements, this publication offers a rare glimpse into one of the most remarkable projects of his 63-year creative life in cinema.”Explore more on these topicsCharlie ChaplinnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s Blackadder crossed with CSI – with a sprinkling of Philomena CunkFrances RyanSat 11 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTShareWitches of Essex is one of those television shows that could have been created working backwards from its title. “It sounds like Witches of Eastwick!” you can imagine a producer brainstorming. “Can we do anything with that?”Yes, yes we can. We can put together a three-part documentary about the Essex witch trials, which saw hundreds of people – the majority of them women – accused of witchcraft in the 16th and 17th centuries. Crucially, we can hire everyone’s favourite Essex boy, Rylan (though less favourite sincehis comments on immigrationsaw more than 700 Ofcom complaints last month) to present it alongside Prof Alice Roberts.“I’ve always been interested in history, but I had no idea Essex is steeped in horrific stories of persecution and death,” Rylan says to camera before the opening titles, in what can only be described as a mood killer.300 years on, will thousands of women burned as witches finally get  justice?Read moreIf you were expecting a camp and cheeky take on Elizabethan history and the supernatural in time for Halloween, you could be slightly disappointed by Witches of Essex (Tuesday 14 October, 9pm, Sky History). It’s not that Rylan doesn’t add plenty of humour to proceedings (“There were a couple of witches then,” he quips about his youthful nights out in Chelmsford) but this is a real story about real women – many of whom were killed for little more than being a widow or falling out with a neighbour. Quite rightly, the series has at least some level of respect and gravity to it, albeit one that involves dramatic re-enactments featuring actors with panto-esque colloquial accents while wearing a variety of hats.Each episode centres on a specific witch trial that took place in Essex, with Rylan and Alice opening a “cold case” of women accused more than 400 years ago, guided by original court documents and a team of historians and medical experts. Think Blackadder crossed with CSI plus a sprinkle of Philomena Cunk.Much of the action takes place in an “incident room” – AKA a budget studio in which Rylan and Alice write on a board with a big pen above mugshots of the key characters. At one point, Rylan sticks a photograph of “Attorney General Gilbert Gerard” – one of the main prosecutors to implement Elizabeth I’s 1563 law criminalising witchcraft – and Alice nods in recognition. That she is actually recognising the actor Sky has hired to play Gilbert Gerard rather than presumably congratulating Rylan for discovering the earliest known camera roll on Earth is neither here nor there. This is history coming to life! We’re in the moment!On paper, Rylan and Alice are a presenting duo that could have been made by AI. Or – more likely – a focus group trying to bring the 18- to 28-year-old demographic to the history channel. But they are a genuinely engaging team, balancing the not always easy tone of investigation into state-sponsored femicide and light entertainment. A tour of the modern-day Chelmsford courthouse that once saw women tried for witchcraft enables Rylan to respond to the detail that they would have shared the building with a market. “So you’d be getting tried for the death penalty and there’d be a cow in the background mooing?” “Possibly,” Alice nods, with a game straight face.It’s all very slight, of course, offering more of an introduction to the topic than anything armchair historians would learn much from. But that is probably its strength. Everyone involved is almost visibly working to make what is an under-discussed and shameful period in history accessible (at one point, a lecturer from the LSE describes the first depiction of a witch on a broomstick as a phallic symbol of going “off to shag the devil”.) The ongoing point about ambitious politicians using fear against one group to get control over the populace feels painfully relevant for modern audiences.When the actors re-enact a woman being hanged after being found guilty of witchcraft and Rylan places a photo of her corpse – with accompanying rope marks – on the board, you can’t help but feel moved. Rylan as the nation’s history teacher? As long as he starts withWindrush.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherRylan ClarkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A work of autofiction, first published in 1997, it chronicles Kraus’s infatuation with a cultural theorist named Dick, a doomed, one-sided love affair that nonetheless pulls Kraus, a depressed, 39-year-old failing film-maker languishing in a sexless marriage, out of her personal and artistic rut. After a slow start, the book became a cult classic and in 2016 it was made into anAmazon Prime Video TV series, with Kraus played by Kathryn Hahn. “To me, success would have been like a long review in the New York Review of Books, not being a character on a sitcom,” Kraus says now. Her commercial success was a financial boon, of course. “But who can stand by a book they wrote 20 years ago? It was massively embarrassing to go out and support the book as if I’d written it last year.”She had, however, promised herself that if she ever achieved mainstream success she would write about it with the same candour that she brought to her struggles. “I’m going to write about all of it. Not just about youth, but about middle age,” she says. “Middle age is so much harder to write about, because youth is kind of like a trope. We’re very familiar with reading books about the aspirations or disappointed aspirations of youth, but middle age is much crazier ground. It’s not as sexy, it’s not as familiar. So, to write about middle age in the same way takes commitment.”Kraus is now 70 years old, frank and sharp and funny as ever. She’s speaking by video call from her home in Baja, Mexico, where she stays when she wants to escape LA to write. Her onscreen name, confusingly, comes up as Agatha. “Oh, that’s my dog’s name. My account goes under my dog’s email address,” she says, very matter-of-factly. Agatha is a chihuahua-terrier mix and somewhere in the background. “Why does your dog have an email address?” I ask, when no further information is forthcoming. It’s for spam.Who can stand by a book they wrote 20 years ago? It was massively embarrassingThe Four Spent the Day Together,Kraus’s ninth book, is another exercise in radical disclosure, this time exploring how, as Kraus’s public profile soared in her 60s, her private life fell apart once more when her second husband relapsed into drug and alcohol addiction. She chose to write about being married to an addict because the experience is “underrepresented”, she says, perhaps because there is so much shame attached to it. “I think it’s maybe more shameful for the co-addict than it is for the addict,” she observes. But Kraus, who writes unflinchingly about shame and abjection, finds writing a way to metabolise those feelings. On the page, everything becomes “material”. “My character is just a character in the book. It’s never yourself – even if you use your own material. You’re never the same person, you’re constantly changing,” she says.Kraus prefers the term “nonfiction novels” to “autofiction” because her books are as much about other people as they are about her, and she describes her approach as “reporting on experience”. “The fabulation of an entirely invented world of a novel is completely beyond me,” she says, “but transcribing and reporting to be accurate, that’s something I can do.” She changes names and details, but “I don’t invent anything. It’s more a matter of mixing, it’s a composition.” For decades, she has kept a detailed daily diary. “Just the act of writing anchors you in time and gives a reality to things that have happened that would otherwise be completely vaporous and elusive,” she says.In her novels, Kraus uses herself as a case study, digging so deeply into her own, singular story that she uncovers truths that feel closer to universal, if not for everyone then at least for other “weird girls”. To construct them, she supplements diaries with boxes of photographs, interview recordings and – in the case of her latest book – court transcripts. The Four Spent the Day Together is split into three parts: the first describes Kraus’s upbringing in blue-collar small-town Connecticut; the second covers the slow, traumatic breakup of her second marriage; and the third describes Kraus’s journalistic investigation into a brutal murder that took place close to her former summer house in Minnesota, in a working-class community ravaged by meth.View image in fullscreenKathryn Hahn in the TV adaptation of I Love Dick.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIn her more recent novels, Kraus has written about herself in the third person and used pen names, so that she can treat her characters “like clowns or puppets” and maintain enough emotional distance to write about very sensitive, personal topics. In this book, Kraus is Catt Greene and the character based on her second husband, a psychologist, is named Paul Garcia. Paul says awful things to Catt, telling her that she is old and ugly and that he only married her for her money, and she lives in fear of his rage. Late at night she Googles things like “is my partner abusive?”. The reader is desperate for Catt to leave the relationship well before she does so. “I’ve talked to other friends in this situation, who’ve been partners with addicts. And it really is like a frog in boiling water. You tend to rationalise it as not really the person, it’s the addict,” she says. She tried to find a therapist, but while there are countless therapists who specialise in supporting addicts, the only one she found who helped family members lived miles away, in Santa Barbara. She used to go to Al-Anon meetings often, but she struggled with their official position that it’s possible to carve out a healthy life for yourself while living with an addict. Ultimately, she did seek a divorce.Kraus’s writing lays bare not only her private life, but that of others. The real-life Dick, identified by New York magazine as the British academic Dick Hebdige, tried to block publication of I Love Dick. How did her ex-husband respond to his unflattering portrayal? “The publisher wanted him to write an email giving his permission, and he did that happily and gladly,” she says. “The person who Paul Garcia is based on is now in a very strong and quality recovery … and we’re still very close to each other in many ways.” Is she saying they are back together again? Kraus laughs, sounding suddenly very girlish, and either embarrassed or appalled. “I mean, who knows,” she says. “If you’ve known someone for 20 years and they are part of your permanent family, those are such flexible and relative terms: together, apart,” she adds as she recovers her poise.Anyone who has gone through a year of high school is damaged for lifeWhen it came to writing about her upbringing, Kraus held back until after her parents’ death, believing they would find it too painful. “Everything about our family was based on pretence, and pretence is the opposite, of course, of writing. I didn’t want to hurt them,” she says. Her father worked in the warehouses of the Cambridge University Press but would have everyone believe he was an editor. He was “a little bit Asperger’s”, she says, spoke with a fake British accent and had a fantasy that he was the illegitimate son of a famous Park Avenue surgeon. Her mother was “the enabler of these fantasies”.Kraus was a good student, but was bullied mercilessly at school in Milford, Connecticut. By 13, she was regularly bunking off and hitchhiking to bars to drink with older guys. She might have gone completely off the rails had her parents not decided to emigrate to New Zealand in the hope their children might be happier. “They were timid people, and this was a very bold move. It was the boldest, most radical move they had made in their lives,” she says. New Zealand in 1969 felt like the end of the world, she recalls. “Magazines came by boat, and they didn’t arrive until three months after they had been published.”The fresh start helped Kraus and her younger sister, who settled easily into school in Wellington. Her New Zealand high school was “much more interesting and challenging”, she says – you actually got to read whole books. “It wasn’t perfect, but there wasn’t the level of vicious bullying and scapegoating that there was in the US.” Why was the bullying worse in America? “I mean, it’s notorious!” she says. “Anyone who has gone through a year of high school is damaged for life!” Her first husband, the cultural critic Sylvère Lotringer, would tell her he preferred working with non-Americans “because he said there was something about the American upbringing that made people so defensive and competitive and distrustful”.Kraus worked as a journalist in New Zealand before returning to the US in her early 20s, initially in the hope of becoming an actor. She met Lotringer in 1980, when he attended a performance piece she had written and performed in New York. They married in 1988. Lotringer founded the independent publishing house Semiotext(e), where Kraus remains an editor. Although it marked the beginning of the end of their marriage, Lotringer was initially supportive of Kraus’s infatuation with Dick, pleased that she had a distraction from her struggling film career, and he wrote several letters to Dick too. Semiotext(e) published I Love Dick, as well as Kraus’s later autofiction, Aliens and Anorexia (2000), Torpor (2006) and Summer of Hate (2012). Kraus is also the author of several essay collections and a biography of the novelist Kathy Acker, whom she deeply admired and who was an ex-girlfriend of Lotringer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

When, seven years later, three teenagers kidnapped another teen and shot him dead on a hiking trail near their home, Kraus drew on her journalistic background to investigate their lives. Before they killed the victim and used his meagre savings to buy junk food, the teens spent 36 hours hanging out together. What had driven them to commit such a brutal and seemingly senseless killing, she wondered? The working-class America they had grown up in – an ex-mining town torn apart by addiction, violence, family breakdown, poverty and lack of opportunity – was entirely different from the blue-collar community in which she had spent her early years, and geographically close but a world apart from Kraus’s rural bolthole. A local landlord told her that the teenagers’ thinking and worldview were “depraved” – “and I thought that was the most profound answer I got from anyone in the book, much more so than the educators, the police, the lawyers,” she says. “There’s just an inexplicable depravity at the heart of it that pretty much defines American contemporary society. It’s a nihilism and an apathy that swirls underneath everything.”Meanwhile, she watches in horror as President Donald Trump succeeds in his “flood the zone” strategy, creating endless social media diversion to distract from his power grabs and excess. She is due to travel to Mexicali, in Baja California, to visit an exhibition by a Mexican friend who, although a green card holder, no longer dares travel to the US. “Why has the resistance to Trump been so ineffective?” I ask. The Trump administration is “so well-organised now, so relentless,” she says. “They are making incursions on every single front: the gerrymandering, the culture wars, the immigration roundups. To be in a position of resistance already takes so much more. It’s so much harder to defend than attack,” she adds. “That’s compounded by the fact that there’s no political party that has any glamour or allure to lead the resistance. The Democratic party could not be lamer or less sympathetic or appealing to anyone.” One person who has the right idea is Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, she continues. “He’s obviously less than a perfect avatar of the Democratic party. He’s a billionaire, he’s an enormously privileged person like Trump, but at least he gets it. You have to play the game you’re in and the game now in American politics is just cynicism, distraction and insult.”View image in fullscreen‘Writing anchors you in time’ … Kraus.Photograph: Maggie Shannon/The GuardianKraus is similarly politically outspoken in The Four Spent the Day Together, and she’s likely to annoy some on the left, too. She believes that the#MeToo movementoverreached, for instance. “There’s so much competition within the attention economy that people push things to their absolute limits,” she says. In 2018, she wrote a controversial blogpost defending Avital Ronell, a New York University professor who was accused of sexually harassing a male grad student. She maintains that Ronell, whom she describes in the book as a “philosopher pixie”, was “completely villainised” in the New York Times piece that broke the story. “It was so clear to me that this was the next media pivot. #MeToo was already getting a little played out and stale and for a gay man to accuse a gay woman, that gave it another month of play,” she says. (The NYU investigation had found that Ronell sexually harassed the student and suspended her for an academic year.)Around this time, she became subject to much Twitter mockery and insult for being a landlord, having for decades written and spoken openly about subsidising her artistic career by buying up and managing low-value rental properties. In her new book, she recounts since-deleted tweets by book critics calling her things like a “POS slumlord”. “I understand how people see landlordism as a kind of evil,” she says, because she recognises the frustrations of young people priced out of the property market, “but it’s a good and service like any other.” And unless you are independently wealthy, she points out, most artists need another source of income.For years, Kraus has taught graduate art students at the ArtCenter in Pasadena, and she’s acutely aware of how much harder it is becoming for underrepresented artists to break through. Arts and humanities funding and scholarships that were established in the 20th century, when the economic climate demanded a global professional class, have mostly disappeared, she says, and “techno-capitalism doesn’t need that educated class any more, so it’s all shutting down”. Would someone with her background be able to make it today? “Put it this way, my students or former students who are merely the children of lawyers or architects or college professors feel that they are underprivileged, because they won’t necessarily have access to family money beyond college,” she says. In much of her work she has tried to probe unexplored aspects of the human experience, but this kind of storytelling will become harder. “There’s nothing wrong with privileged people making art – they’re great artists,” she says, “but it’s a single channel of experience that gets represented.”The Four Spent the Day Together by Chris Kraus is published by Scribe.

I’d had a long string of admin jobs that I hated. Usually, it was the case that I didn’t know what my job was and nobody else did either. When I was 29, I thought: “I haven’t really done anything creative or put myself out there. Here I am with two kids, what am I doing?” So I signed up for an open mic night. I wasn’t going into comedy for the money – I wanted to see if I could do it.What inspired your latest show, Emmaculate?People have asked: “Is it about Madonna’s Immaculate Collection album?” No, it’s not. Although, I do nod to it because when I was in an all-girls school we had a talent show one year and the girl in the year ahead of us sang Like a Virgin. She was six months pregnant and we were all very judgy. I shouldn’t have been because that was me the following year.“Immaculate”, when I was growing up, was the biggest compliment a woman could pay another woman, mother to mother. That her house was immaculate, her children were immaculate … while she was probably having a breakdown. So, that’s where it comes from and the show is all about family.You’ve just added 18 extra shows to your tour. How does it feel to see that demand for your comedy?It makes me feel sick. Basically, all I do all day is refresh ticket pages to see if it was a good idea.Any preshow rituals?I try to move my body because I’m naturally a sloth. Before gigs, I’m usually still in my coat, curled up in a ball and vaping. So I try to get up and do a few squats or something to get some blood pumping.What’s one of the strangest fan encounters you’ve had?One time, somebody took it upon themselves to come backstage and they brought cookies with my face on them. I learned from an older, more experienced comedian, that you never eat the food. So I had to bin them straight away, even though they did look nice.Actually, what happens most is somebody on the street sees me and then I have to stand there while they explain to their friend who I am – and start showing them videos. It’s very awkward.Any bugbears from the world of comedy?There’s nothing worse than a dodgy mic. If I rock up to a venue and they say, “The thing about the mic is …” I just go, “Oh, God. Here we go.” That sends me into a decline.Can you recall a gig so bad, it’s now funny?I did a gig and the MC proposed to her girlfriend just before she brought me on. It was so bizarre. I often think of that MC and how they are getting on. I don’t think they ever got married … so it was needless.What advice would you give your younger self?I wouldn’t bother because she’d probably just look at me and say, “Who is this old woman?”, and try to bum a cigarette off me. I probably would just say to her keep going with the standup. But I’m sure she’d be like, “Yeah, I was going to do that anyway.”Do you have any regrets?Loads. Even as I’m sitting here, talking to you, I regret that I didn’t wash my hair last night and I’m going around with a big greasy mop.Emma Doran: Emmaculate ison tourin the UK and Ireland until 24 AprilExplore more on these topicsStageComedy Q&AComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)featuresShareReuse this content"

They are namechecked early in a play about the region’s recent rugby union history to make the point that, in the early 80s,Exeterused to lose to neighbourhood clubs considered minnows.Exe Men is adapted by Ashley Pharoah from Guardian rugby writerRobert Kitson’s 2020 book. It shows how an ambitious investor, Tony Rowe, and enterprising coach, Rob Baxter, renamed the club the Exeter Chiefs and made them the best in England andthen Europe. The Chiefs were the Seabiscuit of jock-straps and scrum caps, the Leicester City of rugby.The biggest problem in sporting theatre is how to stage the games without the audience being hit by flying balls or the too obvious difference between the movement of actors and professional athletes. David Storey’s great 1971 rugby league play, The Changing Room is sensibly set around the action. As the Chiefs’ rise had so many rich onfield scenes, Pharoah and director Martin Berry really have to show some rucks, scrums and drop kicks but do so impressionistically; in the props department, the score is: rugby balls 1, giant inflatable plastic penises 2. (The latter relating to Baxter’s coaching manual containing a thick section on getting loose on the bus and in the pub.) Play is portrayed through effective tableaux created by movement director Kim Healey, the use of a community cast of volunteers allowing Berry sometimes to have two full XVs on the artificial turf covering the strip of stage between seating risers called for this show “stands”.View image in fullscreenEnterprising … Robert Shaw Cameron as coach Rob Baxter.Photograph: Craig FullerTwo other obstacles are a two-decade span and a potential lack of tension as even non-Chiefs fans know that there wouldn’t be a book and play if the team hadn’t kept winning. Pharoah, though, has a sure sense of when to cut and run from the calendar (one four-year jump), within a match or from sport to home, including a powerful scene of private grief.The biggest risk is of a local show for local people. Certainly, names of places and players drew cheers but Exe Men holds wider interest by exploring the metaphor in the Storey title: that sport changes people. The great Chiefs team – multiple squad members played by Joe Feeney, Pete Watts and Emile Ruddock with engaging versatility – were allowed a second chance, reflecting a generosity projected by Tim Hudson’s Rowe and Robert Shaw Cameron’s Baxter. Micha Colombo as the coach’s wife has a narrative subs’ bench role but, with the amateur cast, radiates an appropriate sense of team work.AtExeter Northcott theatreuntil 18 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreExeterRugby unionDevonreviewsShareReuse this content"

Is this the champion the American left has been waiting for?Steve RoseSat 11 Oct 2025 00.00 EDTShareBen Meiselas is a very busy man. So busy, he has to break off halfway through our interview to conduct an interview of his own, for his next broadcast. It’s 7am Los Angeles time when we meet via video call, and Meiselas is already well into another 18-hour day of podcasting, planning, interviewing, meetings and more besides. His “pro-democracy” channel MeidasTouch, which he runs with his younger brothers Jordan and Brett, puts out 15 or more videos a day, most of them presented by Meiselas himself. “I was doing another video before this,” he says, “and so by now I’ve already released one video I did last night, which was my 4am, and now I just worked on my 7am – it’ll get released any minute now. And then I’ll have an 8.30, a 10, an 11.30 …”The prolific output is part of the reasonThe MeidasTouchhas become one of the most listened-to podcasts in the US, routinely beating the mighty Joe Rogan in bothvideoand audio, and even overtaking Fox News in YouTube views. Rogan and others in the right-leaning podcast manosphere are thought to have swung the 2024 election in Donald Trump’s favour, prompting much soul-searching on the American left about its media game, and why they need a Joe Rogan of their own; MeidasTouch seems to have stepped in to fill the void.That void extends far beyond just podcasting, in Meiselas’s view. He is appalled at how the US media has reacted since Trump came to power. “It’s a total capitulation,” he says. “They’re either corporate news – like cable news, [which is] just completely both-sides-ing the issues and intentionally ignoring critical, existential things – or they’re just outright state regime media à la North Korea and Russia: Fox News, OAN [One America News], Newsmax … All of these corporations are run by rightwing oligarchs; they are tools to ingratiate themselves with the regime for other benefits and other business interests.”The spectacle of CEOs and podcast bros alike “kissing the ring” at Trump’s inauguration cemented this impression early on. As counter-programming, Meiselas broadcast four hours ofcute puppies and kittens, raising funds for the Humane Society.View image in fullscreenThe Meiselas brothers collecting their Webby award earlier this year: from left, Jordan, Ben and Brett.Photograph: Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images for the Webby AwardsIf the left is looking for itsJoe Rogan, though, Meiselas doesn’t quite fit the bill. Where Rogan is casual, rambling and often credulous of his guests’ outlandish claims, Meiselas is focused, well-informed and disdainful. And as you’d expect of a former trial lawyer, he speaks with an off-the-cuff fluency (“no scripts, no notes – that’s part of the connection I build with the audience”), and he brings receipts. If he has a catchphrase, it’s “play this clip” – as he illustrates yet another incidence of Republican duplicity/hypocrisy/incompetence/deception/authoritarianism with video, audio, graphs or data.He can be a level-headed interviewer – this week he has spoken to Democrat leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and newly elected congresswoman Adelita Grijalva. (He breaks off from our interview to talk to a former commissioner for the Federal Communications Commission about free speech and media monopolies.) But over the course of a typical episode – which could be a 20-minute solo broadcast or a 90-minute talk with his brothers – he often becomes audibly outraged at what’s going on.We’re not talking about abstract concepts. People are waking up every day feeling that this is life or death for themPut that all together, and tonally MeidasTouch is somewhere between wartime resistance broadcast and wrestling commentary. Meiselas is not above throwing out insults: the Republican house leader is consistently referred to as “Maga Mike Johnson”, for example, and he is as merciless about Trump’s health as the rightwing media was about Joe Biden’s. He doesn’t hesitate to speak his mind: “What the hell are these people even talking about?” “Stop making up things and defrauding the American people.” “These people are sick.” And MeidasTouch’s episode titles conform to the hyperbolic YouTube vernacular: “Trump is COLLAPSING under SHUTDOWN PRESSURE!!!”, “​​Trump LOOKS AWFUL as PRESSER Goes OFF THE RAILS”. One journalist described MeidasTouch’s commentary as “seemingly calculated to appeal to those for whom [MSNBC host]Rachel Maddowis too subtle.”Meiselas makes no apologies for his house style. “I don’t curse,” he says. “I try to still keep it as much as possible appropriate for everyone. But on the other hand, I think where you have characters who are cartoonishly evil, like Maga Mike Johnson or JD Vance, framing them for the WWE cosplay characters they’ve become is actually an accurate way of describing who they are … I’m just trying to reflect the language of, truthfully, what it is that I’m seeing, and I think the growth of the network is the audience responding: ‘Yes, that’s exactly how I see it.’” He is speaking from the same home office in which his 5.5 million subscribers see him every day; it’s somewhat uncanny – as if I’m watching my own personal episode of his podcast.In his view, it’s other media outlets that are not meeting the moment. “We’re beyond a constitutional crisis. America’s living in a dictatorship right now. And the question is, how will an opposition respond to a dictatorship?” he says. “This is not a time to be playing games. People are waking up every day feeling, and rightfully so, that this is really life or death for them. We’re not talking about abstract concepts. People are saying, ‘I may not be able to afford healthcare and I’m going to die.’ So they don’t want to be lectured about, ‘Well, on the one hand; on the other hand.’ They want to be told directly, ‘What are you going to do to fight for my life? What are you going to do to fight for my healthcare? My community is under attack right now. There are masked agents who are disappearing human beings right here.’ Or, ‘I’m a member of a marginalised group’ – whether it’s a gay person, LGBTQ – ‘and I matter. I’m a human being, damn it.’ I think where we come in, very unapologetically, is we say, ‘We’re fighting for you, and we don’t waver on our values.’”This is what separates his operation from the forces they’re opposing, he says, despite their superficial resemblances. “You have to unite people with empathy and love and community and shared values as a force against the hate.” He’s all for building connections: communally, politically and internationally – given the global rise of far-right politics. “That, to me, is more important than, ‘Am I beating Joe Rogan this week or that week?’”View image in fullscreenMeiselas … ‘I don’t like politics. It distorts from what the human issues really are.’Photograph: Philip Cheung/The GuardianMeiselas, 40, didn’t set out to build a media empire, nor did he really have to. Until about 2020 he was a partner in a successful law firm and his career was flying. The legal profession was in his blood, you could say. His mother practised law for a spell; his father, Kenny, is a leading entertainment lawyer whose clients include Lady Gaga, the Weeknd, Nicki Minaj and formerly Sean “Diddy” Combs, who wasrecently sentencedto more than four years in prison for prostitution-related charges. Meiselas actually interned for Combs’ Bad Boy Records for a few summers in his late teens. AVariety profilefrom 2019 claimed that Combs “took Meiselas under his wing, resulting in a precocious and priceless apprenticeship”, but he was not part of Diddy’s entourage or witness to any of wrongdoing, he stresses: “I was very low on the totem pole.” He was actually working on Diddy’sCitizen Changeinitiative, which was about voter registration for young people.He grew up on Long Island, New York, with his two brothers: Brett, who is five years younger, and Jordan, eight years younger. “We always did things together as brothers,” he says. “Like, we made videos, even in the early days of Adobe editing. We would do comedy skits together in the back yard for fun, and we would make movies together for our school projects.” Then, as now, Ben was the leader, it seems. A confident public speaker, he was president of his student government in middle school and high school, and of various undergraduate clubs. In his early 20s he interned on Capitol Hill, for New York Democrat Steve Israel, then for Hillary Clinton when she was a senator. “I would hand her the speeches before she spoke, answer constituent mail, give tours of the Capitol building – which was my favourite part about it.”He was one of the youngest students at law school, in Georgetown, Washington DC, but he only really became enthused when he began studying civil rights law. He was recruited out of college to a small law California firm and “thrown into the fire”, he says. Within three years, still in his mid-20s, he was in court handling significant cases of brutality and wrongful death at the hands of the police (he assisted the Guardian’sreporting on these issuesin 2015), and invariably winning them. That led to representing Colin Kaepernick when the San Francisco 49ers quarterback sued the NFL for excluding him for taking a knee, in what seems like a different era (they reached a confidential settlement). He went on to become a business partner with Kaepernick and they remain good friends.View image in fullscreenColin Kaepernick (right) takes the knee.Photograph: Mike McCarn/APIn retrospect, it could look as if Meiselas was destined for a career in politics, but it never really appealed. “When I became a civil rights lawyer, I actually started to not like politics, because politicians would start calling me up for money,” he says. “I still, and I say this all the time on the show, don’t like politics. To me, politics distorts from what the human issues really are.” He doesn’t quite rule it out for the future, though. “I can’t imagine it ever happening. I know it sounds like a political answer to say that, but I really have no desire at all.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Again, he doesn’t mince words. “I thought that Trump was killing people,” he says. “He would do these Covid press conferences, and it would be spewing a bunch of nonsense and disinformation. And me and my brothers were like, ‘Are you watching this? What the hell is going on? We need to do something to call this out.’”At the time Brett was a digital editor for Ellen DeGeneres’ TV show, and Jordan worked in marketing. The brothers began producing anti-Trump videos that started to go viral. One of them, with a#CreepyTrumphashtag, superimposed GOP insider Kellyanne Conway’s comments about Joe Biden being “creepy” over clips of Trump’s inappropriate comments about young women, including his daughter Ivanka. They formed a political action committee, to raise funds for Joe Biden’s campaign, but found simply placing TV attack ads to be unsatisfactory – “You’re renting space on their network, and they’re undermining your message with their both-sides-ism.”Then the January 6 attacks happened, and the brothers decided to start their own podcast in earnest. “We just said, ‘Let’s just put out our own show together, from our living rooms,” Meiselas says. “The quality wasn’t great, but the first podcast we put out, there was a decent-size audience and the feedback was great. And so we’re like, ‘There’s something there.’”Meiselas began phasing out his legal work, and fully quit the day job in 2023. As well as him and his brothers, MeidasTouch now has a whole stable of hosts, including Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer; it produces shows not just on politics but on legal and economic matters. And it is expanding internationally: in September it launched a Canada podcast. “For us, the strategy is just to try to be everywhere,” he says. And not just in the interests of expanding the brand: “It may be important in the future to have international hubs getting out the message, in the event that there’s additional kind of clampdowns here.”Is TikTok about to go full Maga? – podcastRead moreThere is no shortage of material for anti-Maga podcasting at the moment, but will the world still need such granular focus on day-to-day politics once the Trump era comes to an end in 2028 (assuming it actually does)? Even the podcast bros who supported Trump, including Rogan and Theo Von, are now turning against him over issues such as the Jeffrey Epstein saga and his brutal immigration policies. “I don’t think anybody would have signed up for [this],” Rogan said in July.“I think there’s always going to be a Trump worldview,” says Meiselas, “whether that’s embodied in Trump, or a Maga perspective, or the next generation that’s going to push these ideas. And while we’re often framed as anti-Trump or liberal or left, I don’t see it like that at all. Because to me, it’s what Trump represents, and what he does, that I’m against. It’s that he’s laundering a set of ideas that permeate internationally, that impact you in the UK, in Europe, in South and Central America, in Russia. He is a vehicle and a vessel for these concepts that I think bring us back to the dark ages.”Either way, Meiselas’s 18-hour shifts aren’t going to end any time soon – but he is fine with that, he says. At least he gets to work from home. “When I was a lawyer and I would have trials across the country, I’d be travelling for weeks and months, and I’d be in Utah or New York or San Francisco or wherever,” he says.He married last year and has a baby daughter. “She just turned one, so I’m able to do some videos, I get to walk my little girl up the block, we walk back, I do another video, we have lunch together, I do another video. So for me, it’s actually a blessing.” But he laughs as he admits that he’s never really not working. “Even when I’m doing the walks, I’m always thinking a little bit about what’s next. I’m always trying to make the connections in my mind.”But it doesn’t reallyfeellike work, he says. “I don’t wake up and I’m like, ‘Another day at work …’ I feel a broader sense of this historical moment and where the network fits into it. I feel every day is like, ‘This is what I was meant to do.’”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The gym is too far away, and the effort to get there is just too much. In short, I don’t go because I’m lazy.But what would happen if you remove the friction? What would happen if you literally moved into a gym? If youlivedat the gym? As in: you slept at the gym, socialised at the gym and ate all your meals there? Would it change anything? Would you become agym person?After a couple of months travelling where I didn’t hold back on alcohol and carbs, I decided on radical action to get over my gym-phobia.‘Inject that Stoicism into my veins!’: 10 tools of ancient philosophy that improved my lifeRead moreI flew from France to Thailand, where I moved into a four-storey gym adjoined by 17 hotel rooms. I lived there for a week, taking as many classes, ice baths, saunas and scoops of protein powder as I could handle.Unlike a wellness retreat, the gym at Action Point, in the southern tip of Phuket, is open to the public. It has a weights room, a yoga studio, sauna, cold plunge, swimming pool, cafe and cardio room. It is so close to the accommodation I was able to get out of bed at 7.20am and make it to a 7.30am class.‘Rinse and repeat, all week’A day living at Action Point looks something like this: wake up at 7.20am, grab a protein shake and drink it quickly before a 7.30am Morning Mobility (stretch and movement) class. Then it’s up to the cafe, with its swimming pool and views across Phuket. For breakfast? Eggs, of course! Or a protein hotcake as heavy as a shot put. Cross training starts at 9am, while at 10.15am – one floor up – you can take power yoga.For lunch, more protein. At 1pm there is personal training, or a one-on-one Muay Thai session. The afternoon is set aside for recovery which may involve an in-room massage, a nap, an ice bath and sauna, then an early dinner at 5pm with your training mates and, three times a week, a knowledge session on mindset or nutrition. In the evening there is yin yoga, maybe some singing bowls or meditation, and an early bedtime of 8pm. Spending 11 hours in bed at night is easy when you’re tired from all the exercise.Rinse and repeat, all week.When I arrived, my fitness was very poor. Yes, I had been biking around France, but it was an electric bike, and I was only riding to restaurants.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningSo I was always going to find the first few days a shock. My first personal training session focused on the right way to do squats. I bounced up and down, trying to get lower each time, departing from my natural sitting range (bar-stool height).The next day, I am broken! The only way I can get out of bed is to commando roll on to the ground, then hoist myself up to standing by gripping a chair. Leaving breakfast, I cling to a hand rail to go down two stairs, like an elderly person.‘I worry I am now mostly protein’But my program also included recovery. Action Point manager Chris Lawless tells me this helps prevent injuries, and I was grateful to be returning to my room for a massage. Or as Charli xcx put it on B2b: “Took a long time, breaking muscle down, building muscle up, repeating it.”Then there’s the food. This wellness retreat is not of the White Lotus variety. It’s more of the white protein variety.

It’s the rainy season, the water is foamy and brown and when I enter the surf, a strong current deposits me down the other end of the beach, like I am a parcel of protein.As I shake off the sand, I long to return to Action Point. Life lived according to the gym timetable doesn’t contain too many dangers or surprises.‘It’s easy to think of staying here for ever’I’m not the only one to feel this way. People keep extending their stays. One week becomes two, becomes four, becomes “I’m moving to Phuket and going to this gym all the time”.It is tempting. A storm races across the sky. You watch the rain bounce off the swimming pool as you sip your thick protein shake and contemplate an ice bath. Each day you get better at Muay Thai. You contemplate entering a seniors competition. Classes feel like a community – people are friendly, a mix of Thai and foreign – it’s easy to think of staying here for ever.Each day I get stronger, more flexible, fitter. I can walk down stairs again! But then again, I am living at the gym.The war in my head, that is always in my head – the battle to go to the gym – has quietened. Of course I will go to the gym today. I’m already here.Brigid Delaney was a guest ofAction Point. She is the author ofWellmania(A$27.99, Black Inc).

Is this the right dirt track? Is our progress going to be thwarted at any moment by an impenetrable thicket, or worse still an implacable landowner who will force a ham-fisted reverse? As it turns out, we are only temporarily stalled by two male peacocks jousting in the middle of the lane in a kaleidoscopic blur of feathers and fury. We wait for them to retire to the grass verge and continue to bounce up the track until we see a sign for our cottage pointing to the left. This leads us deeper into a woodland of oak, ash, birch and Douglas fir, until we finally see a brick-and-stone house standing in a clearing set back from the trail.From the outside, Van Cottage looks like a pioneer homestead, with a crooked stone chimney to one side and a metal-roofed veranda to the other. Around the corner there’s a wood-fired hot tub, and beyond the garden fence in a little forest glade is a small brick dunny. The house sits on a ridge, and the garden offers views over the carmine-coloured ploughed fields and billowy woodland of Herefordshire.View image in fullscreenThis pioneer spirit continues inside, where there’s a kitchen with a wood-fired range, and an oak-beamed living room with a wood burner, a comfy sofa and a range of books. A wall of old oak boards has retained remnants of the wallpaper of previous occupants, adding a patina of history. The original two-up, two-down stone cottage dates back to the 18th century and a brick extension was added in the mid 19th century. Upstairs, there are two bedrooms, a shower room and a sink overlooked by a mirror encased in an old leather horse collar, in keeping with the cottage’s farm-labourer origins. But the most recent renovation has converted it into a wood- and solar-powered off-grid escape.View image in fullscreenThe living room at Van Cottage.Photograph: Matt DaviesMy own idea of an off-grid escape has roughly conformed to the same blueprint since I read a line in Albert Bigelow Paine’s The Tent Dwellers many years ago: “Then away to the heart of the deep unknown, where the trout and the wild moose are. Where the fire burns bright, and the tents gleam white, under the northern star.”In our current deep unknown, a fleeting glimpse of a roe deer as I make my way to the outside dunny will have to make do for the wild moose. But we get the fires burning bright in the stove and the hot tub and then strike out around fields of buttercups and clover to walk down to a lake stocked with trout on the nearby Whitfield Estate. As I cast a line out over the water, a red kite circles in the thermals above and the chirrup of a redstart in an oak provides the melodic soundtrack. After thrashing the water until dusk, I walk away empty-handed but content.The only thing missing from this Disneyesque scene is a flotilla of butterfliesBack at the cottage, we lower ourselves into the outdoor hot tub, which has reached a tolerable temperature, and watch the stars gleam white as a blanket of darkness envelopes the cottage and a tawny owl hoots in the distance.The next morning, the realisation of being off-grid truly kicks in. While I wait for the kettle to boil – a full 30 minutes as I neglected to keep the stove stoked overnight – I step outside and into a cacophony of nature. My bird app identifies chiffchaffs, wrens, great tits, blackcaps, blackbirds, nuthatches and a woodpecker. A startled hare skitters beyond the garden fence and a group of female pheasants saunter by. The only thing missing from this Disneyesque scene is a flotilla of butterflies.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Matt DaviesThe thing about waiting for a kettle to boil is that it forces you to slow down. So I occupy my time by reading the cottage’s literature, in which I discover that nearby, on the A465 to Hereford, isLock’s Garage, described as “one of the great frontier stores in the whole country”. The notion of a frontier store in the UK is new to me, but it plays perfectly into my romanticised notion of backwoods living. The reality, when I arrive at Lock’s Garage later is a little more prosaic. It’s a petrol station with a Londis storefront. But I soon discover that it’s so much more besides. Outside, the fruit and veg shelves display trays of giant papaya, agave leaves, dragon fruit, lychees and nashi pears. And inside the fridges are laden with grass-fed Hereford beef and rare-breed pork, some from the owners’ own farm. There’s cheese from Hereford and Wales, and local beers and wine. We come away with sausages and steaks for the barbecue that evening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

One day, we walk down into Kilpeck village, where grotesque medieval motifs guard the porch of the Church of St Mary and St David, which architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described as “one of the most perfect Norman churches in England”. We explore the ruins of the Norman motte and bailey castle overlooking the church, and a painterly landscape beyond of barns and grazing Hereford cows. We stop for lunch atthe Kilpeck Inn, where we dine on sea bream with cauliflower and brown butter puree, and local cider, before walking it off on a stretch of theHerefordshire Trail.View image in fullscreenSkenfrith Castle is just over the border in Monmouthshire.Photograph: Maciej Olszewski/AlamyOn other days we head into Hay‑on‑Wye to browse the bookshops, and walk country lanes aroundSkenfrith Castle, just over the border in Monmouthshire. But mostly we spend the time sitting outside listening to birdsong, pulling books from the shelves and deciding our daily menu. It’s surprising how fully so little can occupy you without a television to fill in the gaps. And even though the cottage has broadband, our laptops remain unopened throughout the visit. We replace doomscrolling with keeping the home fires burning in the range and the hot tub. Each evening is spent with a saunter down to the lake in pursuit of an elusive trout. And each evening I return to the cottage with an empty net, but with a lightness of being after another day in the “heart of the deep unknown … and under the northern star”.The trip was provided byThe Cottage Company.

I’m not sure why this happened, but I can tell you that I love the energy that platters give to a table, and the gentle sense of pomp and ceremony they lend even the simplest of meals. My love for the platter has dictated today’s recipe, a final fling with the very last of the summer vegetables served over whipped feta.Za’atar roast vegetables with whipped fetaYou’ll need a food processor for the whipped feta.Prep15 minCook40 minServes4400g courgettes, cut into irregular, roughly 3cm x 3cm pieces1 red onion, peeled and cut into 1½cm-thick wedges at their widest point300g fetaExtra-virgin olive oil2 tsp za’atar, plus extra for servingFine sea salt and black pepper1 small aubergine(450g), cut into irregular, roughly 5cm x 4cm shapes100g greek yoghurtFinely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon– you’ll need only ½ tbsp of the juice570g jar butter beans, drained to get 240g (save the rest for another use)20g fresh mint, leaves picked and torn, to serveHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 and line two large rectangular baking trays with (ideally reusable) baking paper.Put the courgettes and onion in a bowl, break in a third of the feta in small pieces, and add three tablespoons of oil, a teaspoon of za’atar and a half-teaspoon of salt. Tip out on to one of the lined trays, making sure all the vegetables have enough legroom.Put the chopped aubergine in the now-empty bowl and add two tablespoons of oil, another teaspoon of za’atar and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Tip out on to the second tray, and save the bowl for later. Roast both trays of vegetables for 30 minutes, until tender and golden in spots.Meanwhile, put the remaining 200g feta in a food processor with the yoghurt and three tablespoons of oil, then add the lemon zest, half a tablespoon of lemon juice and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and blitz until smooth.Spread the whipped feta on to a platter big enough to hold all the vegetables. When the vegetables are out of the oven, tip them all, cooking juices included, back into the reserved bowl, stir through the butter beans and mint, and season with a little freshly ground black pepper. Check for seasoning and oil, adding both to taste, then tip on top of the whipped feta and serve.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesMeera Sodha recipesFoodCheeseVegetarian food and drinkMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

With watering eyes, pumping endorphins and overactive salivary glands, I licked each mustard off a spoon, then quickly cleansed my palate with plenty of milk and water to subdue the heat. But the sandwich I had at the end, with my new favourite mustard, was worth every fiery spoonful.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Mustard is intriguingly complex in flavour – powerful, umami, hot – yet easy to make. At its simplest, it is little more than fermented mustard seeds soaked in brine until viscous and bubbling. Sadly, however, many modern brands, especially the cheaper ones, see fit to include unnecessary additives, such as xanthan gum and wheat flour. And, rather predictably, the cheaper the mustard, the less actual mustard it tends to contain.Much as withmayonnaise, many processed mustards contain spirit vinegar instead of more subtle acids, such as white-wine or cider vinegar. Spirit vinegar is harsh and sharp, dominates the overall flavour and can result in an unappealingly aerated, mousse-like texture. In fact, six of the mustards I tasted were so similar, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if they were all made in the same factory. They were essentially carbon copies of each other – sulphuric, sweet, hot and moussey – even if they did still bear the hallmark fieriness and complexity of a classic English mustard.So, when looking for a mustard that’s worth your money, seek out those with real vinegar rather than spirit vinegar, and without emulsifiers or texturing agents such as wheat flour; they’re simply unnecessary. Or, better still, make your own: you can easilyproduce a year’s worth of mustardwith just five minutes’ work.The best supermarket English mustardBestoverall:Stokes classic English mustardView image in fullscreen£2.90 for 185g at Ocado (£1.57/100g)★★★★☆Satin-sheen gold with a sweet, clean aroma.
