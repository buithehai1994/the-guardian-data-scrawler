Starmer survives another week, and it’s only cost us £26bnMarina HydeLabour can proudly say this was a budget for working people – that is, if your job happens to be prime ministerFri 28 Nov 2025 10.14 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 14.18 ESTShareThanks to Labour’s incredible Black Friday deal, breaking manifesto policies is buy-one-get-one-free. As part of its all-promises-must-go drive, it’s ditching its flagship policy giving the right toclaim unfair dismissal from day oneof employment. Employers will now have up to six months to summarily sack workers who don’t pan out – unless they’re the government, in which case people have to wait till 2029.The employment rights bill was drawn up and championedby Angela Rayner, who resigned in September following a series of discoveries about her tax affairs. Weird to think that Rayner could easily have been in the I’m a Celebrity camp right now. The former deputy PM reportedlygot pretty far along in her discussions with ITV in terms of booking a spot on the current series of the fauna-testicle-based format, and could at this very moment have been giving us her Queen Over the Water/Queen in the Jungle Shower for 80 minutes of primetime a night. But in the end, Rayner seems to have concluded – or had it concluded for her – that there wouldn’t be a way back to frontline politics if she took that particular leave of absence.Such are the sliding-doors moments in our very serious politics. Who’s to say for sure, but maybe Rayner will now be thinking that declining the ostrich anus was the right call as she does the House of Commons tearoom trial over the coming days. According tobriefings, she’ll be taking soundings from the various malcontents who seemingly run the party from the backbenches, who got most of what they wanted in the budget this week, and who still see themselves as victims of something or other. Arguably, Labour backbenchers should count their blessings. Unlike most of the rest of the country, they have guaranteed jobs for the next few years, unless they sexually harass a junior staff member or whatever. And, on the parliamentary standards form book, even if they do. In recent times, employment rights for MPs seem all too frequently to have been modelled on those of medieval feudal lords.Anyway, whichever way you slice it, the government is back in a familiar place: arguing about whether it did or didn’t break a manifesto commitment, just as it has spent the past few days doing over its tax-raising budget. It is also arguing about whether or not it was lying on Monday when it insisted it wasn’t going to water the employment rights bill down, even though it was meeting business leaders and unions on that same day to discuss doingjust that.First out to defend all this hokey cokey was business secretary Peter Kyle, who always comes off as a man playing a businessman in a play about business. According to Kyle, the pledge ditch doesn’t break the manifesto because “the manifesto committed us tofinding compromise”. Did it though? By chance I have the document in front of me on my desk – they are always worth hanging on to, I find – and there is precisely nothing about compromise in it as far as I can see. Maybe there was a limited-edition manifesto with bonus material? Or maybe talking about all this is better than talking about our absent friend – growth.And so to Rachel Reeves’s budget. From almost the minute she took office, no one seems to have been more surprised by economic realities than the chancellor. OK – with the possible exception of the prime minister. Remember that during last year’s general election campaign, Keir Starmer wentabsolutely nutsat Rishi Sunak for suggesting that Labour would, in fact, need to raise taxes to pay for all the things it said it was buying. Sunak was lying, insisted the Labour leader, and had seriously breached the ministerial code by doing so. “He knew very well what he was doing,” Starmer fumed to the cameras back then. “He lied about our plans. And that is a true test of character. As we go to the polls it is important for voters to know about the character of the two individuals who want to be prime minister.” Mate, they know a lot more now.In fact, blissful ignorance is very much off the menu all round. Spool forward to the immediate aftermath of this latest budget, and Helen Miller, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS),said: “Before this budget, the UK was faced with lacklustre economic growth, stagnating living standards, and a dizzying array of fiscal pressures. The same is still true after this budget.” The tax burden that went up by £40bn last November went up a further £26bn this week – and the IFS wascrystal clearthat rises in national insurance in the budget did represent a manifesto breach. A moment for reflection in Downing Street? Not so’s you’d notice. When the Conservatives were in power, Labour could never stop talking about the IFS, refusing to even name it without prefixing it with its epithet “the trusted”. Now, strangely, it doesn’t want to talk about the IFS at all.As for what the upshot of all this will be, it was great to learn today that the budget’s apparently overriding aim – not to offend Labour backbenchers – has been judged sufficiently successful in that regard thus far tokeep Starmer’s job safetill after the May elections. You’ve heard of a budget for jobs. Sadly, we can’t have that. What we seem to have had instead is a budget for job: one in particular. Unfair dismissal may be in the headlines now; fair dismissal is likely to be more of a preoccupation in the coming months.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But are contemporary artists more collaborative than their renaissance predecessors?Jonathan JonesFri 28 Nov 2025 12.51 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 13.21 ESTShare“He has been here and fired a gun,”John Constablesaid of JMW Turner. A shootout between these two titans would make a good scene for in a film of their lives, but in reality all Turner did at the 1832 Royal Academy exhibition was add a splash of red to a seascape, to distract from the Constable canvas beside it.That was by far the most heated moment in what seems to us a struggle on land and sea for supremacy in British art. It’s impossible not to see Tate Britain’s new double header of their work this way. For it is a truth universally acknowledged, to paraphrase their contemporary Jane Austen, that when two great artists live at the same time, they must be bitter and remorseless rivals. But is that really so, and does it help or hinder creativity?Turner & Constable review – boiling portentous skies versus two men and a dogRead moreThe Renaissance sculptor Benvenuto Cellini literally fired guns, blasting a man to death at close range with an arquebus. But when he contemplated murdering his rival Baccio Bandinelli, whom he claimed was “full of badness” and whose statue of Hercules looked “like a sack of melons”, it was with his trusty dagger. Cellini spotted Bandinelli across a quiet piazza, according to his autobiography, and reached for his blade to end their competition for Medici patronage with a single knife blow – but spared him.It’s just one intense moment recorded between Renaissance artists. In fact the story of the Renaissance can be told as a series of rivalries: Cimabue v Giotto, Bellini v Giorgione, Michelangelo v Raphael, Michelangelo v Bramante, Michelangelo v Titian and of course Michelangelo vLeonardo da Vinci. Michelangelo, the feuder’s feuder, humiliated Leonardo by telling him in front of others he was a failure: “You who promised to make a bronze horse in Milan and couldn’t do it.” Leonardo got his revenge when he called for Michelangelo’s David to be made “decent” with bronze underpants.When Artemisia Gentileschi moved to Naples, she had to get a weapons licence in a city so tough it had an art mafia known as the Cabal that violently menaced rivals. In 1621 the Cabal, led by the painter Jusepe de Ribera, severely wounded the visiting artist Guido Reni’s assistant to scare him out of Naples. It may also have lethally poisoned Domenichino, another outsider who got a big commission.You can’t really call that healthy competition. But it was believed in Renaissance Italy that rivalry was constructive, with artists driving one another on: given the works it produced, the theory may have something in it. Michelangelo’s most creative standoff was with Titian. He once said the Venetian painter would be really good, if only he could draw. Despite this catty remark, the two artists mutually influenced each other, Titian borrowing the pose of Michelangelo’s statue Night for his nude painting Danaë,Michelangelorivalling Titian’s colour and space in his The Last Judgment.View image in fullscreenMatisse and Picasso: they pushed and pulled each other in rivalry for decades.Composite: National Gallery of AustraliaSuch epic rivalries have happened in modern times. After Francis Bacon died in 1992, Lucian Freud bloomed, painting his colossal, heroic nudes of Leigh Bowery and Sue Tilley. They were friends, and on Bacon’s part it may have been love, but there was some sense in which Bacon’s brilliance daunted the younger man. With Picasso and Matisse it was the opposite: after Matisse died, Picasso’s art went flabby. They’d pushed and pulled each other in rivalry for decades, ever since Matisse gave Picasso a painting in 1907 and Picasso, it was gossiped, used it as a dartboard.Yet such grand creative tensions went against the opposite tendency for modern artists to bond together. Were there undercurrents of rivalry between Monet and Renoir, Dalí and Magritte, Pollock and De Kooning? Maybe, but avant gardes from the Impressionists onwards saw themselves as gangs of friends united against the bourgeois enemy. When Gauguin and Van Gogh fell out it wasn’t because of rivalry, but Vincent’s illness. Picasso, while rivals with Matisse, collaborated harmoniously with Braque to create cubism.View image in fullscreenThe joint winners of the 2019 Turner Prize (l-r): Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo, Tai Shani and Lawrence Abu Hamdan.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThis belief that artists should be collaborators rather than rivalrous enemies is very much in fashion. The 2019 Turner Prize nominees evenchose to share the award as a “collective”. It was charming, but what would Turner have said, let alone Michelangelo? Shunning competition makes the Turner Prize feel pointless. It may be why there are no more art heroes any more.Artistic competition goes to the essence of critical discrimination. TS Eliot said someone who liked all poetry would be very dull to talk to about poetry. Double header exhibitions that rake up old rivalries are not shallow, but help us all be critics and understand that loving means choosing. If you come out of Turner and Constable admiring both artists equally, you probably haven’t truly felt either. And if you prefer Constable, it’s pistols at dawn.Explore more on these topicsJMW TurnerJohn ConstableMichelangeloLeonardo da VinciHistory of artfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Seenaked dressing, where stars on the red carpet wear transparent and sometimes barely there gowns.This party season, however, there appears to be a real-life friendly compromise. Enter the sheer skirt.Sheer skirts have appeared on the catwalk at brands including Simone Rocha and Chanel, and have been worn by celebrities. This week, Jacqueline Bisset wore one with a blazer to the Torino film festival, while Victoria Beckham wore one to a hen party in the summer. But they are also now on the high street – including at Cos and Marks & Spencer. At Depop, searches for sheer skirts are up 99% since January.These designs often come with a strategically placed opaque panel to preserve the wearer’s modesty. This fact alone may mean that a more respectable version of naked dressing will be spotted this party season. But even the more risque skirts – without the panel – are workable when worn with a jumper or blazer to cover the bottom. Of course, should the wearer be keen to combine extreme trends, they work with the “day knicker” as loved by the likes of Emma Corrin this summer.View image in fullscreenMillie Bobby Brown dares to bare with her sheer skirt and corset.Photograph: Cristina Massei/ipa-agency.net/ShutterstockGaëlle Drevet, the founder of The Frankie Shop, says the brand’sPeri skirthas been a bestseller since it launched last year. She believes the sheer texture hits a sweet spot. “It strikes a balance that feels very modern,” she says. “It’s sexy and a little daring, but never too much.”Karin Gustafsson, the creative director of Cos, says sheer skirts have been popular too. She puts it down to the “underwear as outerwear” trend, and also the effect of layering. “When colour is in transparent layers, it becomes beautiful and radiant.”The content creator Camille Charriere is an expert in wearing sheer –her wedding dresswas made from upcycled sheer lace. She suggests there is more to the trend than pretty fabrics: “I don’t think society is any less misogynistic – just look at the comments under pictures of anyone wearing anything see-through – but I do think women are caring less and less about what others have to say and that is really great.” She referencesthe tradwife aesthetic, “this idea of the perfect stay-at-home woman, who has Little House on the Prairie type outfits”. For her, wearing sheer sits in contrast. “I find the naked trend a lot more irreverent, which is why I like it more.”Part of the appeal of a skirt specifically is that “you can cover the rest”, says Charriere. “You can wear a really nice turtleneck on top, and then you have something a bit more sheer underneath. As it’s winter, you could even do sheer with a tight and a boot.”Charriere avoids the designs with panels because “it can look a bit clunky”. Instead, she advises wearing a longer jumper, or a blazer, like Bisset. Gustafsson agrees this is a good combo. “It’s nice to have something smarter, tailored, with a menswear reference, and then have this super-feminine, delicate chiffon to pare it back with.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s still that feeling of something really delicate,” says Gustafsson. She believes the transparency provides an “alternative” to more tried and tested details such as sequins or a bright colour this party season. “It’s another way of making a statement,” she says. “It’s strong in another way.”Explore more on these topicsSkirtsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A note from Plath’s doctor about her entering hospital for an appendectomy is among Ted Hughes’s application documents. Elsewhere, Joyce, in his 1915 application, writes that he receives “nothing in the way of royalties”, the sales of his books being “below the required number”. And Nesbit, author of The Railway Children, wrote in an August 1914 letter that the shock of her husband’s death “overcame me completely and now my brain will not do the poetry romance and fairy tales by which I have earned most of my livelihood”.View image in fullscreenA 1951 grocery bill of Dylan Thomas’ from J Eric Jones in Camarthen.Photograph: Courtesy of the Royal Literary FundLessing, who is the only British woman to have won the Nobel prize in literature, describes in a 1955 letter having moved to Britain in 1949 from Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, with £20, after the end of her marriage. When her debut novel, The Grass Is Singing, was published the following year, she left her job as a secretary and devoted her time to writing. “I have been living on my pen ever since, though very precariously,” she writes five years later, laying out details of debts she owed to friends, and the lack of help on offer from her family and ex-husband.“It has been suggested that I should write scripts for murder stories for the commercial TV, but my short and unfruitful experience with this sort of work has made it clear that while I might earn a lot of money, I won’t be doing any serious work,” she writes.The conflict between making art and earning a living through commercial work also makes itself clear in a letter by Ezra Pound in support of Joyce’s application. “He has lived for 10 years in obscurity and poverty, that he might perfect his writing and be uninfluenced by commercial demands.”At the time of the application in July 1915, Joyce had fled Trieste, where he had first moved in 1904. He had published the poetry collection Chamber Music and short story collection Dubliners, and was working on Ulysses. In his letter, Pound describes the latter as “uneven”, but calls the forthcoming A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as having “indubitable value, and permanence” – an endorsement that helped win Joyce a grant. “If we ever get into cataloguing the books that might not exist without the RLF, I think we start with Ulysses and work down from there,” says Edward Kemp, the former director of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, who now runs the charity.DH Lawrence, Bram Stoker and Samuel Taylor Coleridge were also RLF recipients. Welsh poet Thomas was supported by the charity from 1938 to his death in 1953. “I have been trying to live by my writing for five years, and have lived in poverty nearly all that time,” he wrote in his August 1938 application. “So far I have had to be content with poverty, and have always been fortunate to have just enough food and to have a room to work and sleep in. But now my wife is going to have a baby, and our position is desparate [sic]”.Given that the RLF was not due to meet until mid-October that year, the charity forwarded his application to the Royal Bounty Fund (a somewhat shadowy taxpayer-funded operation that waswound downafter more than 200 years in the early 2000s). But Whitehall didn’t mince words when rejecting the application:“If one is to put it brutally, ought Thomas – at 23 and apparently unable to support himself – to have married and be adding to his family? If he has taken on these responsibilities, ought he confine his activities to writing comparatively unremunerative verse, etc at a time when even the most successful find it difficult to make a living by literature?”Nobody goes into writing for the money: today, professional authors in the UK earn amedian incomeof £7,000, according to the Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society. Looking at the starry names awarded grants through the RLF’s history makes clear that the challenges are not new. However, Kemp thinks the problem has become more acute in some regards. “The kinds of deal you get with a publisher as a mid-list fiction writer has gone down, down, down, down, down.” Twenty or 30 years ago, such writers could survive; it is now much tougher, he says. Big publishers are “paying large amounts of money to a small number of writers”. A “tiny percentage actually survive on what they’re making from writing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

And at the other end there are people like Coleridge, and more recently Edna O’Brien, who have had stellar careers, and you’d have hoped actually were doing OK, but the vicissitudes of a writer’s life mean that sometimes it goes to pot.”Gormenghast author Mervyn Peake first applied to the RLF in 1948 when he was struggling to complete the second novel in his fantasy series. By the 1960s, his health had declined, and his wife, Maeve Gilmore, applied for a second grant on his behalf. “He has been ill since 1956, with what was first diagnosed as a breakdown, but has subsequently [been] found to be encephalitis, with Parkinson’s disease as a consequence,” she writes in an October 1961 letter. (Aposthumous studyfound that he in fact probably died of Lewy body dementia). “He has managed to do a little drawing, but work of a literary nature is no longer possible.”The RLF saw a400% increase in applicationsfor hardship grants between 2023 and 2024. To be eligible, a writer has to have had two works professionally published. Grants are awarded for basic living expenses, costs associated with long-term disabilities or health conditions, and one-off costs like unexpected bills. Most of the RLF’s money comes from authors who bequeathed some or all of their literary estates to the charity, including Colin MacInnes, Somerset Maugham, AA Milne, Arthur Ransome and Ronald Blythe.The archives unveil a complex web of literary connections: there is CS Lewis supporting Peake’s application, Henry James backingJoseph Conrad. “You look back, and people who you’d have thought are surviving as writers really aren’t,” says Kemp.“You’d hope we didn’t have to exist,” he adds.

I thought, ‘just swipe left if you want to say no!’”The next day, Ollie messaged to see how Elizabeth was doing. “Not very well. I’m in the hospital and I’m having a heart attack,” she replied.“She said she was scared,” Ollie recalls. He asked if he could visit her. “She said that she absolutely did not want to meet me for the first time in the intensive care unit.”But the following day, he felt “compelled” to look up the hospital where she was staying, and messaged her from reception.“I decided, well, you might as well come up,” says Elizabeth. He found her upstairs and they shook hands.“He seemed like the perfect gentleman,” she says.About 20 minutes into their first date, Elizabeth said, “Can I ask you a weird question?”“Is it weirder than having our first date in the ICU?”“Will you come home with me? Because I’m afraid to drive home.”Ollie helped her get home and they kept in touch daily until Elizabeth was well enough for their sushi date. “We had the sushi and it all just kicked off from there,” says Ollie. He’ll spend the autumn and winter in Chiang Mai with Elizabeth before they return to Yorkshire for the summer.Elizabeth recalls that she had two scheduled dates for the week they first met. “One was with Ollie, who I liked more, and then another coffee date. And as soon as that guy found out [about my heart attack], he hit the hills.”“The fool!” says Ollie.‘It took us a long time to say I love you’Steph, 38, from London, met Will, a musician and events worker, on a sunny day in Hyde Park in September last year. “I wasn’t in the mood,” she says. “I was experiencing dating app fatigue. I hadn’t [even selected] men as an option on the dating apps for about 12 months.”She arrived 10 minutes late on her bicycle. “When we met, I thought, who is this man? I was struck by how gorgeous he was and how easy he was to talk to. We discussed music and our jobs. I’m too old and too serious to be playing games, so I texted him after the date that I would love to see him again,” Will agreed.It was only after their date that she realised he was nine years younger than her. “That took me a few months to get over, and tell people,” she says.I was ghosted at 54. Here’s why I choose to think of it as empoweringRead moreAlthough they feel secure in their relationship now, Steph says she was “anxious” at the beginning. “For the first three months I thought he would leave me. It was hell. The only person who understood was my friend, a fellow therapist, who had experienced something similar when she first started dating her now husband. The honeymoon period for me is now, a year in.“It took us a long time to say I love you, so much so that I didn’t know if Will truly loved me. I brought it up nine months into the relationship and we both cried – we’d both been waiting for the perfect moment. He told me that he loved me on a night out with friends in a pub garden shortly afterwards. Now we tell each other all the time. It’s definitely the most fun I’ve had in a relationship.”‘We’ve had more fun dates in the last year than I can recall in the previous 20’In late September last year, Ryan was sitting around at home in Victoria, Canada, with a broken leg, scrolling through Hinge when he came across Kristin, 42. “We hit it off immediately and ended up messaging each other for almost five hours,” says Ryan, 43. “Who does that? I wouldn’t message my best friend for five hours.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But while I was typing, she thought I wasn’t responding. She was like, ‘oh, I guess I’ll talk to you later’. And then, boom, I send three or four paragraphs. And she thought that was pretty cool because you don’t normally do that while texting. I just felt she was inviting and open.”Ryan and Kristin have children of a similar age. “They get on pretty well. We don’t live together yet. We’re looking at making that happen next summer,” he says.“We’ve had more fun dates in the last year than I can recall in the previous 20. We’ve been kayaking, whale watching, and racing in go-karts. We’re off to Thailand next March for our first big trip together.”‘After 23 years of no contact, we started messaging on LinkedIn’View image in fullscreenErin and Brandon in 1999.Photograph: Guardian CommunityErin and Brandon had crushes on each other back at college in the late 90s. “But it never lined up right for the both of us,” says Brandon, now 47. “Every time I saw her out somewhere, we would talk. And then we graduated in 2001, but by then I had a girlfriend and she had a boyfriend. I just thought I’d never see her talk to her again. Every time I thought about my college days, I’d always wonder what she was up to.”View image in fullscreenErin and Brandon in 2024.Photograph: Guardian CommunityAfter 23 years without contact, Brandon, who works as an engineer, received a message from Erin on LinkedIn. “We started messaging. We were both divorced and living far apart, but we reconnected and things started to get intense. Old feelings were resurrected, as well as developing lots of new ones. I had never forgotten about her or the feelings I had. She is the love of my life.”Brandon lives in Alabama and Erin in Denver. “We are both committed to trying to build a long distance relationship to eventually live together,” he says.‘We thought we’d keep it secret’In July, Luke, 34, a healthcare researcher from British Columbia in Canada, was on vacation in Mongolia, “never dreaming that I would fall for somebody on the road trip”.He met Adina, from Sweden, on a tour with a group of six and a local guide. “Adina and I first bonded over being the most adventurous and latest-to-bed tourists on the tour. Our love of nature and interest in exploring spirituality also helped. I would have been happy to simply make a friend, but I began to suspect there was more there when she said she’d go stargazing with me on a completely cloudy night,” he says.The couple initially wanted to avoid “throwing off the group dynamic”.“We thought we’d keep it secret for a while – with stolen kisses and sneaking out of the ger [yurt] at night. We thought we were being very clever. But of course it turned out everybody else knew.”At first they thought the relationship would last only as long as the tour. “But after a couple days at the end, we started asking: why should that be it? We have messaged every day since we parted, and we are meeting up to travel again in a couple months – this time, just the two of us.”Luke is currently back in Canada, while Adina travels on through east Asia. “I never thought I would have a travel romance like this, and some days it feels delightfully impractical. We don’t know if it’s forever, but we know it’s real, and that’s enough for us.”‘His teeth flew out of his mouth and landed in my spaghetti’: 10 first date horror storiesRead moreExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyDatingRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The body pointed out that she knew about the forecasts well before she had a change of heart.In an interview with the Guardian, Reeves defended her decision to tax and spend at the budget, saying she had made “fair and necessary choices”.She said: “I wasn’t willing to cut public services, because people voted for change at the election.”Reeves added: “People often talk about what chancellors do in their budget, but sometimes what’s more important are the things you don’t do. One of the things I didn’t do was cut the investment that I put into capital spending, new schools and hospitals, new energy infrastructure, rail infrastructure.“It would have been the easiest thing to do to say the OBR’s done this downgrade, you need to cut our cloth accordingly.“But we’ll never get out of this problem of weak growth unless we’ve got investment in the economy, and we’re investing in things to boost our productivity.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves in her office at No 11 Downing Street on Friday.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian“When you’ve got creaky infrastructure, you’re not able to get the productivity benefits. So you know what, I’ve chosen to protect public spending in the budget.”After a turbulent few weeks, during which Labour MPs have privately questioned the political futures of both Reeves andKeir Starmer, she played down the prospect of ambitious colleagues challenging the prime minister.“I just don’t think it is a mainstream thing in the parliamentaryLabourparty,” she said.“They want Keir to succeed. They want this government to succeed. We all know what happened in the last government, when they went through leaders and chancellors. It was bad for the country.”Reeves argued that anyone who took over at the Treasury would confront similar challenges. “Whoever is chancellor would face the same … volatility in the global economy, and probably most importantly, the dire inheritance.”With taxes on course to hit a historic high, she declined to say if they could climb further in future. She denied that working-age people were being asked to carry more of the burden than pensioners.‘The City can’t be taken for granted’: how banks won over Rachel ReevesRead moreShe said: “It’s quite clear that the economic burden in the budget was not about age. It was about wealth. People who bear more of the burden are those with big incomes and assets … so I don’t accept that.”The chancellor also rejected the idea the government had put up taxes to pay for benefits, although she did fund U-turns on welfare and winter fuel cuts, and lift the two-child benefit cap, at a cost of £3bn a year.“I don’t think there are many people who think it is reasonable that children grow up in poverty,” she added.However, Reeves faced questions on Friday over Treasury claims that there was a hole in the public finances even though official figures showed it did not exist. The Conservatives accused her of misleading the public.Speaking before the OBR’s intervention, Reeves confirmed that the option of raising income tax rates had remained on the table until well after she had made a speech in the budget run-up in which she highlighted the challenges posed by the downgrade in productivity forecast.“We did look, as everyone knows, at income tax and national insurance, that was a responsible thing to do, because we didn’t know the size of the downgrade, the productivity,” she said.After the Treasury had submitted its most important policies to the OBR, “they then update their forecasts, both for growth, for wages. So all of those things moved around,” she added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The answer is no. The OBR confirmed the £16bn hit to headroom and the chancellor was clear on the need to increase headroom. That ambition did not change.”Reeves said the leak of the OBR forecasts just before the budget had been “a bit of a scary moment” as it could have significantly affected the markets. “My worry was that the budget is a story as well as a set of numbers … but in the end it was, I think, OK.”She was sitting in the Commons for PMQs when she first sensed something was going on, with opposition MPs looking at their phones. The chief secretary to the Treasury, James Murray, shared the news and then a series of notes were passed to and from officials preparing her response.The chancellor, however, said she still had confidence in Richard Hughes, the head of the OBR, and also defended the independent budget watchdog despite criticism from some inside government.“It is right that we have an independent forecaster. I don’t think it would be fair on Treasury officials to prepare a forecast and all the policies. That’s why, when I was in opposition, and consistently through my time as chancellor, I’ve spoken about the importance of independent economic institutions.”Congratulations everyone!

I don’t buy this idea that poor rights for workers is good for our economy.“This was about actually getting this legislation passed. We’re in this impasse at the moment where for months, this bill has been going backwards and forwards, and we want to get this bill passed, otherwise no rights are enhanced.”Reeves did not say how the government would pay for special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in England, after saying she wouldtake over full responsibilityfor costs from councils.But she said that plans for reform, expected early next year, were not focused on savings but on improving the system, amid concern that MPs could oppose changes if they felt they were simply a cost-saving exercise.“All of us in government know, all of us as parents know that the Send system is not working for children, parents, schools. Whenever I go to schools in my own constituency, they talk about just how badly the system is letting people down.“So the reform is not focused on money. The reform is focused on making the system work.”Explore more on these topicsPoliticsBudgetRachel ReevesOffice for Budget ResponsibilityKeir StarmerLabourEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

They will also decide whether the party should support socialist independents in the 2026 English local elections.Each of the party’s MPs is expected to give a speech, alongside a series of grassroots community organisers and leftwing politicians from across Europe.Ahead of the conference, Corbyn said: “Over the last few months I’ve travelled the length and breadth of the country, speaking to people, and learning about their visions for a member-led party.“I am very excited to get this party started and begin the work of building a majority for real political change. This is our chance to create a mass, democratic, socialist party that can be a voice for economic justice and peace.”Your Party said its approach to the conference showed they were prepared to do politics differently.Sultana said: “I’m looking forward to the Your Party founding conference, where we’ll work collectively toward our shared socialist vision. We’re building a new kind of party – rooted in and democratically accountable to a mass movement.”The conference coincided with someYour Partymembers having their membership cancelled over their membership of other parties such as the Socialist Workers.Despite this ban, Sultana is backed by the Socialist Unity Platform, a lobby organisation comprising groups including the Communist party of Great Britain.Explore more on these topicsJeremy CorbynZarah SultanaLabourEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

At the time Airbus issued its bulletin to the plane’s more than 350 operators, about 3,000 A320-family jets were in the air.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the main certifying authority for A320 aircraft, issued the instruction on Friday night as a “precautionary action”.The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software and is relatively simple, but must be carried out before the planes can fly again, according to the bulletin to airlines seen by Reuters.Airlines from the US to South America, Europe, India, Australia and New Zealand warned the repairs could potentially cause flight delays or cancellations.The world’s largest A320 operator, American Airlines , said some 340 of its 480 A320 aircraft would need the fix. It said it mostly expected these to be completed by Saturday, with about two hours required for each plane.Other airlines said they would take planes briefly out of service to do the repairs, including Germany’s Lufthansa , India’s IndiGo and UK-based easyJet.Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70% of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates until 8 December.In Australia, Jetstarcancelled domestic flights.The Guardian understands that only three of BA’s short-haul aircraft are affected and it does not expect any operational impact while these are undergoing the software updates.EasyJet had said it was expecting some disruption on Friday evening but later confirmed it was planning to operate as normal on Saturday as it had already completed the software update on many required aircraft.A spokesperson for Gatwick airport said a small number of its airlines were affected, while Heathrow said it was not seeing an impact as of late Friday night.Airbus said in a statement that a recent incident involving an A320-family aircraft had revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls.“Airbus acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers,” it said.Industry sources said the incident that triggered the unexpected repair action involved a JetBlue flight from Cancún, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on 30 October, in which several passengers were hurt after a sudden drop in altitude.JetBlue and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had no immediate comment.The bulletin seen by Reuters traced the problem to a flight system called ELAC (Elevator and Aileron Computer), which sends commands from the pilot’s side-stick to elevators at the rear. These in turn control the aircraft’s pitch or nose angle.The computer’s manufacturer, France’s Thales, said in response to a Reuters query that the computer complies with Airbus specifications and the functionality in question is supported by software that is not under Thales’s responsibility.For about two-thirds of the affected jets, the recall will result in a relatively brief grounding as airlines revert to a previous software version, industry sources said.But it comes at a time of intense demands on airline repair shops, already plagued by shortages of maintenance capacity and the grounding of hundreds of Airbus jets due to long waiting times for separate engine repairs or inspections.Hundreds of the affected jets may also have to have hardware changed, threatening much longer waits, the sources said.American Airlines and Hungary’s Wizz Air said they had already identified which of their aircraft would need the software fix. United Airlines said it was not affected.Wizz Air said “some flights over the weekend may be affected” and passengers who booked via the website or app would be told about any changes.A spokesperson said: “The safety of our customers, crew and aircraft is always our number one and over-riding priority. We apologise for any inconvenience caused by circumstances outside of our direct control.”Jet2.com said it was “installing software updates on a very small number of aircraft” but there would be no impact on its schedule, while Irish carrier Aer Lingus said it was not expecting major operational disruption.The UK’s transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “The good news is it seems the impact on UK airlines seems limited, with a smaller number of aircraft requiring more complex software and hardware changes.”There are about 11,300 A320-family aircraft in operation worldwide, including 6,440 of the core A320 model, which first flew in 1987.Launched in 1984, the A320 was the first mainstream jetliner to introduce fly-by-wire computer controls.It competes with the Boeing 737 MAX, which suffered a lengthy worldwide grounding after fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, blamed on poorly designed flight-control software.Demand for the two main brands of workhorse jets has surged in recent years as economic growth led by Asia brought tens of millions of new travellers into the skies.Explore more on these topicsAirbusAirline industryAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump has also claimed many times, without evidence, that the Biden administration officials may have forged their boss’s signature by using the autopen and taken broad actions he was not aware of.Trump has also obsessively cast doubt on the validity of pardons and other documents that Biden signed with an autopen, even though other presidents have also relied on the device to sign key papers for decades. The Justice Department in 2005 said the president does not need to sign a bill by hand and can direct an official “to affix the president’s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen.” Trump himself has alsoused an autopen in the past.The sweeping announcement left many questions about how Trump would actually nullify Biden’s pardons and executive orders, given that US presidents are allowed to use the autopen – and that there has been no concrete evidence of any attempt to bypass Biden’s will at the end of his second term.Nonetheless, Trump’s post was swiftly celebrated by Republicans.Oversight Project, a branch of the conservative Heritage Foundation started in 2022 with a mission of “increasing aggressive oversight of the Biden administration”, and which has relentlessly promoted the narrative about Biden’s use of autopen, thanked Trumpin a post on X.“Thank you President Trump for taking our historic Autopen investigation and findings seriously and ordering your Administration to take action,” the group said.Congressman James Comer, the Republican chair of the GOP-led House oversight committee, alsowelcomed Trump’s announcement, writing on X: “I applaud President Trump for deeming President Biden’s autopen actions NULL AND VOID.”The oversight committee released a report in October on Biden’s use of the autopen that made many sweeping claims but did not include any concrete evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without Biden’s knowledge or that he was unaware of laws, pardons or executive orders signed in his name.The report alleged a “cover-up of the president’s cognitive decline” orchestrated by Biden’s inner circle and pushed contested claims that the president’s mental state had declined to such an extent that White House officials were able to enact policies without his knowledge, and focused heavily on the pardons he granted in office, many of which infuriatedDonald Trump.Democrats on the committee denounced the report as a “sham”, highlighting that the report included no evidence to support the allegations. Legal experts have also warned that attempts to void past executive actions could set a problematic precedent, given that so many other presidents have utilized the autopen.Conservative legal commentator Ed Whelan said on social media that Trump was free to revoke executive orders whether or not Biden personally signed them.“But he doesn’t have the same freedom with respect to ’anything else’ (e.g., bills enacted by Congress, pardons) that Biden directed be signed by autopen.”Agencies contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJoe BidenTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The search for a successor would begin on Saturday and the powerful office of the president of Ukraine, which Yermak led, would be “reorganised” as part of the process.“I am grateful to Andriy for always representing Ukraine’s position in the negotiation track exactly as it should be. It has always been a patriotic position. But I want there to be no rumours or speculation,” Zelenskyy said.Journalists had filmed about 10 investigators entering Kyiv’s government quarter early in the morning, in a widening of the investigation into a nuclear energy kickback scandal allegedly run by an associate of the Ukrainian president who has fled the country.Nabu, the national anti-corruption bureau, said it and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office, Sapo, were “conducting investigative actions at the head of the office of the president of Ukraine”.View image in fullscreenYermak with Zelenskyy in Spain earlier this month.Photograph: Violeta Santos Moura/ReutersA seemingly indispensable aide until today, Yermak was a former intellectual property lawyer and film producer who knew Zelenskyy in his days as an actor and comedian before helping him be elected as president. Yermak became a foreign policy adviser, then the president’s chief of staff in February 2020.Rapidly he assumed a central position as Zelenskyy’s gatekeeper in the charge of the president’s office. He was routinely consulted on foreign policy, domestic affairs and appointments. Never far from Zelenskyy’s side, the two were particularly close during the early days of the invasion, when Kyiv was under threat.Earlier, in a short statement, Yermak confirmed that searches were continuing at his home. “The investigators have no obstacles,” he added in a social media statement. “They were given full access to the apartment, my lawyers are on site, interacting with law enforcement officers. From my side, I have full cooperation.”The energy corruption scandal first emerged earlier in November, but after days of damaging revelations it dropped down the news agenda when Donald Trump unexpectedly released apro-Russian 28-point peace plan, in which the Kremlin demanded control of all the Donbas region before any ceasefire.But Friday’s developments thrust the scandal back into the spotlight just as Ukraine had been carefully wooing the White House on a 19-point counterproposal, with Yermak fronting talks in Geneva with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.View image in fullscreenAndriy Yermak fronted talks in Geneva with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio (right), last weekend.Photograph: Martial Trezzini/EPAEarlier in November, investigators from Nabu said they had uncovered a high-level criminal scheme at the heart of government. Insiders allegedlyreceived kickbacks of 10%-15%from commercial partners of Energoatom, the state-owned nuclear power generator and Ukraine’s most important energy supplier.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mindichfled abroad, leaving his apartmentin Kyiv’s government district hours before investigators came to arrest him.Zelenskyy himself has denounced the scheme. However, questions swirled in the days that followed about how much the most senior figures in government knew about what was happening, given how many others in or close to the administration have been accused of involvement.The 28-point ‘peace plan’ for Ukraine may be dead – but Trump still won’t stop Putin | Dmytro KulebaRead moreZelenskyy fired two ministers this month and the allegations have prompted widespread public outrage at a time when most Ukrainians are having to endure hours of daily electricity blackouts because of Russian bombing of energy infrastructure.Another high-profile suspect isOleksiy Chernyshov, a former deputy prime minister who was charged by Nabu for allegedly receiving $1.2bn (£900m) from participants in the anti-corruption scheme. Chernyshov allegedly spent some of the illicit cash building four luxury mansions in a new-build riverside plot south of Kyiv.The anti-corruption investigation has been based on more than 1,000 hours of conversations recorded secretly by Nabu, details of which have been released to the media. In one, a suspect said it was a “pity” to build structures to defend power stations from Russian attacks since the money could be stolen instead.The European Commission said the investigations showed that Ukraine’s anti-corruption bodies were functioning. “We understand that investigations are ongoing, and we very much respect these investigations, which show that anti-corruption authorities in Ukraine are doing their job,” a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It changes the way you talk to your friends, and it changes the way you walk down the street. These are experiences you never forget. I still remember vividly how I felt.”Three more ex-pupils at school with Nigel Farage reject ‘banter’ claimsRead moreKhan said he could not understand why Farage had failed to apologise to the individuals who were contemporaries of his at Dulwich college in south-east London.Khan, 55, said 61-year-old Farage’s suggestion that the alleged abuse could be dismissed as “banter” that was of its time failed to recognise the impact on those on the end of it. “Growing up in London in the 70s and 80s, I was no stranger to racist abuse,” Khan said. “Those responsible might have thought it was a bit of harmless banter, but I’ll never forget how their words made me feel.”Khan, the son of a bus driver and a seamstress from Pakistan, has spoken before of facing abuse during his childhood in Tooting, south London.Khan revealed in 2019 that practically everyone outside his immediate family had been pronouncing his name incorrectly, as “Sad-eek” rather than “Saad-ick”.Farage has been under growing pressure to apologise for his alleged behaviour at school, including the claims that he targeted abuse of a number of people.Peter Ettedgui, 61, who is now an Emmy- and Bafta-winning director,told the Guardianthat Farage would“sidle up to me and growl: ‘Hitler was right,’or ‘Gas them,’ sometimes adding a long hiss to simulate the sound of the gas showers.”His alleged abuse spanned six years, from age 13 to 18.Khan said: “I’m sure that the multiple reports that Nigel Farage regularly used vile racist and antisemitic language as a London schoolboy will strike a nerve with all those who were on the receiving end of racism growing up. We’ve made huge progress as a society since then, but we risk normalising racism like we did decades ago. Racism has the same long-lasting impact on people now as it did then, and we need to keep calling it out.”In legal letters ahead of publication of the Guardian’s investigation, Farage’s lawyers claimed that “the suggestion that Mr Farage ever engaged in, condoned, or led racist or antisemitic behaviour is categorically denied”.Farage later seemingly shifted his position in an interview with the BBC’s political editor in Wales: “Have I said things 50 years ago that you could interpret as being banter in a playground, you could interpret in a modern light today in some sort of way? Yes.”Headdedthat he had “never directly, really tried to go and hurt anybody”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked about the claims about Farage and the Reform leader’s response, the prime minister said: “Let me go to the heart of that question. This afternoon in Bushey I’ve spoken to a number of different groups, including Jewish students, young people, children at school. They’ve described to me some of the antisemitism they’ve experienced. It has massively impacted them.“It is really difficult for them to even talk about it, and I know they’re going to carry that for years and years; this is not just something that can be passed over.

On Wednesday afternoon Lau was at his home nearby, when he saw smoke from Mei Lan’s building. Mei Lan, her husband, and their children live in the Wang Fuk Court high-rise apartment complex in northernHong Kong. Shortly after lunchtime on Wednesday, a fire started in one of its eight high-rise towers, and quickly spread to six others. It burned for more than two days, killing at least 128 people – a number certain to rise.The inferno has been compared to London’s Grenfell Tower disaster. Not just for the scale, but for the now rampant questions about negligent safety standards and corruption, amid revelations that the construction site had been inspected 16 times for safety concerns and allegedly had a history of violations.Late on Friday, Mei Lan still was not answering Lau’s calls. The phone just rang and rang.View image in fullscreenMr Lau was calling his cousin Mei Lan trying to reach her. The phone just rang and rang.Photograph: Helen Davidson/The Guardian“I’m worried she might have fainted from the heat and can’t hear [the phone],” Lau told the Guardian. “People have died now; of course I hope she can make it out, but there is no contact. I’m worried, of course, I feel awful. The whole family, five or six people, is missing.”Rescue efforts end at Hong Kong tower block fire as death toll reaches 128Read moreOfficially, Mei Lan and her family were among the 200 or so people unaccounted for, including 89 bodies that could not be visually identified. Lau was accompanied by two friends, and the three elderly men were keeping each other upbeat and optimistic, fielding calls from other friends and relatives.It was hard to stay hopeful. The small children’s playground where Lau spoke to the Guardian is adjacent to a community centre through which families of victims walked to identify the dead. Once firefighters could finally access the upper floors, there was a steady stream of people leaving the building, often in floods of tears.Outside a local school, repurposed as an evacuation shelter, another man sobbed. His parents lived in the towers and were missing.“I can’t eat, I can’t sleep. I just need to know … I don’t expect them to still be alive, I only want you to tell me they’re gone so I can stop missing them. Let me know they’re in heaven,” he cried. “But I don’t know anything.”The Hong Kong apartment fire continued to burn on Thursday.He asked: “What is John Lee, Hong Kong’s chief executive, doing? All he does is walk around and hold press conferences. What about us? We can’t get any answer to our questions.”Anger swelling in Hong Kong over deadliest fire in more than 70 yearsRead moreMuch of the city’s grief isracked with anger. Since the crackdown on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement, the government has made “national security” its overriding priority. There is a sense among some that while the government has been chasing down any whisper of potential dissent, a building of almost 5,000 people, which authorities knew was not safe, burned down.At the volunteer donation site in Tai Po, scores of young people ran various stalls, held cardboard information signs and offered support using collective action skills not seen at this scale since the 2019 protests.An online petition even listed “four demands”, echoing the protests’ “five demands” for democratic rights, but calling for guaranteed care of victims and accountability for officials in any corrupt activity.It appeared to be making the government nervous. After dark on Friday, a squad of armed police officers walked laps of the donation site, and government workers took over from volunteers at the shelters.graphicAuthorities were quick to act after the fire, arresting three employees of the construction company on Thursday, and launching an independent commission against corruption. On Friday, the anti-corruption watchdog said it had arrested eight people.But the ferocity of the fire, and how many people were unable to escape it, has raised significant questions and accusations of complacency, negligence, and corruption in the city’s construction sector.View image in fullscreenThe ferocity of the fire has raised significant questions and accusations about complacency, negligence, and corruption in the city’s construction sector.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockHong Kong is famously a city of densely packed apartments that stretch into the sky, cramming millions into an area that can be crossed from end to end in just a couple of hours.The bamboo scaffolding and mesh that covered Wang Fuk Court is a ubiquitous sight in the city. Hong Kong’s security secretary said on Friday that preliminary investigations had identified the unauthorised and highly flammable styrofoam boards discovered in windows on every level of every tower as the primary cause of the fire’s intensity, and that the mesh was up to standard.A man who gave his name as Mr Au lost both his parents to the fire, which also put his brother in intensive care. He said the windows of their home were all sealed with flammable styrofoam-like material.How the Hong Kong fire unfolded – visual guideRead more“There are too many problems. Repairs are so expensive, and what kind of people did they hire?” said Au. “The biggest issue is the lack of fire safety awareness. The fire alarm didn’t ring, otherwise my parents could have evacuated.”This particular renovation was already controversial before the fire.Work began in July 2024, with a reported price tag of HK$330m (£33.5m). The contract, awarded to Prestige Construction & Engineering Co, drew accusations that decision makers had chosen the most expensive proposal, despite the costs being shared by residents, who include social housing recipients.Prestige Construction & Engineering Co could not be reached for comment. Local media reported the physical office was closed when they visited during business hours after the fire.In September, residents lodged concerns with authorities about the renovations, “including the scaffolding netting”, the Hong Kong labour department told the Guardian. The department said they had told residents the netting was to catch falling debris, and that current safety regulations “do not cover flame retardant standards” for such material. Given the construction did not involve open flames such as welders, the risk was low, they said.View image in fullscreenAuthorities were quick to act after the fire, arresting three employees of the construction company and launching an independent inquiry.Photograph: Vernon Yuen/Nexpher/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThat response prompted further complaints, so they clarified that the netting had been inspected, and “met approval standards”.However, the department also said inspectors had visited the site 16 times after the complaints, and issued multiple written warnings about the need for better fire safety measures, including as recently as last week.“Whatever the government does is useless, says Au. “It’s already over. I just hope it won’t happen again. Arresting a few people to take responsibility can’t help us. Proper supervision should have been in place from the very beginning.”Additional reporting by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsHong KongHong Kong apartment firesAsia PacificConstruction industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Varun Chandra, the prime minister’s envoy, however, was among the 400 guests. Dispatched, according to the Financial Times, to reassure the JP Morgan boss of Labour’s pro-business stance.JP Morgan boss gave go-ahead for new £3bn tower in London after UK assurancesRead moreThis week – hours after banks werespared a tax risein Reeves’s £26bn budget – Dimonunveiled plansto build a 279,000 sq metre (3m sq ft) tower in the Canary Wharf district of London, with a caveat that a “continuing positive business environment in the UK” was required.It is understood that planning issues and long-term considerations are more important for the bank than any one budget. But the episode still highlights how financial services has won a prized status in government, amid ferocious City lobbying to ensure it was one of the few off-limits sectors in Reeves’s smorgasbordtax-raising budget.For months Labour has been rolling out the red carpet for Wall Street and City financiers, amid a far broader campaign to woo bankers and company bosses after the party’s pre-election love-in with industry turned sour.Norman Blackwell, the former chair of LloydsBankingGroup, who also advised Margaret Thatcher on policy in the 1980s, said Reeves had “work to do” to rebuild the confidence of the City after her £40bn tax-raising 2024 budget.“Before the election they talked as though they would be a party that would recognise the importance of wealth creation in the economy by business and entrepreneurs. Everything they have done in government has gone in the opposite direction,” he said.View image in fullscreenAn artist’s impression of the planned JP Morgan Chase building in London’s Canary Wharf. The bank went ahead with the investment after assurances from an adviser to the UK prime minister.Photograph: JP Morgan Chase/PA“They have increased taxes on business, increased regulation in the labour market, [and] the threat to high earners and non-doms. If you look at the numbers of entrepreneurs and rich people leaving the country – they have convinced people that they do not value and will not support entrepreneurs.”Despite the reprieve for banks, Blackwell said the budget was still unlikely to help much because it would do little to boost UK growth. “It’s a budget that takes the economy in the wrong direction, and is in that sense self-defeating in terms of growth and future government revenue.”Much of the rationale behind the rearguard action is pragmatic. Reeves sees the City as critical to the government’s growth mission, with financial services among the eight critical sectors backed in Labour’s industrial strategy. Finance contributes almost a tenth of UK GDP, employs 1.2 million people, and brings in more than £40bn a year for the exchequer.In Birmingham earlier this autumn, the chancellor hosted a gala dinner for 300 financiers and business chiefs – putting on a ballet and a spoken-word poetry reading on the eve of its first regional investment summit. Sponsored by HSBC, Lloyds, Eon, KPMG, and IBM, the event the next day at Edgbaston cricket ground secured more than £10bn of investment in Britain.However, Labour’s proximity to the boardrooms of the Square Mile does not sit comfortably with the party’s own MPs and voters for whom the memories of the 2008 financial crisis still sting. Most people – including a majority of those considering voting for Nigel Farage’s Reform UK – would havebacked a windfall taxon banks at the budget.“The chancellor’s failure to levy a windfall tax on the banking sector in the budget is a damning indictment of the stronghold the sector continues to have over our politics,” said Sara Hall, a co-executive director at the campaign group Positive Money.“It is very concerning that whilst the public is asked to contribute more to fix our crumbling public services, banks got off scot-free – it’s high time we have a proper public conversation about the sector’s lobbying and influence.”View image in fullscreenThe Goldman Sachs boss, David Solomon, advised Rachel Reeves last month against increasing bank taxes.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersLast month Reeves hostedGoldman Sachs boss David Solomonin No 11 Downing Street, with the head of the Wall Street firm advising her against increasing bank taxes. Politico reported he ripped up his briefing notes to focus exclusively on the issue, a detail denied by the bank.This week, after the budget, Goldman announced that it would expand its Birmingham office and hire 500 staff, in a move that would more than double its workforce in the UK’s second-largest city.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves had been actively considering a multibillion-pound bank windfall tax to help repair the public finances and fund the removal of the two-child benefit limit.In August a paper by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank estimated Reeves could rake in as much as £8bn, in a report triggering asell-off in UK banking sharesand prompting the industry to lobby harder.Reeves’s office was furious with the IPPR report suggesting a windfall tax, and subsequent share price reaction. However, insiders said the Treasury had requested to see the report in advance of its publication.The Guardian also understands bank profits – inflated by the Bank of England’s quantitative easing scheme – were examined by Treasury officials on the instruction of ministers in the buildup to the budget.“We get whiplash in meetings with HMT at times,” said one senior banker. “One minute [senior officials are] incredibly nervous about inward investment, the next they’re suggesting that major structural problems are businesses’ fault. Narratives like lenders are the real handbrake on growth creep in. I think they’ve come to realise that the City can’t be taken for granted. London’s one of many financial centres for global banks.”View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves had actively considered a multibillion-pound bank windfall tax, but dropped the plan.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/APLondon’s high-paid corporate lawyers were also among those who expressed relief after the budget, after escaping a threatened tax on their earnings. Reports suggested Reeves was looking at scrapping an exemption for limited liability partnership members from national insurance – a move that would have raised £2bn.Mark Evans, the president of the Law Society, a body representing lawyers, this week welcomed the reprieve, saying it would have been damaging to the UK economy and claiming that law firms would not have been able to invest, hire, and contribute to growth.Banking industry figures said the sector paid a 28% headline rate of corporation tax, above the standard 25% rate charged on company profits, in addition to a 0.1% levy on bank’s balance sheets. “It’s hard to say we don’t pay a fair share, as we pay more,” said one bank lobbyist.However, banks have still managed to rake in record profits, benefiting from rising interest rates and the winding down of the Bank’s quantitative easing scheme. In total, Positive Money estimates banks made £24.1bn in the first half of 2025 alone, amounting to almost £1bn a week.Speaking earlier this autumn, Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, said getting banks to pay a little more to help rebuild Britain was common sense. “Banks have done very well out of the British people. It’s only right that they use their bumper profits to pay a bit more in tax to invest in our hospitals, schools and local councils.”The Treasury was approached for comment. JP Morgan declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025BudgetBankingFinancial sectorGoldman SachsJP MorganEconomicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The countries that execute the most women are also the countries that execute the most people, namely China, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.According to Amnesty International, in 2024an unknown number of women were executedin China, two were put to death in Egypt, 30 in Iran, one in Iraq, nine in Saudi Arabia and two in Yemen. Some countries, including China, North Korea and Vietnam, do not publish accurate data.The two main crimes for which women are sentenced to death are murder and drug trafficking. Countries with a mandatory death penalty for murder or that do not recognise gender-based violence as a mitigating circumstance are more likely to have a high number of women on death row.Certain countries in the Gulf and south-east Asia severely criminalise drug trafficking and have a high proportion of women awaiting execution.While some women engage in the drug trade of their own volition, a narrower range of choices for others, along with poverty, coercion, violence, manipulation and the survival needs of a family, aresignificant factorsin their involvement.Not all countries with the death penalty carry out executions.Womensentenced to death are usually subjected to worse living conditions in prison, such as increased security and solitary confinement.Here are the stories of five women on death row around the world.Christa PikeComposite: Tennessee Department of Correction/APUS: Christa PikeMurderChrista Pike is the only woman on Tennessee’s death row. She committed murder when she was an 18-year-old with severe but untreated mental illness. She isone of 47 womenon death row in the US as of October 2025.In January 1995, Pike, along with her boyfriend Tadaryl Shipp, then 17, and Shadolla Peterson, then 18, killed Colleen Slemmer while attending a government-run programme to help teenagers gain job skills.The murder was sensationalised because a pentagram had been carved into Slemmer’s chest – a reflection of the satanic imagery that fascinated Shipp. The media pounced on this detail, painting Pike as a demonic killer and describing the murder as an “occult” event linked to “devil worship”.Lawyers failed to present any mitigating evidence of her history of sexual violence and child abuse to the juryAppeal to Tennessee supreme courtPike was born with brain damage caused by her mother’s alcohol abuse while pregnant. She wasthe victim of severe, repeated physical and sexual abuseand violence that began when she was a child.By the time she was 18, she had been raped twice, physically abused by at least seven family members and sexually abused by at least three individuals. She has bipolar disorder and severe post-traumatic stress disorder.In her 2021 appeal against the death sentence, it was noted that at her trial, Pike’s “state-appointed lawyersfailed to present mitigating evidenceof her history of sexual violence and child abuse to the jury, leaving the jurors with no reason to consider an alternative sentence to the death penalty”.Pike spent more than 28 years in solitary confinement until she secureda lawsuit settlementexercising her right to be treated equally with men on death row, who are housed together and allowed to hold jobs.Of the other defendants in the case,Shipp is eligible for parole in 2026because he was 17 at the time of the crime, and Peterson was an informant who never served prison time. Pike’sexecution date has been set for 30 September 2026.Pakhshan AziziComposite: Guardian DesignIran: Pakhshan AziziArmed rebellion against the stateBranch 26 of the revolutionary court of Tehransentenced Pakhshan Azizi to death in July 2024. The 40-year-old Kurd was convicted of armed rebellion against the state (baghi) in relation to her human rights and humanitarian work.Between 2014 and 2022 she was providing humanitarian support to displaced women and children in camps in north-east Syria and the Kurdistan region of Iraq.On 4 August 2023, Azizi was arrested and imprisoned in Tehran’s Evin prison. She was held in solitary confinement for five months without access to a lawyer or her family.Iran’s executions function as a form of collective punishment … [it] weaponises the death penalty to suppress speechBahar Mirhosseni, lawyerThere have been reports that she was subjected to severe psychological and physical torture to extract a confession. Several members of her family were also temporarily detained and faced national security charges. In December 2023, she was transferred to the women’s ward of Evin prison, where she remains.In January 2025, the supreme court upheld her conviction and death sentence, and subsequently rejected her request for a judicial review.Iran is one of the countries in the world that has executed the most peoplesince the 1979 Islamic revolution. “Tens of thousands of prisoners, including women, have been executed following sham trials,” according to Iran Human Rights, which notes thegender-specific aspects of the death penaltyin the country, such as stoning having been used disproportionately against women.Last year, it said at least 975 people were put to death, including many human rights activists as well as drug offenders.So far this year, 31 women have been executed, surpassing the total for 2024.In the aftermath of the“woman, life, freedom” uprising, Iranian authorities have intensified their use of the death penalty to instil fear and tighten their grip on power. According to Amnesty International, this escalation includes theuse of the death penalty against women on politically motivated charges.Inan article for the US magazine the Nation, Bahar Mirhosseni, a criminal defence and human rights lawyer, wrote: “Iran’s executions not only constitute outrageous human rights violations but also function as a form of collective punishment.“The repression is so lethal that it is now common knowledge amongdiverse marginalised communities within Iran, as well as abolitionists around the world, that Iranweaponises the death penalty to suppress speech.”Rosita SaidComposite: Guardian Design / suppliedIndonesia: Rosita SaidDrug traffickingRosita Said, 43, has been detained since 23 August 2015 in relation to a narcotics case. She was raised in West Sumatra and dropped out of education after primary school because of financial hardship. Married twice and suffering from domestic violence, she eventually moved to Jakarta in search of a better life.While working as a shop assistant, she met a man, Emeka Samuel, who showed kindness and supported her financially. She fell in love with him, he converted to Islam, and they married.Three months into the marriage, Said noticed that Samuel would receive calls from unknown numbers. She accused him of infidelity and he eventually admitted that the calls were related to a new business opportunity: drugs.Said was horrified but feared another failed marriage would bring deep shame to herself and her family. According to her lawyer, Aisya Humaida, she felt trapped and when Samuel asked her to find someone to transport and handle drugs, she agreed.The court failed to take into account her background, gendered vulnerabilities and limited understanding of Samuel’s activitiesAisya Humaida, lawyerAt one point, she passed 5,500,000 Indonesian rupiah(£250) on to the person she had found, Rubiyanti Hasyim, at Samuel’s request, believing it to be a harmless act of assistance.On 21 August 2015, Samuel informed Said that a drugs shipment was ready for collection. The police raided the operation, and later arrested Hasyim who said Samuel and Said were responsible.Said was sentenced to death along with Samuel. Humaida says: “The court failed to take into account her background, the gendered vulnerabilities she faced, and her limited understanding of Samuel’s criminal activities.”Drug-related offences are the leading cause of women’s involvement in Indonesia’s criminal justice system and the “war on drugs” has increased prison overcrowding.A study byLBH Masyarakat(Community Legal Aid Institute), an Indonesian human rights organisation that provides free legal aid, found that27% of 307 women surveyed who were imprisoned for drug-related crimesreported being influenced by an intimate partner.As of August this year, there were 10 women out of 594 total inmates on death row in the country for drug crimes or murder. The quality of legal defence and the number of unfair trials have been fundamental factors in the extent of death sentences being imposed.Astudy of 32 death sentencesimposed on women from 2002 to 2020 found only nine defendants had offered mitigating circumstances in their trials, 20 had none, and three were sentenced without any mention of mitigation. Furthermore, eight women were sentenced to death despite not being charged with a capital offence.There has been ade facto moratorium on executions in Indonesia since 2016.A silhouette to represent Lemi LimbuComposite: Guardian Design/Getty ImagesTanzania: Lemi LimbuMurderIn 2015, Lemi Limbu was convicted of the murder of her baby daughter. In Tanzania, the death penalty is the mandatory sentence for murder, but no executions have been carried out since 1994.Limbu is in her early 30s buthas the developmental age of a child. Growing up, her father beat her mother and Limbu was repeatedly raped by men in her village. She gave birth at 15 after becoming pregnant by rape.At about 18, she married an older man and had two more children. She later fled from her husband, who beat her, and moved to a different village with her youngest child, Tabu, who was about a year old.Why women killRead moreThere she met Kijiji Nyamabu, an alcoholic, who told Limbu he would marry her but would not accept Tabu because the child had been fathered by a different man.Shortly afterwards, Tabu was found strangled. There were no witnesses and Nyamabu had fled by the time Limbu brought the authorities to her daughter’s body. She was arrested in August 2011 but Nyamabu was never detained.Limbu has been a victim of abuse since childhood and is uniquely vulnerable because of her intellectual disabilityProf Sandra BabcockAt her first trial, Limbu pleaded not guilty. Unable to read or write, she said she did not know the contents of a statement that police claimed she had made admitting to the murder. She said she was beaten, threatened at gunpoint and detained for two days at the police station.Her original conviction in 2015 was nullified in 2019 due to procedural errors. But she remained incarcerated awaiting a new trial. In 2022, she was retried and sentenced to death a second time.The court did not allow evidence to be heard from medical professionals about her intellectual disabilities or history of abuse. An appeal was filed in 2022 but no date for a hearing has been set.Under international law, Limbushould not be held criminally liable, given her intellectual disability. Prof Sandra Babcock, founder of the Cornell Center on the Death Penalty Worldwide and a legal consultant to Limbu, wrote that the case was “a clear example of the profoundly unjust consequences of Tanzania’s mandatory death penalty.“Limbu has been a victim of abuse since childhood and is uniquely vulnerable because of her intellectual disability,” she said.A silhouette to represent Asiya BibiComposite: Guardian Design/Getty ImagesPakistan: Asiya BibiBlasphemyOn 20 March 2024, a court in Lahore passed a death sentence for blasphemy on Asiya Bibi*, 50 . She is illiterate and has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.Blasphemy is an offence punishable by death in Pakistan, although no one has ever been executed. Blasphemy laws have their origin in the British colonial era, and were designed to curb incitements to religious violence.Sarmad Ali, who is Bibi’s lawyer, says she was found guilty of allegedly burning the Qur’an in her area of Lahore. On 30 September 2021, a Muslim cleric reported her to the police, who arrested her the same day.In their investigation, the police found that Bibi, a Muslim, had sought help from a practitioner of black magic, who advised her to burn the Qur’an. Ali, who took Bibi’s case on in early 2022 as part of his pro bono legal work, believes she visited the witch-doctor in an effort to help her daughter find a husband.The prisoners facing blasphemy charges are very vulnerable … and jailed in very miserable conditionsSarmad Ali, lawyer“The prisoners who are facing blasphemy charges, whether they are under trial or convicted or condemned to death, are very vulnerable … and are jailed in very miserable conditions,” says Ali. “I would say that one day she might die in the prison.”Ali is awaiting a new date for an appeal to be heard in Bibi’s case. It had been set for 14 March 2025but was adjourned.While Pakistan’s blasphemy laws have been an instrument of persecution for decades, there has been a significant rise in the number of blasphemy cases since 2022, according to Human Rights Watch.In 2020, individuals brought 11 cases of alleged blasphemy in Pakistan, and nine in 2021. In2024, at least 475 blasphemy caseswere registered. Increasingly, those alleging blasphemy have based their accusations on comments made on social media, with the laws increasingly used to carry out personal vendettas and target members of minority religious communities.* Asiya Bibi is not to be confused with Asia Bibi, a 53-year-old Christian Pakistani woman who spenteight years on death row on blasphemy chargesand now lives at a secret location in Canada."

Kiefer Sutherland dives into the world of pantoHollywood megastars hit Leeds this year to make Tinsel Town, a feelgood festive comedy about panto. The 24 star, Rebel Wilson and more talk about their addiction to Greggs sausage rolls – and epic brawls with Danny DyerHollie RichardsonFri 28 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 08.22 ESTShareTwenty-odd years ago, I binged a TV series on DVD for the first time. At my mate’s house in a village outside Harrogate, I was glued toJack Bauershooting his way through24. We probably only made it to episode six before surrendering to sleep for school the next day.Fast forward to the start of this year, and photos are all over the local news ofKiefer Sutherlandout and about in nearby market towns Knaresborough and Wetherby. The real Jack Bauer in Yorkshire! He and Rebel Wilson are in the area making Tinsel Town, a British Christmas film about pantomimes. By March, I am invited to a Leeds studio, where they are filming, and find Sutherland dressed as Buttons on a stage. His glittery eyeshadow shimmers as he smiles and dances to Katy Perry’s Roar with the Cinderella cast. He repeats this showstopper scene about 15 times. It’s a surreal full circle moment; I half expect him to pull a pistol out on the ugly stepsisters.Sutherland is in Paris when I explain the connection later. “That’s very funny,” the Canadian laughs down the phone. “I ended up loving it; Leeds is a fantastic city.” Locals might have spotted him on weekend walks around the university, or at the pub he filmed in. “They had regular customers in, and they were just being really nice.” He also continued his obsession with Greggs sausage rolls, which started on tour with his band – “it was like the heavens had opened up” – and arranged for the bakers’ van to visit the set. Does he have a gold card? “I did for one tour. It was great, but I didn’t use it. I could afford my own sausage roll and a Steak Bake!”View image in fullscreenSetting the stage … Sutherland with Savannah Lee Smith and Lucien Laviscount in Tinsel Town.Photograph: Sky UKTinsel Town is a feelgood family comedy, directed by Chris Foggin (Bank of Dave,Fisherman’s Friends). Sutherland gamely leans into a meta role for it: Bradley Mack, a washed up Hollywood action star who thinks a stint in the West End will save his career. Except, when he arrives in England, he realises his stage debut will be in a small theatre production of Cinderella in a northern town called Stoneford. “It’s funny to watch his descent into actor hell,” says Sutherland. But it’s moving, too, as Bradley realises he needs to get himself together for his semi-estranged daughter. “It’s a lesson to a lot of parents out there who might actually be the children in that relationship. Certainly there were times where I could definitely say the same thing about myself.”Ultimately, though, this is a very sweet call to arms to save pantomime – and a “booo!” to anyone who sneers at it. The ensemble boasts stage icons such asDerek JacobiandMeera Syal. “My first glimpse of theatre was attending panto at a little church group – there was nothing else to do in the village I grew up in,” says Syal, taking a breather in her trailer on set. “I’ll never forget the feeling of the lights going down, the music starting, the actors coming on.” She played Fairy Mermaid (“obviously”) in Birmingham Hippodrome’s production of Peter Pan in 2018. “Wearing a fishtail three times a day – you really had to work out the toilet breaks. It’s really hard work. But you get that joy of seeing kids absolutely spellbound. It’s very life-affirming.”Panto isn’t just about tradition – it keeps the arts financially afloat. “The revenue from those pantomimes keep those theatres going for the whole year,” says eight-time Olivier award nomineeMaria Friedman. “I haven’t got enough time to tell you how dismayed I am about where the arts are – it’s just terrifying.” Friedman starred in Chicester Festivals’s 1982 production of Jack and the Beanstalk with “greats of comedy” Frankie Howerd and June Whitfield. In Tinsel Town she plays the fairy godmother. Her version of the classic panto goodie? “She loves a drink, she loves a joint, she’s permanently on heat. She really feels she’s in with a shot with Brad.”View image in fullscreenMan and van … Sutherland with Rebel Wilson in Tinsel Town.Photograph: Matt Squire/© Sky UKRebel Wilson cheerily walks on set at the end of the day in a green jumpsuit, charming the crew around her. She plays choreographer Jill, who champions the performance from the stage wings. And yes, she attempts a Yorkshire accent.“The Yorkshire accent is hard,” Wilson admits to me later. “But I tried to do my best!” (Last year, sheconfessed: “I don’t think my Yorkshire accent is that great.”) Her favourite bit of dialect? “My classic Yorkshire line was, ‘Hiya luv!’”. She got into the local spirit by joining Sutherland in loving the local delicacies: “I can’t go past a Greggs sausage roll but I also like their doughnuts any time of the day.”Jill helps Bradley to embrace theatre life. “It was fantastic working with Rebel,” says Sutherland. “Obviously her comedic skills are world renowned but she also brought real heart to the film. I don’t want to speak for her, but I think it was exciting for her on that level.” As well as singing a lively Christmas number for the first time in a film (a good use of his country music success), Sutherland shares a schmaltzy waltz with Wilson: “It was a bit foreign for both of us but I think we had fun.”Wilson is no stranger to pantoland: “I have fun memories of seeing pantomimes in Australia when I was a kid. They were on at our local Returned and Services League club – my relatives fought in the wars. My mum also said that when I was two, she took me to my first pantomime in Sydney. They asked for volunteers from the audience and I ran up on stage and sang a song. She was shocked. I was normally so shy.”What was working with Hollywood stars in Yorkshire like for the rest of the British cast? By all accounts: lovely. “Kiefer actually told us about a great pie shop [in Wetherby],” says Ray Fearon, who plays the baron. “The funniest moment was a scene withMawaan[Rizwan] driving a VW minibus,” addsLucien Laviscount, who plays Prince Charming. “Kiefer was in the front seat – Mawaan hadn’t driven manual for a good few years and tried to get the car started. We’re all in stitches in the back and Kiefer’s just breathing down his neck saying, ‘More gas! More gas!’ He stalled it about eight times.”View image in fullscreen‘Worst fighters’ …  Sutherland fights Danny Dyer in Tinsel Town.Photograph: Sky UKHowever, the best scene for viewers is undoubtedly the pathetic scrap between Sutherland andDanny Dyer, who plays Jill’s troubled hard-man ex. “Danny, I absolutely adore him,” says Sutherland. “He’s known as a tough guy in his films; I had 24 in my back pocket. It was just like, look, the way this is going to be funny is that these two guys really can’t fight very well at all. They’re the worst fighters on the planet but it ended up being one of my favourite fight sequences ever in my career.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Them two got on straight away. We filmed some scenes at [a] Wakefield theatre and in between rehearsals they would go off and fight with a stunt coordinator.”Foggin speaks from his Hertfordshire home over Zoom. After 2022’s This Is Christmas, Tinsel Town is the second festive film from the director, who was born in Sunderland and grew up in Durham. Is he the northern Richard Curtis? “He’s the reason I wanted to make movies. He’s a bit of an idol to me,” Foggin smiles. “When I think of Christmas, I think of Love Actually. I always wanted to make something – and who knows if this is going to be that film – like that: without looking at the TV listings, no matter what happens, Love Actually is always replayed at some point in the Christmas period, and the whole family still gets together to watch it.”View image in fullscreenAlways on the go … Sutherland as Jack Bauer in 24.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarSutherland was the first choice, says Foggin, and he immediately got the assignment: “He’s got a lot of [British] sensibilities.” It makes sense: he was born in London and his grandparents were Scottish (his Falkirk-born politician grandfather, Tommy Douglas, went on to become the “father of universal healthcare” in Canada), which means he’s been back and forth all his life. Wilson, meanwhile, has spent a lot of time in the UK recently. Responding to reports that she has relocated to the Cotswolds, she says she remains rooted in LA. “My family and I love London,” she says. “I’ve been getting into UK TV shows like Slow Horses and Downton Abbey (yes, I know I’m a bit late) and the Celebrity Traitors.”But hold on. Sutherland’s transatlantic background makes an earlier revelation he made even more shocking: “I’ve never seen a pantomime. I was so bummed. We arrived in the first week of January. I dropped my bags off, went for a walk around town, and one of the first things I saw was a big poster for a pantomime. I got so excited: ‘Oh my gosh, I’m gonna go see the panto tonight!’ It was a big part of my research. Of course, it had closed the night before.”There’s always this year though, right? “That I will be able to do.” First though, it’s business as usual in Paris: “I’m about to go to a fight rehearsal for this film I’m doing.”Tinsel Town is on Sky Cinema from 5 December.Explore more on these topicsKiefer SutherlandComedy filmsTelevisionRebel WilsonMeera SyalDanny DyerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He submitted his last column last week after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. From his hospital bed in Luton, Pauloffers his reflections on45 years writing for theGuardian.We, in the climate business, all owe a great deal to MrsMargaret Thatcher. Her politics were anathema to me and to many Guardian readers. But she prided herself on being a scientist before she was a politician.It was Thatcher’s inquiring mind that first demanded a scientific briefing about the dangers of the hole in the ozone layer, and subsequently on another even greater potential catastrophe, climate change. She was at the height of her influence on the international stage.Around the world, around the clock: how we report on a world on fireRead moreView image in fullscreenPaul Brown, former environment correspondent of the Guardian, 1991.Photograph: David Sillitoe/The GuardianMeanwhile, the Guardian was getting more and more interested in the environment. Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace had grown into large radical campaigning organisations, alongside more established organisations like the WWF. Their young membership increasingly looked to the Guardian to report their activities and advertise green jobs.As a general reporter on the paper, first assigned to cover nuclear power when the science editor was ill, I was allowed to sign on as a crew member of various Greenpeace ships. I went on voyages to block the Sellafield pipeline draining plutonium into the Irish Sea, I took trips round the coast highlighting sewage dumping and all manner of unlicensed chemical waste pipelines.I began to report from international conferences trying to protect the seas and fish stocks, and best of all I spent three months in Antarctica on a Greenpeace boat that tried, and eventually succeeded, to get Antarctica accepted by the international community as a world park. In Antarctica, I got 26 pieces in the paper via satellite – the first journalist to file direct from the icy continent.View image in fullscreenGreenpeace protesters at ICI, Runcorn, 1990.Photograph: Don McPhee/The GuardianAs I came back, Thatcher was in New York warning the UN about the dangers of climate change. Shortly afterwards, I found myself reporting from Geneva as Thatcher and other European leaders warned that the world was headed for disaster if it did not cut down on the use of fossil fuels.Back in London, Peter Preston, the Guardian’s then editor-in-chief, who once encouraged me by saying you could not write about anywhere properly unless you have been there, called me into his office and made me environment correspondent. The Green party had got 16% in the European elections, and Thatcher thought they were a threat.View image in fullscreenThe agreements set up in Rio de Janeiro at the Earth summit 1992 sent Paul Brown globe-trotting to various Cops in capital cities around the world.Photograph: Martin Argles/The GuardianSixteen years in the job followed. Most of the time, I sat beside John Vidal, who had an interest in everything. He took to editing the weekly environment pages, and then periodically dropping everything to head off after a maverick idea which generally turned into a brilliant story. More than once he left a note on my desk: “Could you do the pages this week, gone to Africa.”It was clear from the beginning of my new job that Thatcher’s understanding of the science clashed with her ideology. Curbing the free market was not going to happen. Instead, she did what all politicians do – divert attention by creating something else. In this case, it was the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, to study the subject better. The centre is now one of our world-renowned institutions.But this pattern of politicians learning the inconvenient truths of climate change and then falling short in the actions required to solve the problem has continued ever since. In fact, with the recent advent of blatant climate deniers, it has got far worse.In the 1990s, I travelled to a rollercoaster ride of international conferences. At the Earth summit in 1992 in Rio, Brazil, I saw George HW Bush and Fidel Castro walk past each other in the corridor, pretending they could not see each other. Oh, for a camera rather than a notebook!That summit saw the setup of the climate change convention, the biodiversity convention and much else, although it failed to do enough to protect forests. The agreements set up in Rio de Janeiro sent me globe-trotting to various conferences of the parties (Cops) in capital cities around the world to report on the snail’s pace of progress on climate.View image in fullscreenPresident HW George Bush looks the other way as the Cuban leader Fidel Castro passes in front of him at the Earth summit, 1992.Photograph: Omar Torres/AFP/Getty ImagesBack home in the 1990s, the UK was in recession.The Guardiannews desk’s interest in the environment, once the Earth summit was over, was minimal. House repossessions and job losses were rightly more immediate and pressing.But as the decade progressed, the Conservatives were ousted in 1997 and then, as John Prescott became environment secretary, the environment news kept moving up the agenda. By the time of the second Earth summit in Johannesburg in 2002, it was back at the top of the news list.By the autumn of 2005, I was run off my feet. After the catastrophic foot and mouth epidemic, every department – home, foreign, city and features – wanted to know each day what story (or stories) I had for them. And every section naturally wanted their story first. Vidal had taught me one good lesson: that it was possible to get away with absences from your desk if you came back with a good story. At the same time, the Guardian Foundation and various UN institutions had adopted me as a tutor on environment matters and began sending me to eastern Europe and Asia to teach other journalists how to cover this subject. By 2005, the pressure of work became too great and I took redundancy. Six months after I left, the Guardian had five people doing my old job.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I have attended more conferences, such as the Cops in Paris and Warsaw, and helped train young journalists on how to cover these bewildering events, giving something back to the profession that has given me so much.But I have also watched in continuing dismay what we might call the Thatcher syndrome: apparently intelligent politicians failing yet and yet again to have the courage to implement the decisions necessary to tackle the ever more imminent danger of climate change. Of course, as at the recent Cop30 in Brazil, they have been beset by more fossil fuel lobbyists than environmentalists, a phenomenon that was first reported by Vidal and I in the 1990s. Do the well-funded fossil fuel lobbyists always have to win?And there has been another – in my view, very sinister – development, which has put back the cause of action on climate change into very dangerous territory: the latest “nuclear renaissance”. I started covering the nuclear industry in the early 1980s, and like all well trained journalists was neutral then. Nuclear power was a success story because it was part of the National Coal Board and its true costs were hidden, not just from consumers but from the government.The first nuclear renaissance took place in the late 1980s when the Sizewell B nuclear power station was being built. Several more were on the drawing board, but Thatcher demanded to know the cost and the resultant price of electricity to consumers, and was so enraged that she and the government had been lied to about the real cost that she cancelled the rest of the programme. It was one of my more memorable stories.View image in fullscreenThe first ‘nuclear renaissance’ took place in the late 1980s when construction started on the Sizewell B nuclear power station.Photograph: Graham Turner/The GuardianAt least two more “renaissance” moments have come and gone, mostly also on cost grounds, but now Keir Starmer’s government has gone completely gung-ho on nuclear – to the utter dismay of many environmental campaigners.The government subsidies are simply huge: a nuclear tax is being levied on hard pressed consumers. What is the government thinking of? The fossil fuel industry, which has thrown its weight behind nuclear power, is of course delighted; all these decades of new construction without any electricity to show for it gives at least another decade or two of unabated burning gas. It is no accident that Centrica invested in Sizewell C – after all, it is primarily a gas company. With Sizewell C likely to take 10 to 15 years to build, that is a lot of extra gas being burned and profits for shareholders.But the biggest mystery is small modular reactors (SMRs), which are theoretically built in factories and put together on site, making them easier and cheaper to build. SMRs originally were defined as generating less than 300MW, about a third of the size of a traditional nuclear or gas station, but have now been redefined by Rolls-Royce to mean 470MW because even on the drawing board the company could not make the economics work.View image in fullscreenA Greenpeace demo outside the BP headquarters, Finsbury Circus, London, in 1997.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianSeveral have been promised, but the problem is that they do not yet exist, except on paper or on a computer. No factory has been built to make their components, no prototype has been built, no licensing process has taken place. All that is known about them is that (also on paper) they produce more hotter waste at the end of their lives.I know many of my colleagues at the Guardian would disagree, but as I disappear into oblivion after 40 years of covering this industry, I would ask them to keep looking at it closely. Over the years I have regularly been fed wildly optimistic figures of construction costs and times and of the resultant electricity supply. At worst we have been consistently lied to. Unlike wind and solar, nuclear costs have consistently gone up for decades.And now it is happening all over again at Sizewell C in Suffolk and in north Wales; the British public is being forced to watch as the government pours billions of pounds of our money down the drain. Journalists should be exposing this terrible waste. In the name of the climate I ask them to look closely at the real facts, not believe the hype, and try to stop this waste of resources before it gets worse.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentNewspapersWork & careersCampaigning journalismNewspapers & magazinesThe GuardianNational newspapersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, this morning, we finally reached the day that puts the “Friday” into Black Friday. That means products that have been discounted throughout November have been given even more tempting offers, and some fresh savings have hit the shelves.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.So, if you’ve just clocked off from your nine-to-five, there’s no need to panic. There are still plenty of savings available to shop and, crucially, there’s lots of time left to mull over your decision. Remember, there are lots of dud deals flying around and it’s important to only buy the things that you really need. There’s a long weekend of savings ahead, and last-minute deals won’t drop until Cyber Monday.As ever, we’d encourage you not to buy anything unless you really need it and have the budget to do so – read our advice onhow to shop smartly.Here’s our fully updated guide to the best genuine Black Friday bargains on the Filter’s favourites, from Anker battery packs to KidiZoom cameras via the espresso machine you loved more than any other product this year.For more, read thebest Black Friday deals under £50and thebest PS5, Xbox and Nintendo Switch 2 dealsHow we selected these deals (and excluded others)The key toshopping smarton Black Friday, Cyber Monday or any discount event is to know what you want – and we’re here to help you target the good stuff. We’ve tested thousands of products at the Filter in 2025 and warmly recommended hundreds of them, including many that have genuinely good Black Friday discounts.Instead of listing price cuts on all the products we’ve featured, we’ve focused on the things you’ve liked the most this year, and looked for deals that undercut their long-term average prices by a significant amount. Ideally, their Black Friday price will be their lowest of the year.We don’t take retailers at their word on discount size, either. Amazon may say it’s “70%” off the RRP, but we study the price history of every item using independent tools such asthe Camelizerto find out how generous a discount really is. If an item’s price has been all over the place in 2025, we’ll give the average price below instead of a “was …” price, so you can judge how good a deal it is.Q&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The bestBlack Friday deals on the Filter’s favourite productsThe best book dealsBen Lippett’s cookery bestsellerView image in fullscreenHow I Cook by Ben Lippett (hardback), from £10.92 (was £26)£10.92 at Amazon£15.60 with code BLACKFRIDAY40 at HarperCollinsCook and food writerBen Lippett, who has contributed somedelicious recipesto these pages recently, scored an instant bestseller with this wonderfully readable guide to everything you always wanted to know about cooking but were afraid to ask.

He found it a little too expensive, however – and it’s still north of £100, but somewhat less so.The best heated clothes airerView image in fullscreenDry:Soon Deluxe heated airer, £159.99 (was £199.99)£159.99 at Lakeland£159.99 at AmazonA heated airer dries your clothes fast enough to avoid the dreaded stink of slow-dried laundry, and without the cost or noise of a tumble dryer.

The company’s deluxemattress topperadds a touch of softness to a too-hard mattress, and is one of the easiest toppers we tested to move and store. Woolroom’s 35% isn’t quite as big a discount as Amazon’s, but it applies to everything on its site, including duvets, mattresses and linens.Powerful pressure washerView image in fullscreenBosch UniversalAquatak 135 high pressure washer, £117.99 (was £209)£117.99 at Amazon£135 at CurrysBlitz the gunk from your patio, decking, gutters and any flat surface you find yourself unable to resist pointing the nozzle at.

The Eufy X10 was named “best overall” by Stuart Andrews in his guide to thebest robot vacuums, and it’s already one of the fastest-selling items in Amazon’s Black Friday sale. Its price cut isn’t quite the 38% Amazon suggests, because it cost £579 throughout 2025, but this is still a legitimately good deal.Damp-destroying dehumidifierView image in fullscreenProBreeze dehumidifier, from £151.99 (was £189.99)£151.99 at Amazon£159.49 at ProBreezeThis “workhorse”, which “extracted moisture powerfully” in ourbest dehumidifierstest, has tumbled to its lowest price of the year (except for a few days in May, because no one buys dehumidifiers in May).

A fiver off is not a massive discount, but this is its cheapest recent price on Amazon, where it normally costs £84.99. Beurer has now matched Amazon’s Black Friday price, dropping from £94.99 to £79.99.Google video doorbellView image in fullscreenGoogle Nest doorbell, from £119.98 (was £179.99)£119.98 at Amazon£129 at CurrysSort the cold-callers from the welcome visitors when they’re still metres away from your front door, with this outstanding battery-powered doorbell that crashes to its lowest price since Black Friday 2023.

With more than £30 shaved off Amazon’s average price for the camera, it’s now an even more reasonable buy.Budget electric blanketView image in fullscreenSlumberdown Sleepy Nights electric blanket, king size, from £30.59(was £45.99)£30.59 at Amazon£34.20 at SlumberdownThis Slumberdown Sleepy Nights performed admirably in Emily Peck’s test ofthe best electric blankets, heating quickly to a temperature that was comfortable to keep our reviewer warm through the night. It also has elasticated fitted straps to make fitment easy, and comes in a variety of sizes to suit your bed size. It’s the king-size one that’s been discounted.Subscription-free video doorbellView image in fullscreenEufy Security doorbell E340, £74.99 (avg £151.29)£74.99 at AmazonLots of video doorbells and home surveillance systems come with a recurring subscription to access some of their features, which you may wish to avoid. If so, then the Eufy Video Doorbell E340 was Andy Shaw’s pick in his testing of thebest video doorbellsout there. He liked the E340 precisely because of its dual camera setup to make keeping an eye on parcels a breeze, plus the onboard storage to stick it to cloud storage. Reliability of movement detection needed some work, though.

The correct answer would have been “Don Welsh bad”, given he was the last Liverpool manager to preside over nine defeats in 12 games, back in 1953-54. But the on-the-spot consensus was “Brendan bad” for reasons that may increase anxiety at Fenway Sports Group as the club’s owners desperately await a recovery under Arne Slot.The Roy Hodgson era, airbrushed from history by some atLiverpool, is too low a base for comparisons with a Premier League champion. There are, however, some parallels between the current Liverpool crisis and the final 16 months of Brendan Rodgers’ reign at Anfield. The 2014-15 season was the last time confidence in a Liverpool manager or head coach began to drain. It was also the last time the impressive development of a Liverpool team – one that went agonisingly close to an unexpected title triumph in Rodgers’ case – not only came to an abrupt halt but veered into a steep decline with several new signings on board. FSG must hope the comparisons go no further, because that decline was precipitated by self-sabotage in the summer transfer window of 2014 and there is no conclusive evidence so far that it has avoided an expensive repeat in 2025.Can Arne Slot revive this Frankenstein’s monster of a Liverpool side? | Barney RonayRead moreResponsibility for Liverpool’s ridiculous and unbelievable collapse – to use Slot’s own descriptions – is on the shoulders of a head coach who has struggled to find solutions and faces a critical run of Premier League fixtures in the next week against West Ham, Sunderland and Leeds. The affable, honest Dutchman has never shied from that responsibility and accepts that questions over his future are legitimate, only six months after leading Liverpool to theirsecond league title in 35 years. He is not bringing the best out of an unquestionably talented group, whose commitment towards the end of the losses toPSVandNottingham Forestwas questionable.Slot spoke with Richard Hughes, Liverpool’s sporting director, to dissect the PSV defeat on Thursday, as he does after every game, and came away reassured that the club’s hierarchy still back him. But he knows faith in football is finite and the current rate of losses is unsustainable. The conversation and the questions should not be one-way, however, whenthe most extravagant transfer windowin Liverpool’s history has failed to improve a title-winning team after 20 games. An outlay approaching £450m, that included committing to break the British transfer record twice in one summer, has brought only disruption and imbalance so far.Liverpool’s fall is unprecedented, even with echoes of 2014 taken into account. Status, pulling power and finances comfortably restored thanks to Jürgen Klopp, and Slot’s success last season, Liverpool today have their choice when shopping at the high end of the market.Selling Luis Suárezand buying Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Lazar Markovic with the proceeds this is not.View image in fullscreenArne Slot has not managed to get the best out of Mohamed Salah this season.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersLiverpool’s transfer strategy is led by Hughes and Michael Edwards, chief executive of football at FSG. Slot has input and a say on transfer targets but, as his head-coach title demonstrates, his role is to work within the system FSG put in place after Klopp’s departure and coach the team. That is worth considering as the clamour among Liverpool supporters for Klopp to return gathers pace. FSG does not want an all-powerful manager in charge. Edwards would in all likelihood have not agreed to return to the club in March 2024 had that been the plan.Edwards’ and Hughes’ reputations for astute, intelligent transfer dealings and long-term planning are well established. But, with Slot under intense pressure and Liverpool in the bottom half of the table – albeit while three points off fourth place – their approach to the summer window invites as many questions as the team’s results.Were last season’s champions really crying out for theaddition of Florian Wirtz’s creative class at a cost of potentially £116m? Whysign Hugo Ekitikéfor up to £79mplus Alexander Isak for £125mwhen there is so little cover on the flanks, especially after the departure of Luis Díaz? Why sign a right wing-back in Jeremie Frimpong when a bona fide full-back was required? Liverpool will be paying a considerable price for the foreseeable future if, and it remains an if given the calibre of Wirtz and Isak, they have got this one spectacularly wrong.Questions at right-back have had a destabilising effect on the Liverpool team. The club were powerless to preventTrent Alexander-Arnold leaving on a free for Real Madridbut the consequences of his acrimonious exit have been extensive. Conor Bradley’s struggles with injury were well known before Alexander-Arnold went, hence the need for an established addition in that position. One did not arrive. Bradley, Frimpong, Joe Gomez, Curtis Jones, Calvin Ramsay and Dominik Szoboszlai have been deployed at right-back this season. The high turnover has undoubtedly affected Mohamed Salah’s form. Switching Szoboszlai to defence has also deprived the Liverpool midfield of the team’s most effective player this term.‘I’m feeling safe’: Arne Slot insists he retains Liverpool’s support after PSV humiliationRead moreSlot had hoped Wirtz would provide the ingenuity needed to break down low blocks and turn the slender victories of last season into more emphatic routs. It has not happened. The Germany international, who could return from injury at West Ham on Sunday, may have been lured with promises of a team being built around him, as Arsène Wenger has claimed, but has had minimal impact in the Premier League when playing as a 10. Slot’s search to accommodate the playmaker continues.Isak’s start to life at Liverpool has been worse than Wirtz’s. The most expensive signing in British football history was excused for a sluggish introduction by Slot on account of missing pre-season at Newcastle while effectively on strike to force a move to Merseyside. Two months into his Liverpool career, the Sweden striker remains short of match sharpness. One can only wonder what the rest of the Liverpool dressing room makes of his behaviour at Newcastle this summer.The new signings owe Slot but are not solely responsible for the downturn of a champion team reeling from theimmeasurable loss of Diogo Jotaand in uncharted territory on the pitch too. It was noticeable how often Slotused the word “fight” during his press conference to preview the West Ham game. Liverpool must show more over the next week, or the unthinkable will come a step closer.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotanalysisShareReuse this content"

I’m very happy with that. I just need to continue to do it.”That job has been a season-long challenge in which he has led the championship, lost the advantage and retaken it to reach the point in Qatar where he could seal the deal. He leads his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri and Red Bull’sMax Verstappenby 24 points, with 58 still on the table from the final two meetings in Doha this weekend and in Abu Dhabi next week, including a sprint race here on Saturday.As things stand he holds the cards to win his first title and become the 11th British driver to claim the F1 world championship. Outscoring both of his rivals by two points across the weekend regardless of where he finishes or by one point if he wins the race on Sunday will be enough.Quick GuideF1 title race: how they stand and what's still up for grabsShowDrivers' championship standings1Lando Norris (McLaren) 390pts2Oscar Piastri (McLaren) 3663Max Verstappen (Red Bull) 366Despite being level on points, Piastri (7 wins) holds second place due to more GP victories than Verstappen (6 wins) this seasonPoints still availableGP1st 25pts, 2nd 18, 3rd 15, 4th 12, 5th 10, 6th 8, 7th 6, 8th 4, 9th 2, 10th 1Sprint race1st 8pt, 2nd 7, 3rd 6, 4th 5, 5th 4, 6th 3, 7th 2, 8th 1Remaining race weekends29-30 Nov Qatar (sprint race and GP)6-7 Dec\tAbu Dhabi (GP only)What Norris needs• He needs to emerge from the weekend having scored two points more than Piastri and Verstappen to be sure.• There are a maximum of 58 points left for each driver to win: eight in today’s sprint, 25 in tomorrow’s race and 25 in Abu Dhabi next Sunday.• If two drivers are level on points in the standings the driver with most race wins would be champion. If they still cannot be split it goes to most second-place finishes, and so on until a point of difference is reached. The McLaren drivers are level 7-7 on wins, with Verstappen on six, but Norris is 8-3 ahead of Piastri on second places.• Norris is aiming to become the 11th British champion after Mike Hawthorn, Graham Hill (2), Jim Clark (2), John Surtees, Jackie Stewart (3), James Hunt, Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill, Lewis Hamilton (7) and Jenson Button.McLaren sealed the constructors' title with in October, with six races remainingWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.He is resolved to do so with a win if possible, rather than any bet-hedging and his belief that he will indeed take the title is underscored by the streak of form he has found in the final third of the season. Since being 34 points behind Piastri after failing to finish due to an oil leak at the Dutch Grand Prix, he has returned two wins and three podiums.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen was happy to throw in a few mind games to put his McLaren rivals under pressure before the last two race weekends.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockThe early-season struggles with the car, which did not give him the feel for the front grip on which he thrives, have been banished and he has been relentless in exploiting his chance ever since.This has been a process that Norris has pursued with his zeal for self-improvement. McLaren’s team principal, Andrea Stella, has described this resolve and Norris’s commitment to it all season as being a quality that demonstrated why he was convinced the Briton was always in contention, and it has indeed been instrumental.“I’m getting a lot out of the car and performing consistently,” Norris said. “I feel like my confidence is very high. Because I was struggling a lot with the car and several things at the beginning of the season, it’s put me into a much better position now, much later in the season.“I feel like this year I’ve still learned a lot in terms of how to deal with all of those things as a driver. I’m happy I had all the struggles and almost got them out of the way and been able to improve.”View image in fullscreenOf course, Norris is not the only driver full of belief. Piastri, who led for so long, is still in the running, albeit after a slump in form just as Norris has come up to speed. It is very much still a three-way title fight and the Australian has good form at the Lusail circuit, with two previous podiums and victory in the sprint race in the past two seasons. He underlined that form by qualifying on pole for the sprint race on Saturday. A win on Sunday might yet reinvigorate him and put the pressure back on to Norris.The Australian has insisted he will fight on until out of contention and rightly has no intent of sacrificing himself to Norris’s advantage, while McLaren will let their drivers continue to race, as they have all season. That was a decision which was welcomed with open arms by Verstappen in Qatar.View image in fullscreenOscar Piastri was looking good in practice on Friday in Qatar, running quicker than his McLaren teammate, Lando Norris.Photograph: Antonin Vincent/DPPI/ShutterstockFor it is surely Verstappen who is altogether the more threatening variable. He had looked out of contention by the mid-season point in the Netherlands but has hurtled back into the running with an upgraded car which has proved very much to his liking, a string of wins and that disqualification for the two McLarens in Vegas. The defending world champion cannot be written off and will probably be quick in Qatar, the fast corners playing to the Red Bull’s strengths.Moreover, he has nothing to lose and he knows it and was happy to throw a few mind games in Norris’s direction. “The pressure of getting it over the line is in the back of his mind,” he said. “When you have won four world championships already, it is amazing and I shouldn’t be in the fight really but I am here.”Ever the provocateur, Verstappen maintained that had he been in the McLaren the title would already have been wrapped up. “We wouldn’t be talking about a championship,” he said. “It would already have been won, easily.”Verstappen was 104 points off Piastri after the Dutch GP. That he has made them back to come into the running is remarkable and gives these championship-deciding races a real edge. He simply cannot be ruled out and while he acknowledged that he would need a chunk of good fortune to bridge the gap to Norris, there always remains the chance that ill fate or poor judgment may strike the British driver.“The most important is that you have a fast car,” he said. “So we have to make sure that we are faster than them, or at least equal-ish. Then with that, we still need a bit of luck. I mean, even if they tense up and they finish P2 [second], P3, it’s still fine, you know. So from our side, everything needs to go really well and then we might need a little help.”If he gets a shot, no one is in any doubt Verstappen will pounce and force this fascinating contest down to the wire. While for Norris, calm and at ease as he holds his destiny in his own hands, there is only focus on finishing the job.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Lando NorrisMax VerstappenMcLarenFormula OneRed BullMotor sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In an email to players on its books and others who have expressed interest, R360 board member Stuart Hooper said the delay would “strengthen its integrity”.Senior rugby figures believe rebel R360 league all but dead after unions’ statementRead moreR360 has been beset by problems since reports of the new grand prix-style franchise competition spearheaded by the former England World Cup captain Mike Tindall first emerged 12 months ago. The Guardian revealed in September that ­competition organisers had delayed its planned application for ­sanctioning by World Rugby that month until next June, which raised questions over their ability to launch four months later, although R360 insisted it would go ahead as planned.In another significant blow, eight of the 12 tier-one unions, led by England and New Zealand, announced a ban on R360 players in October, a move that was followed this week by the British and Irish Lions, ashas been previously reported in the Guardian. Australia’s National Rugby League, whose players have been heavily targeted, went even further by announcing that rugby league stars who joined R360 would be barred from returning to the competition for 10 years.Despite these setbacks, Tindall had claimed this month that next year’s planned launch was on track and that “funding had been secured for the first three years of the tournament”, so the timing of the postponement on Friday came as a surprise.In his email to players Hooper, a former Bath captain and director of rugby, indicated that the delay would give R360 longer to negotiate with the sport’s other stakeholders, although given the opposition of the major unions there is still no guarantee it will be sanctioned by World Rugby.While 2026 was always intended as a soft launch, the men’s Rugby World Cup in 2027 presented additional complications, so R360 has opted to start with a full 16-week competition staged in four blocks in 2028.“We appreciate this will be a shock for some and disappointing for all, but we’d like to explain the reasoning behind the decision,” Hooper wrote.“We had detailed plans to launch in late 2026. A full season launch in 2028 means that we can: go straight into a full season rather than starting with two shortened seasons; spend more time speaking with rugby stakeholders to ensure you are not penalised with your international careers for choosing where you want to play club rugby; continue to build a commercial model that sees you paid fairly for the value you bring to the game.”The top 40 players in R360 have been promised annual contracts worth at least $1m (about £750,000), which is comparable with the earnings of top England stars for a deal that would also permit them to play international rugby, although that is now in doubt.Despite such bold financial commitments, R360 has yet to announce any commercial partners or reveal details of its broadcast model, although it has been reported matches would be made available free-to-air on YouTube. There have also been rumours in rugby circles that one of its financial backers may have withdrawn, although that has not been verified.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The financier Roger Mitchell has previously confirmed he is a board member and has provided seed funding through his company, Albachiara.Difficulties recruiting top players are also likely to have been a factor, with many big names recently committing elsewhere. France’s captain, Antoine Dupont, has re-signed with Toulouse until 2032, while England players George Ford, Fin Smith, Alex Mitchell and Fraser Dingwall have signed new deals with their clubs.“The decision to shift our launch to 2028 is a strategic decision based on timing,” Tindall said. “Launching under compressed timelines would not meet the standards we set for R360, nor would it deliver the long-term commercial impact that the sport deserves.“As a board we remain absolutely determined to bring R360 to life at full scale and with maximum global impact. We’re building something bold and new that will resonate globally – and we cannot wait to show the world in 2028.”Explore more on these topicsRugby unionSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was asked whether he thought Rice had reached his peak.“Probably yes, a year or two ago, yes,” Arteta said. “But now being with him every single day and understanding and connecting with him in the way that I’ve done, we’re going to get more. Because he wants more and he’s going to get more. The team knows him better, his role is growing around the team, the impact that he has on the team is huge and we’ll find ways to make it even better.”Rice was signed as a defensive midfielder but has evolved into a box-to-box player that Arteta believes allows the England international to have more influence. “He can adapt to anything that you throw at him,” he said. “But at the moment that forward thinking and anything that is in front of him is probably much more positive for the team. He has earned the right to increase that role, to be more and more important, to be very present in everything that we do.“He’s in the leadership group, which is very important as well, and it’s a real presence. Sometimes you don’t need to just wear the armband to feel really connected, really powerful and really important in the team.”Rice, who joined West Ham after being released by Chelsea, was namedman of the match against Bayern. He told the former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry in an interview for American television after that there was “an anger in our players this season” and that they have “that fire in our stomach” after finishing as runners up for three successive campaigns. It is a feeling clearly encouraged by Arteta.“Yes, but I sense that for a long time and that’s a great thing,” Arteta said. “That desire, that willingness to win and to do everything that we have in our hands to be the best that we can.

There is still hope.Before the Ashes started I had plenty of it, because of England’s fantastic array of fast bowlers and because I felt they had improved on their crash‑bang‑wallop, one-size‑fits‑all approach to batting. Then the series got under way, and while the bowlers did their bit, the batters failed badly. After thetwo-day humiliation in Perththey are inevitably under the microscope – but while everyone is questioning England’s approach, how much are they challenging themselves?I based my optimism on some of what I had seen over the summer. In thefirst innings against India at Lord’sJoe Root and Ollie Pope put on 109 runs at almost exactly three an over, staying calm and building a foundation thateventually won their side the match. I watched that and admired the way they had refined their attitude, becoming more adaptable to the match situation, the surfaces they were playing on and the challenges presented by the opposition – in that case, in particular, the need to negate the brilliant Jasprit Bumrah.England can’t change now: Bazball approach must be seen through to its conclusion | Taha HashimRead moreI thought that India series, five tough matches against excellent opposition, would have really helped prepare the side for the Ashes. This England team have absolutely battered some teams, who haven’t been able to cope with their quality and their approach, but in their most recent Test series they faced a group that had the resilience and the skill to cope with it – ideal preparation for what they were going to face in Australia.Then they won the toss in Perth, chose to bat, came out and got absolutelymauled by Mitchell Starc.The emotional intelligence, the situational awareness, that impressed me at times over the summer was nowhere to be seen. Instead England, pumped up on adrenaline and the desire to “put the bowlers under pressure”, surrendered to their attacking instincts. To some degree I can understand it: on a pitch with pace, bounce and movement, a lot of players will feel the need to be proactive, feeling that sooner or later they’ll get a ball with their name on it. But in that second innings none of Pope, Root or Harry Brook faced that killer delivery: they were all out driving away from their body, at balls that were a good length. Australia cannot have believed how easy it was.View image in fullscreenHarry Brook can barely believe it after he is out during England’s collapse in the second innings of the first Test at Perth.Photograph: Gary Day/APAfter the match Ben Stokes said he thought the players who made runs on that wicket had been very proactive, and to an extent he was right –Travis Head certainly had beenin his match-winning knock. But sometimes you’re up against good bowling on a helpful pitch and you just need to get through it. A team that never want to back off, that just keep throwing the bat, will find their approach pays off on some days, and on others leads to complete meltdown. At times it feels their approach is a total lottery, and not one you would expect from an elite, winning side.England were very vocal about getting matches into players before this series, and I thought their chances of winning the Ashes were really boosted by the fact they look a very settled unit – nine or 10 players in that team pretty much pick themselves. They have the experience, the continuity of selection, and they have a lot of quality. So how did it all go so wrong?When it came to it, they seemed to get dragged into this gladiatorial thing, where they walked into the arena, with all this noise and hype, and felt they had to go out from the start and show Australia that they felt no fear, that they were going to play their own game, and that it would be better than anyone else’s. Every batter in that team has been selected because they are very aggressive. No one with any other method – and there are some brilliant batters who have had great success in the County Championship and been completely ignored – has a chance of getting in. So what happens when aggression is not the best approach?In my experience the best teams have a blend of batters. It’s great to have someone who can take the game away from the opposition very quickly, but you also need people who are capable of playing an innings over many hours, or even many sessions. Stokes and Root have both played that kind of innings in the past, but now seem to prefer a different approach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One way to do that is to attack, and there are occasions when that is the right approach. One other way, which has been accepted for about 150 years, is to give nothing away, provide no encouragement, be remorseless, and bat yourselves into complete dominance. They are both ways of putting the bowlers under pressure. The pitch was getting better, the ball was getting older, several of their opponents appeared to be injured – what an opportunity, in the first Test of the series, to make a statement.But the world of cricket has seen how England play, and Australia knew there was no need to panic – they would probably just get themselves out.At Lord’s in the 2023 Ashesthey just kept bowling short and batter after batter fell into their trap. In Perth they went wide of off stump and it happened again. England’s batters wanted to keep going at five an over and within half an hour they’d lost the match.View image in fullscreenBen Stokes congratulates Travis Head after the Australia batter’s 123 runs had all but win the first Test.Photograph: Dave Hunt/EPANow they have to usethis extended breakbefore the second Test. They may not be using it to get match practice, but they must take this opportunity for reflection. They have to be completely honest with themselves. It’s hard to know how much of this actually goes on within that batting unit, because when he speaks in public Stokes always talks about blocking out the external noise, doubling down, knocking them off their lengths, being proactive. The thing is, sometimes that’s bloody difficult.Something has to change over the next 10 days, because if the pink ball moves around at the Gabba in the second Test they’ll be faced with the same situation, and the same answers are likely to produce the same outcome. And then it surely will be over.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26England cricket teamCricketThe AshesBen StokescommentShareReuse this content"

An exemption to the ban was granted to athletes, coaches or “persons performing a necessary support role” who were travelling for the World Cup or “other major sporting event”, but appears not to have been applied in this instance.“We have informed Fifa that the decisions taken are unrelated to sport and that the members of the Iranian delegation will not participate in the World Cup draw,” the federation spokesperson Amir Mehdi Alavi was quoted as saying by the English language newspaper the Tehran Times.View image in fullscreenIran played the USA at the 2022 World Cup.Photograph: Wolfgang Rattay/ReutersAccording to the newspaper, the president of the FFIRI, Mehdi Taj, was one of three individuals denied a visa by the US state department, while four people – including the head coach, Amir Ghalenoei – were granted one. Reports in October suggested both Taj and Ghalenoei had seen their visa applications rejected, with the Tehran Times reporting that the FFIRI had taken up the issue personally with Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino.Infantino has previously pledged that “everyone will be welcome” at the World Cup, which begins in Mexico City on 11 June. Speaking on the sidelines of an assembly of the European Football Clubs organisation on 9 October, he had sought to calm concerns that visas could be denied to athletes or officials.“We have excellent discussions with the US government. There is a White House task force chaired by President Trump, and all these topics are discussed there,” Infantino said. “With all the relevant secretaries of state, there will be no issues with regard to visas, obviously for the participating teams and delegations, and we are working on something as well for fans. Hopefully, some good news will come out very soon.”Fifa has since confirmed the creation of the Fifa Pass, a scheme that will allow World Cup ticket holders priority access to the visa application process before the tournament. Applications are not guaranteed to be successful, however. According to reporting in Politico, fans of Haiti – who qualified for their second World Cup last week but whose nation is also on Trump’s restricted travel list – are able to submit visa applications but “may be ineligible for visa issuance or admission to the United States”.Fifa, the FFIRI and the US Department of State have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026IranWorld CupnewsShareReuse this content"

We knew they would be dangerous and have their chances.

From April 2027 these will be subject to the 45% top rate of income tax, rather than the corporate tax rate of 25%.Some Premier League players signed from overseas are understood to have clauses in their contracts that make their clubs liable for any significant changes to the UK’s tax regime but those who do not are likely to demand higher wages.Many players negotiate contracts based on net pay, with clubs taking care of their tax affairs, a trend likely to continue. Image rights payments often make up a notable portion of players’ salaries, which is permitted by HMRC if the amount is deemed commercially realistic and does not exceed 20% of total earnings, so the increased tax liability for clubs may be considerable.The government’s move follows a long-running clampdown by HMRC on footballers’ earnings, which has recovered hundreds of millions of pounds in unpaid tax.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was, the firm’s post-race analysis said, a “disconcertingly tame display”.Tame. Ouch. It is not a word that could ever have been applied to the first dozen races of Constitution Hill’s career, which ranged from the electrifying, effortless brilliance of his first two seasons to the high drama of falls at Cheltenhamand Aintreethis year.At Punchestown he travelled well enough to three out, but when Nico de Boinville shook the reinsConstitution Hillhad nothing more to give. He eventually trailed home 27 lengths behind the winner, beaten when completing for the first time in his career.Racing celebrates ‘Axe the Tax’ Budget campaign victory after Reeves spares sportRead moreThe greatest racehorses, by definition, have further to fall when they pass their peak, but few have ever slipped as far or as fast as Constitution Hill in the seven and a half weeks between the Cheltenham festival and Punchestown. He lined up for the Champion Hurdle on 11 March as the unbeaten winner of 10 races, including eight at Grade One level. By 2 May , as he trailed home all of 27 lengths behind State Man in Ireland, he was a listless shadow of his former self.It remains a troubling image before Constitution Hill’s return to action in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle on Saturday, but an essential part of the narrative too before what promises to be the best hurdle race this side of Cheltenham 2026.The deposed champion on the comeback trail is up against not one, but two young pretenders in Dan Skelton’s The New Lion, an impressive winner at Cheltenham in March, and the unbeaten Anzadam, from Willie Mullins’s powerhouse stable in Ireland. The winner, almost certainly, will set off as favourite for the Champion Hurdle itself in the spring.And if that winner turns out to be Constitution Hill, the stage will be set for one of the great festival showpieces next year, as Nicky Henderson, a trainer with plenty of previous when it comes to coaxing champions back to the summit, attempts to do for Constitution Hill what he did for Sprinter Sacre a decade ago.That horse, like Constitution Hill, had compiled an unbeaten 10-race before he was pulled up with an irregular heartbeat in the Desert Orchid Chase at Kempton in December 2013. He was off the track for more than a year, and then beaten in all three starts in the 2014-15 season, but went unbeaten in four in 2015-16 including a memorable second success in the Champion Chase in March.A similar story arc for Constitution Hill would arguably be an even greater achievement for a trainer who has shown plenty of resilience himself over the course of nearly 50 years in the game. Henderson won his second National Hunt trainers’ title in 1987, the same year he nursed the talented but fragile See You Then to his third Champion Hurdle victory. His third championship, after a quarter of a century of dominance by Martin Pipe and then Paul Nicholls, did not arrive for another 26 years.So the script for a glorious final season to Constitution Hill’s career writes itself. It is just waiting for its star to take centre stage at Newcastle on Saturday, and prove that he still has what it takes.Blizzard Of Oz set to strike GoldWillie Mullins’s record in handicap chases in Britain is not all that it might be given his general dominance in jumping in recent years, but he has plenty of ground to make up on Dan Skelton in the race to retain the trainers’ championship andBlizzard Of Oz (2.55)is an interesting each-way chance for a typically competitive renewal of the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury on Saturday.As a seven-year-old with just five previous chase starts to his name, Blizzard Of Oz is among the most lightly raced runners in the field, but he went close to winning a big-field event at the Punchestown festival on his only previous start in a handicap and finally got off the mark over fences in a three-mile Listed event at Wexford last month.The time of Blizzard Of Oz’s Punchestown run puts him right in the mix for Saturday’s race and he appeals as the pick of the prices at around 16-1.Newbury 1.40The lightly racedDominic’s Faulthad just started to make significant progress towards the lead when he was brought down by a faller in front of him at the third-last at Sandown in January. He is 1lb lower in the weights for his first race since and has gone well fresh in the past.Newcastle 2.00In his prime, Constitution Hill would have set off at short odds here, even with two up-and-coming, unbeaten rivals lined up against him, but the memory of his listless run at Punchestown in May is difficult to shake off and Willie Mullins’sAnzadam,at around 9-4, looks the value bet in a high-class field. He has something to find with The New Lion on his bare form to date but is just two runs into his career with Mullins, and had plenty in hand when successful in a Grade Three at Naas in January, a race that was run in a strong time for the conditions.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowBangor-On-Dee11.00 Daylatedollarshort 11.30 Idaho Sun 12.02 Regal Renaissance 12.37 Laganhill 1.12 Kahavari 1.47 Bridget MaryNewcastle11.42 Gaelic Rover 12.15 Grand Geste 12.50 Just Golden 1.25 The Big Breac 2.00 Anzadam 2.35 Brace For Landing 3.15 Jasmin De GrugyDoncaster11.48 Storming George 12.22 Hecouldbetheone 12.57 Madame Luna 1.32 Kalium 2.07 Fierce Warrior 2.42 Charging Thunder 3.22 AshburtonNewbury11.55 Whimsy 12.30 Hunter Legend 1.05 Kalkbrenner 1.40 Dominic’s Fault 2.15 Indemnity 2.55 Blizzard Of Oz (nb) 3.35 Rath Gaul Hill (nap)Wolverhampton4.30 Fortification 5.00 Phantom Watch 5.30 Queen Sana 6.00 Mersea Island 6.30 Sovereign Class 7.00 Carolus Magnus 7.30 Liberty Bird 8.00 Hint Of Humour 8.30 So AlexWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Newbury 2.15Emma Lavelle’sIndemnityran a fine race to finish second behind the fast-improving Alexei at Ascot earlier this month, having looked the likeliest winner two out, and is just 1lb higher in the weights here.Newcastle 3.15Anthony Honeyball’s stable has started the season in excellent form andJasmin De Grugy,who progressed by the run last season, can add another useful prize to his haul.Newbury 3.35The strong-travellingRath Gaul Hillcould find the race run to suit and though he has not been out since Aintree in April, he was a winner over track and trip after an extended break last season.Explore more on these topicsConstitution HillTalking HorsesHorse racingHorse racing tipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That kind of talk is becoming alarmingly mainstream on the Maga rightFri 28 Nov 2025 12.46 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 13.39 ESTShareNigel Farage could have strangled this story at birth. Confronted with the testimony ofmore than 20 former schoolmates, who shared with the Guardian their memories of a young Farage taunting Jews and other minorities in the most appalling terms – telling a Jewish pupil that “Hitler was right”, singing “Gas ’em all” and making a hissing sound to simulate lethal gas – he could have said: “I have no memory of what’s been described, but such behaviour would of course have been atrocious and if I was involved in any way, I am genuinely sorry.”Sure, it would have been more of an “ifpology” than an apology, its admission of guilt wholly conditional, but it would surely have closed the story down. Reassured that the Reform UK leader had declared racist and antisemitic abuse unacceptable, most observers would have allowed that these events took place half a century ago and moved on.But that is not what Farage did. Instead, he and his partyhave offered shifting accounts, moving from outright denial to non-denial denial and back again. That slipperiness itself raises questions about the character of the man who, according to the polls, is on course to be Britain’s next prime minister. But this episode also points to a larger and more alarming phenomenon, one that stretches far beyond these shores.Farage’s defence rests on three pillars, each one of which is shaky. The first response has been to say the accusations are all untrue or, to put it another way, that his accusers are liars. As at least one of them has pointed out, that is itself an antisemitic trope: that Jews lie about their own suffering in pursuit of some devious, unstated end.The second line of defence insists that Farage never did these things but, if he did, it would be irrelevant because he was only a child at the time. I’ve spoken to several Jewish community officials who say this is among the reasons why, so far, they have been reluctant to join the chorus of condemnation. True, the argument is undermined somewhat by the fact that Farage’s alleged conduct spanned a six-year period, right until he was a sixth former, aged 18, but it might just hold up – were it not for a flaw in Farage’s third defence.This argues that the accusations against him lack force because they have no bearing on his politics today; that whatever the ex-pupils of Dulwich college might say about the boy of the 1970s and 1980s, the man of 2025 cannot be accused of antisemitism. Here the facts get a bit more awkward.Don’t believe Nigel Farage’s denials. He targeted me for being Jewish – and it hurt | Peter EttedguiRead moreConsider one of Farage’s comments this week, in a broadcast interview where he gave that non-denial denial. “Have I said things 50 years ago that you could interpret as being banter in a playground, you could interpret in a modern light today in some sort of way? Yes.” Perhaps Farage was admitting there to less than his accusers recall, but it sounded as if he was suggesting that songs about gassing Jews, Asians and Black people amount to no more than “banter”. That’s not schoolboy Farage talking, but the Farage of 2025.And that is far from the only mark against the fully adult politician. In 2017, the Board of Deputies of British Jewssaid he had“crossed the line into well-known antisemitic tropes”, after he had nodded along while a caller to his LBC show claimed that Israel had both the Republican and Democratic parties “in their pockets”. Farage replied: “In terms of money and influence they are a very powerful lobby”, explaining that “there are about six million Jewish people living in America, so as a percentage it’s quite small, but in terms of influence it’s quite big”.Three years later, the Board of Deputies again denounced the then Brexit party leader for trading “in dog whistles and tropes”, after he had repeatedly deployed words and motifs that are staples of far-right antisemitic conspiracy theory.In that period, Farage was ticking off almost every item on the trope bingo card, railing against “globalists”, “cultural Marxists”, Goldman Sachs and George Soros, the latter a perennial hate figure to those who allege a secret Jewish plot to undermine nation states in pursuit of global government. In a 2020article for Newsweek, Farage aimed his fire at “unelected globalists shaping the public’s lives based on secret recommendations from the big banks”.The Community Security Trust, or CST, the organisation that monitors and combats antisemitism in the UK, lambasted Farage at the time for using “language that evokes antisemitic conspiracy codewords”, warning that “this search for scapegoats will keep requiring new enemies and new excuses, moving the national debate into more polarising and dangerous places”.There was particular disquiet at thecompany Farage was keeping, cheerfully sitting alongside the notorious Alex Jones of Infowars, for example, as the pair played some of the greatest hits of antisemitic conspiracy theory, from the Bilderberg group to “new world order”. Farage was no less happy to be interviewedat least six times by Rick Wiles, a far-right US pastor who would later brand the impeachment of Donald Trump a “Jew coup”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Talk to the CST today and it is clear that the most urgent, direct threat to Jewish safety is violent jihadism, of the kind that saw Jihad al-Shamie launch adeadly attack on Heaton Park synagoguein Manchester last month. But what it sees as a growing long-term danger is a shift nowunder way on the US right.The fear, asCST policy director Dave Richputs it, is that “Nick Fuentes becomes the face of the Republican movement” – Fuentes being theunabashed white supremacistand Holocaust denier who oncedined with Trump at Mar-a-Lagoand who, some warn, is poised to replace Charlie Kirk as the darling of the next Republican generation.Dispensing with the previous posture in which rightwing politicians deflected accusations of antisemitism by boasting of their pro-Israel credentials – even if their support for Israel amounted to no more than taking sides in what they saw as a battle of the west against Islam – Fuentes, Tucker Carlson and others are moving into a new place. No longer speaking of “Judeo-Christian values”, but espousing instead an aggressive Christian nationalism, they are increasingly hostile to Israel and Zionism, and seemingly motivated not by sympathy for the Palestinians, but rather by an updated version of the 1930s, America First view that suspected a Jewish plot to drag America to war. Given the global might of the US, such a change to the American right would have a profound effect on Jews the world over.All of which is a long way from the playground of Dulwich college.

Keir Starmer, a methodical person as well as a former director of public prosecutions, is so keen on orderliness that in 2022 his close colleague Lisa Nandy called him “Mr Rules”.There are things to be said for this approach. Many voters have been saying for at least a decade that they want politicians to exert more control over Britain’s erratic trajectory. Meanwhile the recentcatastrophic administrationof Boris Johnson, with its vast carelessness about Covid deaths, Brexit and immigration, still looms over our politics as a demonstration of what happens when governments have little interest in rules. As tech oligarchs, bond traders, international criminals, and digital and physical viruses increasingly prey on vulnerable people, it can be argued that a libertarian or fiscally loose government is a luxury most Britons can’t afford.And yet, so far, Labour’s politics of rules isn’t working. Last week’s immigration announcements, which “will make Britain’s settlement system by far the most controlled and selective in Europe”, according to the home secretary,Shabana Mahmood– rapidly becoming an even more severe figure than Starmer – have not lifted Labour’s dire poll ratings. This week’stax-raising budget, which prioritised reassuring the bond markets that the government will keep to its “iron-clad” fiscal rules, also feels unlikely to dramatically improve Labour’s standing – despite the inclusion of some redistributive measures, such as a mansion tax, which may match many voters’ anti-elite mood. Although much of the financial establishment, media and electorate believe that Britain is in an economic and social crisis, the more Starmer and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, offer to restore order, the more the public seem to dislike them.Why are Mr Rules and Labour’s sober remedies so widely rejected? His and Reeves’s limits as communicators have clearly played a part. So have the damagingly regular occasions when ministers have failed to behave with rectitude themselves. Although this government’s scandals have been far smaller than those of its Tory predecessors – Angela Raynerunderpaying stamp dutyhardly compares to neglecting to properly organise the evacuation of Afghanistan – they have enabled Labour’s enemies to deploy a favourite and effective weapon: the claim that anyone at all leftwing is a hypocrite at heart. Rather than really considering Starmer’s programme, many voters have thus been able to stay in an almost nihilistic comfort zone, believing his government is no better than Johnson’s.There are also deeper reasons for the failure of Starmer’s emphasis on rule-making. The capacity of the British state to enforce ever more rules – for example, checking that millions of immigrants who want to be Britons have been model residents – has almost certainly been diminished by Tory austerity. Not recognising this is one of the many ways in whichLabourappears to have underprepared for power.Even if the state’s ability to manage much of society can eventually be restored – and even if you think such a situation would be desirable – by then many voters may have moved on in terms of how they conceive of the government being in control. EU membership used to be the supposed source of our national instability; now it’s our porous borders (even though immigration is actuallyfalling fast); next year, it might be multiculturalism – already a target for rising hard men of the right such as Robert Jenrick andMatthew Goodwin– or the crime rate, already being talked up by Nigel Farage.The claim that this country is in chaos is one that rightwing journalists and politicians have a vested interest in making, particularly during a Labour government, as it enables them to scapegoat groups they don’t like and demand authoritarian solutions. In this context, voter anxiety is constantly shape-shifting, and hard for even a competent, well-resourced government to address for long. During the calmest, most popular years of Tony Blair’s premiership – which seem another world now – plenty of Britons still believed that his government needed to “get a grip”, as focus groups regularly told Blair’s pessimistic public opinion guru, Philip Gould.Even more challengingly for Starmer, while many voters say they want a government in control, they are often drawn to politicians promising something else: risk, radical change or simply entertainment. Over the past decade, Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Farage and Zack Polanski have all enjoyed surges of support. Sterner, more orthodox party leaders such as Starmer, Rishi Sunak and Theresa May have often left voters cold.“In the Britain we make, we will all play by the rules,” Starmer pledged in 2022. But the disruption of politics and everyday life by digital technology, the addictive rebelliousness of populism, and the widespread, justified conviction that conventional politics is exhausted and insufficient for today’s huge crises all mean that making Britain orderly again is an old-fashioned, perhaps impossible goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More like Operation Save Our Skins | Aditya ChakraborttyRead moreIf Labour’s mood and popularity don’t improve soon, the party may decide to pursue a different project under a different leader. Under the ideologically flexible Andy Burnham, or the combative Rayner, or even Wes Streeting – currently trying to shed his reputation as a rigid Labour rightwinger – the government could conceivablyreinvent itselfas a less rule-fixated, more nimble administration that better fits the times. In Spain, the centre-left premier Pedro Sánchez has won three elections in a row, despite a rightwing populist upsurge, partly by presenting immigration and liberal social change as opportunities rather than threats, and partly by taboo-breaking parliamentary moves, including coalitions with the radical left.However, given the long history of Labour prioritising respectability, especially when in trouble, it’s just as likely that the government will become even more fixated on control under Mahmood or another disciplinarian. Labour has always been a complicated party, with both authoritarian and libertarian traditions, but both inside and outside Labour the severe approach is often seen as the realistic one – even when it’s clearly not working well.Labour governments, assuming that there are further ones, will always need to impose some new rules – to prevent this country lapsing back into ancient hierarchies or lurching forward into even worse forms of inequality. But if Labour is going to inspire voters again, rules are not enough.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

They survive only in some English-speaking countries as quaint relics of medieval jurisprudence. They deserve dispatch to the world of ducking, flogging, drawing and quartering.As it is, criminal courts have built up ahopeless backlogin England and Wales of almost 80,000 cases, with some hearings postponed to 2029. A surge in rape cases has led to a two-year delay, withtwice the number of complainantswithdrawing as five years ago. Britain’s prison population threatens to break the 100,000 barrier, or twice its size in the 1990s. These are not just convicts. A fifth of cells contain remand prisoners spending months awaiting trial. This is a parody of justice.Jury trials are flawed and unwieldy – but vital for justice being seen to be done | Gaby HinsliffRead moreThe justice secretary, David Lammy, knows it cannot go on. He proposes that juries be confined to extreme crimes, such as rape, manslaughter and murder, with the rest defaulting to a single judge. This year, the Leveson review of the criminal courts warned of a “total system collapse”. Brian Leveson, a former judge, proposed most trials go before a judge with two magistrates in attendance. In the jury-loving US, a similar crisis has led to 98% of criminal cases now beingsettled informally, in out-of-court negotiations with prosecutors. This ishardly justice seen to be done.Almost no other European country uses juries, except sometimes in exceptional cases. Most use judges and examining magistrates. They treat trials as matters of possibly contested evidence, most often a matter for scientific expertise and discussion. Dramatised rituals are the preserve of Britain’s justice system.British juries have already been abandoned for civil trials – curiously so, as in matters of libel public opinion could be of some relevance. They have also been discontinued for financial trials, which frequently went far over the heads of “12 good citizens and true”. Meanwhile, most people seem unaware that the overwhelming majority of criminal cases are conducted in magistrates courts, already without juries. Even among cases that go to crown courts, only one in five are now decided byjuries. Yet they occupy a ludicrous amount of time and bureaucracy.I have done jury service on three occasions and have never seen such a waste of time and money. What should take two or three hours would take two or three days. Two of our cases involved nothing more serious than grievous bodily harm, and one was a fraud that few of us understood. None needed a jury. All we knew was that a guilty verdict leading to a jail sentence would be grotesque. Going to prison is not a matter of months. For most people, its consequence is a sentence for life.In the courts, we heard arguments of extreme guilt against extreme innocence. There was little discussion of mitigation, previous records or background circumstances.Barristersoften seemed ill-briefed, while solicitors sat silent, sometimes with their heads in their hands. This division of Britain’s legal profession between solicitors and barristers is as costly and archaic as are juries.The only people who love juries are barristers, fiercely defending them in the media. This is understandable, as juries are their audience and their bread and butter. Many crooks also like them because they believe juries are lenient, and it may be that in some cases a jury is more lenient than a judge. When I was recently prosecuted for driving too often over 20mph, I would love to have pleaded my case before a jury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England and Wales imprisons 145 of its citizens for every 100,000. Jury-free Germany imprisons 71, the Netherlands and Norway just 54. I do not believe that Britons are twice as criminal as Germans, or three times as Dutch or Norwegians. The jury-loving USimprisons 541.British crime and punishment is prison-obsessed. Not a week passes without some MP demanding long sentences for everyone from hate speakers to water board chairs. Jurisprudence is stuck in a rut and hostile to new ideas. Crime is seen not as a societal disease, requiring professional analysis and cure. There seems no scope for restorative justice or the role of rehabilitation in sentencing, as there is in Scandinavia. Discussion is over retribution and deterrence – a deterrence that is patently ineffective in areas such as cybercrime and sexual violence.The legal profession is lobbying frantically to keep its place on stage. It accuses opponents of wanting “to go back to the star chamber”. Anyone who says that should be compelled to spend a week studying justice in Norway – and join the 21st century.

Everyone knows that the courts are in crisis, that we can’t go on like this. Traumatised victims can’t keep being told that the earliest available date for a trial is 2029,so they’re either going to have to live with it hanging over them for another four years or drop out. (And nor can defendants put their lives endlessly on hold, worrying that witnesses’ memories will only fade with time.) Something obviously needs to change. But the idea that the only solution is toscrap jury trialsin all but the most serious cases of rape, murder and other offences with sentences longer than five years – as a leaked letter from the justice secretary, David Lammy, suggests – should ring alarm bells nonetheless.Anyone who has sat in a courtroom for long enough, never mind on a jury, will know that it isn’t exactly 12 Angry Men out there. Members of the public obliged to dispense amateur justice have the same flaws, limitations and tendency to fall asleep in the boring bits – or, as onone memorable occasionat the Old Bailey, repeatedly ask if the hot witness is single – as the rest of us, and unlike judges they aren’t obliged to give their reasons for sometimes baffling decisions. Juries are notoriously resistant to convicting in all but the most straightforward rape trials, andexpert doubtsraised over Lucy Letby’s murder conviction make a strong case for removing them from cases with very complex medical evidence. All that said, however, they’re absolutely vital to justice being seen to be done.David Lammy is right to slash the use of juries – it’s an open-and-shut case | Simon JenkinsRead morePublic confidence in institutions depends, as the prime minister’s one-time legal mentor Lady Helena Kennedy KCput it this week, on public involvement in an establishment that can otherwise appear remote. Jury service is the only chance most people ever get to see the legal sausage getting made, and while the results aren’t always edifying, being excluded from the process seems even less likely to inspire confidence. Meanwhile for defendants and their families, the right to be judged by one’s peers – including people more closely resembling the person in the dock than the one in the wig – matters.Even with an increasingly diverse judiciary, juries are seen as a safeguard against racism, as Lammy himself used to argue before getting this job: 12 people riddled with competing biases may paradoxically have a better chance of collectively cancelling out each other’s assumptions and blind spots than one however highly trained to be impartial.And at the risk of sounding faintly paranoid, juries represent a safeguard against the politicisation of the courts that is not to be taken lightly in the current climate. Judges are appointed – a process much more easily hijacked by future governments of malign intent than the act of picking random names from a phone book.Perhaps it would be worth overriding all those fears if juries were the main cause of gridlock. But when only a tiny1% of criminal casesin England and Wales actually end up in front of one, at best this feels like a cover for the real problem: public reluctance to pay for the services we want.As with NHS waiting lists and asylum seekers cooped up for years in hotels, the judicial backlog is the legacy of previous governments’ spending choices, for which this one is getting unfairly blamed. The system has gummed up thanks to the chronic underfunding of not just the courts but of other public services on which they depend. Long delays getting mobile phone data analysed or obtaining reports from probation officers and social workers before sentencing all add up, and so does the time wasted by defendants who don’t qualify for legal aid attempting to use ChatGPT toconduct their own defence.The untold side of the story meanwhile is the growing complexity of the law – usually as a result of parliament satisfying public demands for “something to be done” – and more proactive policing of complex historical sexual abuse and exploitation, otherwise known as police and prosecutors doing exactly what society is asking of them, but without the funding to see it through.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(Scrapping jury trialsdoesn’t save much money, but Leveson calculates it would free up 20% of court sitting time, allowing more cases to be heard within existing budgets.) It’s the same gamble underpinningRachel Reeves’s budgetthis week – the hope that something will turn up before 2029, allowing harder choices to be avoided – with all the same potential risks and rewards.Justice delayed is, as the saying goes, justice denied.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, spoke of “substantial progress” after Ukraine-US talks in Geneva. On Monday night, Vladimir Putin made his countermove:another massive barrageof missile and drone strikes on Kyiv.The sequence of contrasting events captured the grim essence of the outgoing year. By day, diplomatic battles are fought: hopeful statements are issued from Washington, London, Brussels and Kyiv. Immense energy is expended on containing Donald Trump’s initiatives. By night, Putin brutally reminds the world that, for him, war remains the primary tool for achieving “peace”.As Russia’s attack unfolded into the early hours of Tuesday, the immediate reality of Ukraine’s vulnerability was laid bare.Ukraineis able to track missile launches from Russian territory, a capability afforded by timely US intelligence. Outside my window, two Ukrainian air force fighter jets, which had been scrambled to intercept incoming cruise missiles, roared overhead – American F-16s, supplied to Ukraine by one of its European allies.Moments later, Kyiv’s air-defence systems thundered: two sharp launches fired to intercept a Russian ballistic missile. This was a Patriot system at work, most likely delivered by the US or Germany. Every launch jolts you unexpectedly, shaking the windows. The instant of fear quickly gives way to grim resignation: perhaps the incoming missile won’t strike its target this time, sparing the city from devastation and another blackout.Soon after, a heavy machine gun opened up on a drone somewhere nearby, part of a mobile-fire group – almost certainly a US-madeBrowning. Unfortunately, the bullets missed the Iranian-made Shahed drone – it pressed on overhead, toward its destination.With pauses, this continued until dawn. Kyiv awoke to the morning news: seven people killed, destruction and heating outages in many homes as a result of the night’s assault. As always, everyone still went about their day – living the war. But those 24 hours encapsulated Ukraine’s critical military reliance on the US – a dependence thatEuropeis demonstrably unable to fill in the short term.The28-point planfrom Washington sparked intense emotion, debate and deep concern – and temporarily diverted attention from Ukraine’s largestcorruption scandalin years. Yet, we have seen this script before, afterthat disastrous meetingbetween Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in February, and after theAlaska summitin August.Every new initiative from Washington unfolds according to the same pattern: a diplomatic cavalry charge against Ukraine, which Kyiv, with other European capitals, manages to fend off. They stabilise the situation but never actually win the battle. This pattern will, no doubt, persist.It is tempting to accuse Trump of consistently pushing Russia’s terms. But that does not seem to be the whole story. Washington operates on a premise well known to American diplomats: you cannot win at the negotiating table what you have lost on the battlefield. The White House presumes that it is impossible to force Russia to relinquish the territory that it already controls in Ukraine’s south or east.The problem is that while recognising this factual reality, Washington does nothing to deter Moscow, through words or deeds, from thinking that the situation will shift further in its favour in the coming year.Therefore, Putin is convinced that time is on his side – that Ukraine and its partners are approaching exhaustion. His motivation to sign a deal that does not give him the maximum possible gain is close to zero. There may be many attempts to end hostilities, but they will continue as long as Russia’s leader remains supremely confident in the outcome.On the contrary, Zelenskyy believes that Ukraine can still hold out, slowly losing people and territory but avoiding a total frontline collapse until circumstances change in its favour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, subjective factors are entering the equation: Trump’s desire to broker a ceasefire andpave his wayto a Nobel peace prize, and Zelenskyy’s twin challenges – on one hand, not to alienate a key ally, and on the other, to rally Ukrainians around the flag against any US initiative Kyiv finds unacceptable, so that their focus does not switch to domestic problems. And although his task will now be much harder after anti-corruption authoritiessearched the homeof his most trusted confidant, Andriy Yermak, it remains highly unlikely that this will change his overall approach.These two forces are driving the talks.It took a mere seven days to killthe 28 pointsof the latest plan. Aggressive and erratic handling of the matter by Washington, pushback by Ukraine and the rest of Europe, along with the soothing efforts of Rubio, and finally,the leaks about Witkoff, all did their job.While new plans based on old ideas are imminent, Kyiv, London and other European capitals should draw one fundamental conclusion: Ukraine and Europe will only be able to fend off diplomatic offensives from Washington that are based on Russian demands and reflect Trump’s reluctance to change the course of events, if they stand together and strengthen their defence capabilities at a much faster pace. If they do, neither Trump nor Putin will be able to break them. In the meantime, Ukraine’s ability to repel nightly air assaults will, for the foreseeable future, largely rely on the US.Dmytro Kuleba was Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs from 2020 to 2024Explore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpMarco RubioEuropeEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

OK. I have an idea. Why don’t we NOT search for anything called “the German hairy snail”? In fact, I have an even better idea – why don’t we not search for any kind of “hairy snail”. I would go even further and suggest not searching for anything “hairy” at all because that is second only to “mucus” in the list of world’s worst words. But I will settle for not searching for the thing that unassailably evokes the two in grotesque combination.Except, it turns out – the German hairy snail (hereafter known as the GHS because, honestly, with the best will in the world, I simply CANNOT) is only hairy on its shell and, most crucially, is only the size of a fingernail. And it has apparently been here since Neolithic times – though surviving now only in tiny patches along the Thames, which back in the stone age used to connect to the Rhine. In Germany, do you see? Also, there exists something called the Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland, which is supporting the survey, and I didn’t know the word “conchological” before. All these deeply pleasing new pieces of information change everything and I am now heading for the mudbanks of the Thames with a will. The more you know, the less you fear! There’s almost a lesson in that somewhere. Truly, even the hairiest molluscs have much to teach us.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump: ‘You know, turkeys voting for Christmas is kinda the secret of my success. Beautiful.’Photograph: Newscom/Alamy Live NewsTuesdayA young person with whom I, despite the best efforts of both of us, have pretty much daily contact, has introduced me to the phrase “posting zero”. It is the practice of turning away from social media – usually because you are tired of the meaningless mixture of influencers, AI-generated content and advertisements it has become. This, it seems, is a growing trend. The brief promise it held of creating communities, sharing interests and oh, I don’t know, making life a bit more cheerful and interesting has turned out to be a pretty empty one.In short, we may be returning to real life. Life as it was lived pre-2000 or so, amongst real people, with real-time conversational exchange, the reading of body language and intonation, the gleaning of detail, the understanding of nuance. Imagine. Imagine. Or, for anyone over 25 – remember? Remember?WednesdayA friend of mine has long maintained that the only way to preserve good mental health and happiness is never to look at yourself from behind. We have evolved, she reckons, to cope only with seeing what the waters of a gently rippling pond or, at a stretch, a polished metal goblet or other sturdy drinking vessel can show us. Humans are not meant to see themselves with either piercing clarity nor in, as it were, the round. This is a very good rule.Or it was until today, when scientists revealed that the state of the human bum is, alas, a useful guide to the future health of the human to which it is attached. Specifically, changes to your glutei maximi can warn of the approach of type 2 diabetes. In men, the muscles get thinner, in women fat infiltrates the muscles making them look larger, because of course it does.My friend is sticking to her rule, reckoning that the misery caused by constant viewing to check on the state of matters posterior would outweigh any possible advantages. I’m pretty sure that after 20 years of just sitting here typing I don’t have any glutei maximi left, so I cannot advise further. I’m butting out here, you might say.ThursdayTo everything there is an equal and opposite reaction, they say. So I suppose the fact that it is the joyous day of Thanksgiving across the pond that has induced the exact opposite in my life today. Viz to wit: the cat – the good one. Not even the bad one – has what I can only describe as the bloody flux and the vet says it will cost at least £600 to discover why; the wardrobe I have at last assembled from Argos has two sets of lefthand drawers and no righthand drawers. My husband thinks this can be sorted with a five-minute phone call. I know it will take the rest of my life; HMRC has lost all record – all record – of an application for repayment of tax I made in July. “Here is the reference number,” I say. “No,” they say. “I hope Argos does better than this,” I say. “We doubt it,” they reply. And I still haven’t found any tiny hairy snails.View image in fullscreenWoman to Rachel Reeves: ‘And so, in a few weeks, this is where you’ll start. Manager? Yes ... it’s possible.

The weekend is almost upon us and, as the final one in November, we can now officially look forward to the festive season. Or, depending on how the budget has worked out for you, cancel it entirely.I enjoy these early days. I like to grab a cup of warm cider and settle down with as many gift guides as I can and enjoy the rage they fuel among people who have misunderstood what many might feel was the fairly simple concept of gift guides entirely. I am particularly fond of people who look at a list headed, say, “Stocking stuffers for under £50” and respond by commenting on how £50 is a ridiculous amount of money to be spending on a stocking stuffer. They are closely followed in my pantheon of greats by those who see something like “25 affordable luxuries for loved ones” and can only type “Affordable BY WHOM?!?!” before falling to the ground in a paroxysm of ill-founded self-righteousness.

Well, not from where I’m standingFri 28 Nov 2025 10.06 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 13.22 ESTShareCrisis? What crisis?British Theatre Before and After Covid, a report released this week, is like a comedy-tragedy mask rendered in academic form. If you look at it one way, you see smiles. Look at it another, you see only things to cry about. The media coverage of the report, by the British Theatre Consortium, focused on the latter, with industry bible the Stage reporting: “‘Sharp decline’ in new plays since Covid.” Between 2019 and 2023, the number of new plays produced dropped by almost 30%. If vindication was needed for much recent angsting about the condition of new writing in UK theatre, this report seems to provide it.So is playwriting in crisis? I’m in a decent position to comment, at least insofar as that question applies in Scotland. I run A Play, a Pie and a Pint (PPP), the Glasgow theatre institution producing more new plays than any other theatre in … Europe? The world? The known universe? (We wait in vain for someone to tell us we’ve been trumped.) Based on our experience – fielding hundreds of scripts a year, producing and touring new plays every week, year-round – there is plenty to be concerned about. But there are also reasons for optimism, some evidenced by the report, which was written by director Dan Rebellato and playwright David Edgar.A healthy culture is one that doesn’t just regurgitate old stories, but tells itself new ones – lots of themThe undeniable bad news is the steep drop in the number of new plays being produced (proportionally higher than the overall decline in theatre production). That corroborates a widespread grassroots sense that opportunities are diminishing for playwrights to get their work staged, and chances shrinking that one might ever make a living as a playwright alone. The report also documents the closure of many smaller theatre spaces, where new plays used to be offered a soft landing. At PPP, we are inundated with plays, and the frustration – particularly among the younger generation – is palpable that beyond Òran Mór, where our work is presented, options for new writers to be staged, or playwrights to develop their craft, are sparse.Why then this tailing off of new play production? It seems likely to be commercial conservatism post-Covid – that notorious idea that audiences are scared of new drama. And here’s where Rebellato and Edgar get more interesting, and substantiate what my daily experience lays bare. Because while there are fewer new plays, “[the] new plays that did get on had longer runs, bigger audiences in bigger houses, and attracted bigger box office income than in 2019”.View image in fullscreenNo fear of novelty … Dancing Shoes at Òran Mór, Glasgow.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanMore and more people are coming to see new plays. And if we widen our lens to consider new work (including new musicals, devised shows, and original Christmas shows), we see that audiences certainly do not fear novelty. As the report states, new-work attendance accounted for just over 40% of all productions in 2023 – an increase of almost 50% compared to 2019.Isn’t the story then that the demand for new work is soaring – if only we could get it to market? To see the production of new plays slump over that 2019-23 period isn’t just shameful, it’s shortsighted. A healthy culture is one that doesn’t just regurgitate old stories, but tells itself new ones, lots of them – and makes space for new storytellers too. But as this report demonstrates, we shouldn’t be staging new plays for some abstract common good – we should (contrary to received wisdom) be doing it for our bottom lines, too.If you’re a theatre producer heaving yet another Arthur snore Miller or Anton zzzzz Chekhov (just kidding!) on to the stage, because that’s all your audience will accept – well, you’re not doing your job properly. Where is the buzz in theatre? What gets audiences out of their seats? This season, it’s Sophia Chetin-Leuner’sPorn Playat the Royal Court, or Uma Nada-Rajah’s NHS fantasiaBlack Hole Sign, or James Graham’s smash hitPunchon the West End. Or (dare I say) Éimi Quinn’s Hauns Aff Ma Haunted Bin! at PPP – by some measures the biggest-selling show in our 21-year history – orDancing Shoesby Stephen Christopher and Graeme Smith, a feelgood hit so adored by our audiences in the spring it’s being revived for Christmas at the Traverse.At PPP, we stage only world premieres – no old plays allowed – and we get audiences of 150-200 pretty much every lunchtime, six days a week. They come as a habit, for the pies and the craic as well as the plays. And so for thousands of people in the West End of Glasgow, watching new plays is a cheerful part of their everyday life – like reading a book, or switching on the radio, or going to a food market.Cheer is a part of it. Note that the BritishTheatreConsortium classified all new plays as “drama” – overlooking that some may be comedies. (And don’t get me started on classifying Scotland as a “region”). Maybe if we stopped talking about new plays as if they were a penance, the wholefood of the entertainment world, we might attract more people to engage with them. But – judging by these latest findings, and all those millions of people happily flocking to new plays – we’re doing an OK job of that already.Now we just need bolder programming, more confident promotion, and more – lots more – opportunities for writers to present their work on stages big and small, commercial and subsidised, London and beyond. Give them those opportunities and the audiences will follow. The data doesn’t lie!Dancing Shoes is at the Traverse theatre, Edinburgh, 4 to 20 December.Explore more on these topicsTheatreOpinionComedycommentShareReuse this content"

Equipping Kyiv with the resources to fight on is the quickest route to a just settlementFri 28 Nov 2025 13.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 14.11 ESTShareAs Donald Trump’s Thanksgiving Day deadline for a Ukraine peace agreement came and went this week, the Russia expert Mark Galeottipointedto a telling indicator of how the Kremlin is treating the latest flurry of White House diplomacy. In the government paper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a foreign policy scholar close to Vladimir Putin’s regime bluntly observed: “As long as hostilities continue, leverage remains. As soon as they cease, Russia finds itself alone (we harbour no illusions) in the face of coordinated political and diplomatic pressure.”Mr Putin has no interest in a ceasefire followed by talks where Ukraine’s rights as a sovereign nation would be defended and reasserted. He seeks the capitulation and reabsorption of Russia’s neighbour into Moscow’s orbit. Whether that is achieved through battlefield attrition, or through a Trump-backed deal imposed on Ukraine, is a matter of relative indifference. On Thursday, the Russian presidentreiteratedhis demand that Ukraine surrender further territory in its east, adding that the alternative would be to lose it through “force of arms”. Once again, he described Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government as “illegitimate”, and questioned the legally binding nature of any future agreement.The simultaneous assertion that a peace plan discussed by the US and Ukraine this week could “be the basis for future agreements” is therefore as bogus as Mr Putin’s empty praise for Mr Trump’s previous diplomatic efforts. The plan – which emerged as a counter to White Houseproposalseffectively copied and pasted from a Kremlin wishlist – reportedly calls for an end to the fighting as a precondition for talks over territory. This is precisely the route that the Kremlin remains determined to resist. News that Mr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has resigned after being placed underinvestigationby anti-corruption authorities – a damaging development that could scarcely come at a worse moment for Ukraine’s president – makes it still less likely that Mr Putin will be persuaded to make concessions he has never before contemplated.Mr Trump is being strung along again. But the clear and present danger is that a combination of “peacemaker-in-chief” presidential vanity, a desire to do business with Russia and Mr Zelenskyy’s sudden political vulnerability will tempt him to do Mr Putin’s dirty work for him. After four years of resistance, sacrifice and suffering, Ukraine must not be bullied into a cynical carve-up, which would leave it permanently vulnerable to Russia’s aggression, jeopardise Europe’s future security and inspire authoritarian regimes worldwide.Responsibility for ensuring this does not happen lies with Europe. Though Russian forces continue to make small, incremental gains in Ukraine’s east, their advance is painfully slow and at enormouscost. By signalling a commitment to provide Kyiv with sufficient financial and military resources to resist in the medium term, European leaders can begin to alter the dynamic of negotiations in the present.Whether such aid is to come through a “reparations loan”underwrittenby frozen Russian assets, from the EU budget, or via common borrowing by member states, must be resolved quickly after months of delay. A signal needs to be sent to both Mr Putin and Mr Trump that Europe will resolutely defend Ukraine’s right to a just peace. As the Kremlin seeks leverage via the killing fields of eastern Ukraine and within the corridors of the White House, Mr Zelenskyy must urgently be given some of his own.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The climate emergency gives new urgency to their workFri 28 Nov 2025 13.25 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 14.11 ESTShareJMW Turner appears on £20 notes and gives his name to Britain’s most avant garde contemporary art prize. John Constable’s work adorns countless mugs and jigsaws. Both are emblematic English artists, but in the popular imagination, Turner is perceived as daring and dazzling, Constable as nice but a little bit dull. In a Radio 4pollto find the nation’s favourite painting, Turner’sThe Fighting Temeraire– which even features in the James Bond filmSkyfall– won. Constable’sThe Hay Waincame second. Born only a year later, Constable was always playing catch-up: Turner became a member of the Royal Academy at 27, while Constable had to wait until he was 52.To mark the 250th anniversary of their births, Tate Britain is putting on the first majorexhibitionto display the two titans head to head. Shakespeare and Marlowe, Mozart and Salieri, Van Gogh and Gauguin – creative rivalries are the stuff of biopics. Mike Leigh’s 2014filmshows Turner (Timothy Spall) adding a touch of red to his seascape Helvoetsluys to upstage Constable’s The Opening of Waterloo Bridge at theRoyal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1832. Critics delighted in dubbing them“Fire and Water”. The enthralling new Tate show is billed as a battle of rivals, but it also tells another story. Constable’s paintings might not have the exciting steam trains, boats and burning Houses of Parliament of Turner’s, but they were radical too.Painting mill workers and bargemen was groundbreaking at a time when grandiose classical themes – favoured by Turner – were de rigueur. Like Jane Austen (whose 250th anniversary wascelebratedthis year), Constable is often accused of ignoring the external world and harsh realities of 18th-century rural life. But his bucolic scenes redefined what a painting could be. Echoing Wordsworth’s Romantic manifesto in the Lyrical Ballads (1800) that poets should take “incidents and situations from common life”, Constablewrotein 1832 that his art “is to be found under every hedge, and in every lane, and therefore nobody thinks it worth picking up”.Today, Constable’s spirit can be found in the council estates and abandoned garages of the Coventry artistGeorge Shaw, as well as the hedges and lanes ofDavid Hockney’s latepaintings of his beloved Yorkshire Wolds. Every age has found new meanings and inspiration in Constable and Turner. They can still cause a stir. Turner’s abolitionist1840 Slave Ship– believed to have been inspired by theZong massacre, in which more than 130 enslaved people were thrown overboard by the British captain for the insurance money – has been reworked by the poetDavid Dabydeenand the installation artistSondra Perryto give a black perspective. In 1980, Constable was weaponised inPeter Kennard’s Haywain with Cruise Missilesas a protest against US nuclear weapons being based in the English countryside – a cold-war riposte to the biscuit-tin nostalgia.The climate emergency gives a renewed urgency to their work. Their influence can be seen in the cracking icebergs and crumbling coastlines ofEmma Stibbon’spaintings and the elemental installations ofOlafur Eliasson. A terrible storm at sea or dark clouds over Salisbury Cathedral – Turner and Constable captured not just moments in time but the spirit of their age. In recording technological innovation, political upheaval, inequality, the shadows of war, and a rapidly changing natural environment, the work of both artists resonates with our own era. Displaying them side by side encourages us to see such familiar paintings in a whole new light.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This demonstrates that growing numbers of Jews are deserting the Labour and Conservative parties in favour of the Green party and Reform UK.As JPR points out, there is no symmetry here. The turn to Reform among Jewish voters is half the size of the growth in support for the party within the population as a whole. On the other hand, support for Greens among Jews is 900% the size of the turn to theGreen partyoverall.In this context, we question the characterisation of support for Greens among Jewish people as “paradoxical”. According to the report, “domestic priorities and progressive values outweigh foreign policy concerns that touch directly on Israeli governmental and military behaviour”. Yet as JPR itself demonstrates, the Green surge is a phenomenon of younger Jews (19% of 30-49-year-olds; 22% of 16-29-year-olds). This is the age group in which more Jews are turning away from Zionist identification: 25% of non-Zionist Jews and 62% of anti-Zionist Jews now support the Green party. This suggests that it isbecauseof Green policies onIsraeland not despite them that the party is appealing to many.While the mainstream of the community and its leaders remain committed to the Conservative and Labour parties, a large and growing minority, especially among the young, is finding a new voice and new forms of political identification. There is still a tendency in public debate to imagine Jewish people as single community, united in its support for Israel. As JPR’s research demonstrates, this is not the case.Prof David Feldman, Dr Ben Gidley and Dr Brendan McGeeverBirkbeck Institute for the Study of Antisemitism, Birkbeck, University of LondonExplore more on these topicsGreen partyJudaismReligionIsraelForeign policylettersShareReuse this content"

As we do not have a clear and impartial doctor’s diagnosis, we cannot take as read that the mother had a mental illness, rather than being perhaps difficult to get along with.I recommend that your writers read the articleDr Monro, Mr Turner, and His Mother, published by the online journal Hektoen International, before they continue to celebrate Turner’s legacy with such unbridled devotion.Helen JamesWorthing, West SussexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

My key frustration, though, is how, as with any successful charlatanism, there is truth and real fear being exploited: medical overreach blights lives, women can and should trust their bodies, and a healthy body rarely grows a baby it can’t birth.However, physiology is not a perfected endpoint. Evolution continues with genetic variation spreading through a population by “survival of the fittest”. In the brutal “wild”, the least “well-adapted” (whether by health or circumstance) do not survive. Human beings, however, don’t like those odds. Medical intervention, yes, but a body of life-saving social knowledge has been passed down since language began, towards facilitating successful birth.Midwives provide the kind of respectful emotional support that in itself can act as pain relief. A good modern midwife will fiddle with the blood pressure cuff (and rightly – unchecked pre-eclampsia is a killer) but will also prioritise holding your hand and breathing with you through contractions. Mostly, though, experienced midwives enact “watchful waiting”; being discreetly right there, to intervene directly, or escalate to more medically focused colleagues when/if necessary.The loss of access to and respect for autonomous midwifery, its descent into obstetric nursing, is a raging western misogynist tragedy, resulting in both heinous obstetric violence and the Russian roulette of free birthing. The solution to both is accessible, respectful, experienced, autonomous midwifery care.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Despite being the second most common cancer in the UK after breast cancer, there is no screening programme in place in part due to the unreliability of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.One in four black men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetimes. Black men have a higher risk of a late-stage diagnosis of the disease than white men, but the committee did not recommend they should be screened, due to lack of data and uncertainties in the existing data.Screening of black men could lead to “high rates of overdiagnosis and overtreatment”, the committee said, with its modelling finding that an annual screening programme for black men aged between 55 and 60 would lead to 44% of prostate cancers being “overdiagnosed”. This is because some prostate cancers that are slow-growing and not aggressive would not necessarily require certain treatments.The committee estimated that about 40-50% of prostate cancer cases detected by PSA screening would be slow-growing, and that further treatment and testing for these slow-growing cancers would lead to high levels of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, “causing unnecessary anxiety and lifelong side-effects such as incontinence, erectile dysfunction and bladder problems for a cancer that would never have caused harm”.The committee concluded that screening all men for prostate cancer in the UK, regardless of their risk, would only slightly reduce the number of deaths from the disease but would lead to a “very large number of men to be overdiagnosed”. Men with a family history of prostate, breast or ovarian cancer were also not recommended for screening by the committee for similar reasons.BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene variants are faulty genes that can increase a person’s risk of developing breast, pancreatic, ovarian and prostate cancer.About one in 300 to one in 400 people will have a faulty BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, according toCancerResearch UK, with many being unaware of their status.People with Jewish ancestry are at a higher risk of having the faulty gene, with one in 40 Ashkenazi Jews and one in 140 Sephardi Jews being at risk.Men are encouraged to speak to their GP about getting a blood or saliva test for the faulty gene if they have a strong family history of cancer.Although the screening committee could not give an exact figure on the number of men who would be eligible for prostate cancer screening under its proposal, it is expected to only be a few thousand men given the rarity of the gene mutation.Although some charities have welcomed the decision by the screening committee, others and some public figures have expressed “deep disappointment” that men with the highest risk of the disease would not be offered screening.View image in fullscreenStephen Fry: ‘Men in the UK deserve so much better.’Photograph: Karl Black/AlamyCancer Research UK said it “support[s] the committee’s conclusion that for other groups of men, there isn’t currently enough high-quality evidence that screening would do more good than harm”.Dr Ian Walker, the executive director of policy at Cancer Research UK, added: “It can miss dangerous cancers and detect ones that don’t need treatment.“Work is still needed to understand how the proposed screening programme could be delivered, and we look forward to the UKNSC setting out further details in due course.”Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, also supported the committee’s evidence-based approach to screening, adding: “Today’s decision by the NSC not to recommend whole-population screening of men for prostate cancer reflects the lack of evidence that PSA blood testing is reliable enough to detect prostate cancer that needs treatment.”However, the charities Prostate Cancer UK and Prostate Cancer Research, alongside public figures including Stephen Fry and Rishi Sunak, expressed “deep disappointment” at the screening committee’s decision and warned that many more men would be at risk of late diagnosis or even death from the disease.Laura Kerby, the chief executive of Prostate Cancer UK, said the decision came as a “blow to the tens of thousands of men, loved ones and families who’ve fought for a screening programme”.Kerby added: “While screening men with BRCA gene variations will save only a fraction of that, the committee’s decision is the first time they’ve recommended screening of any kind for prostate cancer. It shows that research and evidence can shift the dial and save men’s lives.”Prostate Cancer Research said that excluding black men and men with a family history of the disease was a “serious error that ignores modern evidence and risks widening health inequalities for another generation”.What is prostate cancer and should I be worried if I wee a lot at night?Read moreFry and Sunak, ambassadors for Prostate Cancer Research, both expressed disappointment in the decision. Sunak said that it was a “missed opportunity to make a generational difference to male health”, while Fry stated: “Men in the UK deserve so much better.”The former prime minister David Cameron, whorevealed earlier this weekthat he had been treated for prostate cancer, also said he was “disappointed” in the decision. He added: “We are letting down too many men if we don’t push for a wider screening programme that includes all high-risk groups – and not just the men involved, but their families too, who risk losing a loved one unnecessarily.”Streeting said: “I have always said I want to see screening in place for the most common cancer in men, provided this is backed by evidence. I want to change the NHS so it diagnoses earlier and treats faster. That aim will be balanced against the harms that wider screening could cause to men.”He added: “I will examine the evidence and arguments in this draft recommendation thoroughly, bringing together those with differing views, ahead of the final recommendation in March.“In the meantime, we will keep making progress on cutting cancer waiting times and investing in research into prostate cancer detection. In the last 12 months, 193,000 more patients received a diagnosis for suspected cancer on time.”Explore more on these topicsProstate cancerHealthCancerHealth policyMennewsShareReuse this content"

Four people died of their injuries in hospital, Chris Tang, the city’s security secretary told the media on Friday afternoon. A further 79 people, including 11 firefighters, had been injured. About 200 people were still unaccounted for, and 89 of the bodies had not yet been identified.The head of the fire services, Andy Yeung, confirmed what many residents had been claiming for days: that no fire alarms went off in any of the eight towers. “We will take enforcement actions against the contractors responsible,” he said.Later on Friday, Hong Kong’s anti-corruption watchdog said it had arrested eight people. The group of seven men and one woman included “engineering consultants, scaffolding construction contractors and a middleman”, said the Independent Commission Against Corruption. Three other construction executives have already been detained.View image in fullscreenBurnt-out buildings of the Wang Fuk Court complex in Hong Kong.Photograph: Vernon Yuen/Nexpher/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockOfficials have said the fire was finally outbut they needed to wait for the building to cool down before they could enter some areas, where temperatures were still above 200C (390F). They estimated it would take three to four weeks to collect evidence.Throughout the morning, more people arrived at the Kwong Fuk estate community centre, adjacent to the towers, to identify the bodies being pulled from the gutted buildings. Few names of the dead have been released to the public yet, and Tang declined to release demographic information of those confirmed killed.Anger swelling in Hong Kong over deadliest fire in more than 70 yearsRead moreYeung said: “The fire in the building was extremely intense, with temperatures at the scene reaching 500 degrees, sometimes exceeding that.” That made it difficult to reach high floors, he added.“The interior spaces of the building were very narrow. Firefighters had to carry out operations unit by unit, floor by floor, and the units were cluttered with a large amount of items.”The blaze, which began on Wednesday afternoon, spread quickly through the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in the northern district of Tai Po. The eight-tower estate housing more than 4,600 people had been undergoing renovations and was wrapped in bamboo scaffolding and green mesh.On Friday afternoon, Tang said the green mesh was up to safety standards. Instead, they believed the highly flammable polystyrene foam discovered in every elevator window was the primary cause of the fire’s intensity. He said the blaze started from the lower part of the Wang Cheong tower, first in the mesh, then the foam, before spreading inside the building. High temperatures broke windows, allowing the fire to spread from unit to unit, helped along by high winds and falling debris from the burning mesh and scaffolding, Tang said.Hong Kong’s labour department said the building contractor had been reminded repeatedly in writing to take appropriate fire prevention measures after inspections over the last year revealed unsafe working practices. The most recent inspection was on 20 November.View image in fullscreenA resource collection point set up by volunteers to provide supplies for residents affected by the fire.Photograph: Jessie Pang/ReutersHowever, the department said the risk of fire was deemed to be relatively low and that the scaffold netting appeared to meet the standards for flame-retardant performance.Most of the dead were found intwo of the seven towers that caught fire, and most survivors were pulled from the others.A man identified only as Mr Lau said his parents were missing, and he believed they had not survived. Sobbing, he told reporters he had no information. “At the scene I know nothing,” he said. “I just want to know if my parents are alive or dead. If they’ve died I don’t want to even see the bodies, I only want to know they’re gone so at least I won’t keep worrying.”Another resident, who lived on the 10th floor of one of the towers, said her family was safe but her neighbours were missing. “I don’t want to watch TV, I don’t want to look at community groups, I don’t want to read any news on my phone,” she said. “I just want life to go back to normal, but right now it feels very difficult.”Indonesia’s consul general, Yul Edison, arrived on Friday afternoon to help with identification of the bodies.View image in fullscreenFirefighters near the scene of the fire at Wang Fuk Court.Photograph: Chan Long Hei/APMany Indonesians work as domestic helpers in flats such as those at Wang Fuk Court. Edison told reporters at least one Indonesian national was among the dead. A spokesperson for the Mission for Migrant Workers NGO said there were 11 Indonesian domestic helpers still missing, from 119 known to live in the building.The Philippines consulate said one Filipino domestic worker was still missing, one was injured, and 24 were accounted for. A crowdsourced web app has collated reports from people about each building, identifying individual flats in each tower, with available details of the residents.“A 41-year-old man went missing at 16.45,” said one report from block F, where the fire began. “His last message was that he was trapped in stairwell 25-26.” Another report confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man, a 90-year-old woman and a 40-year-old Indian national who lived with them as a domestic helper in an 11th-floor apartment. Eight floors above them, four people were reported to have died in one apartment.The fire hasprompted calls for stronger fire safety lawsin the construction sector. “There’s no law stipulating that flame-retardant materials must be used,” Lee Kwong-sing, the chair of Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner said, according to the state broadcasting service RTHK.“It is merely stated in the codes of practice by the labour department, so many people may not follow the requirements as it is not illegal. But if you turn such codes into a mandatory requirement … then that’ll be another story altogether.”Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsHong Kong apartment firesHong KongAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

In September, Franceproposed a ceilingon the value of UK-produced military components in the fund.The UK and EU had been expected to sign a technical agreement on Safe after establishing an administrative fee from London. But after months of wrangling, and only days before the 30 November deadline for an agreement, sources said the two sides remained “far apart” on the financial contribution Britain would make, Bloomberg reported.EU officials have suggested an entry fee of up to €6bn, far higher than the administrative fee the government had envisaged paying. Peter Ricketts, the veteran former diplomat who chairs the European affairs committee in the House of Lords, described a rumoured €6.5bn fee as “so off the scale that it suggests some EU members don’t want the UK in the scheme”.The minister for EU relations, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said it was “disappointing” that talks had fallen through but insisted that the UK defence industry would still be able to participate in projects through Safe on third-country terms.“While it is disappointing that we have not been able to conclude discussions on UK participation in the first round of Safe, the UK defence industry will still be able to participate in projects through Safe on third-country terms.“Negotiations were carried out in good faith, but our position was always clear: we will only sign agreements that are in the national interest and provide value for money.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Without this pact, the UK could never supply more than 35% of the value of components of any Safe-funded project.As recently as last week, the prime minister had expressed a belief that quiet diplomacy would result in agreement, telling reporters travelling with him to the G20 summit in South Africa: “Negotiations are going on in the usual way and they will continue.”He added: “I hope we can find an acceptable solution, but my strong view is that these things are better done quietly through diplomacy than exchanging views through the media.”But soon after, the talks appeared to be on rocky ground after the defence secretary, John Healey, said the UK was willing to quit, telling the i newspaper the UK was not willing to sign up for “any price”.Thomas-Symonds sought to downplay the significance of the collapse of negotiations on Friday, stating: “From leading the Coalition of the Willing for Ukraine to strengthening our relationships with allies, the UK is stepping up on European security in the face of rising threats and remains committed to collaborating with our allies and partners. In the last year alone, we have struck defence agreements across Europe and we will continue this close cooperation.”He added that the UK and EU were continuing to “make strong progress on the historic UK-EU May agreement that supports jobs, bills and borders”.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionKeir StarmerEuropeDefence policynewsShareReuse this content"

The borough of Hammersmith and Fulham was also affected and has said it is “working around the clock” to restore its systems.Westminster said in a statement on Friday that the attack had affected IT systems shared by all three councils. It added that it was working with the NCSC to maintain essential services.RBKC said it was also working with the National Crime Agency, the Metropolitan police and the NCSC to identify the assailants.‘Scamming became the new farming’: inside India’s cybercrime villagesRead moreThe council said it faced at least two weeks of “significant disruption” and was working to bring its systems back online after services were affected.Public bodies and private businesses across the UK have been hit in recent years byransomware attacks, where criminal gangs typically based in the former Soviet Union lock up a target’s IT systems with malware and extract data at the same time.

The Kelani River, which runs into the Indian Ocean near the capital Colombo, overflowed its banks on Friday.VSA Ratnayake, 56, said he had to leave his flooded home in Kaduwela, near Colombo. “I think this could be the worst flood in our area for three decades,” Ratnayake said. “I remember a flood in the 1990s when my house was under 7ft of water.”Kalyani, 48, also from Kaduwela, said she was sheltering two families whose homes were flooded.View image in fullscreenPeople leave their homes in Wellampitiya, near Colombo.Photograph: Tharaka Basnayaka/NurPhoto/ShutterstockAt least 3,000 homes were damaged in mudslides and floods, and more than 18,000 people have been moved to temporary shelters. In Anuradhapura district in the north, a Bell 212 helicopter airlifted a man who had climbed a coconut tree to escape rising waters.The DMC said more rain was forecast, with Cyclone Ditwah likely to move away from the north towards the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu by Sunday.India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, expressed his condolences over the loss of life inSri Lankaand said Delhi was rushing out aid to the affected areas. “We stand ready to provide more aid and assistance as the situation evolves,” Modi said on X.‘We can no longer predict the seasons’: why Indonesia’s coal mindset has to changeRead moreDMC officials said they expected flood levels to be worse than in 2016, when 71 people were killed nationwide.

With new legislative powers, Carney’s government could also slash permitting and approval delays.But the response from politically powerful nations, such as the Haida – whose consent the government needs – was both quick and simple: “This project is not going to happen.”Gaagwiis, the president of the Haida nation, said the federal government had a duty to “uphold the honour of the crown” when working with his community.“Trying to ram through a project puts that ‘honour’ in jeopardy,” he said. “This is an opportunity for the government of Canada and the prime minister, to look in the mirror and see what kind of country he wants to lead and what kind of country he wants Canada to be.”Despite Carney’s pledge to obtain the full consent of First Nations – and to share any windfall – on any possible pipeline project, Gaagwiis said there was nothing federal or provincial leaders could say to move his nation.“Because there’s absolutely nothing that can fully guarantee the safety of our communities from an oil spill, there’s nothing that can be said to convince us otherwise.”Marilyn Slett, the president of the Coastal First Nations (CFN), which represents eight coastal First Nations including the Haida, said the group had no interest allowing tankers in coastal waters.“We have zero interest in co-ownership or economic benefits of a project that has the potential to destroy our way of life and everything we have built on the coast,” she said.Carney has been working to calm political strife among provincial leaders, and Thursday’s announcement was met with enthusiasm in Alberta. Speaking to the Calgary chamber of commerce, the prime minister received a standing ovation, a near-impossible feat for a Liberal leader in a conservative-leaning region.Business groups have come out in favour of the deal, which the Canadian chamber of commerce says moves the country towards “economic cooperation, greater regulatory certainty and reduced tension”.Recent polling showsthat a majority of Canadians – including a slim majority in British Columbia – are open to the idea of a pipeline. The vague outlines of a major infrastructure project have also piqued the interest of some First Nations in Alberta who have been promised a possible equity stake in any project.The premise of Carney’s energy plan is that oil and gas exports can be increased while meeting the federal government’s climate targets. The federal government will exempt a possible pipeline project from the existing coastal oil tanker moratorium and emissions cap. In exchange, Alberta must raise its industrial carbon pricing and invest in a multibillion-dollar carbon capture project.In theory, the deal goes a long way in bringing together Alberta and Ottawa in the pursuit of a common, nation-building goal. But critically, no private company has expressed an interest in backing a pipeline project that would face stiff opposition.“No proponent, no route, no money, no First Nation support,” the British Columbia premier, David Eby, said after the announcement.Eby, a strong critic of the deal after his province was excluded in talks, said any pipeline proposal “cannot draw limited federal resources, limited Indigenous governance resources, limited provincial resources away from the real projects that will employ people, provide the country with money that we desperately need, and provide investment and access to global markets”.The agreement also cost Carney one of his most prominent cabinet ministers,Steven Guilbeault, who resigned hours after the signing of the agreement.In a post on social media announcing his resignation, Guilbeault said the decision came with “great sadness”, but was necessary given his values as a longtime environmental advocate.The decision to lay the groundwork for a possible heavy oil pipeline also reflects a political shift by Carney, who, before entering politics, developed credentials as a global economist focused on attaining a net zero future.Jessica Green, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said: “Everything in this [agreement] says more fossil fuels, except the first line – where it says Canada and Alberta remain committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.“Call a spade a spade: if you want to double down on fossil fuels, at least have the guts to say it out loud.”Green said the pact was a “dumpster fire” of a climate agreement after signalling politically that Canada was “all in” on fossil fuels.But a protracted trade war with the US, Canada’s largest trading partner and closest political ally, has dramatically upended the country’s economic security. Much of Carney’s brief tenure as prime minister has focused on expanding potential markets outside of the US.“Without the trade war and the tariffs, I imagine the economy would not be hurting in the way that it is,” said Green. “Nobody’s got a crystal ball, but in a world where we’re not haemorrhaging from the trade war, I imagine we don’t see this level of aggressive pandering to fossil fuel interests and infrastructure.”For the remote coastal First Nations whose harvests and livelihood come from the Pacific Ocean, the threat of a pipeline is more than just a question of climate policy.Gaagwiis said: “When people talk about this project, they need to understand an entire ecosystem could collapse in the event of a spill. Losing a culture that developed relationships with the ocean over thousands of years would be devastating. There needs to be respect for that.“I see the reality setting in soon that there is no project, there’s no pipeline route, there’s no proponent – and there’s no support. Everyone here is against it. There are other ways for Alberta to find more business in moving oil. But it’s not going to be through the coast.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereFiona Harveyin BelémFri 28 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 02.02 ESTShareSome commentators have called Cop30 a failure. An attempt to insert plans for a route to the phaseout of fossil fuels into the legal text was stymied, consideration of how to improve countries’ emissions-cutting plans was put off till next year, and although developing countries got the tripling of finance for adaptation that they were seeking, it will not be delivered in full until 2035 – and will come out of already promised funds.Look beyond the headlines, however, and the Cop achieved a great deal more. Take the outcome on fossil fuels – it seems absurd, but until 2023 three decades of annual climate summits had failed to address fossil fuels directly.More on the positives to come out of this year’s climate conference, after this week’s most important reads.Essential readsUK can create 5,400 jobs if it stops plastic waste exports, report findsZombie fires: how Arctic wildfires that come back to life are ravaging forestsThere’s a catastrophic black hole in our climate data – and it’s a gift to deniers | George MonbiotIn focusView image in fullscreenLengthy discussions in windowless rooms … delegates at a closing plenary session at Cop30 in Belém.Photograph: Fraga Alves/EPABelém, a city of 2.5 million people, sits about 100 miles (161km) below the equator, near the mouth of the Amazon river and in the midst of rainforest, which creates its own weather. Most afternoons, torrential downpours soak the city, and frequently throughout the fortnight-long climate talks that ended on Saturday, the thunder roared outside the conference centre, shaking the ground beneath, while lightning flashed on those fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of the outside world.All this was lost on the thousands of negotiators from 194 countries who filled the windowless rooms. Occasionally, they had to pause over the microphone, as the deafening drumming of rain on the plastic roof drowned out their words. Mostly, however, their attention was all within.It is true that a discussion of a path to the end of the fossil fuel era did not make it into the final legal text. However, Cop30 president André Corrêa do Lago noted that Brazil – whose president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva spoke several times in favour of a phaseout – did have a “plan B”, which is now in full swing. That is a presidential initiative to consult governments, energy experts, civil society and scientists, and report back at Cop31 on how a plan for the “transition away from fossil fuels” may work.It is possible, at Cops, to get too hung up on what is legally binding and what is not. Before the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, many people were angry that although the main part of the treaty – limiting temperatures to 1.5C above preindustrial levels – was legally binding, the means of doing so – national plans on emissions, called nationally determined contributions or NDCs – were in a separate, nonbinding annexe.Over the course of the 19 Cops I have now reported from, I calculate that I have sat through days, possibly even weeks, of earnest back -and-forth discussions on what is legally binding. My takeaway from that is: get over it. The finer points of legal shading turn out to matter a lot less than countries’ political priorities.The fact that NDCs are not legally binding turned out not to be a problem. The real issue is that they are so far inadequate to keep to the 1.5C limit and must be strengthened.Many countries are wary of a “top-down” approach, by which global commitments are imposed on them, and prefer the “bottom-up” model that NDCs represent, which they feel allows them to retain some sovereignty over their decisions. (Many developing countries endured decades of being told what to do by organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, which frequently imposed on them unpalatable policies such as privatising national assets or cutting public services in return for bailouts. It left a bitter taste.)The transition away from fossil fuels should be seen in this light. A nonbinding process that allows countries to decide their own pathways, policies and timetables toward the eventual phaseout of oil, gas and coal has far more chance of succeeding than anything that is seen as an outside imposition.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A future Cop, in Turkey next year, Ethiopia in 2027, and perhaps India in 2028, could opt to “recognise”, “welcome”, “acknowledge” or even – the strongest formulation – “adopt” the roadmap idea, giving it legal standing to please the purists.)Detractors dismiss nonbinding initiatives as “coalitions of the willing” but, ultimately, climate progress comes from such coalitions – nobody can force countries to follow the Paris agreement, or other commitments, if their government decides not to. Just look at the US.What matters in the climate crisis is not the legal status of words agreed over night-long sessions in windowless conference rooms. What will save us is real-world action. If enough countries display their intent to move away from fossil fuels, money will follow. Today, global investment in renewables is twice that of fossil fuels; a quarter of all new vehicles sold worldwide are electric; and half of the power-generating capacity of China and India is low-carbon.Look outside, hear the thunder, feel the rain: in the real world, change is happening.Read more:US, Russia and Saudi Arabia create axis of obstruction as Cop30 sputters outWe delivered a clear message at Cop30: the delayers and defeatists are losing the climate fight | Ed MilibandAnother Cop wrecked by fossil fuel interests and our leaders’ cowardice – but there is another way | Genevieve GuentherTo read the complete version of this newsletter –subscribe to receive Down to Earthin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentDown to Earth newsletternewslettersShareReuse this content"

Farmers are clearing more land for food production. Infrastructure projects and mining are exacerbating the loss of vegetation and global heating – caused by the burning of gas, oil and coal – thereby degrading the resilience of ecosystems.The rainforest the world forgot: the Congo basin is the second largest on Earth, so why is it being neglected?Read moreScientists found that between2010 and 2017, African forests lost approximately 106bn kg of biomass per year, which is equivalent to the weight of about 106m cars. The worst affected were the tropical moist broadleaf forests in Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and parts of west AfricaThe study,published on Friday in Scientific Reports, was led by researchers at the National Centre for Earth Observation at the Universities of Leicester, Sheffield and Edinburgh. Using satellite data and machine learning, they tracked more than a decade of changes in the amount of carbon stored in trees and woody vegetation.They discovered that Africa gained carbon between 2007 and 2010, but since then widespread forest loss has tipped the balance so the continent is contributing more CO2into the atmosphere.The authors said the results show that urgent action is needed to stop forest loss or the world risks losing one of its most important natural carbon buffers. They say that Brazil has launched an initiative, the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), which aims to mobilise more than $100bn (£76bn) for forest protection by paying countries to leave their forests untouched.So far, however, only a handful of nations have invested a total of $6.5bn in the initiative.Prof Heiko Balzter, a senior author and director of the Institute for Environmental Futures at the University of Leicester, said the study showed the importance of scaling up the TFFF rapidly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But progress is not being made fast enough. The new TFFF is intended to pay forested nations for keeping their trees rooted in the ground. It is a way for governments and private investors to counteract the drivers of deforestation, such as mining for minerals and metals, and agricultural land take.

He said: “We wanted to see how widely the new regulations were being adhered to and then look at the effect on the atmosphere. We flew the FAAM aircraft out from the UK and Portugal to investigate in 2019 and then again in 2021 and 2022.”TheUK’s FAAM aircraftstarted life as a prototype short-haul airliner for about 100 passengers. Nowadays it carries up to18 researchers and four tonnesof science equipment.Dr Dominika Pasternak, one of the researchers on the study, said: “The most difficult part was finding the plume. We would position the FAAM aircraft in the area of operation. A person back at the airport used a ship tracker website and relayed coordinates, heading and visual description over Satcom.“We often flew just 30 metres over water. With data on wind speed and direction, the speed and heading of the ship, some trigonometry and very skilled flying, we were able to intercept 130 ship plumes.”In the open ocean, eight ships out of 19 were emitting more sulphur than permitted in 2019. These included a 61,900 tonne container ship and an 86,100 tonne crude oil tanker. Five ships out of 78 exceeded the stricter limits in 2021 and 2022.A tighter air pollution zone operates in the Channel and North Sea. This was largely effective but here two out of 33 ships breached limits. In one case, a 200,000 tonne container ship was found breaching sulphur limits in the open ocean but had later switched to cleaner fuel when it was sampled nearer land in the Channel and North Sea zone.Air pollution from burning shipping fuels can bemeasured further inland– inLondonfor example – and wasestimated to have cost the UK £1.5bn in health impacts in 2017.Lee offered a message to policymakers: “The reduction in sulphur shows that regulations can have an effect. Our work also showed that ships are a significant source of local air pollution when they are sailing close to shore.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A prominent member of the Ukip and Brexit party groups, he had pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019.Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) documents used in Gill’s case showed him and Voloshyn apparently discussing how much should be set aside for Coburn, who was also an MEP for Reform UK’s precursor, the Brexit party.View image in fullscreenNathan Gill was sentenced to 10 and a half years in prison on charges of accepting bribes.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe messages were sent in April 2019 before a meeting at the European parliament of the editorial board of 112 Ukraine, a pro-Russian Ukrainian channel, whose membership included Gill and Coburn.Later that day, there was discussion between Gill and Voloshyn regarding money, which the latter had given to be distributed between Gill and another MEP identified as “D” and “David”.“I’m seeing D. In the morning. How much was for him?” Gill Messaged Voloshyn, who replied: “6.5 USD.”The MEP called David, apparently Coburn,was also mentioned in other messages between Gill and Voloshyn, who was working for Viktor Medvedchuk, Vladimir Putin’s most important ally in Ukraine in the years before Russia’s full-scale invasions.“There is a big request to you and David,” Voloshyn messaged Gill, going on to outline “a smart idea”, which he said Medvedchuk had.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dozens of families fled and copycat disturbances spread to other towns. A third teenager suspected of involvement in the alleged attack reportedly fled to Romania.The PPS said in a statement it had a duty to consider new information or evidence that became available. “We have recently been made aware of significant evidential developments in this case. In light of this new evidence, it has been determined that the test for prosecution is no longer met on evidential grounds, and therefore the case should not proceed.”Prosecutors and the police investigation team met the complainant and her family earlier on Friday to explain the decision, the PPS said.Belfast youth court granted the request to withdraw charges, paving the way for the release of the boys from the juvenile detention centre where they have been held since June. Because of their age they have not been named. “This is a very sensitive case, but the matters are now marked withdrawn. The less I say about it the better,” the district judge, George Conner, told the court.DCI Stephanie Finlay said any reported sexual crime was investigated and urged victims to come forward. “You will be dealt with sensitively and will be offered the appropriate additional support.”Finlay appealed to the public to not speculate about the Ballymena case. “I would remind everyone to remain respectful in light of today’s decision, and refrain from speculation, particularly on social media,” she said.The collapse of the prosecution gave a fresh twist to a case that became a focus for anti-immigrant protests.Ballymena, a largely Protestant town about 25 miles (40km) north of Belfast, is 95% white, according to the 2021 census. However, an influx of people from eastern Europe, many of whom worked at food processing plants, prompted complaints from some residents.Accounts of the alleged rape last June spread swiftly on social media – in court it was claimed that the girl was dragged down an alley and attacked by three boys in a garage in the Clonavon Terrace area.Hundreds of people, many wearing masks or in hoods, targeted foreign-owned homes and businesses in a three-night spree of smashing, burning and missile-throwing that terrorised immigrants from the Philippines, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Romania and other countries. “Where are the foreigners?” some shouted.Some rioters attempted to focus attacks on ethnic Roma people, prompting people to put signs with statements such as “Filipino lives here” on their homes. Others erected union flags and loyalist bunting in the hope of deflecting attacks. Mobs assaulted police, leaving dozens injured, and disturbancesspread to Larneand Portadown.There are no official figures but one informed source with ties to the Roma community in Ballymena estimated thattwo-thirdsof the approximate pre-riot population of 1,200 had left.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandRacenewsShareReuse this content"

He resigned before this investigation had concluded.“We are committed to living up to our values at every level of the organisation and ensuring a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace for everyone.”Smith said the executive director of ZSL, which runs London zoo and Whipsnade zoo in Bedfordshire, had stepped in as interim chief executive and was “focused on leading an organisation with honesty, integrity and accountability at its heart”.No further details were provided. At the top of Gould’s LinkedIn account, he has written: “Plotting my next move”.A spokesperson for ZSL confirmed the contents of the letter to staff. She said: “This investigation was not related to ZSL’s financial operations. This matter was addressed promptly and appropriately, and there are no wider implications for our staff or operations. We are not sharing any further details on an internal matter.”The spokesperson added: “ZSL’s work continues unchanged and we are committed to maintaining a culture that lives up to our values and ensuring the organisation continues to be a supportive and respectful place to work.”The resignation comes at a difficult time for ZSL, before its bicentennial in 2026 and at a point when cuts to aid funding by the Trump administration and the UK government has forced it to look for savings.In October, it launched a voluntary redundancy scheme in an effort to reduce costs by £2m a year. Gould said at the time he could not rule out compulsory redundancies but he was “doing everything possible” to avoid them.The 54-year-old has known Osborne since they were both members of the same chess club at St Paul’s, a public school in west London, and spoke at the former chancellor’s wedding to Thea Rogers in 2023.Before joining ZSL, Gould was a career civil servant with a glittering array of top government positions. After eight years in junior roles in the Foreign Office, including as speech writer to the then Labour foreign secretary, Robin Cook, he moved to Downing Street in 2007 to be private secretary for foreign affairs at the end of Tony Blair’s premiership.Postings followed in Islamabad, Tehran and Washington DC and five years as the British ambassador to Israel.During the Covid pandemic, he had a central role as the first chief executive of NHSX, the health service’s digital innovations wing, a position to which he was appointed by the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, who was also a former chief of staff to Osborne.Gould joined ZSL in September 2022 and told the Daily Telegraph in an interview in 2023 that he stayed in London during the week before rejoining his wife, Celia, a photographer and textile designer, and two daughters at their home in Somerset at the weekend.Speaking of his time at the centre of government during the pandemic, he said: “I found [that] trying to do really difficult things under immense pressure with a massive spotlight of public, internet, media and parliamentary scrutiny was really difficult.“I think it’s harder to be a public figure now. The respect has gone down. The suspicion and the scrutiny has [increased]. Back then, you needed a thick skin, but now you have to be a pretty strong character to survive the presumption of ill intent and constant searching for evidence of wrongdoing. And the constant knowledge that at any point somebody might pour a bucket of ordure over your head.”Of his job at ZSL, Gould said: “I don’t want to say for ever, but I can’t see anything I’d rather be doing.”Explore more on these topicsLondonZoosnewsShareReuse this content"

Extra security guards have been hired.How did an idea with so much potential traction and reach – hundreds of thousands of people signed up to support the idea of a movement spearheaded by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana before it even existed – become so quickly and comprehensively bogged down inpower struggles and infighting?The slightly simplified answer, one agreed on at least in private by people from all sides, is rooted in escalating tensions between Corbyn, portrayed as indecisive and at times ambivalent about yet another political venture at the age of 76, and Sultana, the combative former Labour MP who has enraged colleagues by making major decisions unilaterally.The ground zero for a split so comprehensive that, insiders say, Sultana has for the past three months mainly communicated with her supposed colleagues through lawyers, came on 3 July, or “terrible Thursday” as one calls it. This was when the Coventry South MPannounced she was resigning from Labourand would jointly lead a new entity with Corbyn.View image in fullscreenZarah Sultana addresses the crowd at a Stop Trump Coalition protest in Parliament Square in September.Photograph: James Manning/PAThe news followed a meeting of the embryonic organisation earlier that day at which the co-leadership was discussed. There was, however, one problem: Corbyn and his allies firmly believed that no decision was made.Their surprise at Sultana’s fait accompli was briefed to the media, while an internal WhatsApp group descended into intense disagreement. It took until the next afternoonfor Corbyn to respond publicly, with a tweet pointedly saying that discussions were “ongoing”.It highlights the contrasting and often incompatible personalities of the party’s protagonists, one where Sultana either believed Corbyn’s lack of a firm answer on co-leadership was a tacit yes or simply chose to bounce him into it.Even allies of Corbyn say the former Labour leader can be hard to pin down, with an aversion to open conflict and a tendency to, as one person involved in the project put it, “disappear to his allotment for 24 hours without his phone”.“Jeremy can be a touch avoidant,” one ally said. Another source involved in the project was more blunt: “That’s always been the problem – he won’t say anything. You have this whole industry of Jeremy-whisperers, trying to interpret what he means.”A source close to Corbyn disputed the idea he was wary about leading the party and said it was for members to decide. The idea he disappeared to his allotment was, they added, “complete nonsense”.Corbyn said: “Lots of people have said a lot of things about me. I will carry on representing my community in parliament and speaking out against inequality, poverty and war.”The first push for Corbyn to lead a new leftwing party came before last year’s general election, at which hestood in his Islington North seat as an independent. These overtures were rebuffed. There are some who view him as still slightly reluctant, but urged on by Karie Murphy, his chief of staff when he was Labour leader, and his wife, Laura Alvarez.After the election, Corbyn suddenly found himself one of five left-leaning independents, with Shockat Adam, Adnan Hussain, Ayoub Khan and Iqbal Mohamed winning urban, formerly Labour seats on Gaza-focused platforms. Two months laterthey jointly formedthe Independent Alliance.View image in fullscreenAdnan Hussain, the MP for Blackburn, was one of five independents to form a parliamentary alliance with Corbyn after the election.Photograph: Imageplotter/AlamyBy this point, discussions had begun about the possibility of launching a new Corbyn-focused, not necessarily Corbyn-led, political movement.While a platform of specific policies will have to await agreement on a leader or leaders, those involved in Your Party argue they will have a voice distinct not just from Labour but also the Greens, with a focus on community organising, internationalism, nationalisation and redistribution.But from the start, there were difficulties. “The first meeting was very disorganised,” one source recalled. “It started late as they were waiting for Jeremy to turn up and then the agenda kept changing.”The coming months produced progress, including an outline of the party’s philosophy, but also disagreements: for example, attempts to create a powerful role of general secretary, viewed as a means for Murphy to take over.Into this slightly ponderous mix arrived Sultana, whose punchy social media presence reflects an MP keen to get things done, but one with a tendency to fall out with people who could be allies.“Zarah has made her profile by being combative and there’s clearly a place for that,” said one observer. “But her diplomacy has been shockingly bad. There has been a complete failure to either produce an alternative plan, or win people over.”An ally of Sultana said she sought to work collaboratively but was excluded from decision making process, and that she remained fully focused on the party and its mission.If the divide created on 3 July was bad, worse was to come when Sultana unilaterally launched a membership portal, collecting reams of data and about£800,000 in donationsand levies.Your Party had spent £13,000 on a software system intended for this process and Sultana planned to use it for her membership drive, the Guardian has been told. But she was thwarted when Corbyn’s allies learned of her plans and sent a staffer into the organisation’s offices at 3am to change the passwords, sources claimed.Sultana pressed on, using her own software, prompting fury from Corbyn. Heaccused Sultanaof creating a “false membership system” that had collected money and data without authorisation, and said Your Party had referred Sultana to the Information Commissioner’s Office. In response, Sultana said she was consulting defamation lawyers over what she called baseless claims from a “sexist boys’ club”.Since then, the tensions have become less dramatic, if no less entrenched. Much of the recent disagreementhas centred onhow the money can be passed from a holding company set up before Your Party existed to the party itself, with counterclaims of delay and of a failure to understand the basics of company law.Possibly more damaging was the departure of two of the independent MPs, Hussain and Mohamed. The formerlashed outat what he called “persistent infighting” and a “toxic, exclusionary and deeply disheartening” culture, rancour based in part on issues such as transgender rights.For now, Adam and Khan remain in place, but the departures highlight the difficulties in creating a party encompassing Sultana and Corbyn, along with the often more socially conservative electoral bases of the other independents.View image in fullscreenJeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana on a picket line outside London Euston railway station in July.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA“At one point we had six MPs and four different factions,” one source said. Another observer blamed what they called “bridge burning” by Sultana. “This is not to say that independent MPs are flawless, but if you’re going to build a big thing you need to work with a lot of people.”As members travel to Liverpool to decide on everything from a leadership structure to a name – Your Party was only ever an interim choice – opinions differ on what might come next.“I think it’s toast,” one participant said, noting how the splits in Your Party have been mirrored by asurge in membershipand attention for the Greens under their new leader, Zack Polanski.Some omens remain unpromising. Sultana’s decision to hold a self-organised pre-conference rally in Liverpool on Friday evening, billed an official Your Party event, annoyed others in the party.And although Your Party members are barred from also being members of other parties, Sultana is backed by the Socialist Unity Platform, a lobby organisation comprising groups including the Communist party of Great Britain. It is from here that possible disruption is predicted.Your Party is a mess. Here’s what they could learn from Farage and Polanski | Zoe WilliamsRead moreOthers see the conference as a chance to move forwards, especially if members choose the option of collective rather than individual leadership, thus preventing a long and possibly brutal contest between Corbyn and Sultana.“One reason for going so soon to a conference is because we can’t decide anything among ourselves, so it has to go to the membership,” one insider said. “Then, maybe, a committee can move forward like normal human beings.”Despite the drama, there is seemingly an appetite for a leftwing challenger to Labour that is not the Greens, shown by the mass sign-ups and by about 3,000 people heading to Liverpool for an event only weeks in the planning.“This is a long-term project,” said one person who is, at least for now, involved in it. “Who knows where we will be in a couple of years? There are likely to be areas of the country the Greens can’t get into, and we could cooperate.“By then we might be saying: ‘Do you remember that absolutely mental period at the start?’ But this conference has to provide some stability and some structure.

Carpets will receive the “same level” of treatment.Other areas of the building will remain open, including a current exhibition about US actor and film-maker Orson Welles.In 2023, the government said it was launching a concerted effort to fight bedbugs, which appeared in numbers on public transport, in cinemas and in hospitals asFranceprepared to host the 2024 Paris Olympics.In 2024, the government said that disinformation spread by Russia-linked social media accounts had amplified the public’s panic in autumn 2023.Bedbugs get their name from their habit of nesting in mattresses, although they can also hide in clothes and in luggage.Bedbug bites leave red areas, blisters or large rashes on the skin, and can cause intense itching or allergic reactions.They also often cause psychological distress, sleeping issues, anxiety and depression.Explore more on these topicsParisFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

It also fostered a huge affection for the trio, who have built up a loyal following onsocial media, where they post regular reports about their tumultuous experience and joy at their return.They have been helped by local supporters and former pupils, who have provided them with food, clothing, medical care and security and installed a chairlift to enable the three to reach their third-floor cells.The nuns’ religious superior, Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey, had argued that the sisters had to be placed in a Catholic care home as they were unable to safely live in the old stone convent. He repeatedly accused them of breaking their vows of obedience, a claim the nuns denied.View image in fullscreenThe three nuns have been helped by local supporters and former pupils since returning to Goldenstein Castle in Elsbethen.Photograph: Helena Lea Manhartsberger/Panos/The GuardianOn Friday, however, church officials said the women could stay at Goldenstein “until further notice” after a proposal put forward by Grasl aimed at resolving the dispute. The nuns are yet to agree to the deal.Church officials have reportedly said the nuns will be provided with adequate medical care and nursing help, and a priest would be at their disposal to serve regular mass. Over the past months, priests have had to be more or less smuggled into the convent’s chapel to say mass, against the will of church authorities.View image in fullscreenSister Bernadette leads prayers attended by supporters and former pupils in the chapel at Goldenstein.Photograph: Helena Lea Manhartsberger/Panos/The GuardianAmong the conditions for them to remain include the cessation of all social media activity, a ban on outside visitors to the convent and the settling of a legal dispute. Should the health conditions of the women deteriorate, they would be registered at the Elsbethen nursing home and placed on the waiting list there.“Now it’s up to the sisters,” Harald Schiffl, a spokesperson for Grasl, told the Austrian news agency APA.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Staley has already beenbanned from the UK banking sectorforplaying down his relationship with Epstein.While the regulators would not publicly confirm whether they were opening formal inquiries, their directors assured Warren they would take action over any potential misconduct.“While it would be inappropriate to comment on any specific ongoing supervisory matter, I take very seriously any allegations of wrongdoing or abuse by banks and bank executives,” the comptroller of the currency, Jonathan Gould, said in a letter to Warren, who is the lead Democrat on the US Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs.“We appreciate the seriousness of this matter and will continue to examine banks, includingJP MorganChase Bank, NA, within the scope of our authority, including to ensure banks address safety and soundness concerns and violations of law under our jurisdiction,” Gould added.Warren’s original letter raised questions over JP Morgan’s wider banking relationship with the sex offender, noting that Epstein was one of the bank’s most profitable clients before being dropped in 2013, five years after he was jailed for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The well-connected financier died in prison in July 2019, while awaiting trial over child sex trafficking charges.The FDIC’s acting chair, Travis Hill, said the regulator took“unlawful activity involving the banking sector, including possible insider involvement in illicit activity,very seriously”.His letter, dated 17 November, said “if this type of activity is identified” the watchdog would follow standard protocol: collecting and reviewing potential evidence, before escalating the matter to the FDIC’s inspector general’s office, which has law enforcement powers.Wrongdoing could result in a fine and a potential ban from working in the US banking sector.The FDIC and OCC declined to comment. The Guardian contacted Staley’s legal representative for comment.Warren said in a statement: “Regulators need to investigate and hold accountable Epstein’s enablers – and I’ll believe they’re taking action when I see it. Americans deserve to know that their banking system isn’t facilitating the disturbing crimes of the rich and powerful.”A spokesperson for JP Morgan did not directly comment on Warren’s correspondence with regulators but in relation to Epstein said: “We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts. We ended our relationship with him six years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges. The federal government had damning information about his crimes that they failed to share with us or other banks.”Last week Warren used an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to urge the JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, to testify in front of the US Senate banking committee.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They did more than a billion dollars in transactions for Jeffrey Epstein … He literally could walk into the bank and get $50m from JP Morgan Chase.“So, what I’d like to do, over on the banking committee, is I’d like to have Mr Dimon and some of those other bankers come in and, under oath, testify about exactly what the financial trail is that kept Jeffrey Epstein afloat for so long.”JP Morgan said in a statement: “Jamie never met with Epstein, spoke with him, emailed with him, and was not involved in any decisions about his account, to which he testified under oath. There are over a million pages of emails and other documents produced in this case, and not one comes even close to suggesting otherwise.”The bank’s spokesperson added: “We will follow the law, including responding to a subpoena. Our involvement with Epstein is largely a matter of public record, with millions of pages of discovery from litigation already publicly available.”The correspondence between Warren and US financial regulators comes days after Donald Trump waspressed into signing a billthat will lead to the US justice department releasing all of its unclassified records, documents, and communications related to Epstein and the co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.It follows initial backtracking by the US president, who had come under fire for his own ties to the sex offender, having been friends with Epstein before the pair fell out in 2004, before Epstein’s conviction. The documents are expected to be released within 30 days, on or about 19 December.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It also bans communal prayer on public roads and in parks, with the threat of fines of C$1,125 for groups in contravention of the prohibition. Short public events with prior approval are exempt.CAQ has made secularism a key legislative priority,passing the controversial Bill 21 –which bans some public sector employees from wearing religious symbol –in 2019.It plans to extend that prohibition to anyone working in daycares, colleges, universities and private schools. Full face coverings would be banned for anyone in those institutions, including students.Quebec’s secularism minister, Jean-François Roberge, said the controversial new provisions were the latest steps in a province working towards full secularization. He criticized previous accommodations by post-secondary institutions, including prayer rooms, telling reporters the schools “are not temples or churches or those kinds of places”. The ban on public prayer comes after the group Montreal4Palestine organized Sunday protests outside the city’s Notre-Dame Basilica that included prayers.“It’s shocking to see people blocking traffic, taking possession of the public space without a permit, without warning, and then turning our streets, our parks, our public squares into places of worship,” said Roberge.The province will also limit the offering of kosher and halal meals in public institutions. “We think that when the state is neutral, Quebecers are free,” said Roberge, rejecting allegations the law disproportionately affects minorities. “We have the same rules applying to everyone,” he said.But for Muslim students, the new rules “fee[l] like a personal attack against our community,” Ines Rarrbo, a first-year mechanical engineering student, told the Canadian Press. “It’s as if we’re not welcome here.”‘It shut all my doors’: how a Quebec law banning religious symbols derails women’s careersRead moreStephen Brown, president of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said the move amounts to “political opportunism” and reflects a “doubling down on identity politics and division in a desperate attempt to regain the public’s trust”.In a statement, the Assembly of Quebec Catholic Bishops said the proposed bill would be a “radical infringement on the rights and freedoms of the Quebec population” and that “the government has not demonstrated the need for such legislation”.Bill 21 bars judges, police officers, prison guards and teachers from wearing religious symbols while at work. Other public workers such as bus drivers, doctors and social workers must only keep their faces uncovered.The legislation runs afoul of both Quebec’s charter of human rights and freedoms and Canada’s charter of rights and freedoms but in 2021, Quebec’s superior court upheld the statute despite a finding that the law violates thefreedom of expressionandreligionof religious minorities. Governments in Canada can pass laws that breaches certain fundamental rights if they use a legal mechanism known as a the “notwithstanding clause”.Like Bill 21, the new legislation also invokes the clause pre-emptively, shielding it from challenges under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Canada’s supreme court is expected to hear a legal challenge to the use of the notwithstanding clause in the coming months.Explore more on these topicsQuebecCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

This level of membership, or subscription revenue, does not justify the time and effort it takes to launch monthly exclusive Prime seat sales for our 55,000 Prime members.”The company said it would return to offering discounts to “all our customers, and not this subset of 55,000 Prime members”.Prime was launched in February at a cost of £79 and €79 a year to customers in the UK and the EU. With seat costs ranging from £4.50 to £38, the scheme could have saved between £54 and £456, the equivalent of several low-fare flights, for those making use of the maximum 12 flights a year.The membership scheme was opened for a 12-month rolling basis with automatic renewal in February.Ryanair said all members would continue to “enjoy exclusive low fare offers until October 2026 but no new members will be allowed to sign up after Friday, 28 November.“We are grateful to our 55,000 Prime members who signed up to this Prime trial over the last eight months, and they can rest assured that they will continue to enjoy exclusive flight and seat savings for the remainder of their 12-month membership.”Ryanair, the market leader in budget airlines, with more than 207 million passengers a year, made low fares its unique selling point but managed to claw back revenue on equally innovative charging for bags and seats, something unheard of 20 years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The trend has prompted calls for increased testing of such products and governmental oversight.“If we look into how these toys are marketed and how they perform and the fact that there is little to no research that shows that they are beneficial for children – and no regulation of AI toys – it raises a really big red flag,” said Rachel Franz, director of Young Children Thrive Offline, an initiative fromFairplay, which works to protect children from big tech.Last week, those fears were given brutal justification when an AI-equipped teddy bear started discussing sexually explicit topics.The product, FoloToy’s Kumma, ran on an OpenAI model and responded to questions about kink. It suggested bondage and roleplay as ways to enhance a relationship, according to a report from the Public Interest Research Group (Pirg), the consumer protection organization behindthe study.Character.AI bans users under 18 after being sued over child’s suicideRead more“It took very little effort to get it to go into all kinds of sexually sensitive topics and probably a lot of content that parents would not want their children to be exposed to,” said Teresa Murray, Pirg consumer watchdog director.Products like the teddy bear are part of a global smart-toy market valued at $16.7bn in 2023, according toAllied Market Research.The industry is particularly big in China, which has more than 1,500 AI toy companies, which are working to expand abroad,MIT Technology Reviewreports.In addition to the Shanghai-based startup FoloToy, Curio, a California-based company, works with OpenAI and makes astuffed toy, Grok, as in Elon Musk’s chatbot, voiced by the musician Grimes. In June, Mattel, which owns brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels,also announceda partnership with OpenAI to “support AI-powered products and experiences”.Before the Pirg report on the creepy teddy bear, parents, technology researchers and lawmakers had already raised concerns about the impact of bots on minors’ mental health. In October, the chatbot company Character.AI announced that it would ban users under 18 followinga lawsuitalleging that its bot exacerbated a teen’s depression and caused him to kill himself.Murray said AI toys could be particularly dangerous because whereas earlier smart toys provided children-programmed responses, a bot can “have a free-flowing conversation with a child and there are no boundaries, as we found”.That could not only lead to sexually explicit conversations, but children could become attached to a bot rather than a person or imaginary friend, which could hurt their development, said Jacqueline Woolley, director of the Children’s Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin.For example, a child can benefit from having a disagreement with a friend and learning how to resolve it. That is less likely to happen with bots, which areoften sycophantic, said Woolley, who consulted on the Pirg study.“I worry about inappropriate bonding,” Woolley said.Companies also use the AI toys to collect data from children and have not been transparent about what they are doing with that information, Franz, of Fairplay, said. That potentially puts users at risk because of a lack of security around such data, Franz said.Hackers havebeen able to take control of AI products.“Because of the trust that the toys engender, I would say that children are more likely to tell their deepest thoughts to these toys,” Franz said. “The surveillance is unnecessary and inappropriate.”Despite such concerns, Pirg is not calling for a ban on AI toys, which could have educational value, like helping children learn a second language or state capitals, Murray said.“There is nothing wrong with having some kind of educational tool, but that same educational tool isn’t telling you that it’s your best friend, that you can tell me anything,” Murray said.The organization is calling for additional regulation of these toys for children under 13 but has not made specific policy recommendations, Murray said.There also needs to be more independent research conducted to ensure the products are safe for children and, until that is done, they should be pulled from shelves, Franz said.“We need short-term and longitudinal independent research on the impacts of children interacting with AI toys, including their social-emotional development” and cognitive development, Franz said.Following the Pirg report, OpenAI announced it was suspending FoloToy. The toy company’s CEO thentold CNNthat it was pulling the bear from the market and “conducting an internal safety audit”. Earlier this week, it reintroduced the product,posting on social mediaon Friday morning that it had “initiated a deep, company-wide internal safety audit; strengthened and upgraded our content-moderation and child-safety safeguards; and deployed enhanced safety rules and protections through our cloud-based system”.“As global attention on AI toy safety continues to rise, we believe that transparency, responsibility and continuous improvement are essential,” it said. “FoloToy remains firmly committed to building safe, age-appropriate AI companions for children and families worldwide.”It did not, however, confirm in the statement if it had consulted with independent experts before re-releasing the bear, as it claimed tothe Registerafter pulling the product that it would do.RJ Cross, the director of Pirg’s consumer privacy program, said FoloToy’s turnaround “does seem perhaps a little quick for a comprehensive safety audit, but what matters most is if the immediate problems got fixed”. He urged the company to allow access to outside experts, and said that regardless, questions remain about whether any AI “friends” are good for children.“We don’t know what an AI companion toy might do to a child’s long-term social development,” he said. “This is a question no corporate safety audit can answer right now.”FoloToy did not immediately respond a request for comment.On Thursday, 80 organizations, including Fairplay, issuedan advisoryurging families not to buy AI toys this holiday season.Meet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AIRead more“AI toys are being marketed to families as safe and even beneficial to learning before their impact has been assessed by independent research,” the release states. “By contrast, offline teddy bears and toys have been proven to benefit children’s development with none of the risks of AI toys.”Curio, maker of the Grok toy, told the Guardian in an email that after reviewing the Pirg report, “we are actively working with our team to address any concerns, while continuously overseeing content and interactions to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for children”.Mattel stated that its first products with OpenAI “will focus on families and older customers” and that “use of OpenAI APIs is not intended for users under 13”.“AI complements–not replaces–traditional play, and we are emphasizing safety, privacy, creativity and responsible innovation,” the company stated.Franz referred to pastprivacy concernswith Mattel’ssmart productsand said: “It’s good that Mattel is claiming that their AI products are not for young kids, but if we look at who plays with toys and who toys are marketed to, it’s young children.”Franz added: “We’re very interested in learning the concrete steps Mattel will take to ensure their OpenAI products are not actually used by kids who will surely recognize and be attracted to the brands.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ToysChildrenMarketing & PRBlack FridayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Comparable store sales fell 2.8%.The company said it had struggled with technology problems from a lengthy effort to separate its IT systems from those of its former owner, Walmart.Relief for retailers as business rate changes in budget not as bad as fearedRead moreAllan Leighton, the chair of Asda,returned to the business last yearto try to revive the business for a second time. He said the supermarket’s fall in sales andmarket sharewas “totally self-inflicted” and had put his turnaround plans “back six months”.However, Leighton also hit out at the government for hindering growth and depressing consumer sentiment.“The country is stuck in reverse,” he said. “They have got to encourage business to invest and they keep hampering that with costs.”He said in order to “sell more stuff” retailers needed “a positive consumer” and the government was “killing consumer confidence because of the fact there is no growth and nobody is investing”.“The government isn’t doing anything to stimulate growth,” he added. Leighton said the impact of fearedbusiness rates changesfor large retailers in Wednesday’s budget would be “neutral” for Asda.Official figures last weekshowedthat sales at UK retailers slumped unexpectedly last month as shoppers waited forBlack Fridaydeals, and uncertainty over the budget dampened consumer confidence.Asda’s sales and profits have dived since a debt-fuelled£6.8bn takeover in early 2021by Blackburn’s billionaire Issa brothers and the private equity company TDR Capital. Aldi is poised to overtake it as the UK’s third-largest supermarket, according to analysts at Worldpanel by Numerator, formerly known as Kantar.Leighton said problems with its new IT systems had caused availability problems across the business, with clothing and homewares supplied to more than a quarter of its stores hit by problems at a specialist distribution centre. A new grocery home shopping app had proved “more clunky than what we had before”, putting customers off, he admitted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The sale of new petrol and diesel cars in the EU isscheduled to be banned in a decade’s time.Merz’s letter hardens the battle lines emerging between Germany’s powerhouse car industry and those pleading with Brussels to stick to its flagship green policy, which is designed to help the EU meet its 2050 carbon-neutral target.“We’re sending the right signal to the commission with this letter,” Merz said, adding that the German government wanted to protect the climate in “a technology-neutral way”.Merz has previously said he would do all he could to ensure the 2035 deadline was softened. He has now argued it is vital that hybrid cars are allowed to still be made after 2035.Merz said he would ask for a series of exemptions in his letter, including the right to continue to produce plug-in hybrids, battery hybrids – in which driving charges the battery – and range-extended electric vehicles with “highly efficient” combustion engines as backup to cope with long journeys.“I will ask the commission, even ⁠after 2035, to continue to allow battery-electric vehicles that also have a combustion engine,”‍ ⁠he said. “It is much more opportune and pragmatic to invest more effort and money in the development of efficient, hybrid systems that will combine the best of the world of internal combustion engines on the one hand and electric mobility on the other.”View image in fullscreenA Volkswagen employee works on assembly of an electric ID.3 model in Zwickau. The German government is to introduce a subsidy for buyers of electric or hybrid cars with components largely made in the country.Photograph: Martin Divíšek/EPAThe EU’s planned ban has faced complaints from some automakers that it was unworkable given European drivers’ tepid take-up of electric vehicles.The EU in September said it would fast track a review of its plans to give carmakers more certainty.Merz has repeatedly spoken out against the ban, but he needed to discuss the matter with his centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners before communicating a joint position to the EU.Speaking alongside Merz, the SPD vice-chancellor and finance minister, Lars Klingbeil, said his party agreed with Merz’s centre-right CDU that there had to be changes to the ban. “The future viability of the German automotive industry, securing jobs, that is the key argument for us,” he said. “We agree that the future of the industry is electric … but we need to be open to more technologies, we need flexibility.”The Germancar sector is in crisis, faced with the costs of increasing investment in EVs and fierce Chinese competition that is biting into sales.Speaking alongside Merz and Klingbeil, the head of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, Markus Söder, said the government would introduce a subsidy of up to €5,000 (£4,380) for the purchase of electric or hybrid cars with components largely made in Germany, in an effort to boost the car industry.On Wednesday, theEuropean Commissionvice-president, Stéphane Séjourné, said that the EU was willing to show “flexibility” in how the combustion engine phase-out was achieved, ahead of a commission announcement expected on 10 December.The EU Commission’s chief spokesperson, Paula Pinho, was asked on Friday if the German position would change its direction on the 2035 deadline.“We’re talking of a very, very important proposal that has big implications around Europe,” she said, adding that a consultation on the issue had closed on 10 October. “We will carefully study everything that comes our way, including the position of the German government today.”However, the Swedish carmaker Volvo and its spin-off, Polestar, the only all-electric carmaker in Europe, and hundreds of industries that have already poured money into EVs and battery factories, are vehemently opposed to softening the 2035 date.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryGermanyFriedrich MerzElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionGreenhouse gas emissionsnewsShareReuse this content"

The film is long, atmospheric and as ponderous as the taciturn antihero Meursault, played by Benjamin Voisin, a French settler in Algiers.His failure to show emotion after his mother’s death and cold detachment after he kills “an Arab” on a beach sees him condemned to death by decapitation.In 1967, the Italian director Luchino Visconti made the first film of the novel, starring Marcello Mastroianni, but it was viewed as a failure. Visconti had wanted Alain Delon in the role but was reportedly overruled by the film studio.Nedjib Sidi Moussa, a political scientist, teacher and author of several books on Algeria, said the new film succeeded in conveying the absurdity of Camus’s first novel.“Ozon was faithful to the text in that he accurately conveyed what L’Étranger is: a novel of the absurd. Meursault is not condemned to death for killing an Arab. Colonial justice would not condemn a European to death for killing an indigenous person.“Meurseult is condemned for his indifference, for not crying at his mother’s death, because he has an extramarital relationship and is an atheist. All this clashes with the values of European colonial society and this is why he is condemned. L’Étranger isn’t an anti-colonialist manifesto, Camus is painting a picture of a society he knows well.”View image in fullscreenLuchino Visconti directs Marcello Mastroianni in the first film of the novel, released in 1967.Photograph: ScreenProd/Photononstop/AlamyCamus, who won the 1957 Nobel prize in literature, was born in French Algeria topied noirparents–of French and European descent, born under French colonial rule. As a French citizen, even a poor one, he would have enjoyed rights not afforded to the country’s majority Arabs or Berbers.Sidi Moussa said Ozon had made subtle references to the dehumanising side of colonial society, for colonised and coloniser.“The film is daring and faithful to the book in that respect and with these little personal touches it reconstructs the story to speak to today’s audiences. It’s pretty well done from that point of view,” he said.A review by the cinema programmerJacques Déniel for Causeur magazinewas less enthusiastic.“Ozon’s adaptation fluctuates between a certain fidelity – Mersault’s indifference and lack of human compassion – and blatant betrayal owing to its lack of metaphysical ambition and its politically correct interpretation of the novel,” Déniel wrote.View image in fullscreenOzon’s L’Étranger stars Rebecca Marder and Benjamin Voisin.Photograph: BFA/Gaumont/Alamy“In Camus’s work, absurdity springs from the clash between man and the world. In Ozon’s work, it dissolves into a seamless mise-en-scène. François Ozon’s L’Étranger is a polished, thoughtful, masterful film, but one that lacks inspiration. The film-maker does not adapt Camus: he comments on him.”Catherine Brun, a professor of literature at the Sorbonne, said L’Étranger continued to divide French society because the story was opaque.“The novel remains an enigma on to which everyone can project their own interpretations. Much like Camus,” she said. “It is as much about what is not said; the silences in the book over the question of French colonialism over which there is no consensus.”View image in fullscreenAlbert Camus, photographed in October 1957.Photograph: Smith Archive/AlamyBrun added: “With L’Étranger, Camus can be seen as being on either side of the polemic. He mirrors the tensions and contradictions. Everyone finds something in it to back their argument or settle scores. Nobody can have the last word. As a subject it is inexhaustible.”Camus died in a car crash in January 1960 aged 46. Catherine Camus, 80, his daughter and the custodian of his work, said she liked the film, though she also thought Ozon had fallen victim to political correctness in playing up the role of the murdered Arab’s sister, called Djemila. In the novel neither are named; in the film, the final shot is of her at her brother’s grave marked with his name in Arabic, Moussa Hamdani.“I thought the film was very good but not the role he gave the sister at the end,” Camus said. “She is shown at her brother’s grave; this is not in the book and I felt it was a contradiction. I think François Ozon did it to satisfy wokeism.”Ozon visited Catherine Camus’s home in the village of Lourmarin in Vaucluse, where the author had lived and worked, and told journalists he persuaded her to trust him with the adaptation. “I was very happy about that because I knew she had turned down other film-makers. I was aware of the responsibility that fell on me,” he said.View image in fullscreenFrançois Ozon, Rebecca Marder and Benjamin Voisin attend the film’s premiere at the Venice film festival in September.Photograph: Abaca Press/AlamyIn a statement to theEuropean Film Awards, Ozon said: “It was a huge challenge to adapt a masterpiece that everyone has read and every reader has already visualised and staged in their own mind.”He said giving the Arab’s sister greater presence in the film felt like “pulling on a thread that Camus had woven without developing”.“Djemila … has a conscience and a voice in the film. She is there to bear witness to the fact that, in this story and at the trial, her brother is never mentioned, even though he is the one who was murdered,” he said.“It was important, through her character, to stage how the Arab is rendered invisible, to show that two worlds lived side by side without seeing each other. They did not mix on the streets or the beach. And they certainly did not have the same status. Camus was aware of this unease between the two communities.”Explore more on these topicsFrançois OzonAlbert CamusColonialismAlgeriaFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Show with Mary Todd Lincoln as drunken first lady comes to LondonThe one-act play Oh, Mary! – ‘the stupidest, funniest thing possible’ – to open after blockbuster run in New YorkNadia KhomamiArts and culture correspondentFri 28 Nov 2025 06.29 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 13.21 ESTShareWhat if, in the final weeks before Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, the first lady could not care less about the American civil war and was instead hell-bent on becoming a cabaret star?That is the question posed by Oh, Mary!, the smash-hit show thatreimagines Mary Todd Lincoln as a gloriously unhinged alcoholicwho despises her closeted husband.The 80-minute, one-act play opens in London’s West End next week after a blockbuster run in New York, where it was called“one of the best comedies in years”. It received Tony awards for best leading actor in a play (Cole Escola, who also wrote the show, and became the first non-binary performer to win the award) and best director (Sam Pinkleton).Its runaway success drew a star-studded audience, including Steven Spielberg, Tony Kushner and Sally Field – who made the 2012 drama film Lincoln – as well as Meryl Streep, Robert Downey Jr, Sarah Paulson and Amy Adams. Observers are alreadyasking whether it is “the new Hamilton”.View image in fullscreenRehearsals for Oh, Mary!, from left: Giles Terera, Mason Alexander Park and Kate O’Donnell.Photograph: Manuel HarlanThe acclaim is a long way from the show’s origins in 2009, when Escola conceived of Mary’s miserable life in a simple email sent to themself pondering: “What if Abe’s assassination wasn’t such a bad thing for Mary?”They did no further research.“I wanted to make the stupidest, funniest thing possible,” Escola told the Run-Through with Vogue podcast. “My version of Mary Todd Lincoln is basically just me.“Someone told me the other day, ‘After the show, I had to Google what was true and what wasn’t’. And I was like, ‘Oh no, do not trust my show at all to teach you about Mary Todd Lincoln’.”But they added that there may be some unanticipated similarities with the real Mary, who was often criticised for her lavish spending and lack of emotional restraint. “There’s a telegram that someone sent Abraham Lincoln – it’s now in a museum – that was like, ‘Please come collect your wife, she’s making a fool of herself at this party’.”View image in fullscreenCole Escola accepts the award for best performance by an actor in a leading role at the Tony awards in June.Photograph: Charles Sykes/Invision/APThe US actor Mason Alexander Park, who takes over from Escola as Mary at the Trafalgar theatre inLondon, said they could identify with the character because she is someone who wants to be good at what they do.“I know what it’s like to desperately want something and to feel like there are external factors getting in the way. Everybody knows what it’s like to feel stilted or stuck and not know what to do with the gift you have inside you,” they said.Park, who made their name in recent Jamie Lloyd Shakespeare productions in theWest End, first watched Oh, Mary! on Broadway. “It was one of the most incredible experiences I’ve ever had in the theatre. I called my mom immediately to gush about it. I thought, ‘If there’s one thing I get to do in my lifetime, I would love for it to be this’.”Catherine Clinton, the author of the biography Mrs Lincoln: A Life, and professor of history at the University of Texas at San Antonio, said authenticity was more important to her than accuracy.“Anything that prompts a new look at Mary Lincoln gets my endorsement,” Clinton said. “And Oh, Mary! is a full-frontal pop cultural satire, with high jinks akin to perhaps the British panto. Escola blends several pop culture themes (Lincoln was gay, Mary was a shrew) into an unbelievable but nevertheless enjoyable romp.”How the play fares with British audiences may well determine whether it can become a global pop culture phenomenonon the scale of Hamilton. Park said there were themes that everyone could identify with. “Mary is a mess and a menace. But she’s also someone who really wants to share what they have inside of them. We all want to be seen and loved.”Clinton said Mary “is portrayed as such a melodramatic, larger-than-life character, that she will entertain with or without any historical background”.The theatre critic Michael Billington said British theatres had played host to many plays about American presidents, ranging from Hamilton to the Stephen Sondheim musical Assassins. “Our whole culture, from TV to theatre and narrative fiction, is so steeped in Americana I often suspect that we know more aboutUS politicsthan we do about our own,” he said.For Nancy Durrant, a co-host of the London Theatre Review podcast, the play is more akin to shows such asTitanique,Operation MincemeatandThe Play That Goes Wrongthan Hamilton. “I think the reason it has done so well is that it’s fundamentally ridiculous,” she said. “There’s a strong appetite for well-crafted, tightly written daftness, based on familiar concepts or in familiar settings.“I wouldn’t like to speculate that audience enthusiasm for that kind of thing is the result of a global bin fire, because I think that people have always liked silliness – it’s rooted in joy – but I think the global bin fire probably doesn’t hurt.”View image in fullscreenDino Fetscher and Mason Alexander Park.Photograph: Manuel HarlanThe need to laugh is something Park highlighted too – particularly in a theatre with other people. “The world is quite literally crumbling around us. But it felt like everyone collectively relaxed watching this.”Oh, Mary! is not the only contemporary play about Mary – John Ransom Phillips’s Mrs Presidentopened earlier this year at the Charing Cross theatrein London.Centuries after her death, in the age of TikTok and Instagram, Mary is being afforded a narrative of her own. “She endured the most vicious attacks of any first lady – until Hillary Clinton came along – and was dismissed by Lincoln biographers as a liability for well over a century,” Clinton said. “But she remains unsinkable.”Escola has said their fascination with first ladies began in the third grade because they found the role so fundamentally weird. “You get it if your husband wins something.”But their show has broken ground in ways that go beyond its irreverent take on history, helping to increase visibility of non-binary and trans performers.“Cole winning the Tony was such a remarkable moment,” Park said. “In this political climate, trans identities and non-binary identities are constantly up for debate. Most of the time we’re excluded from those conversations to make it easier to dehumanise us. So it feels special and powerful to be a visible trans performer.”They added: “Oh, Mary! began as small piece of theatre that was meant to be shared amongst friends with the same sense of humour, and then it turned into this massive phenomenon. Diversity creates better art.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreAbraham LincolnLondonUS politicsTransgenderWest EndnewsShareReuse this content"

To her right, a boy’s face is frozen in a Greek tragedy mask of pain. To her left, two other Vietnamese children run away from the bombed village of Trảng Bàng. Behind them, an indistinguishable group of soldiers and, behind them, a wall of black smoke.‘The public has been lied to’: secretly made documentary insists that aliens existRead moreWithin hours of publication in June 1972, the photo, officially titled The Terror of War but colloquially known as Napalm Girl, went the analog version of viral; seen and discussed by millions of people around the world, it’s widely credited with galvanizing public opinion against the US war in Vietnam. Susan Sontag laterwrotethat the horrifically indelible image of nine-year-old Kim Phúc in distress “probably did more to increase the public revulsion against the war than a hundred hours of televised barbarities”. Sir Don McCullin, the legendary British photojournalist who covered the conflict, deemed it the single best photograph of what would later be called “The Television War”. Napalm Girl is, “simply put, one of the most important photographs of anything ever made, and certainly of the Vietnam war”, said Gary Knight, a British photojournalist with decades of combat photography experience.For 53 years, Napalm Girl was credited to Huynh Cong “Nick” Út, a then-21-year-old South Vietnamese photojournalist working for the Associated Press in Saigon. But a controversial new documentary onNetflixargues that the iconic photograph long considered the pinnacle of war journalism – one which brought Út a Pulitzer prize, amid other international acclaim – was actually taken by a different man on the scene in Trảng Bàng that day.According to The Stringer, directed by Bao Nguyen and narrated by Knight, the Terror of War was actually taken by a freelancer, or “stringer”, who sold his photos to the AP. The claim, and the film’s subsequent investigation, originates with a man named Carl Robinson, a former AP photo editor in Saigon who alleges that Horst Faas, the bureau’s legendarily domineering photo chief, ordered him to change the image’s credit from the stringer to Út, the only AP staff photographer on site that day.Robinson, now in his 80s, emailed Knight out of the blue in 2022, seeking a journalist’s help in finding the unknown photographer – should he still be alive, he said, he wanted to offer an apology. Knight thought of the freelance photojournalists he met through his non-profit, the VII Foundation – “the stringers of today”, who, like Vietnamese freelancers during the war, are “often overlooked. Their work is often questioned. They work under much more difficult circumstances. They’re not insured. They don’t have pensions. They don’t have support. They often don’t have good equipment, and they are incredibly vulnerable photographing in their own communities.”Knight wondered: “What must it feel like to be the man who took this photograph, if indeed Nick Út didn’t take it?” As a photographer, he imagined, it would be extraordinarily painful. As a student of photojournalism, particularly the vaunted war photography of Vietnam, it would be earth-shattering, perhaps reputation-threatening. The hallowed legacy of the photograph among Vietnamese-Americans is such that Nguyen, whose parents emigrated during the war, was hesitant to take on the project. “I didn’t want to disrupt this long-held narrative that Nick had taken the photograph,” he said. “And I didn’t want to disrupt the status quo of a community that always looked up to this achievement.”But both Knight and Nguyen agreed: it was worth asking the question. “If journalists are going to hold everybody else in the world to account,” said Knight, “we have to be able to ask difficult questions of ourselves.”The Stringer follows Knight, along with fellow journalists Fiona Turner, Terri Lichstein and Lê Vân, as they pursue their own investigation, from eyewitness interviews, to call-outs in present-day Ho Chi Minh City, to archival research from other footage taken that day (the film-makers say they were not given access to the AP’s archive). Their efforts eventually yield a name: Nguyễn Thành Nghệ, a driver for NBC that day who occasionally sold photographs to international news outlets as a freelancer. In the film, an emotional Nghệ, now also in his 80s and living in California, attests that he sold the photograph to the AP for $20 and a print, only to be haunted by the lack of credit for decades.Nghệ appears, in the film, reserved and thoughtful, but his story proved incendiary within the world of photojournalism. Days before The Stringer’spremiereat the Sundance film festival in January – in which an emotional Nghệ appeared as a surprise guest, assuring through a translator that “I took the photo” – the AP published alengthy reportdisputing the film’s account via its own internal analysis, describing Robinson as a “disgruntled” former employee, and standing by Út, who retired from a distinguished career with the organization in 2017. Several prominent photojournalists dismissed Nghệ’s claim outright, and campaigned against the film’s distribution; others expressed concern, given the current political environment, over any challenge to journalistic credibility. “We had people suggesting that we should drop the investigation because it was a bad time for journalism,” Knight recalled. “But when is there ever a good time?”View image in fullscreenKim Phuc, center, runs with her brothers and cousins, followed by South Vietnamese forces, down Route 1 near Trảng Bàng after a South Vietnamese plane accidentally dropped its flaming napalm on its own troops and civilians on 8 June 1972.Photograph: Nick Ut/AP“The investigation has to live independently of those kinds of concerns,” he added. “The process of self-examination might be inconvenient, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be done.”In May, the AP released a more extensive report andvisual analysiswith new insights – for one, as argued in The Stringer, the photograph was probably captured by a Pentax camera, not a Leica as Út has long claimed. The internal study, based on “extensive visual analysis, interviews with witnesses and examination of all available photos” concluded that it was “possible” Út took the photo. “None of this material proves anyone else did,” the AP said, thus the findings did not meet the “definitive evidence” required by its standards to change the credit. (Út, who declined to participate in The Stringer, has categorically denied the film’s claims, maintained authorship, and threatened to sue for defamation.)Days later, World Press Photo, which awarded Napalm Girl the 1973 Photo of the Year award,releasedits own independent investigation concluding that two people – Nghệ and photographer Huỳnh Công Phúc – were better positioned to take the photo. The organization rescinded Út’s credit but left official authorship unknown, with an open-ended epigraph: “This remains contested history, and it is possible that the author of the photograph will never be fully confirmed.”Findings from both investigations, including details from the AP’s archive, were used to refine the film’s own forensic analysis, conducted independently by the French NGOIndex. The final version, updated from the one screened at Sundance, finds that, based on images taken by and of Út that day, the AP photographer would have had to sprint about 560ft forward, snap the famous photo, then run back 250ft, then turn around to be seen walking toward NBC News cameramen – “an extremely implausible scenario”. Nghệ, they conclude, was in the right position for the shot.All this may seem, to outsiders, like splitting fine hairs, unnecessarily digging into the second-by-second, frame-by-frame, meter-by-meter minutiae for a photograph whose authenticity and import remains unquestioned. Indeed, reading each report, with its flurry of details and assumptions, can feel more confusing than clarifying. But the film-makers maintain that the quest of The Stringer was never about official reattributions – rather, honest reappraisals. Nguyen sees Nghệ as part of a “generation of Vietnamese who left their lives behind, and carried their stories quietly”, and who “still believe that they don’t have the agency and the space to talk about their stories from the past. In many ways, this film was about reclaiming that space, for dignity and truth and memory that is often neglected.”View image in fullscreenNguyễn Thành Nghệ on stage during a Q&A for a screening of The Stringer in Los Angeles, California, on 19 November.Photograph: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for Film IndependentView image in fullscreenNguyễn Thành Nghệ at Sundance.Photograph: Maya Dehlin Spach/Getty Images“I have the utmost respect for AP and news organizations that have upheld journalism for over a century,” he added. “And so I hope that we all can look deep inside ourselves and have a reckoning when it’s necessary.”The Stringer posits a number of overlapping, murky factors for the alleged misattribution: that the Saigon bureau was cutthroat and competitive; that stringers operate on the margins of the profession; that Faas felt some guilt over sending Út’s older brother, Huỳnh Thanh Mỹ, to his death on AP combat assignment in 1965; that Faas could get away with keeping the credit in-house because Vietnamese journalists – particularly non-employees such as Nghệ – were, as Knight put it, “outsiders in their own country” without leverage or recourse.Knight cited a recent event with journalists in London, in which he asked attenders if they knew the names of any Vietnamese war journalists besides Nick Út. None of them did. “To be fair, I couldn’t name anyone other than Nick Út before I started this story, and I’m a student of that war,” he said. “But dozens and dozens of them were working for the foreign press.”Part of the film’s mission, he said, was to re-examine the narration of history – how the story is told, who is doing the telling, who is given the credit. “Vietnamese journalists have really been erased from the narration of their own war,” said Knight. “And I hope that this story won’t only start to rebalance that a little bit, but will also demand of the audience that we examine who is telling today’s stories, and where the power structures in journalism lie.”Both Nguyen and Knight state, for the record, that they have little doubt as to the authorship of the famous photo. But regardless of one’s view, Nguyen said, “I hope people come in watching the film with an open heart and open mind. I think individuals like Nghệ deserve that.”The Stringer: The Man Who Took the Photo is out on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsVietnam warNetflixSundance film festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Co-written with Emily Mortimer, it explores the personas A-listers tend to trade in, and what happens when that starts to fall away. It’s a role right in the centre of Clooney’s comfort zone, and he inhabits it perfectly; imagine the heightened knowingness of Hail, Caesar! twinned with the easy charm of his Nespresso adverts. Plus it helps that he’s backed by a couple of Baumbach all-timers in Adam Sandler and Laura Dern. Catch it now, before all the Oscar buzz kicks in.Friday 5 December, NetflixRuby Gillman, Teenage KrakenView image in fullscreenUnderwater … Ruby Gillman is voiced by Lana Condor in Ruby Gillman Teenage Kraken.Photograph: Universal Pictures/APAn animated family film that didn’t make the splash it deserved to upon release in 2023,Ruby Gillman, Teenage Krakenis a fun riff on every coming-of-age trope. Ruby is a teenage girl whose family bans her from going near the ocean. One day she rebels and immediately discovers why: she is secretly a giant kraken, as is her entire family. Eventually the film lapses into slightly generic action, but if you have kids who like The Little Mermaid (or even Teen Wolf) they’ll have a lot of fun watching all their expectations be subverted.Sunday 30 November, 2.05pm, BBC OneTroll 2View image in fullscreenThe rock … Troll 2.Photograph: Oskar Dahlsbakken/NetflixThe world cinema connoisseurs among you will no doubt remember Troll, the 2022 Norwegian kaiju movie about a giant ancient rock monster that goes on the rampage through Oslo. That film was so successful that a sequel was always bound to happen, and here we are.Troll 2is the largest production of all time in the Nordic countries, and it shows. Epic troll-on-troll action, a troll named Megatroll and a higher focus on humour – witness the scene where influencers grab selfies with a troll before it attacks them – should ensure that the sequel is even more successful.Monday 1 December, NetflixParadeView image in fullscreenGifted … Jacques Tati in Parade.Photograph: Album/AlamyWhile magnificent, Mubi’s recentJacques Tatishowcase did have one intriguing omission, and it’s perhaps his most interesting film. After the vast expense of Playtime failed to recoup its budget, Tati was left so broke he had to sell his house. His final film was this curate’s egg, shot on video and made for Swedish television of all places. There isn’t much to it – it’s ostensibly just a filmed circus performance – but Tati gets to showcase his unbelievable gift for physical comedy and manages to tinker with form just as his greatest films did.Monday 1 December, 1.20am, Talking Pictures TVskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And while the bulk of these will inevitably be about big city types who return home and fall in love with plaid-wearing tree surgeons, others will push the envelope a little. Oh. What. Fun. is one of them.Michelle Pfeiffer(a boon in itself) leads a heaving cast in a relatable story about a family who doesn’t realise how much work Christmas is until the matriarch goes missing.

Depending on which one you like more,The Rosesis either an adaptation of Warren Adler’s 1981 novel or Danny DeVito’s 1989 film. Either way, the story follows Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman as two spouses who become outrageously cruel to one another. The real draw might be the supporting cast, however, which includes Andy Samberg, Kate McKinnon, Ncuti Gatwa, Allison Janney and Jamie Demetriou.Wednesday 3 December, Disney+You Were Never Really HereView image in fullscreenSaves the day … Joaquin Phoenix in You Were Never Really Here.Photograph: Album/AlamyLynne Ramsay might be best known for her films that push the struggles of parenthood to the extreme, likeWe Need to Talk About KevinandDie My Love. But there’s an argument to be made that 2017’sYou Were Never Really Hererepresents her high watermark. A politician’s daughter is kidnapped by human traffickers, and Joaquin Phoenix’s ex-mercenary has to save the day. Though it may sound a bit Jason Stathammy, this is an extraordinarily violent and tender film that will never leave you. A huge accomplishment.Friday 5 December, 1.50am, Film4Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe seven best films to watch on TV this weekGeorge ClooneyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last week, he wrapped up a run of shows in Australia and New Zealand. Tomorrow, the UK leg of his Can’t Stop Me Now tour opens in Cardiff, finishing at the Royal Albert Hall on 9 December. He was the artist who opened the British rock’n’roll era, with Move It in 1958, and after 67 years he is still selling out big rooms.To the uninitiated, Sir Cliff’s continued presence is at best a mystery, and at worst an affront to taste. That is to misunderstand him: Sir Cliff doesn’t operate in the music business – despite his gripes with it – so much as in the Cliff Richard business. When he disappeared from national radio, to his great distress, it was because he had long since ceased to operate in a world recognisable to the rest of pop.View image in fullscreenNational institution … Cliff Richard sings to Centre Court at Wimbledon in 2022.Photograph: Simon M Bruty/Getty ImagesThe writer Richard Williams predicted this future as far back as 1980, when the singer was having a revival off the back of a run of sleek MOR hits such as Carrie and We Don’t Talk Anymore. “Perhaps he will become the next century’s Vera Lynn,” Williams wrote in the Times, and that is more or less what he has become – a performer to commemorate Christmases and royal anniversaries. A national institution rather than a national treasure.How has he managed to endure? “He asks himself that an awful lot,” says Ian Gittins, who has ghostwritten two books for Sir Cliff, including his autobiography The Dreamer. “His contemporaries when he started were Billy Fury, Marty Wilde and Adam Faith, and he said to me two or three times, ‘How am I still going?’ He’s extraordinarily tenacious and incredibly driven, probably more driven than anyone else I’ve interviewed over the years. And he still cares about his career.”He remains fit, too. He plays tennis twice a week and goes to the gym, Gittins says. And while he has long regretted never breaking America, the fact that his fame is confined to the UK and the Antipodes means he seldom plays more than 30 shows a year – his schedule is not as physically gruelling as, say, a big Stones tour (Mick Jagger is 82).At Sir Cliff’s shows, the adoration is as fervent as that for the Gallagher brothers at this summer’s Oasis reunion: it’s just expressed a little more sedately, by a rather different demographic, principally women within a few years in age of their hero. The relationship between artist and fans is extremely gentle. “He’s very fond of them,” Gittins says. “And they’re extraordinarily fond and protective of him. They have grown up and grown old with him – they’ve seen him go through the ups and downs. But he can’t attract new fans, because he doesn’t get radio play.”View image in fullscreenGrowing up and growing old with his fans … Cliff Richard  opens the Alexandra Rose Day Market at Seymour Hall, London in March 1970.Photograph: Express/Getty ImagesThe cleaving of Cliff from mainstream pop came in the mid-60s. Though he was already a clean-cut family entertainer, the records he had been making with the Shadows were decent, peppy beat pop. But just as UK pop culture went into overdrive, he fully embraced Christianity, and in 1966 – the year of the Beatles’ Revolver – he toured the UK not as a rock singer, but as a preacher (contemporary accounts say he needed a large security contingent to deal with the fans who had not yet followed him in renouncing lust). From that point on, no matter the records he made, he was always exiled from pop’s centre.Cliff Richard: Rise Up review – don’t call it a comeback | Alexis Petridis’ album of the weekRead moreNot that it necessarily harmed him. Young female fans often remain very loyal as they age – as Take That and Westlife have found to their benefit – and Sir Cliff has rarely shown any interest in anything other than satisfying them. He rarely gives interviews, and when he does it is to outlets that cater to the people he wants to reach: sometimes to the Daily Mail, more often to Christian newspapers and magazines. That is perhaps wise, given that two separate TV interviews in November 2023 went viral owing to their cringe-worthiness. It has also, perhaps, prevented his genuinely important legacy being reassessed: he doesn’t talk to the publications who would love to run such pieces.But somewhere behind that perma-smiling, perma-tanned face still lurks the raw rock’n’roller who once electrified Britain. “I’ve just finished writing a book with Jimmy Tarbuck,” Gittins says, “who was on tour with Cliff in the late 50s, when they were both 18 or 19. And he said the girls were going crazy, that you couldn’t hear yourself think. And all the mums hated Cliff because they thought he was a sex object.”Explore more on these topicsCliff RichardPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

A new guidebook from Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore may change his mindAlexis PetridisFri 28 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 08.36 ESTShareIn the 1980s, Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore asked his friend, the writerByron Coley, to furnish him with a selection of jazz tapes to listen to on tour. Moore had experienced New York’s fabled avant-garde jazz loft scene first-hand in the late 1970s but “wasn’t so clued in”, he says. “Perhaps I was too young and too preoccupied by the flurry of activity in punk and no wave.” Now, he was keen to learn more.View image in fullscreen‘Freedom to experiment’ … Thurston Moore.Photograph: Vera MarmeloThe tapes, “of Coltrane, Mingus, Dolphy, Sun Ra, Monk et al”, led him by degrees to free jazz: the style of jazz unmoored from standard rhythms and phrasings, resulting in arguably the most challenging and far-out music one can listen to. “A music both liberated and yet wholly indebted to the learned techniques of its tradition” is how Moore enthusiastically describes it. “In some ways, it’s similar to noise and art rock, where the freedom to experiment with open form comes from a scholarship of the music’s historical lineage … truly a soul music, both political and spiritual.”Moore became a longstanding booster of this music. Sonic Youth played live with fabled avant-garde jazz ensemble the New York Art Quartet, while Moore released free jazz albums on his own Ecstatic Peace! label. His latest project is the bookNow Jazz Now: 100 Essential Free Jazz and Improvisation Recordings 1960-80, co-written with Coley and Swedish saxophonist Mats Gustafsson.An attempt to counter what he calls “dry and academic writing” on the subject – “enthusiasm is key, we didn’t want to couch it in too much of a smarty-pants vibe” – the book is intended to introduce the music to a broader audience. It is beautifully assembled, featuring some fabulously engaging two-fisted writing (“Many listeners deny it’s jazz of any kind,” offers the entry for a 1980 album byBorbetomagus, “but those bow-tie ass-wipes can take a flying fuck at the moon”) and it comes with a foreword by Neneh Cherry. She grew up with many of the albums mentioned in the book, thanks to her stepfather, Don Cherry, a trumpeter who worked with Ornette Coleman, the saxophonist who invented the term free jazz with the 1961 album of the same name. “I feel that I know free jazz as a spirit,” she writes. “I’ve thought about it as a commitment and a necessity, such as food.”View image in fullscreenDon Cherry at the Louvre, 1967.Photograph: © Philippe Gras/Courtesy of Suong GrasNevertheless, it’s tempting to say that Moore and co have their work cut out for them. Free jazz, Moore says, “was critically derided”, often described as “noise, or nonsense”. NowJazzNow recommends Free Fall, a 1963 album by Jimmy Giuffre, a celebrated west coast clarinettist and key figure in the development of “cool” jazz, but notes that its release was “a complete commercial failure … Giuffre took a 10-year hiatus from recording afterwards”. He also disbanded the trio who made it after a gig at which they made 35 cents each. Early on, major labels and august jazz institutions, including Impulse!, were willing to dabble, but very swiftly it became the province of tiny independents and musicians self-releasing their work.Decades later, it still seems to carry a uniquely forbidding aura to the average listener, as Joakim Haugland – who runs the Oslo-based label Smalltown Supersound – attests. A Sonic Youth fan, he discovered free jazz via an album Moore released –Arthur Doyle’s Alabama Feeling– and was instantly smitten, recognising the same unpredictablility he’d found at punk and alt-rock gigs. “I had become very tired of live gigs, because I felt they were more of the same: people were dressing up and doing the right moves,” he says. “Free jazz is something created on the spot; you can recognise when it works and doesn’t work. I love the fact that some parts of the concert are 100% connected and sometimes they drift apart. It’s about feelings, physicality, happening in the moment.”Haugland’s label is best known for releasing dance music, by Lindstrøm, Todd Terje and Kelly Lee Owens, among others. It also releases a lot of free jazz, but “not because it’s selling; it’s something I need to do for myself”. He has also published a book on the subject, Johannes Rød’s exhaustiveFree Jazz and Improvisation on LP and CD 1965-2024. But, as Haugland cheerfully admits: “I almost always play free jazz in hiding, when I’m alone, because people think I’m mad to listen to it, that it’s impossible to like. There’s an old expression: ‘It sounds like Polish free jazz or something.’ Like ‘Polish free jazz’ was the worst thing in the world.”I know what he means. I am not a listener who requires music to be melodic or rhythmically straightforward. I am the proud owner of the notorious Swans live albumPublic Castration Is a Good Idea– the original, I might add, not the recent reissue – and an 11-album box set of recordings from the extreme electronic labelCome Organisation, hours of wilfully hideous noise for which I happily shelled out nearly 300 quid a few years back. I genuinely love Lou Reed’s Metal Machine Music and prefer Yoko Ono’s early 70s albums to those of her husband. And I love jazz, a late-flowering passion, and not just the perennially hip stuff: I’m as happy listening to Fats Waller or Duke Ellington’s late 20s Columbia recordings as I am Bitches Brew or Coltrane’s Africa/Brass. And yet, somehow, free jazz has remained a closed book to me.View image in fullscreen‘Furious and unremitting’ … Peter Brötzmann live at Cafe Oto, London, 10 February 2023.Photograph: Dawid Laskowski/The GuardianBoth Moore and Haugland are kind enough to offer recommendations for a relative neophyte.

Haugland opts forJoe McPhee’s Tenor, which he describes as “poetry; I feel like McPhee is pouring his whole soul through the saxophone”, andSilent Tongues, a 1975 live album by pianist Cecil Taylor, a titanic figure in free jazz. (If you want an idea of how reviled the genre is in some quarters, hasten to Ken Burns’ epic, beautifully researched, hugely illuminating but crushingly conservative 2001 documentary series Jazz, in which Taylor’s approach to music is dismissed as “bullshit”). “I love to listen to it on low volume, as it fills my living room with an emotion I cannot describe,” says Haugland. “To me it is relaxing and beautiful.”Peter Brötzmann obituaryRead moreI’d heard of Brötzmann’s Machine Gun, an album preceded by its reputation as a particularly confrontational listen, but even one of the best-known free jazz albums is harder to find than you’d think: it’s been removed from streaming services and YouTube, and vinyl pressings are the province of secondhand retailers. I eventually find it on the Internet Archive, and discover that its advance publicity was not exaggerated. It’s furious and completely unremitting, like a bomb that won’t stop going off for the best part of an hour.And yet I don’t find it unlistenable at all, perhaps because I can contextualise it culturally. Brötzmann was part of the same artistic ferment that gave the world krautrock, and Machine Gun strikes me as grappling with the same issues as Can or Faust: how to make original music, with an identity distinct from Anglo-American musical traditions, in a country whose own sense of national identity had been horribly scarred. Its sound also seems to speak loudly of the tumult and upheaval of 1968, which means it works perfectly amid the tumult of 2025. And if you like Haugland’s idea of free jazz as analogous to the unpredictable wildness of a punk gig, well, here’s the evidence.It also works as a kind of palate cleanser: everything else I’m recommended feels positively dulcet by comparison, a breeze. On Afrodisiaca’s 21-minute title track, long passages of solo trumpet or fluttering woodwind give way to ominous silences or explosive, rattling crescendos, to startling effect. The tracks on side two feel less structured, but they never completely give up on the idea of melody.View image in fullscreen‘Fascinating complexity’ … Cecil Taylor.Photograph: INA/Getty ImagesI try Cecil Taylor’s Silent Tongues on low volume, as recommended, but that doesn’t work at all. It’s too complex and distracting to act as ambient music. Nevertheless, there’s something fascinating about its complexity – and as with Brötzmann in post-Nazi Germany, there is a political implication to Black artists determinedly expressing their freedom in a US that so often denied it.The astonishingly dextrous runs on Silent Tongues’ Jitney No 2 show incredible artistic technique being put to an alternative use. I don’t respond to it in the purely emotional way Haugland does, but it draws me closer to what Moore said about free jazz being “wholly indebted to the learned techniques of its tradition”. It’s not so much musicians doing exactly what they want, more that they are guided through the idea of free self-expression by what they already know – a useful corrective to the commonly held notion that it’s a racket anyone could make.‘It didn’t adhere to any of the rules’: the fascinating history of free jazzRead moreBut with Joe McPhee’s Tenor, I do get that instinctive emotional response. The sound of McPhee playing, unaccompanied, in a Swiss farmhouse, it is immediately and completely spellbinding. It shifts from a kind of melancholy, bluesy lyricism to piercing discordancy, carrying you along with them. However far out it gets, nothing about it feels jarring or difficult – the opposite of Machine Gun, which feels like being pinned against the wall. You’d have to pick your moment and mood with the latter – not that I have a problem with that – but not with Tenor: you could call it beautiful without fear of being seen as deliberately contrary.I’m not sure how many of the other albums in Now Jazz Now would fit that description, but, in Thurston Moore’s view at least, exploration is the point. “The records are the research,” he says, “and the research is the spirit of so much of this music’s essential vocabulary. Research and reveal and join the revolution of the free!” Perhaps I will.Now Jazz Now: 100 Essential Free Jazz and Improvisation Recordings 1960-80 is published by Ecstatic Peace Library on 5 December.

The audience at this month’s sellout gig at St Pancras Old Church in London includedPerfume Geniusand members of theLast Dinner Partyandthe Horrorsand their self-released second album, Ink & Oil, is picking up rave reviews. One used the term “emotional flood” to describe the album’s epic, baroque pop, big pianos and drums, sweeping choruses and Travis Warner’s lush, cinematic orchestrations.Storefront Church is singer-songwriter/producer Lukas Frank and his various collaborators. The son of Scott Frank, director of Netflix’s The Queen’s Gambit, he was a session drummer in his teens, touring with Portland rockers Portugal the Man and playing with Perfume Genius and his childhood friend Phoebe Bridgers before striking out to make his own music. His connections undoubtedly made this easier. His first album, 2021’s As We Pass, pulled Diiv guitarist Zachary Cole Smith into his melancholy, slowcore world; he and Bridgers also put out a mesmerising cover of Low’s Words in tribute to the band’s late Mimi Parker. But Frank has also put in the hard yards, working as a teacher and a waiter while making music.Now 27, he has also dug deep emotionally to fire his hymnal songs, turbulent live performances and impassioned covers (including Roxy Music’s More Than This and the Sisters of Mercy’s Lucretia, My Reflection). A storefront church, incidentally, is “a place of worship, housed in a former shop or restaurant”, so it’s an appropriate moniker for the praise heading his way.Dave SimpsonThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenThinking out of the box … Flowerovlove.Photograph: Peter O’SullivanFlowerovlove – WishlistThe UK pop star channels Phil Spector’s girl groups, 80s festive chintzy synths with a vaporwave twist and Sabrina Carpenter’s cheekiness (“You know I’m teeny / Fit in your stocking”) on the best original Christmas song in recent memory.LS​The Null Club – Overgrown (ft Miss Grit)Irish post-punks Gilla Band have always nodded to industrial techno.

To mark the milestone comes String of Hearts, a collection of covers and remixes featuring an all-star cast of friends and collaborators, from next-gen underground favourites like Coby Sey to fellow old-school experimentalists Liars. This brilliant, genre-agnostic record allows you to trace the breadth of the Melbourne band’s shapeshifting sound, echoes of which can now be found all over underground and commercial music, without leaning too hard on nostalgia.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for String of HeartsThe record spans HTRK’s early hits right up to their most recent albumRhinestones, a period in which they’ve shifted from a darker, industrial palette to warmer territory. Not that you’d be able to tell here: instrumentals are reshaped by Loraine James’s IDM-style glitches and Zebrablood’s atmospheric breaks, while Jonnine Standish’s disaffected vocals are transformed into desperate alien wails by Liars.Some tracks are warped beyond recognition, using just a synth or lyric as a jumping-off point. The gruff, brooding Ha is reinvented by sound artist Perila into an ambient composition so sweeping and gorgeous it veers towards the sublime – the only perceptible similarity lingers in the layered rendition of those once-sneering vocals. Siren Song, originally a 49-second interlude, is stretched out by Kali Malone and Sunn O)))’s Stephen O’Malley into a droning six-minute soundscape, where the simple, mumbled lyric is repeated like an absent-minded mantra.Others lurk more closely to the original tracks, but with exciting adjustments: Sharon Van Etten’s cover of Poison has less smog and more kick; Double Virgo’s take on Rentboy adds percussion, strings and peppy discordance. These are the standout moments, but it’s hard to fault any of the tracks here: all feel imaginative yet faithful to the magic of HTRK.Also out this monthThe mysterious Belgian-Italian duoSexo y Fantasiaremould their low-slung cosmic synth sound into something darker on their brilliant third albumTrabajando El Flex(Pinkman). The icy synths, robotic vocals and skulking dub undertones, paired with their signature erotic themes, conjure up an image of some seedy, haunted club.Radioweaveris the latest record from London-based artistthe Narrator, also of the collective, label and self-proclaimed “gesamtkunstwerk” Life Is Beautiful. Across the eight tracks, dreamy vocals interlace with instrumentals that are both lovely and uncanny, where celestial synthsand strings are occasionally interrupted by glitching samples and unexpected turns. Inspired by theatre, Fellini and dreams,Cinecittàx(Disques de la Spirale), the debut album by Brussels-based artistChe Vuoiis as eccentric as you might expect. In these jittery, lo-fi collages, there are elements of spoken word, post-punk, cabaret and downtempo electronic music, complete with nature samples and toybox percussion.Explore more on these topicsMusicExperimental album of the monthAustralian musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

A new anthology of 10 stories set across England, Bog People, brings together some of the most accomplished names in the genre.In her introduction, editor Hollie Starling describes an ancient ritual in a Devon village: the rich throw heated pennies from their windows, watching those in need burn their fingers. Folk horror by its nature is inherently connected to class and hierarchy. Reverence for tradition is a double-edged sword – or a burning-hot coin.She also notes the complexity of self-identification as working-class. “For the purposes of this collection,” Starling writes, “contributors were asked to consider if they grew up in circumstances of low social, cultural and economic capital and/or asset wealth, and that regardless of their current circumstances and lifestyle that they could write authentically from that point of view.”Many of these stories, including those by AK Blakemore, Daniel Draper and Jenn Ashworth, begin with funerals and loss. Draper’s story about an eternal stew, passed around a village from house to house, hob to hob, will haunt my dreams. Every family contributes meat and keeps it bubbling on and on. Some of the stew is eaten by the heads of family on the occasion of a significant death, then it’s returned to its endless progress round the village. I will not spoil the recipe.In Emma Glass’s Carole, a receipt from Clarks shoe shop stirs echoes of the famous six-word story attributed to Hemingway: “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.” Carole, bereft at the loss of her daughter, walks from a city courthouse to Stonehenge at dawn and then on and on, through a feverish vision of moors and motorways, to Dartmoor, nights and days passing like moments.The rain stops, the sun shows, another night comes dark and flowing with energy. I don’t sleep; I feel my way through the landscape, the trees that reach and catch my shirt sleeves, holding on to me, saving me from slipping on mossy roots, the unfriendly gorse keeping me at a distance, saying don’t step here, stopping me from tearing my feet on its throne of thorns. Stars alive, alight, I wish you could see them…Starling’s own story, Yellowbelly, begins with urgent sex between a man and his AI companion. He resets her because she is too working-class, too independent. “I toggle Regional down to 50% for now and look over the other options. My cursor hovers over Independent Expression. Hmm.”Several authors, in particular Blakemore, who opens the collection, show the world through the eyes of a protagonist whose views embody elitism, class consciousness and bias, the insidious effects of which are passed down the generations. However, the overarching theme of Bog People is sometimes conspicuous by its absence. Class is in the far background. Maybe that’s the point; it is normalised.Protagonists are in conversation with the past, with the land and with the polarising nature of national identityWhere the collection excels is the winding path it takes through horror, folklore and the gothic; through families, oral history and grief. Many stories are highly stylised, told through interruption, song, signs in churches, receipts or textual irregularity. As Starling observes: “In folk horror the soil beneath our feet is seismically unstable. Our closest kin are unknowable and depraved, bound by unseen influences.” The prose follows suit. Critical information and dialogue is often framed in italics, as if removing it from the normal world of human expression. But human relationships are not always the most important ones here. The writers and their protagonists are in conversation with the past, with the land, with the polarising and sometimes toxic nature of national identity.Occasionally the prose overbalances, spelling out characters’ intentions and the ramifications of their actions, emptying out subtext as if the authors don’t trust the reader to intuit their purpose. But the collection remains an urgent reminder that this form and genre must be nurtured. In every story certain passages stand out in stark silhouette. There is the chilling simplicity of the line from Ashworth’s The Hanging Stones: “but the candles couldn’t be returned to the box once they’d been lit”.

These stories trawl the meaning of life, of death and birth, asking who we were and what we are. They’re about justice and superstition and sorrow, about crawling back from – and towards – the abyss.Bog People: A Working-Class Anthology of Folk Horror edited by Hollie Starling is published by Chatto & Windus (£18.99).

The lives of those Edwardian children seemed as rich as a plum pudding, with their knickerbockers and their ironies, their cook and their sophisticated vocabulary. I didn’t understand, in my childhood, that they were separated from me by a gulf of time and change. Because of books, the past seemed to be happening in the next room, as if I could step into it effortlessly.The book that changed me as a teenagerI hated the girls’ grammar school I went to, and in revenge filled my break times with historical novels by Jean Plaidy. These flooded the oppressive grey world of the school with their glorious drama, pregnancies and deformities and adulteries, messengers eating their own shoe leather because they brought bad news.The writer who changed my mindWhen I moved myself to the comprehensive school, we studied the Liverpool poets and Stan Barstow. Then a new teacher read us An Horatian Odeby Andrew Marvell, on the execution of Charles I.You can’t tell what side he’s on …New possibilities of subtlety in writing opened up.The book that made me want to be a writerAll the books I loved, from the beginning, made me want to try. Storytelling was the most powerful magic I knew: it got expressed first in the games I played out with my friends. Written down though, words were puny for such a long time. Encountering the intricacy of Henry James’s fiction – What Maisie Knewfirst– stirred up that longing intensely, to make something intricate and alive on the page. But it defeated the longing at the same time – because who could match this?Theauthor I came back toVladimir Nabokov was too slippery, I couldn’t get hold of him; Speak, Memorywas my way in eventually. When I knew what he made of his own life, I began to understand his ironies, his account of America.The book I rereadWhen I first read Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina I was Kitty’s age, then I longed to be gorgeously amorous like Anna, then I was worn down with domesticity and children like Dolly. Now I’m closer to the old countess at the end of the book, growing irrelevant in the margins.The author I could never read againWell, probably Jean Plaidy …The book I discovered later in lifeFor a long time I thought that I wouldn’t like Anita Brookner; I’d got the idea, for some foolish reason, that she was perfumed and ladylike. Then I opened Latecomers and knew from the first sentence how wrong that was. When you discover a new author their work stretches out before you, an undiscovered continent.The book I am currently readingI’m a fan of Jean-Philippe Toussaint, and I’ve just finished his short novel Reticence.A man with his baby son in a pushchair visits a coastal town desolate with absence. It’s a little skit and a mockery really, a crime drama with no crime apart from a dead cat, and yet its repetitions are deliciously hypnotic, the moon and the sea and the empty house …skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The original Outer Worlds dazzled our eyeballs with its art nouveau palette and charmed our ears with witty dialogue, sucking us into a classic mystery-unravelling story in one of my favourite “little man versus evil corporate overlords” worlds since Deus Ex. It didn’t have the most original combat, but that didn’t matter: it was obviously a labour of love from a team totally invested in the telling of this tale, and we all fell under its spell.Well, when I say all of us, I mean myself and the three kids. My wife did not play The Outer Worlds, because none of those worlds featured Crash Bandicoot. But the rest of us dug it, and the kids particularly enjoyed that I flounced away from the final boss battle after half a day of trying, declaring that I hadpretty muchcompleted the game and that was good enough for a dad with other things to do.My son completed The Outer Worlds 2 first. “How was it?” I asked.“You are going to hate it,” he replied.What? How dare he have the arrogance to predict my gaming tastes! If it wasn’t for me, none of these urchins would have played a video game in the first place. It’s bad enough that they destroy me at Mario Kart. Now they’re robbing me of potential gaming joy. I was now determined to enjoy The Outer Worlds 2 just to prove him wrong.Reader: I did not enjoy it.View image in fullscreenMost of the dialogue is people moaning about their bosses … The Outer Worlds 2.Photograph: Obsidian EntertainmentWhile the combat is top notch, the character skill trees sophisticated, and the speed and smoothness (on the Xbox Series X version) unmatched (especially when rushing away from combat as an ageing gamer is wont to do), the story is awful.The first hour of play hits you with so much tedious factional politics it makes the opening crawl of The Phantom Menace look like Serious Sam. Most of the dialogue is people moaning about their bosses or their charges. Everything is broken. People are starving and miserable, bereft of doctors and medical supplies. It’s basically 2025 but in space, expressed in words so clunky and boring that it feels like reading through LinkedIn comments.“I was right, wasn’t I?” said my son smugly, when I gave up after 20 hours, on the third planet I visited.“How can you tell?”“I haven’t heard you curse at a game this much since you played online Fifa.”“How did they get it so wrong, son?” I asked.“There’s no real heart and soul in the game. They just phoned in the story.”Then we talked. At length. About role-playing games in general; what works and what doesn’t; what makes some great and others tedious. And we agreed that RPGs require a storyteller’s commitment to make it believable. This genre has its roots in Dungeons & Dragons, which in essence is just people sitting in a basement conjuring up great stories. If the Dungeon Master is no good, it’s just a number-crunching, dice-rolling slog but, with a storyteller in charge, it is magic. World building is crucial, too: the lush highlands of Skyrim, the dark conspiracy-poisoned streets of Deus Ex, the techno-magical dystopia of Gaia in Final Fantasy VII.And, like tabletop D&D, the graphics don’t really matter. Decades ago, I spent a brilliant month inside the batshit crazy apocalyptic demonic faith-fest that is Shin Megami Tensei, and that whole world was conjured from tiny pixels on the screen of a Game Boy Advance.View image in fullscreenMy weak bladder and need for sleep were the only things that ever dragged me away from the inhabitants of The Witcher 3.Photograph: CD Projekt REDThat world must have characters you care about. My weak bladder and inconvenient need for sleep were the only things that ever dragged me away from the inhabitants of The Witcher 3. But I couldn’t care less about any of the characters in The Outer Worlds 2; I felt I had seen them all before. Throw in the needlessly dense, grey dialogue and I couldn’t stay focused on the game for longer than five minutes outside battles.In a real world where we have less control than ever, when “truth” is just what the richest liar purports and fairness has been eradicated, it’s increasingly difficult to win in life by working hard. That is what makes the genuine meritocracy of role-playing games so appealing to me. In all video games, if you have skill (or develop it), then you can progress. But in RPGs, even if you weren’t born with talent, you can work hard, grind up levels, and get more skills that lead to more rewards. In contrast to a horrible world that has 3,000 billionaires and yet still leaves most of its inhabitants living in poverty, RPGs are a model of what a just world would be like – with added armour and shields, and hopefully fast travel points.The Outer Worlds 2 was a disappointment for me, but instead of escaping into an immersive RPG as I had hoped, I instead escaped into a glorious chat with my son about them. Again, I realised how much games have given our lives, and how they’ve deepened our relationship with each other. And I realised that sometimes a game’s terrible dialogue can spark a fascinating one in the real world.Explore more on these topicsGamesXbox series S/XfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They stop mid-sentence, floating under his spell, lanterns shining in the frozen night. Sergo Vares’ malevolent clown, dressed in half tux, half tutu, has chaos in his veins. In this wintery co-production between Headlong and the Globe, comedy and horror sit cheek by jowl, as director Holly Race Roughan conjures a nightmarish take on Shakespeare’s classic dream.Vares’ crow-like Puck, a nimble shapeshifter, may be the face of the dark deeds in this frosty landscape, but Michael Marcus’s Oberon is the vengeful controller, his every action designed to get his hands on the young girl (Pria Kalsi) in Titania’s care. By shifting the show’s centre of gravity to revolve around this changeling, Roughan brings the play’s brutal undercurrents roaring to the surface.View image in fullscreenMalevolent clown … Sergo Vares as Puck.Photograph: Helen MurrayThe King and Queen of the fairies’ feud over the stolen child has shaken up the seasons like a snow globe. This typically summertime show glides smoothly into a winter’s tale on Max Johns’ spotless white set, candles flickering above. Cloaked in luscious, heavy furs, the lost lovers leap at each other’s throats at every opportunity, Demetrius (Lou Jackson) and Helena (Tara Tijani) locked in an aggressive, sultry power play, while a softer, sweeter love moves between Lysander (David Olaniregun) and Hermia (Tiwa Lade).With magic in the air, CS Lewis’s White Witch could be just about to stumble on stage. But these woods are already full, with our practising players and watchful fairies. The latter are conjured here as black-tulled ballerinas, their melancholic renditions of pop songs the one off-key note in this otherwise aesthetically assured production. Attentive restaurant staff serve as our players, with Danny Kirrane’s head chef Bottom repeatedly stealing the stage. His ass is given no pointed ears but a pair of cloven boots, wrestled on to him by Puck, which have Hedydd Dylan’s gothic Titania hurling herself at his hooves.When the players finally perform their show, muddles and marriages all sorted, Roughan sets out a strikingly sinister and surprisingly bloody reinterpretation of the finale. Collapsing the distance between the worlds of reality and illusion, this chilling end gives a new, electric explanation for Puck’s apologetic epilogue. “If we shadows have offended,” he says innocently, swinging his legs like a child and ignoring the wet smear of blood streaked across the pristine white snow.AtSam Wanamaker Playhouse, London, until 31 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsA Midsummer Night's DreamTheatreShakespeare's GlobereviewsShareReuse this content"

Six weeks in to her first major concert tour in a decade, she arrived at the Royal Albert Hall to lead what in some ways felt like a celebration – a sort of super-polished jam session, punctuated by friendly, unpolished chat from the stage. Musically, though, if this were a party she was serving canapes – lots of small, delicious things, but not quite a proper meal.And yet those bite-size pieces offered a lot of enjoy. Benedetti’s supporting ensemble is an unconventional but inspired combo of cello, guitar and accordion: Maxim Calver, Plínio Fernandes and Samuele Telari were tight, flexible and responsive partners, and together the quartet created some intriguing sonorities, which came across in this hall better than some of the finer details.The music fell loosely into three categories. There were the romantic salon pieces, including beautifully done arrangements of the Sicilienne attributed to Maria Theresia von Paradis but written by Samuel Dushkin, and Debussy’s Beau Soir. Benedetti’s generous tone and velvety phrasing could have been made for these; the supporting trio, sounding beautifully relaxed, conjured an ambience that explained the title ofViolin Café, the recording released to accompany the tour.Then there were Scottish folk tunes, for which the players were joined by Fin Moore on the smallpipes, first providing just the drone background, then taking up the melody as Benedetti extemporised above. The encore, Peter Maxwell Davies’s Farewell to Stromness, harked back to these.And – in case anyone might have thought that the job of running the Edinburgh international festival would have dented Benedetti’s rock-solid technique – there were the show-off numbers: a Wieniawski polonaise and Paganini caprices, with No. 1 performed solo, as written, and No 24 given in a sparky arrangement that arguably lost some of the wow factor given that all those notes weren’t coming from just one violin. For Sarasate’s Navarra, a virtuoso but formulaic violin duet, Benedetti brought on Emma Baird as her partner. The same composer’s Carmen Fantasy was the final showstopper from a violinist still at the top of her game.At the Lighthouse, Poole, on Saturday, thentouring in the UKuntil 4 December.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicNicola BenedettireviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a poem to rest inside, with its gently tumbling sentences and twinkling memories of Christmases past.Emma Rice’s exquisite adaptation shares these qualities. There are just five performers – one pianist and four actors – but they bring a flurry of characters to life. There is a little bit of magic in every scene, all of which glow with a very Thomas-esque combination of hope and melancholy.The ensemble performs in theEmma RiceCompany’s new home, a converted church in Frome. It’s tiny. The audience sits on plastic chairs and – perhaps this is just Thomas’s poem casting its spell on me – but it feels like the memory of past communal gatherings lingers here. When encouraged to join in with the carols, the audience responds quickly and with relish. We throw snowballs and socks at the actors and pass around family photos of the characters in the play, handling them as fondly as if they’re our own.View image in fullscreenPassion and clarity … Katy Owen in A Child’s Christmas in Wales.Photograph: Steve TannerThe stage is backed by two giant weathered wooden doors, with the adults mostly inside and the children on the outside. It’s a doll’s house, a chocolate box theatre, an Advent calendar being opened. Inside sit the uncles and aunts, “like faded cups and saucers”. Outside the kids roam. In one scene, the children walk through the town in the pitch black and imagine dinosaurs roaming the street. The delicious joy of being afraid when you’re young and the relief of returning home (“everything was good again”) radiates from the tiny stage.The ensemble shines. Tom Fox excels at clowning and contorting his face in every way possible; narrator Katy Owen reads Thomas’s poem with such passion and clarity; Robyn Sinclair’s singing has a lovely vulnerability to it; Ian Ross’s songs wind gracefully through the whole production and Simon Oskarsson’s trumpet playing could just about stop time. It isn’t perfect and a framing device about Thomas feels forced and unnecessary. But it isn’t meant to be perfect. It’s Christmas: maddening, difficult and sometimes impossibly sad. Yet somehow still special, full of love, music and moments to remember.AtThe Lucky Chance, Frome, until 21 DecemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreEmma RiceDylan ThomasreviewsShareReuse this content"

The real-life story of the Von Trapp family’s flight from occupied Austria may contain lashings of melody and a prickle-eyed love story – but it also becomes a tale of personal loss, political integrity and the healing power of music.This was Rodgers and Hammerstein’s final musical together – Hammerstein, the lyricist, died just months after the opening in 1959 – and the tunes don’t hang about. The title song launches a first half driven by Maria’s dreams and desires, especially her love for the widowed Captain von Trapp. Molly Lynch’s tremendous Maria, scrambling through pools and over rocks on Michael Taylor’s mountain set, has rambunctious vim – more pagan than pious. Endearingly full-throttle, she launches into her numbers with a guitar hero flourish.View image in fullscreenFamily flight … the Von Trapps in The Sound of Music.Photograph: Marc BrennerThis was far from the only musical Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote about damaged men and surrogate mothers. Here, David Seadon-Young’s walking wounded Captain is bearishly ill at ease, caught in the grief that disfigures his enjoyment of family life.He seems even more lost in what is predominantly a musical world of high, female voices, harmonising in unison: nuns (warmly led by Joanna Riding’s abbess), piping children, blazing Maria. Male authority, especially after the Anschluss, is confined to flat, humourless dialogue. The valet eavesdrops, the telegraph lad collaborates, and the first Hitler salute we see cools the mood considerably.Foster’s production ripples with feeling, especially in the first half. This is also where the bangers live, tune after lilting tune. Hammerstein’s lyrics are drolly unforced (“underneath her wimple she has curlers in her hair”) and Rodgers’ melodies filtered to alpine purity. The second half is busy with plot and reprises – though Seadon-Young delivers Edelweiss with a memorably forlorn defiance.The show’s central characters are adrift with loss: Lynch’s Maria helps them all to play. A bed becomes a galleon, walls shuffle aside to make room to romp. The little Von Trapps (there are three alternating casts) embrace Ebony Molina’s lolloping choreography and wonderfully darting moves, relishing the chance to sing and dance and feel again.AtCurve theatre, Leicester, until 17 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsThe Sound of MusicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Live music should be affordable and accessible and we need to find a new way of making that possible. BE BETTER.”Ticketmaster initially replied: “We support artists’ ability to set the terms of how their tickets are sold and resold. @OliviaDeano, we will cap resale prices on our site at face value and hope other resale sites will follow.”The ticketing company subsequently said it is in the process of “refunding fans for any markup they already paid to resellers on Ticketmaster”.In a statement, Michael Rapino, CEO of Ticketmaster’s parent company Live Nation Entertainment, said: “We share Olivia’s desire to keep live music accessible and ensure fans have the best access to affordable tickets. While we can’t require other marketplaces to honour artists’ resale preferences, we echo Olivia’s call to ‘do better’ and have taken steps to lead by example.”Reselling tickets for profit to be outlawed in UK government crackdownRead moreDean subsequently posted on Instagram, in part addressing her fellow artists: “Touts steal from artists and they steal from fans. They create inequality and hysteria. I am lucky to have had an education about the complexities and corruption of ticketing from @dicefm and will always choose to partner with them where we can. But know that you have power with other partners.“Capping resale at face value is your right and we have a duty to encourage a fair resale market. We are often made to feel we don’t have a choice but there is always space to ask why and it is always your right to say no!”The UK government recently confirmed that it would make it illegal for tickets to live entertainment and sport events to be resold for more than their original cost, after lobbying from acts including Coldplay and Dua Lipa.Dean is the UK’s biggest breakout artist of the year. She has four singles in the UK Top 20 – chart rules only allow three as a solo artist, but one of them, Rein Me In, is a duet with Sam Fender.

He was the unremarkable New Jersey rhyme spitter by way of Brooklyn who was lucky enough to be a high school classmate of the mesmerizing Lauryn Hill and a cousin to mercurial Wyclef Jean. On the group’s breakout album The Score, Michel’s eight-bar features were minor contributions, relative to Hill’s adroitness as an emcee and balladeer and Jean’s compositional polymathy.“From Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like / Buju Banton, I’m a true champion, like / Farrakhan reads his daily Qur’an / It’s a phenomenon, lyrics fast like Ramadan,” Michél raps on the band’s breakout single Fu-Gee-La, in one of his more pedestrian efforts.The Score was a towering success commercially (with 22m units sold) and critically (with two Grammys), but Hill’s and Jean’s competing ambitions ended up seeing the band separate. Neither missed a beat as solo artists – Hill made Grammy history with The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, and Jean charted with The Carnival before moving on to produce hits for Carlos Santana and Shakira.View image in fullscreenPras poses for a May 1997 portrait in New York City, New York.Photograph: Bob Berg/Getty ImagesMichél, who actually founded the Fugees, never really distinguished himself outside the group. His solo success was pretty much limited to the 1998 hit song Ghetto Supastar, another group collaboration – this time with with the R&B princess Mya and the Wu-Tang clan’s Ol’ Dirty Bastard. Instead, Michél was part of the second wave of rappers to go the Hollywood route, producing and starring in a 2006 documentary about Los Angeles’s Skid Row where he went undercover as an unhoused person. But his screen work didn’t garner the same reception as his gangbusters music partnerships.Then in 2007, Michél attended a presidential campaign rally in downtown LA for a charismatic young Democrat namedBarack Obama.Michél had actually met him years earlier, when Obama was an Illinois state lawmaker. Now, at the rally, Obama invited Michél to a starry Beverly Hills fundraiser, hosted by the founders of DreamWorks – Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg – where he watched in wonder as Hollywood heavyweights raised $1.3m for Obama’s cause.Michél was sold. “He’s a constitutional lawyer,” Michél said about Obama to Rolling Stone magazine in 2023. “At that time, who the fuck knew what that meant? ‘Constitutional lawyer.’ Not a criminal lawyer, not an entertainment lawyer, not a real estate lawyer – a constitutional lawyer. It sounded sexy as fuck. So I’m a surrogate, now – I’m everything Obama.”But in his rush to become a high-stakes political operator, Michél wouldn’t just quickly find himself well out of his depth. He’d eventually emerge as a central character in an influence-peddling conspiracy to corrupt US politics with foreign cash – a weird and winding saga that endedlast week with the 52-year-old sentenced to 14 years in federal prison.That this baritone hype man would find his way into high-stakes international politics after pivoting from music stardom was in some ways inevitable. During their time in the limelight, the Fugees made a point of standing up for Haiti at a time when asylum seekers were demonized on the right and left for washing up on US shores onboard flimsy rafts. In 2010, Jean launched a bid to become president of Haiti that fell apart over residency issues, and Hill has long maintained matriarchal status in the Marley clan, Jamaica’s unofficial first family.But Michél would likely never have fallen from grace so spectacularly if, in 2006, he had not met the Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho – known as Jho Low.View image in fullscreenJho Low poses at the launch of the Global Daily website in Washington DC on 23 April 2015.Photograph: Stuart Ramson/APLow is a notorious figure, the man behind the biggest scandal in Malaysian history. US and Malaysian authorities have charged him with embezzling a staggering $4.5bn from his country’s sovereign wealth fund, known as 1MDB, with considerable support from the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak.But when Michél first met him at a Manhattan nightclub in 2006, as he told Rolling Stone, Low just seemed like a garden-variety finance bro – winning over the room by buying the club’s entire stock of drinks. Michél reckoned Low spent $1.5m on drinks in 20 minutes alone.The two men are unlikely bedfellows. Where Michél was born to Haitian immigrants fleeing the violent regime of François “Papa Doc” Duvalier and had a working-class upbringing just outside of Newark, Low grew up wealthy and studied at London’s elite Harrow school before graduating from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school.Indeed, Michél might have written Low off if there weren’t so many A-list celebrities vouching for him. No less than Leonardo DiCaprio had just worked with Low to finance his $100m passion project, The Wolf of Wall Street, Martin Scorsese’s monument to white-collar crime. DiCaprio later told a trial that Low made generous donations to his charity: a $3.2m Picasso, a $9.2m Basquiat.Fugees rapper Pras sentenced to 14 years in prison over illegal donations to Obama campaignRead moreMichél assumed Low was legit.Although he rejected Low’s offer to perform in Malaysia, they kept in touch, and Michél regaled Low with his enthusiasm for Obama. A few years later, during Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, Low reached out, wanting to learn more about Michél’s connection to this well-placed Fugees fan (Obama reportedly had Ready or Not on repeat during the ’08 campaign).By this point, Low was deep into the 1MDB scheme of embezzling Malaysia’s sovereign wealth, and he needed as many powerful friends as he could muster to keep it going.In June 2012, Michél helped Low inside a fundraiser for Obama in Miami. The Malaysian wired the rapper $1m to cover their entry fees and those of anyone else Michél could wrangle among his glitzy contacts to be a straw donor.It was the beginning of what the justice department said ended up being more than $21m in stolen 1MDB funds, diverted through Michél in the run-up to the election. It is illegal for a foreign national to give to a US political campaign, and to parcel out money to friends for them to donate under their own names. Still, they kept at it. Michél even set up shell companies to disguise it all.View image in fullscreenLeonardo DiCaprio filming on location for The Wolf Of Wall Street on Pine Street in New York City on 25 August 2012.Photograph: James Devaney/FilmMagicIn one instance he has publicly acknowledged, Michél made a “personal” donation of $1.2m to an Obama-friendly Super Pac called Black Men Vote, which aimed to turn out Black male voters in key swing states. The money was actually from Low.At one point, Low had a holiday picture taken with the Obamas at the White House – a clout-enhancing souvenir that is alleged to have set Low back another $20m in stolen money.Michél would later blame the photograph deal on Frank White Jr, a top Obama fundraiser who would prove to be another critical access point for the Malaysian. White, whose sister is married to Michelle Obama’s cousin, was a close collaborator with Michél during the campaign. (For example, Michél testified that White pressed him to fill a table with friends for donations at a fundraiser, which Michél funded with Low’s money.) Later, they launched a DC-based private equity firm, DuSable Capital, with seed money from Low’s 1MDB funds.When justice department investigators cornered him with this information, White cooperated: he gave back $20m in 1MDB funds, admitted to acting as an agent for the Malaysian government in lobbying efforts, severed those ties and filed amended disclosures under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara). As a result, he did not face criminal charges.View image in fullscreenPresident-elect Barack Obama stands on stage along with his wife Michelle and daughters Malia (red dress) and Sasha  (black dress) on election night 2008 in Grant Park, Chicago.Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images NABy the time the justice department went public with its investigation of the 1MDB scam in 2017, Low had already been on the run from Malaysian authorities for two years. The scandal had upended the political landscape in Malaysia. Razak, whose party had been in power since independence from Britain, was thrown in prison.Yet Low doubled down – his troubles could all go away, he figured, if his friend Michél could influence the White House under its new president: Donald Trump. After all, Michél’s political fundraising triumphs from the Obama era had armed him with a thick Rolodex, including key political figures during the Trump years, too, such as Elliott Broidy, a prominent fundraiser not for the Democrats but for the Republicans.But Low needed more than just the justice department off his back. He also needed Michél to insulate him from extradition to China – and that meant doing a favor for the Chinese government.The Chinese, Low said, wanted help extraditing Guo Wengui – a billionaire businessman, friend to Steve Bannon and a Mar-a-Lago member. China was after Guo as part of its “Operation Fox Hunt” campaign to round up fugitive lawbreakers on American soil.Low said he was prepared to spend $75m through Michél to take care of allthis – scrapping the justice department investigation and getting Guo extradited to China – if Michél could close the deal in six months.One clandestine meeting with Chinese government emissaries at the Four Seasons in midtown Manhattan unfolds like scenes out of a John le Carré novel. In interviews, Michél describes meeting China’s public security vice-minister Sun Lijun at the hotel. He claimed he and Sun – evidently while toggling between emails from former US attorney general Jeff Sessions and a phone call with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping – negotiated the release of a pregnant American detainee in China, in a show of good faith for his future efforts on the Guo extradition. The former rapper would claim that the cloak-and-dagger effort to draw him into the hotel had him thinking, for a moment, that he might very well turn up missing.It was a long way from larking around in music videos and rocking sold-out stadium shows.Ready or not, the justice department began rounding up key figures in the 1MDB scam in 2020. Broidy pleaded guilty to Fara-related crimes and forfeited $6.6m. Ultimately, he was pardoned by Trump. Two Goldman Sachs bankers received jail time for their role in facilitating payments, while the bank itself was forced to pay nearly $3bn in penalties to regulators on the US, UK, Singapore and Hong Kong. Altogether, the 1MDB scandal saddled Malaysia with an $11bn debt obligation – one that will continue to hamstring future economic development through 2039.Low, who is believed to be hiding out in China, has maintained his innocence. His lawyers say his “motivation for giving Michél money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective”. They say he “simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then President Obama”.Michél was left holding the bag. In April 2023, he stepped into the harsh glare of a federal trial in Washington DC – a solo star finally, albeit a notorious one now. Headlines blared testimony from Sessions and DiCaprio, who was not accused of wrongdoing, and described Low lavishing him with gifts, parties and the financing of The Wolf of Wall Street.View image in fullscreenPrakazrel ‘Pras’ Michél, accompanied by defense lawyer David Kenner, right, arrives at federal court in Washington for his trial in an alleged campaign finance conspiracy on 3 April 2023.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/APMichél, in his testimony, denied the government’s assertion that Low washed more than $100m through him. He said he viewed the $20m paid to him by Low over nine months in 2012 as “free money from a wealthy businessman that I could use” – and wound up perjuring himself when the justice department presented evidence of the shell companies he created to shroud his financial relations with Low.What’s more, Michél was found to have sent letters to friends who had received 1MDB funds from him, in which he told them, in so many words, that the money was to stop them cooperating with the FBI. Prosecutors framed it as witness tampering.In 2023 a federal jury found him guilty, convicting Michél on all 10 counts of money laundering and campaign finance violations, and ordering him to forfeit $65m because of his ties to Low. In October 2024 he requested a retrial, accusing his own lawyer of using AI to draft his closing arguments, which misattributed lyrics from Puff Daddy’s I’ll Be Missing You to Michél, and lyrics from his own Ghetto Supastar to the Fugees. The retrial was denied.Department of Justice prosecutors recommended a life sentence. Michél, they said, had “betrayed his country for money” and intentionally deceived the White House, senior politicians and the FBI for nearly a decade. He didn’t get life, but he was still given 14 years; his new lawyer called it “completely disproportionate to the offense”.Michél hasn’t commented publicly on the sentence. Neither have his Fugees bandmates. “What benefit would I get trying to break laws? It’s not worth it to me,” he told Rolling Stone in 2023. “I’m like a pariah now. I’ve got friends who won’t talk to me because they think there’s a satellite in orbit listening to them.”In September 2021, the Fugees reunited for their first performance in 15 years, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of The Score. They would later wind up canceling their plans for a global tour after prosecutors placed Michél under severe travel restrictions. But on that first night they performed, at a Global Citizen Live pop-up concert at New York’s Pier 17, it was good vibes all around. Jean moved the crowd with his punchlines, Hill killed ’em softly with her songs and Pras hyped them up the whole way. It was a bittersweet reminder of what could have always been.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeFugeesUS political financingBarack ObamafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The new English-language lyrics were written by Peter Gabriel.Eno said in a statement: “After a year defined by unimaginable loss, grief and injustice, we want to end with an act of love for Palestine’s children. Lullaby reflects their beauty, their longing and their hope. If we rally together and download it, we have a real shot at landing Christmas No 1 – and turning that moment into vital life-saving support for Gaza’s families.”Released on 12 December, it will raise money for the Choose Love charity’s Together for Palestine Fund, which supports Palestinian-led frontline organisations such as Taawon, the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund and the Palestine Medical Relief Society.View image in fullscreen‘An act of love for Palestine’s children’ … the artwork for Lullaby.Illustration: Malak MattarThe song was arranged and recomposed by Kieran Brunt and Nai Barghouti, and also features Amena El Abd, Dan Smith of Bastille, Lana Lubany, London Community Gospel Choir, Sura Abdo, Tyson, Yasmeen Ayyashi and Ysee, along with Brunt and Barghouti .Barghouti, who is Palestinian, said: “This lullaby from our Palestinian musical heritage has been with me since early childhood. Today, it returns at a much-needed time as a reminder of what Palestinians will never lose: hope, defiance, beauty, and dignity.”The artwork is by Gazan painter Malak Mattar.Mabel said: “The song holds a special place for many reasons, but mostly as it’s the first time I’ve sung with both my mum, Neneh, and sister, Tyson, and for it to be a traditional lullaby in tribute to the mothers and children of Gaza means the world. I hope you feel the strength in our voices.”The organisers are urging fans topreorder the singleto help its push for Christmas No 1. Its current competitors are Kylie Minogue, whose song XMAS was recorded exclusively for Amazon Music – and is the first track played if Alexa users request Christmas music – Denise Welch’s Slayyy Bells, and the usual suspects of Wham! and Mariah Carey.The UK’s Christmas No 1 will be announced on 19 December.Explore more on these topicsMusicBrian EnoPalestineNeneh CherryNadine ShahCelesteGazanewsShareReuse this content"

From sound, scent and ceramics to hand soap and elegant wine glasses, I’ve often wanted to recreate elements of my favourite restaurants at home. I’m unlikely to sous-vide celeriac or triple cook my chips, but Icanelevate my plate of pasta with a drizzle of amazing olive oil, or invest in a cutlery set that gives even a midweek dinner a sense of occasion. As much as the cooking, it’s the little details that are, as celebrated chefSkye Gyngellputs it, “what you take away and what make you feel wonderful”.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I spoke to restaurateurs across the UK about the little touches that make their restaurants distinctive – and easy ways to bring their magic into our homes.GlasswareView image in fullscreenRichard Brendon and Jancis Robinson’s universal wine glass (left) and the fluted crystal wine glass from Luigi Bormioli.Composite: Neil Watson£96 a pair at Borough Kitchen£96 a pair at Richard BrendonYou can spend almost anything on a wine glass – and restaurants do. AtRestaurant Mýseoutside York, co-founder Victoria Overington waxes lyrical about the Richard Brendon and Jancis Robinson collaboration glassware. “We use their universal glass, designed to suit any wine – sparkling, white, red or sweet. They are very fine and the shape of the bowl means you get amazing aromas,” she says. A set of two will set you back £96.At the other end of the spectrum, Ruth Leigh ofUpdownfarmhouse, a restaurant and small hotel in Deal, Kent, reveals that their wine glasses are fromIkea’s Storsint range(£12 for six). “I’d been buying them for years for home,” she says, “and they’re incredibly durable.” Between these extremes, brands such asRiedelorNudetend to populate the tables and bars of higher-end restaurants. At theDoverin Mayfair, London, restaurateur Martin Kuczmarski chose weighty fluted crystal wine glasses fromLuigi Bormioli(£40 for four) to add a touch of old-school glamour.Hand soapand scentView image in fullscreenMahala hand soap£18 for 500ml at MahalaRooms atInver, in Argyll, are adorned with the work of local craftspeople, and in the bathrooms you’ll find products from Glasgow’sCaurnie Soaperie, “the only traditional cold process soapery left in the world”, says chef-patron Pamela Brunton. Her friendCeline Louiseprovides “a hand lotion with meaning”, using flavours from Inver’s kitchen, such as black pepper, verbena berry and cardamom.For Mýse, Overingtonchosenearby Boston Spa aromatherapy brandChapter Organics, which is developing a bespoke hand soap for the restaurant that is “woody and earthy, with a citrussy background”. Meanwhile, Carter uses a plant-based hand soap with a Mediterranean garden aroma from London lifestyle store Mahala (£18 for 500ml).Kuczmarski wanted diners to “feel hugged by a scent that was sexy but not overpowering”. He developed somecandleswith a base note of Mysore sandalwood, available on his online store for £40.Olive oilView image in fullscreenExtra virgin olive oil from Two Fields (left) and Trulli.Composite: Safia ShakarchiFrom £18.50 for 500ml at Two Fields£22.50 for 500ml at Trulli UliviIt’s standard for restaurants to have one oil for cooking and another for dressing. The latter is often a high-quality extra-virgin olive oil from a supplier such asBrindisa, which sells five-litre tins of Arbequina olive oil for £84.Will and Harry Rolph are making waves with their terrific, good value Two Fields olive oil from Crete. Yotam Ottolenghisells it, and chef David Carter says his restaurantOma,in London’s Borough Market, gets through 100 litres a week. It is the first non-Italian olive oil that celebrated chef Skye Gyngell has used professionally. A 500ml bottle costs £18.50, and subscriptions are available.Other excellent, restaurant-grade olive oils ideal for finishing off dishes include Trulli Ulivi (£22.50 for 500ml) from Puglia,Capezzanafrom Tuscany (beloved of theRiver CaféandTrullo), andCitizens of Soil, which bottles oils from across the Med.CutleryView image in fullscreenArthur Price of England’s Baguette cutlery set.£711 at Harts Of Stur£995 at Arthur PriceChoice of cutlery runs the gamut from simple to splashy. Luke Wasserman, ofNest farmhousein Norfolk, says the vibe there is “Granny’s house for Sunday lunch – lots of mismatched vintage”, so the team visited antique markets for old Sheffield steel pieces. But at his London restaurant,St Bartsin Clerkenwell, which takes its “best of British philosophy to the nth degree”, Wasserman has commissioned specialist forgesJoel BlackandLee Jonesto make knives and forks respectively.Meanwhile, atLasdun, one of the restaurants in London’s National Theatre, tables are laid with David Mellor’s elegant and weightyLondoncutlery (48-piece set £888), andQuo Vadis, in Soho, London, uses Arthur Price of England’s Baguette canteen (46-piece set £995).LightingView image in fullscreenRechargeable wall lamp from Pooky£138 at PookyWhether it’s candles on tables or bespoke wall lights, low and ambient lighting is key in evening dining spaces. At Grace and Savour restaurant at Hampton Manor hotel in Warwickshire, chef-director David Taylor worked with local ceramicist Sarah Jerath to make ceramic lampshades “to give a warm glow”. At Manchester restaurantWinsome, every table has a large candle in a candlestick bought on one of the team’s charity shop raids. These give “every table its own personality,” says co-founder Tom Fastiggi, “and they all have candle wax dripping down the sides.”Wasserman also loves candles. “We buy pillar candles from theLondon Candle Company[from £7.49 for a set of three] and put them in vintage ramekins or ceramic holders I’ve made.” They also have wall lights from Pooky, which “work with the farmhouse vibe” (£130).Matthew Slotover, co-founder ofToklasin central London, says lighting wasn’t given a lot of thought before they opened, but “it became clear we needed to spotlight the food”. He sourcedPina table lamps(£118) from Italian designer Zafferano, which “are so thin you almost can’t see them, but they flood the table in a high-quality light.”Table linenView image in fullscreenDash Linen tablecloths in grey and blueRequest a quote at Dash LinenKuczmarski says three tablecloths are traditional in continental hospitality: the first to absorb the noise, the second “for decency”, to hide diners’ legs, and the third “purely for stains, and which could be changed very quickly”. For the Dover, he insisted on all three and designed bespoke table linens with Dash Linen “with a little bit of shine, because I wanted sparkle at night”.For their restaurantJikoniin Marylebone, London, foundersRavinder Bhogal(aGuardian Feastcolumnist) and Nadeem Lalani buy bright, hand-blocked linens direct from women’s cooperatives in India. The restaurant is a sea of colour and pattern, realising the couple’s fantasy of an “un-restaurant”, a place for guests to gather, eat and drink that feels “like an extension of home”. The linens are available to buy on theJikoniwebsite.Coffee and teaView image in fullscreenRare Tea Co, Lost Malawi English Breakfast Tea and Assembly House Espresso ‘Brazil’£7 for 50g at AmazonFrom £10 for 200g at AssemblyIn this golden age of the roastery, restaurants have plenty of choice when sourcing coffee. Slotover works withAssembly, in south London, on a rotating selection for the cafe and a bespoke espresso blend for the restaurant (subscriptions from £8). He says: “In a restaurant, you don’t want a super funky coffee – it needs to be palatable and easy-drinking.” Kuczmarski agrees, adding: “I’m Italian, so we useLavazza. It’s a crowd-pleaser. It works.”Erst, a natural wine bar serving seasonal dishes in Manchester, uses Chester-based roasteryAll Caps. Only filter coffee is served, says co-founder Will Sutton, but it still needs to stand out: “We wanted a richer style of filter, to satisfy espresso lovers. The one we have now is from a female-run co-op in Colombia and has rich, orangey, honeyed notes.”Wasserman usesDifference, which roasts high-quality beans for sustainable pods and supplies a swathe of high-end restaurants and hotels (boxes of 25 available on subscription, from £22.50).Rare Tea Companyis a darling of fine restaurants; Slotover says a tasting of more than 30 types, from black, white and green to oolong, pu’er and beyond, “opened up my mind to what’s possible with tea”. At Winsome, Fastiggi opts for a familiar name: “We serve Yorkshire Tea! It’s what people want to drink.”At Updown, plates are there “to subtly frame the food”, says Leigh, who chose plain white plates, sourced from artisan potterJohn Julian. “We buy all their seconds, which makes them half the price, and we like the imperfections.”SoundsView image in fullscreenChilean producer DJ Raff created five custom tracks for Mareida restaurant using recordings he made on the landscapes of his homelandAt the Dover, nostalgic soul, jazz and funk – all from Kuczmarski’s personal vinyl collection – is “an addition to warm your heart and move your shoulders”. Theplaylistis public and “every track is approved by me – as is the timing at which we play each one”, adds Kuczmarski.ForMareida, a new Andean restaurant in central London, co-founder Prenay Agarwal asked Chilean music producer DJ Raff to make five tracks using recordings he had taken from the landscapes of Chile. “We wanted the mood to change as you moved through the spaces in the restaurant,” says Agarwal.Mareida Soundis available on Spotify.FlowersView image in fullscreenMýse restaurant uses York florist Helston StreetFrom £10 at Helston Street“It makes such a difference to see something seasonal and beautifully arranged on a table,” says Leigh of Updown. She has five raised beds for cut flowers and makes new arrangements for the restaurant every week. “I try to keep it as foolproof as possible – easy things such aseuphorbia(the lime green goes with everything) and, at this time of year,dahlias, which are huge and have enormous impact in every colour: dark reds, coppery oranges, deep pinks.”Overington chooses wild and seasonal dried flowers for Mýse, made for her by York floristHelston Street, with colours and styles that reflect the restaurant. “I like sculptural displays of edible things, such as poppy seed heads, lavender, flaxseed, chamomile, dried wheat and grasses,” she says. She displays the plants in small stone vases that she gets from Etsy.CeramicsView image in fullscreenCeramicist Sarah Jerath’s off-green bowl, and Sytch Farm Studios’ blue plates, with a little shell pressed in to resemble a fossilFrom £22 at Sytch Farm StudiosAlmost every restaurant I speak to has a relationship with a potter who is local or a friend. At Grace and Savour, the restaurant at Hampton Manor hotel in Warwickshire, chef-director David Taylor has worked with nearby ceramicistSarah Jerathon a set of off-green plates made with a glaze of dehydrated rhubarb leaves from the kitchen garden. He also works withSytch Farm Studioswhere plates and bowls are made from Cornish clay, into which a little shell is pressed to resemble a fossil. “Everything tells a story of our land, and is handcrafted by British makers,” says Taylor.TilesView image in fullscreenTiles from Bert & MayAtLegadoin London’s Shoreditch, designer Patrick Abrams ofApplied Studioused handmade zellige tiles laid in contemporary patterns for a restaurant “inspired by Spain that belongs in London”. Originating in Morocco, these glazed tiles are all unique, which results in a pleasingly uneven tone and texture to a wall – even when laid in a single colour. TheMosaic FactoryandOtto Tileseach have a wide range of zellige tiles in block colours and patterns. For floors, decorative encaustic tiles from the likes ofBert and Maycan be found across several Soho House properties andThyme hotelin the Cotswolds, where green and white hexagonal tiles bring character and calm.Explore more on these topicsHomesThe FilterInteriorsRestaurantsFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If booze or a scented candle used to be a fail-safe gift option for a party, retailers and food experts are reporting a surge of interest in the kitchen cupboard staple.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The trend is being driven by several factors including a decline in drinking and a shift from dining out to dinners at home. It is premium extra virgin olive oil – or evoo to the experts – that is dominating.AtDelli, an online retailer for independent brands, sales of olive oil are up 515% year on year. Bestsellers include a £14 swing-top bottle from Honest Toil and a £16 drizzling bottle from Glug.Othmana, a Palestinian brand, has more than 4,000 customers on a waiting list for £30 tins from its small batch harvest that will begin in December.View image in fullscreenThere are 4,000 people on the waiting list to buy the Palestinian oil from Othmana.Photograph: OthamanaAs with wine, when it comes to olive oil, flavour, quality and price points vary wildly. Rather than the see-through plastic bottles you see on supermarket shelves, these 2.0 oils come in everything from glass bottles with detailed tasting notes to micro-sized tins resembling canisters of old school car engine oils.Mazen Assaf, an olive oil sommelier and founder of the brandThe Olive Oil Guy,describes the trend as an “olive oil renaissance” and compares it to a kindred upsurge in craft coffee and bean to bar chocolate.“It’s a gift that isn’t going to be regifted,” says Laura Jackson, an influencer, presenter and co-founder of the online retail platform Glassette. The site recently collaborated with the Jordanian oil brandOnsurion a £26.95 glass bottle of extra virgin olive oil that wouldn’t look out of place on an apothecary shelf. “Even if you’re not that interested in food, olive oil is a key kitchen staple. We’ve taken a functional item and turned it into an object that looks beautiful on a countertop,” Jackson says.View image in fullscreenOvette Olive Oil, made by Glassette and Onsuri.Photograph: GlassetteSeyi Oduwole, the lead travel and hospitality analyst at the strategic foresight consultancy the Future Laboratory, credits sober-curious gen Z as driving the shift away from alcohol as a default gift. Oduwole describes an aesthetically pleasing bottle of olive oil as “practical yet indulgent, premium but not ostentatious. It’s something that feels thoughtful without pressuring anyone to drink”.Assaf, who trains Michelin star chefs as part of his sommelier work, says: “It works well with so many different foods, not just bread and vegetables,” pointing to the rise of olive oil martinis and ice-cream drizzled in it.Similar to wine tasting, Assaf says one should start by smelling the oil. “You should be getting a fresh bouquet of greens. Scents like freshly cut grass or tomato indicate freshness.”Sarah Vachon, a sommelier and co-founder ofCitizens of Soil, which sells olive oil from small producers who practise regenerative farming, advises swirling it around your mouth. A little bit of bitterness and peppery flavour are considered positive attributes.View image in fullscreenCitizens of Soil’s Greek extra virgin olive oil, £19.Photograph: Citizens of SoilRed flags include a buttery smell and waxy consistency. “It means it might not be evoo or could be an old oil that has lost its strength,” Vachon says. The bottle should also state the source of the olives and variety. She says: “Countries don’t have a specific profile. Regions do.” Something to bear in mind, when you find yourself wondering what to give thisChristmas.Which olive oils to tryBest if you’re on a budgetView image in fullscreenHonest Toil’s 500ml bottle costs £14, but the 100ml option is £3.20.Photograph: Honest ToilHonest Toil extra virgin olive oil mini, 100ml for£3.20 from DelliSmall enough to fit in a handbag.Best if you want to feel like you’re starring in The BearView image in fullscreenGlug’s bottle makes it perfect for drizzling.Photograph: Glug, £16, DelliGlug,£16 from getglug.comLets you drizzle like Carmy with a squeezy bottle.

Are gen Z so lonely they are falling in love with AI robots? Are they forming polycules across the US? Are they having enough sex? Are they having sex at all?Gen Z is defined roughly as young Americans aged 13 to 28. This generation came of age with information about sex readily available to them, for better (the internet provides both sex education and community) and arguably for worse, too (in 2022, 54% of US teensreportedfirst seeing online pornography at age 13 or younger). They are more likely to embrace non-traditional identities and are progressive on issues such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage – especially gen Z women.A generation of ‘virgins’ is leading America’s next sexual revolutionRead moreBut they have also seen the world shaped by pandemic-era isolation and two Trump presidencies that have celebrated the gutting of reproductive freedoms and LGBTQ+ rights.Sexual conservativeswant gen Z to be straight, get married and have children, lots of them – but not to educate themselves about sex or venture across heteronormative boundaries. As a political gender gap emerges betweenyoung menand women, the right are urging gen Z men to fulfil theirmasculine destiniesand gen Z women to fall in line,minding the home and hearth.Amid this tug of war between progressive ideals and stifling sexual conservatism, in the wake of a loneliness-breeding lockdown, gen Z is trying to date, to hook up, to fall in love. It is a lot to grapple with, for those living it and for those trying to understand it.As part of oursex lives of gen Z series, we gathered 13 data points that, while not nearly conclusive, begin to show what young people think about sex and the partners they’re having it with.1 Gen Z is the queerest generationNearly a quarter of gen Z adults identify as LGBTQ+, compared with 10% of all US adults. Millennials come next, at 15%, with gen X (6%), baby boomers (4%) and the silent generation (2%) trailing far behind.(PRRI, 2024)2 They are in the middle of a sex recessionThe great “sex recession” is the buzzword of the moment if you like making sweeping assumptions about gen Z’s sex lives. Yet, there is something to it: gen Zarehaving sex less and later than millennials did.(CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 2024)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Mona Chalabi3 Gen Z men are having less sexA survey conducted by the Kinsey Institute in partnership with the sexual wellness brand Lovehoney found that one in four gen Z adults aged 18 to 24 have not had partnered sex yet. Break that down by gender, and you will find that one in three gen Z men reported never having partnered sex, compared with only one in five gen Z women.(Kinsey Institute + Lovehoney, 2022)4 Gen Z men are more likely to experience singledomYou could say that gen Z men are grappling with a great “relationship recession” too, based on their likelihood of being single.(Pew Research Center, 2023)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Mona Chalabi5 Gen Z women are more queerIf women under 30 are more likely to be in a relationship than men under 30, it begs the question: who are they dating? Older men, in spite of some gen Z seeingage gap relationshipsas exploitative and taboo? Other young women? After all, gen Z women are significantly more likely to identify as LGBTQ+than gen Z men.(PRRI, 2024)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Mona Chalabi6 A political chasm is dividing gen ZThere is a growing divide betweenyoung menandyoung women’s political views in the US, as evidenced by the 2024 election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. More than half of gen Z men (56%) voted for Trump, while a majority of gen Z women turned out for Harris (58%). The election was in many ways shaped by this wide gender gap. In April 2025, young women were far less likely to identify as Republican than young men.(Tufts CIRCLE, 2024;NBC NewsStay Tuned Poll, 2025)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Mona Chalabi7 They do not want to date across the political divideGen Z’s gender split along party lines might be affecting its relationship and marriage goals,more than older generations.(NPR/PBS/Marist, 2025)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Mona Chalabi8 Conservative policy leads to fear of sexSome women’s sex lives have been adversely affected by recent conservative political triumphs. On social media, the raw emotion of Trump’s election soon made itself clear: talk of a4B movement spikedin the US as young women discussed boycotting heterosexual marriage, dating, sex and childbirth in protest of institutionalized misogyny and abuse.The fall of Roe v Wade in 2022 was also devastating to many young women. As reproductive restrictions rippled through the US, nearly 20% of gen Z women said they were afraid of having sex.(Kinsey Institute + Lovehoney, 2022)The political situation in the US is also having a chilling effect on young LGBTQ+ people: More than a third of LGBTQ+ adults say they do not feel comfortable being open about their identity while dating in 2025. Even more gen Z LGBTQ+ people – 44% of those ages 18 to 24 – said as much.(Kinsey Institute + DatingNews.com, 2025)9 Gen Z adults eye traditional monogamyNow on tohowgen Z dates: Non-monogamy is on the table, but gen Z does not seem to be as taken with it as other generations – perhaps because some young people have not experienced monogamous relationships yet and yearn for what they do not know.These figures are from a survey of the users of Feeld, a dating app that specializes in kink, open relationships and other non-traditional dating situations, so take it with a grain of salt …(Kinsey Institute+ Feeld, 2024)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Mona Chalabi10 Making a move is tricky for gen ZAs dismay with thestagnant situation on dating appsgrows, one survey found that 72% of gen Z singles say passivity in making the first move has increased, compared to 63% of all singles. (Match, 2025)11 One night stands might be going extinctIn 2004, 78% of millennials said their friends commonly have one night stands; just 23% of gen Z said the same 20 years later, in 2024.(YouGov/The Times & Populus, 2025)12 First date sex can be a no-noGen Z is more likely to want long-term relationships and less likely to be into casual sex than millennials or gen X, per one survey. Sex on the first date is a relationship “dealbreaker” for 48% of gen Z.(Kinsey Institute + Lovehoney, 2022)13 Gen Z daters are into AIGen Z is the first generation to have generative AI and chatbot technology available to them early and often in their romantic lives, and it looks as if they are taking advantage – whether forcompanionshipor for dating advice.

She came to public attention when she opened the Petersham Nurseries Café in south-west London in 2004. Until that point, she had been honing her own distinctive cooking personality that emphasised the quality of ingredients and the simplicity of their treatment and presentation. Her dishes were light, graceful and deceptively simple, but were founded on a serious understanding of how flavours and textures worked together, sometimes in surprising ways.She had already built a reputation as a chef, cooking for such private clients as Nigella Lawson, Charles Saatchi, Madonna and Guy Ritchie. At the same time she served as food editor at Vogue magazine until 2003.Gyngell’s friends, Francesco and Gael Boglione, had bought Petersham House, a Queen Anne villa on the River Thames just outside Richmond. In 2004 they asked her to run the cafe that was part of the garden centre in the grounds. She fell in love at first sight and agreed to cook there.Gyngell meant to stay for just a few months but ended up being there for eight years. By 2005, it had won the Time Out award for best alfresco dining, with a Tatler award for most original restaurant the year after. In 2010 the GoodFoodGuide said of it: “There’s no doubting the allure of this secret, horticulturally minded oasis with attitude.”In 2011 the Petersham Nurseries Café was awarded a Michelin star. As far as Gyngell was concerned this was a mixed blessing. On the one hand she was delighted by the recognition; on the other it raised the expectations of the customers who flooded in as a consequence. Gyngell left the next year.She wasn’t out of the kitchen for long. In November 2014 she opened a restaurant amid the classical grandeur of Somerset House in central London. A far cry from the refined rusticity of Petersham Nurseries Café, it was a place of calm order and polished restraint, with interior design by Skye’s sister Briony. The new restaurant was called Spring.View image in fullscreenGyngell in 2016 with Harry Astley and Jane Scotter at Heckfield Place in Hampshire, where she was culinary director.Photograph: Harry BordenHer reputation continued to grow. Shebecame culinary director ofHeckfield Place, a hotel in Hampshire, where she joined forces with her longtime collaborator, the farmer Jane Scotter. This gave her the chance to further develop her passion for ingredients. She helped create a hotel farm where she and Scotter grew rare fruit and vegetables, built up a working dairy, and planted orchards and flowers. Heckfield Place was in many respects the apotheosis of her vision as a chef.Gyngell was born in Sydney, Australia, the daughter ofBruce Gyngell, a TV executive who was managing director of TV-am in the UK between 1984 and 1992, and Ann Barr, an interior decorator. Food was central to family life, albeit in an unusual manner. As Gyngell said later, they “followed a macrobiotic way of eating [which favours locally grown vegetables, fruit and pulses over animal products], which was quite big in the 70s”. She recalled: “We had always had a healthy diet eating fish and salads, but suddenly it became all about umeboshi plums, agar agar and 60% grain intake, and olive oil was completely banned. We spent a lot of time secretly eating away from home and saving our pocket money to buy sweets.”Gyngell studied law at Sydney University. While there, she had her first experience of the restaurant world, washing up at a deli. She was inspired by the cook there, “a wonderful Lebanese woman called Layla Sorfie” who “taught me how to make mayonnaise, stock, pies, things like that”. Aged 19, she moved to Paris and did a course at Anne Willan’sLa Varennecookery school, before spending two years working at the Michelin-starred restaurant Dodin-Bouffant, where she absorbed the techniques and principles of classic French cookery.After three years in Paris, she moved to London and went to work at the Dorchester under Anton Mosimann. By this time Gyngell had already begun to practise a fresher, less formal style of cooking, and the regimented style of a huge hotel kitchen did not appeal to her. She left after a year and joined Fergus and Margot Henderson at the French House in Soho. The Hendersons were among those who were revolutionising British cooking at the time. They were doing away with the complexity, ornamentation and rich saucing, and serving simpler, stripped-back dishes that focused on fundamental flavours and the quality of the ingredients, and exploring novel combinations. This was much more in keeping with Gyngell’s approach.Her life was not without difficulties. She suffered low self-esteem as a child, and later spoke about her drug and drink addiction that began in Sydney when she was a teenager, and continued for 20 years until the death of her father in 2000.Skye Gyngell was singular. She had the palate of a chef and the palette of an artistRead moreAlthough well-connected in the media, she never developed a television career. She did write four well-regarded cookery books.Gyngell’s food may have seemed effortless and delicate, but she had a determination that carried her through adversity. In the kitchen she was known as a demanding, meticulous craftsman, encouraging her staff to emulate her own high standards. She also had a natural modesty, and was driven by passion rather than ego – above all, she was a chef who loved to cook.In 1989 Gyngell married Thomas Gore, with whom she had a daughter, Holly. The couple divorced in 1996. She had a second daughter, Evie, from a relationship with James Henderson. She is survived by her daughters and her siblings, David and Briony.Skye Gyngell, chef, born 6 September 1963; died 22 November 2025Explore more on these topicsChefsFoodRestaurantsAustralian food and drinkobituariesShareReuse this content"

And a very good way to achieve this is to bring a tower of puffy choux buns to the table and pour over a jugful of boozy chocolate sauce and coffee caramel while everyone looks on in awe. To help avoid any stress on the day, most of the elements can be made ahead: the chocolate sauce and caramel can be gently reheated before pouring, while the choux shells can be baked the day before and crisped up in the oven for 10 minutes before filling.Coffee caramel and rum choux towerPrep10 minCook1 hr 15 minServes10-12120ml milk120g butter½ tbsp sugarA pinch of salt160g strong white flour4-5 large eggs,beatenDemerara sugar, for sprinkling400ml double cream½ tsp vanilla bean paste½ tbsp icing sugarFor the coffee caramel140ml double cream2 tsp instant coffee or espresso powder110g sugar50g unsalted butterA big pinch of flaky sea saltFor the chocolate sauce150g dark chocolate1½ tbsp brown sugar2-3 tbsp rumA pinch of saltHeat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½ and line two large baking trays with baking paper. To make the choux, put the milk, 120ml water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan and bring to a rolling boil. Tip in the flour and stir quickly until you have a thick dough. Cook for a minute, then transfer to a clean bowl and leave to cool for five minutes.Add some beaten egg a little at a time, beating well after each addition until the mix takes on a slightly thick, smooth dropping consistency (you may not need all the egg). Spoon the dough into a piping bag and snip off the end (or fit with a round nozzle).Pipe roughly 4cm-wide rounds of dough on to the lined trays, leaving just under 2½cm of space between them. Sprinkle generously with demerara sugar and bake for 25-28 minutes, until deeply browned and puffy. Set aside to cool completely.For the coffee caramel, heat the cream and coffee in a small saucepan until warmed through and the coffee has dissolved.Put the sugar in a large saucepan and heat gently until it completely dissolves and turns a deep amber colour. Add the butter, whisking well to combine, then slowly pour in the coffee cream – be careful, because it will bubble and spit. Simmer for 30 seconds, take off the heat and stir in the salt. Leave to cool and thicken.For the chocolate sauce, put the chocolate, 120ml water and sugar in a saucepan and simmer until melted. Once smooth and glossy, stir in the rum and salt, and take off the heat.To assemble, whip the cream, vanilla and sugar to soft peaks. Fill a piping bag with the whipped cream, and fill a second one with three-quarters of the cooled caramel. Use a knife to make an opening in the base of each choux bun and fill three-quarters full with cream. Top up with caramel. (Alternatively, cut each bun in half and spoon in the cream and caramel.)Pile the filled buns on a large plate or platter, using a little caramel as glue to help. To serve, gently reheat the chocolate sauce, if it has cooled and thickened, then pour all over the buns. If the leftover caramel has also thickened, reheat in a pan until runny and pour over the top, too. Serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkThe sweet spotFoodDessertCakeBakingChristmasChocolaterecipesShareReuse this content"

She would bring up the child altars and the moon radars and everybody, including me, listened politely and said: “You take care now!” Nobody gave her the evidence that, in fact, we thought this was completely, totally, drinking-air-conditioner-coolant wrong.You leave people in their bubble when you don’t tell them you disagree. You help them carry on thinking, “most people areon the same page”.So I’m with you that it’s important to express your disagreement: for their sake as much as yours. This could be a valuable opportunity to learn that other people in their life do not see things the way they do.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningI thinkhowyou do that depends a lot on what expressing your disagreement is for. Is it essentially “for the record”? Or is it for changing your interlocutor’s mind?These two things will often pull in opposite directions. You might change minds more effectively if you listen, empathise, forgive – even when anger and contempt are reasonable responses in the circumstances. This is a famous bind: make yourself more appealing so as to be more persuasive (shutting off anger you’re entitled to), or express your feelings knowing you won’t be seen as persuasive.It might be worth deciding in advance whether you most want to persuade or register dissent. Otherwise you risk paying all the cost of “being difficult” while accomplishing neither.If it’s about voicing disagreement for the record, it could help to rehearse some conversational “block” phrases in advance so you don’t have to invent them when you’re tongue-tied. Something like, “I don’t share that view, and I don’t want to talk about immigrants that way.” Enough to be evidence that not everyone’s on the same page.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Should I ask them to stop? | Leading questionsRead moreAnother strategy is almost Socratic: ask a tonne of questions, press them to define their key terms. The trick is to do this with a completely flat affect; it can’t be a cross examination. It has to have the air that you’re genuinely trying to get to the bottom of things. “Why did you say, “I’m not racist, but?” “What makes someone a racist?” “How are you defining ‘immigrant’?” This is more confrontational. They killed the guy the strategy is named for. But when done well, you can get your opponent to reveal the incoherence in their own view, without you ever stating your own.If, on the other hand, you’re trying to genuinely change minds, you’re in for a longer haul. That one takes relationship building and time.And I’d call us back to the words of Kwame Ture (formerly Stokely Carmichael): “If a white man wants to lynch me, that’s his problem. If he’s got the power to lynch me, that’s my problem. Racism is not a question of attitude; it’s a question of power.” The effort to change a mind is a valiant one; but these people’s attitudes only matter insofar as they join up with power. You may find that ways to overcome the injustices that make you angry aim to change the power, not just the mind.The reader’s letter has been edited for lengthAsk Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsFamilyLeading questionsFriendshipAustralian lifestyleRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This selection of cultural keypoints will put some fizz in your conversationTim JonzeFri 28 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 05.02 ESTShareWhich show will Trump cancel next?It seemed Trump had finally dealt with domestic terrorist Jimmy Kimmel after his chat show was briefly cancelled, but now it’s back on air. So should we expect more censorship? Surely South Park is skating on thin ice bymocking the president and his allegedly inadequate penis?Maybe the president will throw a curveball and declare a nature show about squirrels to be a secret antifa recruitment operation? Or perhaps he will simply cut the niceties and just put Oprah Winfrey up on Showtrial (“Ratings like you’ve never seen before!”)?Should we boycott Spotify?First it was Neil Young and Joni Mitchell who removed their music from Spotify because they didn’t like sharing a platform with Joe Rogan’s podcast. Now Massive Attack have taken their tunes down from the streaming servicein protestat founder Daniel Ek’s investment of half a billion pounds in a military AI company (I’m no expert on these things, but that sounds at least as bad as hosting the Joe Rogan Experience). So should artists still be hawking their wares on Spotify? More to the point, should we as consumers still be paying for Spotify? This line of debate becomes especially spicy if your host is using said streaming service for the evening’s background music, meaning you can accuse them in front of all their peers of being complicit in a future of facial-recognition drone attacks – always a great icebreaker.Heard the one about the comedians who played in Saudi Arabia?It might be handy to know the names of the comedians who recently sold their souls – sorry –embarked on a humanitarian mission to spread the joy of standup across the globe, by agreeing to play at the Riyadh comedy festival. Many people were outraged that the likes of Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, Louis CK, Kevin Hart, Jack Whitehall, Jessica Kirson, Aziz Ansari and Pete Davidson (among others) agreed to take the oil state’s money, although to be fair the arguments over whether they should have played the gig are actually complex to get into. On the one hand, Saudi Arabia is a state that jails people for parody tweets, dismembers journalists with bone saws, and frequently executes multiple people on the same day. But on the other hand, asBurr passionately argued,it also has a McDonald’s and a Pizza Hut and, hey, nobody beheaded him, OK?Meet your new AI art overlordsLater this year sees the opening ofDataland– billed as the world’s first AI art museum – in Los Angeles. It comes off the back of the Velvet Sundown, the 70s-style rockers who went viral on Spotify earlier this year despite existing only in algorithmic form, and Tilly Norwood, recently unveiled as the world’s first AI actor. So what do your dinner party guests think? Could they really spot a Louvre masterpiece from an AI fake? Is there not a better use for galaxy-brained robots than playing bass guitar in a band that sound a bit like the Eagles? Should Norwood be in the next series of Celebrity Traitors? All of this also doubles as helpful practice for the future when all dinner parties will simply involve sitting alone and conversing with obsequious chatbots over a bottle of Huel.How likely is a House of Dynamite scenario?No dinner party is complete without a recap of just how close we all are to being turned into radioactive ash. And what better way to do that than turn toKathryn Bigelow’s A House of Dynamite, which posits a scenario in which some rogue agent has launched a nuke at the US and they have a limited amount of time to respond. How realistic is the film? Is it as terrifying as Threads? (No.) And if this scenario actually happened in the real world, wouldn’t the US response just be Pete Hegseth blaming it all on woke? Oh, and also: does this particular dinner party have access to a lead-lined bunker?Are you still team Taylor?Maybe you haven’t had time to read all of the 732,643 think-pieces currently online (at time of going to press) regarding Swift’s latest album,The Life Of A Showgirl. But if you wanted to boil it all down to one red-hot issue then it’s probably the reigniting ofa feud with Charli xcxon Actually Romantic, in which Swift accusessomeoneof calling her “boring Barbie” when they were high on coke, and wonders why the person in question is so obsessed with her. Said obsession clearly alludes to Charli’s song Sympathy Is a Knife, which was sort of about Swift but also more about Charli’s own insecurities as a young woman. However you view it, please steer clear from wading into discussing the song Wood, Taylor’s ode to her fiance’s penis that will definitely put you off the dinner aspect of this dinner party.Erling Haaland: classical connoisseurIf a dinner party is particularly stilted, certain adults in the room may try to fill the awkward silences in the most desperate manner possible: football chat. You don’t have time to memorise the league position of every club in the pyramid, so this is where you effortlessly step in by plucking out a fascinating fact guaranteed to wow guests: did you happen to know, you will say, that Manchester City’s brutish number nine, Erling Haaland, is actually a surprisingly knowledgable classical music buff?Take them through the full repertoire of a recent playlist he made – from well-thumbed classics, such as Edvard Grieg’s In the Hall of the Mountain King, to hushed pieces of Nordic noir, such as Ólafur Arnalds’s Near Light – and perhaps pontificate on how repeated exposure to Bach’s keyboard concertos is the only surefire way to score an early winner against Brentford.Who should be in the next Celebrity Traitors?With the exception of Haaland’s love of Vivaldi, these conversation starters have admittedly been rather downbeat, covering feuds, military AI, dismemberment, nuclear catastrophe and the mental visualisation of at least two penises we did not need before eating. So let’s lighten the mood by trying to guess who might be recruited for the next series ofCelebrity Traitors: I’m thinking Tracey Emin, Lola Young, Chris Eubank, Miriam Margolyes, Nasty Nick, Meghan Markle, John Cleese andthat guy who won’t cut his hairuntil Manchester United win five games in a row should make a decent show of it.Explore more on these topicsChristmasWinter food 2025featuresShareReuse this content"

The blade missed my aorta by about a centimetreOlly HawesFri 28 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTShareAs someone committed to my craft, I’ve always believed that the show must go on. An accident in my second year of university took it to new extremes. It was the Exeter University theatre society’s annual play at the Edinburgh fringe and I’d landed the part of Cassius in Julius Caesar. The director decided that instead of killing himself, Cassius would die during a choreographed fight with his rival, Mark Antony. We also chose to use real knives, which sounds absurd, but we wanted to beauthentic. The plan was for the actor playing Antony to grab my arm as I held the knife, and pretend to push it behind my back. We must have rehearsed the sequence 50 times.We were about halfway through our month-long run, performing to a decently sized audience. Dressed in our togas, with the stage dark and moody, we began the fight as usual. Then something went wrong.There was a sharp piercing feeling. The knife was supposed to have been quietly slipped to me – instead, it had gone into my back. I realised what had happened while acting out my character’s death, and thinking: I have to lie here until the lights go down.There was a sharp piercing feeling. My heart started to raceAs everything went black before another scene came on, I pulled out the knife. That was when my heart started to race. Feeling strangely clear-headed, I rushed off stage into the foyer, my left leg going numb. I told the venue workers to call an ambulance. There was still a quarter of the play to go, and the performance continued, the audience and cast blissfully unaware. Even now, I don’t know what happened to the knife.The police showed up, then the paramedics. I have no recollection of the journey to the hospital. My clearest memory is being face down in a hospital bed, surrounded by doctors and nurses. I remember going into an MRI scan and giggling as they removed my nipple piercings. Looking back, it was clear I was in shock. It turns out the blade had gone 7.8cm deep in my back. It had partially severed a nerve in my spinal cord and missed my aorta by about a centimetre. When a doctor told me I’d come close to dying, and that the play had to stop using real knives, I remember thinking: “You just don’t understand theatre.”The director called my parents, who came up to Edinburgh to be with me as I recovered. I also got a call from the chair of the university theatre company asking if I intended to take legal action. It hadn’t crossed my mind: I probably thought it would be uncool.Experience: I played the trumpet for 25 hours straightRead moreAfter taking a week off from the show, I went back to the venue to speak to the cast. People were really upset for me.I felt overwhelmed with emotion. I ran out of the theatre, collapsed on to the pavement and started sobbing. I was filled with this sense that I shouldn’t be alive.About a year afterwards, I had a call from the doctor who had worked on me. He had written an article about the injury in a medical journal: it was called A Hit, a Palpable Hit. When I read it, I finally understood the gravity of what had happened to me. Then I didn’t talk about it for 10 or 15 years. Every now and then I’d feel a shudder, a sense that I shouldn’t be alive.If you look closely, you can see a tiny scar on my spine. The numbness in my leg has never gone away, but luckily it doesn’t affect my everyday life. Eighteen years later, I’m not as scared of death as I was, and I’m comfortable talking about what happened.I still work in theatre: I write and perform, and am a co-artistic director of a community storytelling organisation. Last year, I even went back to the venue to perform during the fringe. In mycurrent show, the main character comes across a stabbing victim. For all I went through, getting stabbed on stage never put me off theatre – it confirmed my love for it. The privilege of performing never fails to excite me, but I’m super conscious of safety nowadays.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Photograph: BAE SystemsAs navies seek to counter submarines and protect cables, startups and big defence companies fight to lead marketByJasper JollyFri 28 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 09.18 ESTShareFlying drones used during the Ukraine war havechanged land battle tacticsfor ever. Now the same thing appears to be happening under the sea.Navies around the world are racing to add autonomous submarines. The UK’s Royal Navy is planning a fleet of underwater uncrewed vehicles (UUVs) which will, for the first time, take a leading role in tracking submarines and protecting undersea cables and pipelines. Australia has committed to spending $1.7bn (£1.3bn)on “Ghost Shark” submarinesto counter Chinese submarines. The huge US Navy is spending billions on several UUV projects, including one already in use that can be launched from nuclear submarines.Autonomous uncrewed submarines represent “a genuine step-change in the underwater battle space”, said Scott Jamieson, the managing director for maritime and land defence solutions at BAE Systems, Britain’s dominant weapons company and builder of its nuclear submarines. The new drones under development would allow navies to “scale up in ways that just weren’t available before”, at “a fraction of the cost of manned submarines”, he said.The opportunity of a huge new market is pitting big, experienced defence companies, including BAE Systems and the US’s General Dynamics and Boeing against weapons tech startups such as the American firm Anduril – the maker of the Ghost Shark – and Germany’s Helsing. The startups claim they can move faster and cheaper.View image in fullscreenAnduril’s Ghost Shark is an extra-large autonomous underwater vehicle (XLAUV) that has been ordered by the Royal Australian Navy.Photograph: Rodney Braithwaite/Australian Defence Force/AFP/Getty ImagesThe struggle for undersea dominance has been almost constant in peacetime and war for most of the last century.The first nuclear-powered submarine (the US’s Nautilus, named after Jules Verne’s fictional vessel) was launched in 1954, and nuclear-armed vessels are now the centrepiece of the armed forces of six countries – the US, Russia, the UK, France, China and India – while North Korea may have recently become a seventh. That is despite deep controversy over whether the weapons represent value forhuge sums of money, and whether such a destructive arsenaltruly acts as a useful deterrent.Those armed forces are playing a constant game of hide and seek on the oceans. In order to avoid detection, the submarines rarely surface: maintenance problems on other vessels recently forced some British submarinersto spend a record nine months underwater, carrying Trident nuclear missiles that are theoretically ready to strike at any time.Tracking Russia’s underwater nuclear arsenal – which has become quieter in recent years – is a key focus of the Royal Navy, particularly focusing on the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) gap, a “chokepoint” that allows Nato allies to monitor Russian movements in the north Atlantic. A weapons executive said the South China Sea was another promising market, as China and its neighbours face off in atense, long-running territorial dispute.Greenland-Iceland-UK gap graphicUnderwater drones offer the promise of making it easier to track rivals’ submarines. Some sensors are designed to be dropped by other UUVs to lurk on the seabed for months at a time, according to an executive hoping to sell to the UK.The second spur has been the increasing number of apparent attacks on oil and gas pipelines, such as the Nord Stream attack in 2022, for which Germanyhas identified a Ukrainian suspect, and damage in 2023 to the Balticconnector pipeline between Finland and Estonia. Undersea power and internet cables are also crucial to the global economy. An underwaterpower cable between Finland and Estoniawas hit last Christmas, two months aftertwo telecommunications cablesin Swedish waters in the Baltic Sea were cut.The UK government last weekaccused Russia’s Yantar surveillance shipof entering British waters to map undersea cables. Itsaidthe UK had seen a 30% increase in Russian vessels threatening UK waters in the past two years.Parliament’s defence select committee has raised concerns over the UK’s vulnerability to undersea sabotage, known as “grey zone” actions that can cause big disruption but are likely to fall short of acts of war. Damage to the 60 undersea data and energy cables around the British Isles “could have devastating consequences for the UK”, the committee said.Andy Thomis, the chief executive of Cohort, a British manufacturer of military technology including sonar sensors, said the crewed ships, planes and submarines used up to now to track nuclear-armed subs or sabotage vessels were “very, very capable and very, very expensive”. But, he said, “by combining those with uncrewed vessels, you get the decision-making abilities that humans can give you without putting them in very dangerous proximity”.A video of BAE Systems’s Herne uncrewed underwater vehicle in testing in 2024. Source: BAE SystemsA video of BAE Systems’s Herne uncrewed underwater vehicle in testing in 2024Cohort hopes that some of its towed sensors (named Krait, after a sea snake) could be used on smaller autonomous vessels.The newest vessels contain as many as five times more sonar sensors than submarines in service. Lower power requirements are particularly important for smaller, uncrewed vessels, which do not have the luxury of a nuclear reactor on board. Passive sensors – which do not send out a sonar “ping” – make it harder to detect and destroy.The Royal Navy, and the armed forces in general, are not known for getting the latest technology into action quickly. However, Ukraine’s forces have learned that speed and low cost are crucial when it comes to building drones for the air and the sea. For the undersea drones, the Ministry of Defence is trying to learn that lesson, asking for rapid development of tech demonstrators under “Project Cabot”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Helsing has recently opened a facility in Plymouth, where the Royal Navy also has a base, to produce underwater drones. Anduril, which is run by the Donald Trump fundraiser Palmer Luckey, is eyeing up UK manufacturing sites.The initial contract awards are expected this year, followed by testing, likely to be in north-west Scotland by the defence company QinetiQ, and a full-scale order for one or two companies, named Atlantic Net, to fill the GIUK gap with sensors.The Royal Navy has described the project as “anti-submarine warfare as a service”, riffing on the much more common “software as a service”, according to a£24m tender noticepublished in May.View image in fullscreenAnduril’s Dive LD autonomous underwater vehicle. The US company is eyeing up UK manufacturing sites.Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersSidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow on sea power at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said the submarine-hunting strategy of recent decades “doesn’t scale in a conflict” because it required an expensive mix of big “exquisite assets”.Warships tow cables more than 100 metres long containing arrays of sonar sensors to try to pick up the faintest and lowest-frequency sounds. Planes such as the UK’s Boeing P-8 fleet drop disposable sonobuoys to detect submarines through the depths of the sea, satellites scour the surface for signs of wake left by a submarine communications mast, and a scattering of hunter-killer submarines patrol beneath the waves.The idea of cheap drones taking on a chunk of this work is attractive. Yet Kaushal warned that the price advantage “remains to be seen”. Industry figures warn that a big fleet of UUVs would still come with significant maintenance costs.For protecting undersea cables, too, it could be a double-edged sword: sabotage will be cheaper and easier as well. The prospect of drones firing on one another underwater is “absolutely realistic”, one executive said.The Ministry of Defence described it as “contractor owned, contractor operated, naval oversight” – meaning that privately owned vessels will be charged with anti-submarine warfare for the first time, potentially making them military targets.“The first thing the Russians will do is go out and test this, and push it,” said Ian McFarlane, the sales director for underwater systems at Thales UK, which already supplies the Royal Navy with sonar arrays towed by submarine-hunting ships, uncrewed surface boats and flying drones and hopes to play a part in Cabot, integrating that data.However, the attraction of getting companies on board, McFarlane said, was that the Royal Navy and its allies were looking for “mass and persistence now” to counteract “an aggressor who is ramping up”.This article was amended on 28 November 2025. An earlier version said Helsing was building a facility in Portsmouth; however, the factory is located in Plymouth and has recently opened.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorDefence policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You got naggy’: Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater on power, combovers and Blue MoonXan BrooksAhead of their 11th movie together, the actor and director discuss musicals, the legacy of Philip Seymour Hoffman and what being bald and 5ft tall does to your flirting skillsFri 28 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 05.36 ESTShare‘Ilike this, it’s good,” Ethan Hawke tells Richard Linklater, midway through a lively digression that has already hopped from politics to the Beatles to the late films ofJohn Huston. “What’s good?” asks Linklater. “All of this,” says Hawke, by which he means the London hotel suite with its coffee table, couch and matching upholstered armchairs; the whole chilly machinery of the international press junket. “I like that we get to spend a couple of days in a room,” he says. “It feels like a continuation of the same conversation we’ve been having for the past 32 years.”It’s all about the conversation with Linklater and Hawke. The two men like to talk; often the talk sparks a film. The director and actor first met backstage at a play in 1993 (“Sophistry, by Jon Marc Sherman,” says Linklater) and wound up chatting until dawn. The talk laid the ground for what would eventually becomeBefore Sunrise, a star-crossed romance that channelled an off-screen bromance as it sent Hawke and Julie Delpy wandering around mid-90s Vienna, walking and talking and stopping to kiss. “Yeah, that was the moment. That set the tone,” says Linklater, remembering. “Meeting Ethan backstage, then flying out to Vienna.”Blue Moon, Linklater and Hawke’s 11th collaboration, might be their splashiest number to date in that it’s a posh period drama – a tale of 1940s Broadway. Hawke plays the jilted lyricist Lorenz Hart, propping up the bar on the opening night of Oklahoma! as his former writing partner, Richard Rodgers, celebrates alongside Oscar Hammerstein. Hart dresses sharp and talks fast but he’s barely holding himself together, and so it was with the production itself. Blue Moon was shot at speed in 15 days on an Irish soundstage that masqueraded as midtown Manhattan. The ritzy trappings belie its indie roots.For Hawke in particular, it was a tough film to get right. In previous collaborations, he has essentially played a version of himself, or some amalgamation of himself and Linklater, whereas Hart was a stretch and required a much bigger performance. It was as though he’d grown used to being a member of the band and then suddenly had to learn a whole different instrument.Blue Moon review – Ethan Hawke is terrific in Richard Linklater’s bitter Broadway breakup dramaRead more“Yeah, you play the drums on this one,” says Linklater.Hawke nods. “But workwise, that put us in a different position. It felt dangerous. You got kind of naggy. It felt like I was hitting the wall of my talent.”“That’s the place where you want to be,” says Linklater.Hawke isn’t certain. “Well, you want it when it’s over. Afterwards, my son asked, ‘Was it fun?’ and I said that it was like going down a ski slope that’s too difficult. When you land safely, you say, ‘That’s amazing.’ But I’m not sure I would have said it was amazing when I was trying to maintain some sense of grace. When I was trying not to hit all the trees.”View image in fullscreenMargaret Qualley as Elizabeth Weiland and Ethan Hawke as Lorenz Hart in Blue Moon.Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/Sony Pictures Classics/APGraceful or not, it’s an eye-catching display, a flamboyant old-school physical transformation. Hart was bald and 5ft tall, so Hawke shaved his head and stood in a trench to appear shorter than his co-stars. This literally gave him a fresh view on the world. “Because the world is heightist. It’s ingrained in our culture, it’s in our language. Tall and handsome. Proud and strong. It’s tough when people don’t want to flirt with you. It changes how you see yourself.”He had an actor friend on the set, he recalls, who was helping him with the sightlines. The friend positioned himself in the trench, with his wife close by; suddenly she towered over him. “Wow, that’s so interesting,” she said. “I definitely wouldn’t have married you.”Hawke winces at the memory. “Because that’s shocking, right? That this woman who he’s been married to for 20 years should be put off by something so superficial. Not his brain, not his talent, not his looks, not his essence. You’re short and you’re bald. That’s not masculine to me.”Linklater chips in. “Yeah, but your wife said that, too.”“Yeah, OK, she did,” Hawke admits, laughing. The actor has been married to Ryan Shawhughes since 2008. It’s a good marriage; she loves him, although even she has her limits. “It wasn’t the height or the balding that bothered my wife,” he says. “It was the combover. The disguise is always worse than the thing itself. I dyed my hair, very obviously dyed, and then I did the combover. And Ryan came to visit the set one day, and she looked at me and said: ‘You know what, I’m leaving. I didn’t marry Larry Hart.’”Hawke is 55 and Linklater a decade older. Their films have tracked and mapped their lives, moving from the weightless youthful joy of Before Sunrise through the burdensome adult responsibilities of its sequels (2004’sBefore Sunset; 2013’sBefore Midnight). The sublimeBoyhoodwas pieced together over a 12-year period and featured Hawke as a deadbeat Texas dad who eventually straightens up, settles down and swaps his vintage sportscar for a family-friendly minivan. And now along comes Blue Moon, which is jaundiced and gin-soaked and pines for a world that’s moved on. It is – dare one say it – their first sad old man movie.“Uh-oh,” says Linklater. “I think I know what you’re saying here: ‘You’re in the final chapter, buddy.’”That’s not quite what I’m saying; they have plenty of road left to run. Certainly Hawke and Linklater have little in common with Hart, a brilliant, raging alcoholic who effectively died in the gutter at the age of 48. If anything, they resemble the duo that overshot and outlasted him: they’re the indie equivalent ofRodgers and Hammerstein.Probably every profession contains people like Hart: tortured and talented, and finally too much trouble. Sooner or later, something has to give. “I’ve had my own artistic breakups,” says Linklater. “And it’s always for the same reason – addiction. It’s sad, it’s poignant. It’s the worst. But when you’re in a position of responsibility, you have to make a decision for the good of the ship. ‘We’ll send you to rehab, but you can’t stay here, you got to get out.’”The tyranny of the sudden, early death is that it backshadows a life. Hawke began his career acting alongsideRiver PhoenixandRobin Williams. He performed oppositePhilip Seymour Hoffmanin the 2007 thrillerBefore the Devil Knows You’re Dead. All three have since been posthumously framed as brilliant, tragic figures. According to Hawke, this was only ever half true. “Because there was nothing tragic about those people,” he says. “If they were sitting here on the couch, you’d see how utterly un-tragic they were.”It isHoffman’s death– in 2014 of a drug overdose – that remains the hardest to process. “To understand Phil, you have to understand how many days he beat addiction,” Hawke says. “Phil had a problem. He lost one day. But he won all the other days, for twentysomething-odd years. I don’t want to say that he had no agency in his death. But it was a difficult period and he was taking [his sobriety] seriously. He was on his way to a meeting [the day that he died].” He shakes his head as though to clear it. “And I know other talented people – less famous – who have been lost the same way.”“Too much success or too much failure,” says Linklater. “You can react badly to both.”The secret might be to maintain a nice even keel – or, failing that, have a regular collaborator to measure your own life against. Technically, Hawke and Linklater don’t need one another. Each man has forged a perfectly successful career of his own (Hawke is appearing in the lucrativeBlack Phonehorror franchise; Linklater will soon release his jaunty, black-and-white Nouvelle Vague, all about the making of Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless). But it may be this independence which keeps the relationship healthy and the partnership balanced.“Yeah, my wife once said the same thing,” Hawke says. “She said: ‘Oh, well, it’s easy for them, because they’re on the same level.’ And maybe that’s right. Status plays such a big role in the world. “There are actor-director relationships where the actor becomes huge and is doing the director a favour by being in their movie. Or the reverse – the director becomes a big shot and starts doling out the favours.“And yet, luckily, life has kept us steady.”“We both percolate,” says Linklater. “Our underachieving careers have served us well.”Hawke shrugs. “Well, it makes the friendship easier. I mean, when Ryan said it, I didn’t like how it sounded. I don’t want to think of myself that way. I like to think that I’m not status-conscious and can maintain a friendship with anyone. But she’s not wrong, it makes it easier.”View image in fullscreen‘Life has kept us steady’ … Hawke and Linklater.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThere are other factors to consider. “There’s the business side, too. One of the things that’s hard on an actor is that if you don’t make films that make money, people can’t hire you anyway. If I didn’t have what’s perceived as a successful career, I’d put Rick at a disadvantage. It doesn’t matter that he likes me; he wouldn’t get any funding. So I have to take care of that part of the ship by myself.”Life is long and the film business is tough. Making independent movies doesn’t get any easier. This last one, says Linklater, was especially difficult. But the director feels good, full of energy as he approaches old age. Besides, film-makers aren’t like professional athletes, he adds. It’s not as though they start to lose a crucial step every year.Now it’s Hawke’s turn to chip in. “I know what people lose. They lose idealism and curiosity. The profession beats you up. You get cynical and you lose the curiosity.”“That’s depression, though,” Linklater says, frowning. “To not be interested in things. To think: what’s the point, why bother?”“Yeah, but that’s just what I’m saying,” says Hawke, almost spluttering. “You haven’t lost that at all. I mean, look, we’re sitting here with this little indie movie that we had to make in 15 days.” He turns towards me. “There are directors of Rick’s age and in Rick’s position who would quickly lose interest in working that hard.”“For no money,” adds Linklater. “They think: ‘Wait, this is where I started out. Why should I go back to the minor leagues?’”“But you’d never think of it as the minor leagues,” says Hawke. “That’s because you never equated success with money. It’s nothing to do with the salary, it’s about making good art. That’s why we’re here.” He gestures at the suite: the coffee table, the couch and the matching armchairs. “And you know where we are? You know what this is?”“The major leagues,” says Linklater and laughs.Blue Moon is out in the UK on 28 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmRodgers and HammersteinMusicals (Film)Musicals (Stage)Richard LinklaterEthan HawkeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Zuma-Mncube did not suggest a motive for her sister’s alleged recruiting in the statement she made to police.Zuma-Sambudla then filed an affidavit of her own, claiming she was “a victim of deception, misrepresentation and manipulation” by Khoza after the men were recruited for what she had believed was a legitimate paramilitary training course.Zuma-Sambudla said she went to Russia herself for a month of the training, in excerpts from her statement to policepublished by local media: “I experienced only non-combat, controlled activities. I was never exposed to combat, never deployed.”She claimed that she had “shared information innocently” with others, who then volunteered to go toRussiathemselves. She added: “I would not, under any circumstances, knowingly expose my own family or any other person to harm.”The South African outlet News24 said it had received videos from three of the men trapped in Ukraine, in which they alleged Zuma-Sambudla persuaded them to sign contracts in Russian that they did not understand and said she would spend a year in Russia training alongside them.Zuma, MK party’s president, was at the press conference but did not speak. The 83-year-old has been married six times and currently has four wives and more than 20 children. Polygamy isrecognisedin South Africa via a law governing “customary” marriages.Zuma was ousted as South Africa’s president in 2018, after being accused of directing a period of huge corruption known as “state capture”, allegations he has always denied. He founded MK party in December 2023, winning 14.6% of the vote in the2024 national elections.On Tuesday, police confirmed they were investigating, after receiving both affidavits. Zuma-Sambudla did not return calls and messages seeking comment. Khoza and Xuma could not be reached for comment.On 6 November the office of South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said it wasinvestigating how the menbecame trapped in eastern Ukraine and was working to bring them home, after receiving “distress calls for assistance”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In May, sheposted on X: “I Stand With Russia,” alongside photos of the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, although it was not clear if she had taken the photos herself or when they were taken.South Africa’s African National Congress party, which forced Zuma to stand down as president in 2018, has long been close to Russia after the Soviet Union supported its struggle against apartheid. South Africa’s government, whose foreign policy is still controlled by the ANC although it is now in a coalition, has refrained from criticising Russia for invading Ukraine. It has tried to present itself as a neutral arbiter in the search for a peace deal.Zuma-Sambudla is on trial on charges of inciting violence in posts on X, during deadly riots that erupted in 2021 when her father was sent to jail for contempt of court.

Farmers are clearing more land for food production. Infrastructure projects and mining are exacerbating the loss of vegetation and global heating – caused by the burning of gas, oil and coal – thereby degrading the resilience of ecosystems.The rainforest the world forgot: the Congo basin is the second largest on Earth, so why is it being neglected?Read moreScientists found that between2010 and 2017, African forests lost approximately 106bn kg of biomass per year, which is equivalent to the weight of about 106m cars. The worst affected were the tropical moist broadleaf forests in Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and parts of west AfricaThe study,published on Friday in Scientific Reports, was led by researchers at the National Centre for Earth Observation at the Universities of Leicester, Sheffield and Edinburgh. Using satellite data and machine learning, they tracked more than a decade of changes in the amount of carbon stored in trees and woody vegetation.They discovered that Africa gained carbon between 2007 and 2010, but since then widespread forest loss has tipped the balance so the continent is contributing more CO2into the atmosphere.The authors said the results show that urgent action is needed to stop forest loss or the world risks losing one of its most important natural carbon buffers. They say that Brazil has launched an initiative, the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), which aims to mobilise more than $100bn (£76bn) for forest protection by paying countries to leave their forests untouched.So far, however, only a handful of nations have invested a total of $6.5bn in the initiative.Prof Heiko Balzter, a senior author and director of the Institute for Environmental Futures at the University of Leicester, said the study showed the importance of scaling up the TFFF rapidly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But progress is not being made fast enough. The new TFFF is intended to pay forested nations for keeping their trees rooted in the ground. It is a way for governments and private investors to counteract the drivers of deforestation, such as mining for minerals and metals, and agricultural land take. But more countries need to pay into it to make it work.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisAfricaDeforestationGreenhouse gas emissionsAmazon rainforestTrees and forestsMiningnewsShareReuse this content"

Speakingduring closing argumentsat the trial, assistant US attorney Jacob Gutwillig said Hernández had “paved a cocaine superhighway to the United States”.Hernández was sentenced last June and called his conviction wrongful. He had served served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people, and was considered a top US ally in Central America, particularly by the Trump administration.Trump’s announcement to pardon Hernández comes even as the Republican leader casts himself as being tough on combating drug problems.Trump’s administration designated multiple drug cartels as“foreign terrorist organizations”and used claims of a“war on drugs”to justify deadly airstrikes on vessels across the Caribbean and Pacific. These strikes have prompted the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations to condemn the operations asextrajudicial executions.View image in fullscreenJuan Orlando Hernandez  in Manhattan federal court.Photograph: Jane Rosenberg/ReutersThe post was part of a broader message from Trump that backed Tito Asfura for Honduras’ presidency in upcoming elections, with Trump saying the US would be supportive of the country if he wins. But if Asfura loses the election this Sunday, Trump posted that “the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is.”Asfura’s party forged a close partnership with Washington under Hernández, who governed from 2014 to 2022 and was arrested shortly after leaving office.Honduras has been governed since 2021 by Xiomara Castro, who has forged close ties with Cuba and Venezuela, two countries mired in deep economic and human rights crises whose governments the Trump administration sees as dictatorships and has repeatedly criticized.Castro has leaned into a leftist stance, but she has kept a pragmatic and even cooperative attitude in dealing with the Trump administrations, and hasreceived a visitfrom the US homeland security Secretary Kristi Noem. The president has even backed off his threats to end Honduras’ extradition treaty and military cooperation with the US. Under Castro, Honduras has also received its citizens deported from the US and acted as a bridge for deported Venezuelans who were then picked up by Venezuela in Honduras.Hondurans go to the polls on Sunday to vote in an election that remains a toss-up, with polls showing Asfura, the former mayor of the capital Tegucigalpa, virtually tied with former defense minister Rixi Moncada of the ruling leftist LIBRE Party, and television host Salvador Nasralla of the centrist Liberal Party.Whichever candidate wins a simple majority on Sunday will govern Honduras between 2026 and 2030. Some political analysts fear more than one candidate could claim victory.The Organization of American States and Washington have raised concerns about Honduras’ electoral process and said they are monitoring the election closely.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpHondurasUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Babson College student was then detained by immigration officials and within two days sent toTexasand then Honduras, the country she left at age seven.“She’s absolutely heartbroken,” Pomerleau said. “Her college dream has just been shattered.”Mother of Karoline Leavitt’s nephew detained by US immigration agentsRead moreAccording to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an immigration judge ordered Lopez Belloza deported in 2015. Pomerleau said she wasn’t aware of any removal order, however, and the only record he has found indicates her case was closed in 2017.“They’re holding her responsible for something they claim happened a decade ago that she’s completely unaware of and not showing any of the proof,” the lawyer said.The day after Lopez Belloza was arrested, a federal judge issued an emergency order prohibiting the government from moving her out of Massachusetts or the US for at least 72 hours. ICE did not respond to an email on Friday from the Associated Press seeking comment about violating that order. Babson College also did not respond to an email seeking comment.Lopez Belloza, who is staying with her grandparents in Honduras,toldthe Boston Globe she had been looking forward to telling her parents and younger sisters about her first semester studying business.“That was my dream,” she said. “I’m losing everything.”Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationBostonTexasHondurasTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It also bans communal prayer on public roads and in parks, with the threat of fines of C$1,125 for groups in contravention of the prohibition. Short public events with prior approval are exempt.CAQ has made secularism a key legislative priority,passing the controversial Bill 21 –which bans some public sector employees from wearing religious symbol –in 2019.It plans to extend that prohibition to anyone working in daycares, colleges, universities and private schools. Full face coverings would be banned for anyone in those institutions, including students.Quebec’s secularism minister, Jean-François Roberge, said the controversial new provisions were the latest steps in a province working towards full secularization. He criticized previous accommodations by post-secondary institutions, including prayer rooms, telling reporters the schools “are not temples or churches or those kinds of places”. The ban on public prayer comes after the group Montreal4Palestine organized Sunday protests outside the city’s Notre-Dame Basilica that included prayers.“It’s shocking to see people blocking traffic, taking possession of the public space without a permit, without warning, and then turning our streets, our parks, our public squares into places of worship,” said Roberge.The province will also limit the offering of kosher and halal meals in public institutions. “We think that when the state is neutral, Quebecers are free,” said Roberge, rejecting allegations the law disproportionately affects minorities. “We have the same rules applying to everyone,” he said.But for Muslim students, the new rules “fee[l] like a personal attack against our community,” Ines Rarrbo, a first-year mechanical engineering student, told the Canadian Press. “It’s as if we’re not welcome here.”‘It shut all my doors’: how a Quebec law banning religious symbols derails women’s careersRead moreStephen Brown, president of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said the move amounts to “political opportunism” and reflects a “doubling down on identity politics and division in a desperate attempt to regain the public’s trust”.In a statement, the Assembly of Quebec Catholic Bishops said the proposed bill would be a “radical infringement on the rights and freedoms of the Quebec population” and that “the government has not demonstrated the need for such legislation”.Bill 21 bars judges, police officers, prison guards and teachers from wearing religious symbols while at work. Other public workers such as bus drivers, doctors and social workers must only keep their faces uncovered.The legislation runs afoul of both Quebec’s charter of human rights and freedoms and Canada’s charter of rights and freedoms but in 2021, Quebec’s superior court upheld the statute despite a finding that the law violates thefreedom of expressionandreligionof religious minorities. Governments in Canada can pass laws that breaches certain fundamental rights if they use a legal mechanism known as a the “notwithstanding clause”.Like Bill 21, the new legislation also invokes the clause pre-emptively, shielding it from challenges under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Canada’s supreme court is expected to hear a legal challenge to the use of the notwithstanding clause in the coming months.Explore more on these topicsQuebecCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

With new legislative powers, Carney’s government could also slash permitting and approval delays.But the response from politically powerful nations, such as the Haida – whose consent the government needs – was both quick and simple: “This project is not going to happen.”Gaagwiis, the president of the Haida nation, said the federal government had a duty to “uphold the honour of the crown” when working with his community.“Trying to ram through a project puts that ‘honour’ in jeopardy,” he said. “This is an opportunity for the government of Canada and the prime minister, to look in the mirror and see what kind of country he wants to lead and what kind of country he wants Canada to be.”Despite Carney’s pledge to obtain the full consent of First Nations – and to share any windfall – on any possible pipeline project, Gaagwiis said there was nothing federal or provincial leaders could say to move his nation.“Because there’s absolutely nothing that can fully guarantee the safety of our communities from an oil spill, there’s nothing that can be said to convince us otherwise.”Marilyn Slett, the president of the Coastal First Nations (CFN), which represents eight coastal First Nations including the Haida, said the group had no interest allowing tankers in coastal waters.“We have zero interest in co-ownership or economic benefits of a project that has the potential to destroy our way of life and everything we have built on the coast,” she said.Carney has been working to calm political strife among provincial leaders, and Thursday’s announcement was met with enthusiasm in Alberta. Speaking to the Calgary chamber of commerce, the prime minister received a standing ovation, a near-impossible feat for a Liberal leader in a conservative-leaning region.Business groups have come out in favour of the deal, which the Canadian chamber of commerce says moves the country towards “economic cooperation, greater regulatory certainty and reduced tension”.Recent polling showsthat a majority of Canadians – including a slim majority in British Columbia – are open to the idea of a pipeline. The vague outlines of a major infrastructure project have also piqued the interest of some First Nations in Alberta who have been promised a possible equity stake in any project.The premise of Carney’s energy plan is that oil and gas exports can be increased while meeting the federal government’s climate targets. The federal government will exempt a possible pipeline project from the existing coastal oil tanker moratorium and emissions cap. In exchange, Alberta must raise its industrial carbon pricing and invest in a multibillion-dollar carbon capture project.In theory, the deal goes a long way in bringing together Alberta and Ottawa in the pursuit of a common, nation-building goal. But critically, no private company has expressed an interest in backing a pipeline project that would face stiff opposition.“No proponent, no route, no money, no First Nation support,” the British Columbia premier, David Eby, said after the announcement.Eby, a strong critic of the deal after his province was excluded in talks, said any pipeline proposal “cannot draw limited federal resources, limited Indigenous governance resources, limited provincial resources away from the real projects that will employ people, provide the country with money that we desperately need, and provide investment and access to global markets”.The agreement also cost Carney one of his most prominent cabinet ministers,Steven Guilbeault, who resigned hours after the signing of the agreement.In a post on social media announcing his resignation, Guilbeault said the decision came with “great sadness”, but was necessary given his values as a longtime environmental advocate.The decision to lay the groundwork for a possible heavy oil pipeline also reflects a political shift by Carney, who, before entering politics, developed credentials as a global economist focused on attaining a net zero future.Jessica Green, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said: “Everything in this [agreement] says more fossil fuels, except the first line – where it says Canada and Alberta remain committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.“Call a spade a spade: if you want to double down on fossil fuels, at least have the guts to say it out loud.”Green said the pact was a “dumpster fire” of a climate agreement after signalling politically that Canada was “all in” on fossil fuels.But a protracted trade war with the US, Canada’s largest trading partner and closest political ally, has dramatically upended the country’s economic security. Much of Carney’s brief tenure as prime minister has focused on expanding potential markets outside of the US.“Without the trade war and the tariffs, I imagine the economy would not be hurting in the way that it is,” said Green. “Nobody’s got a crystal ball, but in a world where we’re not haemorrhaging from the trade war, I imagine we don’t see this level of aggressive pandering to fossil fuel interests and infrastructure.”For the remote coastal First Nations whose harvests and livelihood come from the Pacific Ocean, the threat of a pipeline is more than just a question of climate policy.Gaagwiis said: “When people talk about this project, they need to understand an entire ecosystem could collapse in the event of a spill. Losing a culture that developed relationships with the ocean over thousands of years would be devastating. There needs to be respect for that.“I see the reality setting in soon that there is no project, there’s no pipeline route, there’s no proponent – and there’s no support. Everyone here is against it. There are other ways for Alberta to find more business in moving oil. But it’s not going to be through the coast.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaMark CarneyAmericasanalysisShareReuse this content"

Jamaica’s prime minister, Andrew Holness, who is dealing with the devastation of Hurricane Melissa, described the election as “an important moment for the Vincentian people”.He said on X: “I wish Dr Friday every success as he undertakes the responsibility of national leadership, and I pray God’s guidance and wisdom upon him in the work ahead. Jamaica values its close friendship with St Vincent and the Grenadines, and we look forward to strengthening our cooperation as we continue to build a more resilient and prosperous Caribbean region together.”Taiwan’s ambassador to SVG, Fiona Fan, also congratulated Friday. The NDP has previously proposed severing relations with Taiwan and restoring ties with China. This year’s NDP manifesto made no mention of ending ties with Taipei, however, and the party had been criticised for failing to clarify its position on the issue..Under Gonsalves’s leadership, SVG has continued to cooperate with Taiwan over infrastructure, education and healthcare. The relationship has yielded benefits such as the scholarships, support for the international airport and help with the construction of a state-of-the-art hospital.“Taiwan and Saint Vincent share universal values such as democracy, freedom and human rights,” the Taiwan foreign ministry said on Friday.Friday, 66, a lawyer, took over leadership of the NDP in 2016 but has been in parliament since 2001.Hisparty had promisedto create “more and better-paid jobs”, address rising crime and violence and improve healthcare and infrastructure. It had also pledged to follow other Caribbean countries in allowing individuals to gain citizenship through significant financial contributions to the economy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Granted, he did do a lot in terms of transforming SVG,” he said.“He took us through the global financial crisis. He took us through the global pandemic. He took us through the La Soufrière volcanic eruption, Hurricane Beryl and previous climate change episodic events. But I think that wasn’t a concern for many of the voters either. I also think that the messaging from the ULP was not strong and convincing enough because I did not see them leaning enough on a lot of their wins.”The government’s vaccine mandate during the Covid-19 crisis also had a serious impact on support for the ULP, Quashie said. The mandate, which required most frontline workers to be jabbed, resulted in some losing their jobs.In 2021, Gonsalves was taken to hospital after being hit on the head with a stone in a demonstration against the vaccine mandate.Explore more on these topicsSt Vincent and the GrenadinesCaribbeanAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Four people died of their injuries in hospital, Chris Tang, the city’s security secretary told the media on Friday afternoon. A further 79 people, including 11 firefighters, had been injured. About 200 people were still unaccounted for, and 89 of the bodies had not yet been identified.The head of the fire services, Andy Yeung, confirmed what many residents had been claiming for days: that no fire alarms went off in any of the eight towers. “We will take enforcement actions against the contractors responsible,” he said.Later on Friday, Hong Kong’s anti-corruption watchdog said it had arrested eight people. The group of seven men and one woman included “engineering consultants, scaffolding construction contractors and a middleman”, said the Independent Commission Against Corruption. Three other construction executives have already been detained.View image in fullscreenBurnt-out buildings of the Wang Fuk Court complex in Hong Kong.Photograph: Vernon Yuen/Nexpher/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockOfficials have said the fire was finally outbut they needed to wait for the building to cool down before they could enter some areas, where temperatures were still above 200C (390F). They estimated it would take three to four weeks to collect evidence.Throughout the morning, more people arrived at the Kwong Fuk estate community centre, adjacent to the towers, to identify the bodies being pulled from the gutted buildings. Few names of the dead have been released to the public yet, and Tang declined to release demographic information of those confirmed killed.Anger swelling in Hong Kong over deadliest fire in more than 70 yearsRead moreYeung said: “The fire in the building was extremely intense, with temperatures at the scene reaching 500 degrees, sometimes exceeding that.” That made it difficult to reach high floors, he added.“The interior spaces of the building were very narrow. Firefighters had to carry out operations unit by unit, floor by floor, and the units were cluttered with a large amount of items.”The blaze, which began on Wednesday afternoon, spread quickly through the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in the northern district of Tai Po. The eight-tower estate housing more than 4,600 people had been undergoing renovations and was wrapped in bamboo scaffolding and green mesh.On Friday afternoon, Tang said the green mesh was up to safety standards. Instead, they believed the highly flammable polystyrene foam discovered in every elevator window was the primary cause of the fire’s intensity. He said the blaze started from the lower part of the Wang Cheong tower, first in the mesh, then the foam, before spreading inside the building. High temperatures broke windows, allowing the fire to spread from unit to unit, helped along by high winds and falling debris from the burning mesh and scaffolding, Tang said.Hong Kong’s labour department said the building contractor had been reminded repeatedly in writing to take appropriate fire prevention measures after inspections over the last year revealed unsafe working practices. The most recent inspection was on 20 November.View image in fullscreenA resource collection point set up by volunteers to provide supplies for residents affected by the fire.Photograph: Jessie Pang/ReutersHowever, the department said the risk of fire was deemed to be relatively low and that the scaffold netting appeared to meet the standards for flame-retardant performance.Most of the dead were found intwo of the seven towers that caught fire, and most survivors were pulled from the others.A man identified only as Mr Lau said his parents were missing, and he believed they had not survived. Sobbing, he told reporters he had no information. “At the scene I know nothing,” he said. “I just want to know if my parents are alive or dead. If they’ve died I don’t want to even see the bodies, I only want to know they’re gone so at least I won’t keep worrying.”Another resident, who lived on the 10th floor of one of the towers, said her family was safe but her neighbours were missing. “I don’t want to watch TV, I don’t want to look at community groups, I don’t want to read any news on my phone,” she said. “I just want life to go back to normal, but right now it feels very difficult.”Indonesia’s consul general, Yul Edison, arrived on Friday afternoon to help with identification of the bodies.View image in fullscreenFirefighters near the scene of the fire at Wang Fuk Court.Photograph: Chan Long Hei/APMany Indonesians work as domestic helpers in flats such as those at Wang Fuk Court. Edison told reporters at least one Indonesian national was among the dead. A spokesperson for the Mission for Migrant Workers NGO said there were 11 Indonesian domestic helpers still missing, from 119 known to live in the building.The Philippines consulate said one Filipino domestic worker was still missing, one was injured, and 24 were accounted for. A crowdsourced web app has collated reports from people about each building, identifying individual flats in each tower, with available details of the residents.“A 41-year-old man went missing at 16.45,” said one report from block F, where the fire began. “His last message was that he was trapped in stairwell 25-26.” Another report confirmed the death of a 60-year-old man, a 90-year-old woman and a 40-year-old Indian national who lived with them as a domestic helper in an 11th-floor apartment. Eight floors above them, four people were reported to have died in one apartment.The fire hasprompted calls for stronger fire safety lawsin the construction sector. “There’s no law stipulating that flame-retardant materials must be used,” Lee Kwong-sing, the chair of Hong Kong Institute of Safety Practitioner said, according to the state broadcasting service RTHK.“It is merely stated in the codes of practice by the labour department, so many people may not follow the requirements as it is not illegal. But if you turn such codes into a mandatory requirement … then that’ll be another story altogether.”Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsHong Kong apartment firesHong KongAsia PacificChinanewsShareReuse this content"

People can mark themselves as safe, or submit information about who is still missing from certain apartments.Anotherwebsitehas an interactive map which shows where supply stations are available in the Tai Po area. There is also a platform for coordinating volunteer shifts.There are also numerousfundraising platformsthat are collecting donations, including the government’s “Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po”, which has a startup donation of HKD$300m (£29,172,600) from the government.View image in fullscreenThe Wang Fuk Court buildings in Tai Po, Hong Kong, after the fire.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockMessages flooded social media platforms and messaging apps with call-outs for help. On Telegram, the encrypted messaging app that was widely used during the pro-democracy protests, channels appeared for different duties such as Tai Po drivers, Tai Po helpers and Tai Po fire support. Users post lists of supplies that are needed at various locations, such as folding tables, mattresses and cleaning supplies. Many of the groups already have thousands of members.TheHong KongRed Cross said its blood banks had eight to 10 days’ worth of supplies and it appealed to residents to book an appointment for future donations.Elsewhere, a group of Hong Kong lawyersposted a call-outon social media for volunteers to support victims with tenancy and land law questions, employment issues and other legal matters that may arise from the deadly blaze. The group said it was aiming to prepare a list of frequently asked questions to distribute to frontline NGOs and affected individuals to “help them understand their legal rights, options and possible next steps in a clear and accessible way”. The materials would be available in Chinese, English, and possibly other languages used by ethnic minorities in Hong Kong, the group said.At least two Indonesian domestic workers are confirmed to have died in the fire.Questions are already swirling about how the fire could have spread so quickly across the seven tower blocks in Wang Fuk Court that were affected. Residents had complained for more than a year about possible fire hazards in the building relating to the construction work that sheathed the blocks in bamboo scaffolding and green netting. Authorities have also pointed to the highly flammable Styrofoam used in elevator window coverings on every floor.On Friday, the head of the fire services, Andy Yeung,confirmedwhat many residents had been claiming for days: that no fire alarms went off in any of the towers.Three people associated with the contractor, Prestige, have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. The South China Morning Postreportedthat Prestige had been convicted of two safety offences in 2023, before it won the contract for the renovation works at Wang Fuk Court. Prestige has not commented on the disaster.Another crowd-sourced web project is an initiative to preserve the minutes of meetings of the Wang Fuk Court homeowners association, where concerns were raised about the bidding process for the renovation works.The labour department told residents last year that there was a relatively low risk of fire at the site. Nevertheless, it said the contractor had been repeatedly warned in writing about other unsafe working practices at Wang Fuk Court.Explore more on these topicsHong Kong apartment firesHong KongChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

He suffered minor injuries to his right leg but was able to run to a nearby police box to report the incident, which occurred near a railway station that had closed for the night.Amid Japan’s surge in bear attacks, a torrent of AI-generated videos is adding to anxietyRead moreA record 13 people have died in bear attacks inJapansince the start of April, according to the environment ministry, while the number of attacks in that period stands at 197 – another record. Many of the incidents occurred in Akita, a northern prefecture, followed by Iwate and Fukushima in Japan’s north-east.The number in 2025 will almost certainly exceed the annual record of 219 attacks set in the year starting April 2024.Experts say hungry bears are venturing into residential and other built-up areas in search of food afterpoor crops of acorns and beechnutsin their natural habitat.In response, the government has sent members of theself-defence forcesto Akita to help local hunters trap and dispose of bears. Armed police officers have also been given permission to shoot the animals amid a shortage of licensed hunters.A local government in north-east Japan apologised this week after it discovered that an image it had posted on social media to promote awareness of bear attacks had beenAI-generated.The image, uploaded to the X account of the Onagawa municipal government, showed a huge bear standing on a road at night.Officials deleted the post after the image’s creator, who had seen the photo spreading online, contacted them to explain that it was fake.“We have caused anxiety and inconvenience to the town’s residents,” the Mainichi Shimbun quoted an Onagawa official as saying.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The age limit for general candidates has increased from 35 to 38, while the age limit for those with postgraduate degrees has been raised from 40 to 43.The millions of applicants will be competing for 38,100 civil service vacancies across the country, the equivalent of an average of 97 people per job.The low-desire life: why people in China are rejecting high-pressure jobs in favour of ‘lying flat’Read moreSome jobs are particularly in demand. According to data published in Chinese media, the vacancy that received the most applicants was an immigration officer role in Ruili, a city in south-west Yunnan province that borders Myanmar. For the one job, 6,470 people have been approved to apply.Beijing announced in October that the age limit for the civil service exams would be increased in line with recent increases to China’s retirement age.China’s ageing population and dwindling pension budget has forced a reckoning with its relatively low retirement ages. Last year, the government approved plans to gradually increase the retirement age for the first time since the 1950s. The statutory retirement age for women will increase from 50 to 55 for those in blue-collar jobs, and from 55 to 58 for women in white-collar jobs. For men, the retirement age will increase from 60 to 63.Although public sector jobs generally have lower wages – and in recent years somedebt-ridden local authorities have struggled to pay wages at all– the jobs are increasingly coveted for their security in an increasingly challenging economy. Harking back to the Maoist era, civil services jobs are known as providing the “iron rice bowl” – an idiom that refers to having a job for life.In China’s years of reform and opening up, plunging into the risks and rewards of commercial enterprises was known asxiahai,or “jumping into the sea”. Now people talk ofshangan,or “landing ashore”, to describe successfully passing the exams into the stable public sector.“The occupational structure of China’s job market has shifted markedly over the last decade or so away [from] high-pay, high-skill jobs in [manufacturing] and construction towards low-pay, low-skill in the gig and informal sectors. In the latter, benefits and pensions tend to be absent or uncertain, and formal contractual obligations are weak,” said George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre. “With 12 million grads coming on to the market each year … the preference for secure government sector jobs isn’t hard to understand.”China’s unemployment rate is 5.1% for the general workforce, and 17.3% for 16- to 24-year-olds excluding college students. In 2023 the government temporarilystopped publishingyouth unemployment figures, which had reached a record 21.3%, resuming publication after a few months with a new methodology that excludes students.Thetrade warand weak consumer demand after the Covid-19 pandemic have battered China’s economy, withmany young people choosing to “lie flat”, i.e. do nothing, rather than seek employment in jobs which they feel do not match their level of education or provide sufficient benefits. And next year, China is bracing itself for a record 12.7 million graduates.The raising of the age limit for the exams has generally been welcomed, especially as it could help workers avoid the well-documented “curse of 35”, where companies refuse to higher people past their mid-30s.But some have also spoken of the challenges of juggling exam prep with looking after young families, a balance that fresh graduates are less likely to have to worry about.The civil service exam is notoriously gruelling, with questions on law, physics, biology, politics and reasoning. Since last year, there has also been a section on political theory, which “focuses on candidates’ ability to analyse and solve problems using the Party’s innovative theories,” according to an official announcement. Questions from last year covered Xi Jinping’s major speeches of the past 12 months and Communist party plenums.One 35-year-old mother shared her daily routine on Xiaohongshu as she prepared for this year’s tests. It involved pre-dawn starts and cramming in study sessions around childcare, with the result being four to five hours of sleep a night. “Days are for Powerpoint presentations, nights are for formulas and picture books, waking up at 4am is the time to prepare for the exam”.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The deluge tore through mountainside villages, swept away people and submerged more than 2,000 houses and buildings, the National Disaster Management Agency said. Nearly 5,000 residents fled to government shelters.Television reports showed rescue personnel using jackhammers, circular saws, farm tools and sometimes their bare hands to dig in areas marked by thick mud, rocks and uprooted trees. Rescuers in rubber boats were searching through a river and helped children and older people who were forced on to the roofs of flooded homes and buildings.In North Sumatra province the death toll rose to 37 as rescue personnel recovered more bodies on Thursday, said provincial police spokesperson Ferry Walintukan in a statement. Rescuers were searching for 52 residents reported missing, but mudslides, blackouts and a lack of telecommunications were hampering search efforts, he said.‘We can no longer predict the seasons’: why Indonesia’s coal mindset has to changeRead more“With many missing and some remote areas still unreachable, the death toll was likely to rise,” Walintukan said.View image in fullscreenThe Mount Nago Bridge collapsed due to flash floods in the Pauh District, Padang City, West SumatraPhotograph: BNPB/Sutantaaditya.com/ShutterstockSeventeen bodies were recovered by Thursday in South Tapanuli district and eight bodies in Sibolga city, Walintukan said. In the neighboring district of Central Tapanuli, landslides hit several homes, killing at least a family of four as well as one person found dead in floods in the city of Padang Sidempuan.Rescue workers also recovered two bodies in Pakpak Bharat district and were searching for five people reported missing in Humbang Hasundutan, where four villagers were killed by landslides, Walintukan said. At least one resident died when mud and debris struck a main road on a tiny Nias island, and he added.Floods were also occurring elsewhere in the vast archipelago, including in Aceh and West Sumatra, where thousands of houses were flooded, many up to roofs, the disaster agency said.Rescuers by Thursday recovered at least nine bodies after landslides triggered by torrential rains struck three villages in Central Aceh on Wednesday, said the district chief Halili Yoga, who called on the local disaster agency to deploy and excavator to pull out at least two people buried under mud.Aceh’s Disaster Mitigation Agency said nearly 47,000 people were displaced by floods in the province, forcing about 1,500 residents to flee to temporary shelters.The flooding in West Sumatra province submerged thousands of homes, including more than 3,300 houses in Padang Pariaman district, forcing about 12,000 residents to flee to temporary shelters, the local disaster mitigation agency said.View image in fullscreenFlooding in the Lubuk Minturun area of Koto Tangah, Padang City, West Sumatra, caused damage as tree debris and mud affected residential areas.Photograph: BNPB/Sutantaaditya.com/ShutterstockThe agency reported at least 23 people dead and five missing in West Sumatra province as rescuers recovered more bodies on Thursday, including the bodies of six people who drowned in floods in Lumin Park, a residential area in the provincial capital of Padang.Scores of rescue personnel searching through a river around the Anai Valley Waterfall area in Tanah Datar district where tons of mud, rocks and trees were left from flash floods retrieved seven bodies on Thursday, including a child, Padang’s Search and Rescue Office reported.Rescue teams and volunteers in the worst-hit Agam district recovered 10 bodies of people who were swept away by floods in Malalak village by Thursday, said Hendri, a relief coordinator who goes by a single name. He said rescuers still searching for five villagers reported missing.View image in fullscreenPeople wade through the water at a flooded street in Medan, North Sumatra, IndonesiaPhotograph: Binsar Bakkara/AP‘Suddenly I heard a rumbling sound’Lingga Sari, a Malalak resident, recalled the moment the flash flood struck as she was trying to put her restless child to sleep.“Suddenly I heard a rumbling sound that kept getting louder,” said the mother of the one-year-old boy. Stepping outside with her child in her arms, she saw neighbours gathering in panic, shouting warnings of a sudden torrent. She and others rushed toward a small prayer house at a nearby intersection, but flood waters quickly surged in.“We had to run again, racing through the rising water toward the rice field,” Lingga said.Agam district chief Benny Warlis told The Associated Press that about 200 residents remain isolated in landslide-hit Jorong Taboh village on a hillside after recent landslides. Authorities have yet to confirm the number of people left homeless, dead, or missing by the devastation, as all routes to the area are cut off.“We are facing difficulties verifying data on victims and those missing because access to the village, located on a steep hill, is completely blocked,” Warlis said.Heavy seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides inIndonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains.Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaExtreme weatherAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

To respond to a precautionary action from Airbus, we have cancelled some Jetstar Airways flights,” the airline said.“Our teams are working on options to get customers on their way as quickly as possible and are contacting affected customers directly.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailTwelve Jetstar flights from Melbourne and 18 out of Sydney were cancelled on Saturday morning including international flights to Port Vila, Singapore and Bali. Two Jetstar flights into Perth and two departures from the same airport were cancelled.The global recall was issued after an incident involving a JetBlue flight from Cancún, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on 30 October, in which several passengers were hurt after a sudden drop in altitude.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency, which is the main certifying authority for A320 aircraft, described it in the recall notice as an “uncommanded and limited pitch down event” but said if uncorrected it could lead in the worst-case scenario to “an uncommanded elevator movement that may result in exceeding the aircraft’s structural capability”.Qantas also owns planes in the A320 family, but the airline said on Saturday none of its planes or flights were affected as none of its fleet required the software update.Virgin Australia operates four A320-class planes on its Western Australian regional service but said its Boeing 737 fleet was able to cover the small number of flights that A320s were to have flown.“We do not anticipate any impact to either Virgin Australia or our regional airline operations,” a spokesperson for the company said on Saturday morning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has denied the allegations.The supreme court documents state Giuffre’s estate is worth more than A$472,000 – a legal threshold in WA that governs how assets are divided when there is no will.A statement of claim by Christian and Noah includes the Witty River Family Trust, a 2017 Toyota Kluger, a 2024 Chevrolet Silverado, a horse, jewellery, royalties from Giuffre’s memoir and personal effects at the Neergabby property where she died.Even if the court ultimately finds that an informal will existed, Christian and Noah argue that Giuffre lacked the capacity to make a will at the time the documents were drafted.Medical records are expected to form a significant part of their evidence.The plaintiffs in the case also argue the alleged informal will should not be accepted because Louden, the lawyer who recorded the instructions, stands to benefit financially from the estate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Both ingredients are regulated by the TGA, making them subject to safety reviews.New tests reveal ‘hidden’ chemicals boosting SPFTo test the sunscreens, the UNSW scientists spread films of each product on quartz, a type of glass that does not absorb UV on its own.They used a device that could pass UV light through each sunscreen’s film to see how much light was absorbed and reflected, and worked out the patterns that zinc oxide showed compared with “chemical” filters.In the case of the Invisible Zinc Junior Mineral Sunscreen SPF50, the UNSW testing found zinc oxide wasn’t the only ingredient providing sun protection, despite the company advertising otherwise.On the TGA register, its manufacturer, iNova Pharmaceuticals claims, zinc oxide is the product’s only “active” ingredient. It lists butylocyl salicylate and ethylhexyl methoxycrylene as “other” ingredients.The UNSW research found there was “no doubt” these other chemicals contributed to the sunscreen’s SPF performance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOn its website, Invisible Zinc claims the sunscreen contains “no chemical UV filters”.An iNova spokesperson said the assertion that the chemicals were hidden was “categorically false”, because they were disclosed in the product’s TGA listing.“It is true that both [butyloctyl salicylate and ethylhexyl methoxycrylene] absorb UV, however, that is not their primary function in our formulation,” they said.“We stand by the claims associated with Invisible Zinc Junior Mineral Sunscreen, particularly that micronized zinc oxide is the only active ingredient.”Naked Sundays did not respond to Guardian Australia’s requests for comment.But the UNSW researchers said its BeautyScreen SPF50 Peptide Foundation Tint returned similar results to those of Invisible Zinc’s.On its website, the product lists zinc oxide 12% as its only active ingredient. It names butyloctyl salicylate as an “inactive” ingredient, but the UNSW researchers said this chemical was “definitely boosting the SPF” of the product.Because it is considered a cosmetic the product does not need to be registered with the TGA or list its ingredients on the regulator’s website.Sunscreen industry under a microscopeThe UNSW research was conducted over several months after the consumer advocacy group Choice prompted a scandal in June with its owninvestigation into popular sunscreen brands’ SPF claims.The industry has previously run on an honour system: sunscreen brands “self-certify” they have tested SPF claims, and the TGA does not usually do its own testing.But after the Choice investigation, the TGA recalled a range of sunscreens and is considering changes to the way it regulates the industry, including how products should be tested.The UNSW researchers said their calculations were a “best-case scenario” because their testing could not account for the potential interaction between the sunscreens and skin, especially if it were absorbed or washed off.The TGA has said, however, that variability between people presents issues with testing sunscreen on human skin. The regulator is considering a shift to in vitro SPF testing, away from the accepted method of using human volunteers.The TGA has been contacted for comment.Quick GuideContact Guardian AustraliaShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact the Guardian Australia news teams using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He is a patron, and has competed there at least twice.The club, based in Dawesville in Hastie’s Western Australian electorate of Canning, has restrictive membership conditions and “over 300 active members”.The conflict of interest declaration was contained in disclosures made under theStronger Communitiesgrant program obtained by Guardian Australia through freedom of information laws.The declarations also show that the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, sought a grant for the Property Trust of the Anglican Church Diocese of Sydney in the 2025 round of the program, but was knocked back.The grant was deemed ineligible by the department after Albanese declared a conflict; however, it is understood the conflict was not the reason the grant was deemed ineligible.Australian PM blames ‘aggressive protesters’ for closure of local electorate officeRead moreWhile the nature of the conflict is redacted, the diocese was the landlord for Albanese’s Marrickville electorate office, which is next door to its St Clements church and was closed in September.The closure came after repeated protests at Albanese’s office, which heclaimed was the reasonfor the church’s decision to discontinue the lease.Ross Ciano, the senior minister at the church, told Guardian Australia he was not advised why the grant – which had been intended for internal renovations – was knocked back.The prime minister’s office declined to comment.In 2020,Guardian Australia reportedthat Hastie had allocated a $20,000 Stronger Communities grant to the Port Bouvard gun club for electrical work, but since then three further grants have been awarded in collaboration with his office, bringing the total to almost $40,000.The club has received a total of four grants through Hastie’s office since he was elected, paid out across three separate government programs, all of which require direct input from the MP’s office.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailEach of the four grants has been awarded through programs that require the MP to either nominate or invite organisations to apply before they are assessed by the department.In November 2021, the club received $5,000 under the government’s Powering Communities program for the installation of solar panels.Departmental guidelines for the program required each MP to identify potential applicants and projects, and invite them to apply. These were then assessed against the program’s eligibility criteria. A maximum of 12 projects in each electorate was eligible.Just three months later, the club was awarded another grant – worth $4,350 – under the Stronger Communities program, which gives every MP in the House of Representatives a $150,000 envelope of funds to allocate to small capital projects in their electorates.The stated purpose was to renovate the club’s entrance doorways, “to improve the usability and accessibility of the club and encourage further community participation”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first emergency announcement made over Tannoy in Westfield was made only well after Cauchi had been shot dead.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIn her oral submission on Friday afternoon, Sue Chrysanthou SC, representing the Good, Young and Singleton families said: “Cr1 should never have been in that chair unsupervised on that day.”“If a competent person had seen Dawn stabbed on CCTV and issued an alert … then Ashlee Good could have taken some sort of action to save herself,” she said.“She was in a lift,” she continued. Had she “even had 10 seconds’ warning” she could have taken evasive action, including by staying in the lift.Senior counsel assisting the coroner, Dr Peggy Dwyer SC said CR1 was competent in her role in some aspects, but should not have been responsible for the CCTV control room alone.Bondi Junction stabbings: Joel Cauchi’s psychiatrist was belligerent and confrontational when giving evidence, inquest toldRead moreEchoing Chrysanthou’s sentiments, the lawyer for the family of Darchia, Daniel Roff, said: “No alarm was hit, certainly not the correct alarm. Miss Darchia would have been able to take evasive action, but that opportunity was denied to her.”Representing the Westfield Bondi Junction owner, Scentre Group, Dean Jordan SC said earlier on Friday that some criticisms of CR1’s performance were “harsh” and that there was a consistent body of evidence that showed she was competent and did not require ongoing supervision.Chrysanthou also took aim at Dr Andrea Boros-Lavack, Cauchi’s psychiatrist. While she acknowledged the Toowoomba doctor had “finally” accepted her discharge of Cauchi to his GP was deficient, she said the “belated” admission did not “undo the lack of judgment and insight demonstrated by Dr Boros-Lavack throughout this inquest”.Her discharge was “not just sub-par”, she said, but “far worse than that”. The “cheery letter” was misleading and “presented a healthy patient” that was then repeatedly referred to by other doctors for years.Her conduct warrants the coroner referring Boros-Lavack to the health regulator, she said.On Tuesday, Dwyer also suggested that, should the coroner refer the matter, the health regulator could investigate the psychiatrist further. On Friday, her lawyer, Mark Lynch, suggested the families of those who were killed could make the referral to the regulator themselves.In response, Chrysanthou asked: “Haven’t they been through enough?”“Why should they have to go through another process personally … when we have it all here in open court?” she added.Earlier on Friday, Lynch said Cauchi’s phone and internet records showed it was “apparent that he was seeking” cocaine, MDMA and cannabis in late 2023 and early 2024.Further, his resumption of drug use was “quite likely” to have played a part in the events of that day, although cocaine and MDMA were not found in his toxicology report.A key subject in the proceedings has been whether Boros-Lavack should have weaned Cauchi from his antipsychotic medication in 2019.Given Cauchi did not reach the threshold required to administer medications to him without his will, “it wasn’t open to anyone, any doctor … to force him to take medication,” Lynch said.“His autonomy had to be respected,” he said.At one point in the five-week hearing in May the psychiatrist sensationally told the court that she believed Cauchi’s attack had “nothing to do with psychosis” before shewithdrew those commentsthe next day.Cauchi, who was homeless at the time of the attack, was “floridly psychotic” that day, experts agreed. Boros-Lavack’s conjecture traumatised families, the court was told on Tuesday.Cauchi’s mass murders put harsh spotlight on failings of mental health and police systemsRead moreOn Friday, Lynch said it was “grossly unfair” to have been forced to answer questions about Cauchi’s mental state on the day of the attack, given his client had not been provided with the material the experts had, and had not treated Cauchi for four years.Dwyer said that was “incorrect” and that the entire brief of evidence had been provided to Boros-Lavack.Lynch said it was “deeply regrettable” families had been traumatised by Boros-Lavack’s remarks “but in one sense [the questions] should never have been asked”, he said.Dwyer could be seen shaking her head in response to the comment.Lynch also addressed Dwyer’s claim that Boros-Lavack had acted with “belligerence” while testifying.“She was troubled in the witness box, there’s no question about that,” Lynch said, explaining she was in pain, on medication, unaccustomed to giving evidence and “she clearly felt like she was under attack”.O’Sullivan said she was hopeful findings would be delivered before the end of the year.Explore more on these topicsBondi Junction stabbingsSydneyNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The search for a successor would begin on Saturday and the powerful office of the president of Ukraine, which Yermak led, would be “reorganised” as part of the process.“I am grateful to Andriy for always representing Ukraine’s position in the negotiation track exactly as it should be. It has always been a patriotic position. But I want there to be no rumours or speculation,” Zelenskyy said.Journalists had filmed about 10 investigators entering Kyiv’s government quarter early in the morning, in a widening of the investigation into a nuclear energy kickback scandal allegedly run by an associate of the Ukrainian president who has fled the country.Nabu, the national anti-corruption bureau, said it and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office, Sapo, were “conducting investigative actions at the head of the office of the president of Ukraine”.View image in fullscreenYermak with Zelenskyy in Spain earlier this month.Photograph: Violeta Santos Moura/ReutersA seemingly indispensable aide until today, Yermak was a former intellectual property lawyer and film producer who knew Zelenskyy in his days as an actor and comedian before helping him be elected as president. Yermak became a foreign policy adviser, then the president’s chief of staff in February 2020.Rapidly he assumed a central position as Zelenskyy’s gatekeeper in the charge of the president’s office. He was routinely consulted on foreign policy, domestic affairs and appointments. Never far from Zelenskyy’s side, the two were particularly close during the early days of the invasion, when Kyiv was under threat.Earlier, in a short statement, Yermak confirmed that searches were continuing at his home. “The investigators have no obstacles,” he added in a social media statement. “They were given full access to the apartment, my lawyers are on site, interacting with law enforcement officers. From my side, I have full cooperation.”The energy corruption scandal first emerged earlier in November, but after days of damaging revelations it dropped down the news agenda when Donald Trump unexpectedly released apro-Russian 28-point peace plan, in which the Kremlin demanded control of all the Donbas region before any ceasefire.But Friday’s developments thrust the scandal back into the spotlight just as Ukraine had been carefully wooing the White House on a 19-point counterproposal, with Yermak fronting talks in Geneva with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.View image in fullscreenAndriy Yermak fronted talks in Geneva with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio (right), last weekend.Photograph: Martial Trezzini/EPAEarlier in November, investigators from Nabu said they had uncovered a high-level criminal scheme at the heart of government. Insiders allegedlyreceived kickbacks of 10%-15%from commercial partners of Energoatom, the state-owned nuclear power generator and Ukraine’s most important energy supplier.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mindichfled abroad, leaving his apartmentin Kyiv’s government district hours before investigators came to arrest him.Zelenskyy himself has denounced the scheme. However, questions swirled in the days that followed about how much the most senior figures in government knew about what was happening, given how many others in or close to the administration have been accused of involvement.The 28-point ‘peace plan’ for Ukraine may be dead – but Trump still won’t stop Putin | Dmytro KulebaRead moreZelenskyy fired two ministers this month and the allegations have prompted widespread public outrage at a time when most Ukrainians are having to endure hours of daily electricity blackouts because of Russian bombing of energy infrastructure.Another high-profile suspect isOleksiy Chernyshov, a former deputy prime minister who was charged by Nabu for allegedly receiving $1.2bn (£900m) from participants in the anti-corruption scheme. Chernyshov allegedly spent some of the illicit cash building four luxury mansions in a new-build riverside plot south of Kyiv.The anti-corruption investigation has been based on more than 1,000 hours of conversations recorded secretly by Nabu, details of which have been released to the media. In one, a suspect said it was a “pity” to build structures to defend power stations from Russian attacks since the money could be stolen instead.The European Commission said the investigations showed that Ukraine’s anti-corruption bodies were functioning. “We understand that investigations are ongoing, and we very much respect these investigations, which show that anti-corruption authorities in Ukraine are doing their job,” a spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It also fostered a huge affection for the trio, who have built up a loyal following onsocial media, where they post regular reports about their tumultuous experience and joy at their return.They have been helped by local supporters and former pupils, who have provided them with food, clothing, medical care and security and installed a chairlift to enable the three to reach their third-floor cells.The nuns’ religious superior, Provost Markus Grasl from Reichersberg Abbey, had argued that the sisters had to be placed in a Catholic care home as they were unable to safely live in the old stone convent. He repeatedly accused them of breaking their vows of obedience, a claim the nuns denied.View image in fullscreenThe three nuns have been helped by local supporters and former pupils since returning to Goldenstein Castle in Elsbethen.Photograph: Helena Lea Manhartsberger/Panos/The GuardianOn Friday, however, church officials said the women could stay at Goldenstein “until further notice” after a proposal put forward by Grasl aimed at resolving the dispute. The nuns are yet to agree to the deal.Church officials have reportedly said the nuns will be provided with adequate medical care and nursing help, and a priest would be at their disposal to serve regular mass. Over the past months, priests have had to be more or less smuggled into the convent’s chapel to say mass, against the will of church authorities.View image in fullscreenSister Bernadette leads prayers attended by supporters and former pupils in the chapel at Goldenstein.Photograph: Helena Lea Manhartsberger/Panos/The GuardianAmong the conditions for them to remain include the cessation of all social media activity, a ban on outside visitors to the convent and the settling of a legal dispute. Should the health conditions of the women deteriorate, they would be registered at the Elsbethen nursing home and placed on the waiting list there.“Now it’s up to the sisters,” Harald Schiffl, a spokesperson for Grasl, told the Austrian news agency APA.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In September, Franceproposed a ceilingon the value of UK-produced military components in the fund.The UK and EU had been expected to sign a technical agreement on Safe after establishing an administrative fee from London. But after months of wrangling, and only days before the 30 November deadline for an agreement, sources said the two sides remained “far apart” on the financial contribution Britain would make, Bloomberg reported.EU officials have suggested an entry fee of up to €6bn, far higher than the administrative fee the government had envisaged paying. Peter Ricketts, the veteran former diplomat who chairs the European affairs committee in the House of Lords, described a rumoured €6.5bn fee as “so off the scale that it suggests some EU members don’t want the UK in the scheme”.The minister for EU relations, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said it was “disappointing” that talks had fallen through but insisted that the UK defence industry would still be able to participate in projects through Safe on third-country terms.“While it is disappointing that we have not been able to conclude discussions on UK participation in the first round of Safe, the UK defence industry will still be able to participate in projects through Safe on third-country terms.“Negotiations were carried out in good faith, but our position was always clear: we will only sign agreements that are in the national interest and provide value for money.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Without this pact, the UK could never supply more than 35% of the value of components of any Safe-funded project.As recently as last week, the prime minister had expressed a belief that quiet diplomacy would result in agreement, telling reporters travelling with him to the G20 summit in South Africa: “Negotiations are going on in the usual way and they will continue.”He added: “I hope we can find an acceptable solution, but my strong view is that these things are better done quietly through diplomacy than exchanging views through the media.”But soon after, the talks appeared to be on rocky ground after the defence secretary, John Healey, said the UK was willing to quit, telling the i newspaper the UK was not willing to sign up for “any price”.Thomas-Symonds sought to downplay the significance of the collapse of negotiations on Friday, stating: “From leading the Coalition of the Willing for Ukraine to strengthening our relationships with allies, the UK is stepping up on European security in the face of rising threats and remains committed to collaborating with our allies and partners. In the last year alone, we have struck defence agreements across Europe and we will continue this close cooperation.”He added that the UK and EU were continuing to “make strong progress on the historic UK-EU May agreement that supports jobs, bills and borders”.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionKeir StarmerEuropeDefence policynewsShareReuse this content"

Adolf Hitler had loaned the Luftwaffe unit to Gen Francisco Franco’s nationalist forces to help them in their coup against the republican government, and to allow Nazi Germany’s pilots to practise the blitzkrieg tactics they would later use in the second world war.The destruction of Guernica, which would become a template for the aerial bombardment of civilians, was immortalised by Pablo Picasso in the huge monochromecanvas that bears the town’s name.On Friday, Frank-Walter Steinmeier became the first German head of state to travel to Guernica, where he joined King Felipe VI ofSpainin a remembrance ceremony held in a cemetery in the town and laid a wreath for the victims. The pair then visited Guernica’s Museum of Peace, where they met two survivors of the attack, Crucita Etxabe and María del Carmen Aguirre.View image in fullscreenFrank-Walter Steinmeier greets Crucita Etxabe and María Carmen Aguirre, survivors of the Guernica bombing.Photograph: Basque Country Government/ReutersSteinmeier, who is on a state visit toSpain, used a speech earlier this week to address the bombing and its legacy.“Germans committed terrible crimes in Guernica,” the president told guests at a banquet in Madrid on Wednesday.“On 26 April 1937, the feared Condor Legion bombed the city, razing it to the ground. Hundreds of defenceless children, women and men lost their lives in appalling, agonising ways. The terror, pain and grief is felt to this day by many Basque families.”Steinmeier, who visited the Reina Sofía museum in Madrid to see Picasso’s Guernica for himself, said the artist’s warning against remaining indifferent in the face of conflict and suffering “has lost none of its urgency”.He added: “It is very important to me, and I am consciously addressing this sentence to my compatriots in Germany, that we do not forget what happened back then. This crime was committed by Germans. Guernica serves as a warning – a call to stand up for peace, freedom and the preservation of human rights. We want to live up to that, now and in the future.”View image in fullscreenFrank-Walter Steinmeier (left) and the German first lady Elke Büdenbender (centre) look at Pablo Picasso’s painting Guernica at Reina Sofía Museum on Wednesday during a visit to Madrid.Photograph: Rodrigo Jimenez/EPAHis words came three decades after Germany’s then president, Roman Herzog, said he wished “to confront the past and … explicitly admit to the culpable involvement of German pilots”.Guernica’s mayor, José María Gorroño, who had hailed the visit as “a day that will go down in the town’s history”, used the occasion to repeat calls for Picasso’s masterpiece to be moved from the Reina Sofía to the place that inspired it.In aninterview with Cadena Ser radioon Thursday, Gorroño said the Spanish state owed a “moral debt to the victims of the bombing”, adding: “Picasso’s Guernica should come to Guernica. It’s a worldwide peace icon. The victims need this tribute.”Meanwhile, the Basque regional president, Imanol Pradales, has called for the Spanish state to follow Germany’s lead in confronting its role in the bombing of Guernica.“No one has any doubts that the current Spanish state is very different from that one,”he told the Basque parliament last week. “It’s just about affirming truth and justice, and its actions should spring from a commitment to freedom and democracy. We’re asking nothing more, and nothing less, from the Spanish state than what the German president is doing.”Explore more on these topicsSpainGermanyEuropeSecond world warNazismnewsShareReuse this content"

It said the shooting “is under review by the commanders on the ground and will be transferred to the relevant professional bodies”.The militant groupPalestinian Islamic Jihadclaimed the two dead men were fighters in its armed wing, al-Quds Brigades.The footage, which has circulated widely within Israeli and Arab media, shows Israeli soldiers surrounding what appears to be a storage facility in an urban area.The troops use a mechanical digger to breach the garage-style door, after which two men crawl out of the building under the damaged door and give themselves up on their hands and knees, holding up their shirts to show they are unarmed.Uniformed men, identified in Israeli media as officers of Israel’s border police, then approach them. One officer, who is not wearing a helmet and is bald-headed and bearded, appears to take charge. He kicks the men while they are on the ground and then can be seen ordering the detainees back into the building under the damaged door.A few seconds later, as the two victims are crawling away from their captors and have reached the threshold of the building, the five border police officers visible at the scene raise their assault rifles, and the two detainees slump to the ground.Israel still committing genocide in Gaza, Amnesty International saysRead moreView image in fullscreenPeople at the site of the garage in Jenin where the two Palestinian men were shot by Israeli forces on Thursday.Photograph: Nasser Nasser/AP“We’re appalled by the brazen killing by Israeli border police yesterday of two Palestinian men in Jenin in the occupied West Bank in yet another apparent summary execution,” said the UN human rights office spokesperson, Jeremy Laurence.“The execution documented today is the result of an accelerated process of dehumanisation of Palestinians and the complete abandonment of their lives by the Israeli regime,” said Yuli Novak, the executive director of the B’Tselem human rights group. “In Israel, there is no mechanism that acts to stop the killing of Palestinians or is capable of prosecuting those responsible.”Al-Quds Brigades named the two dead men as Youssef Asasa, 37, and Mahmoud Abdallah, 26, and said they were a field commander and fighter respectively in its Jenin brigade.Even in conflict, the execution of unarmed prisoners is a war crimeIsraeli media reports said the border police unit involved in the killings was a special forces group known as Yamas. It is known for its covert and undercover operations, which like its membership are normally cloaked in official secrecy.Israeli soldiers and police are rarely held accountable for the killings of Palestinians despite hundreds of allegations. B’Tselem stopped cooperating with the military review process in 2016, declaring it a “whitewash”.graph showing death toll since 2010 with a tall spike in October 2023What sets the killings in Jenin on Thursday apart is the starkness of the video evidence. The IDF statement on the incident said it happenedduring an IDF and border police operation in the Jenin area, where “the forces operated to apprehend wanted individuals who had carried out terror activities, including hurling explosives and firing at security forces”.“The wanted individuals were affiliated with a terror network in the area of Jenin,” the statement said. “The forces entered the area, enclosed the structure in which the suspects were located, and initiated a surrender procedure that lasted several hours.”“Following the use of engineering tools on the structure, the two suspects exited,” it added. “Following their exit, fire was directed toward the suspects.”The statement added: “The incident is under review by the commanders on the ground and will be transferred to the relevant professional bodies.”However, Ben-Gvir issued his own statement saying he “provides full backing to border police members and IDF fighters who shot at wanted terrorists who came out of a building in Jenin”.The minister, who was convicted in 2007 of incitement to racism and supporting a terrorist organisation, said: “The fighters acted exactly as expected of them – terrorists must die.”Additional reporting by Quique KierszenbaumExplore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineWest BanknewsShareReuse this content"

The Kelani River, which runs into the Indian Ocean near the capital Colombo, overflowed its banks on Friday.VSA Ratnayake, 56, said he had to leave his flooded home in Kaduwela, near Colombo. “I think this could be the worst flood in our area for three decades,” Ratnayake said. “I remember a flood in the 1990s when my house was under 7ft of water.”Kalyani, 48, also from Kaduwela, said she was sheltering two families whose homes were flooded.View image in fullscreenPeople leave their homes in Wellampitiya, near Colombo.Photograph: Tharaka Basnayaka/NurPhoto/ShutterstockAt least 3,000 homes were damaged in mudslides and floods, and more than 18,000 people have been moved to temporary shelters. In Anuradhapura district in the north, a Bell 212 helicopter airlifted a man who had climbed a coconut tree to escape rising waters.The DMC said more rain was forecast, with Cyclone Ditwah likely to move away from the north towards the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu by Sunday.India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, expressed his condolences over the loss of life inSri Lankaand said Delhi was rushing out aid to the affected areas. “We stand ready to provide more aid and assistance as the situation evolves,” Modi said on X.‘We can no longer predict the seasons’: why Indonesia’s coal mindset has to changeRead moreDMC officials said they expected flood levels to be worse than in 2016, when 71 people were killed nationwide. Dozens of stranded tourists were evacuated to Colombo from the tea-growing central areas on Friday.The Sirasa TV network broadcast an appeal for help from a desperate woman. “We are six people, including a one-and-a-half-year-old child. If the water rises another five steps up the staircase, we will have nowhere to go,” she said by telephone.Sri Lanka is in its north-east monsoon season, but rainfall has intensified because of Cyclone Ditwah, the DMC said.Sri Lanka depends on seasonal monsoon rains for irrigation and hydroelectricity, but experts have warned that the country faces more frequent floods owing to the climate crisis.This week’s weather-related toll is the highest since June last year, when 26 people were killed during heavy rains. In December, 17 people died in flooding and landslides.The worst floodingSri Lanka has experienced since the turn of the centuryoccurred in June 2003, when 254 people were killed.Explore more on these topicsSri LankaSouth and central AsiaExtreme weatherFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

Due to the sheer amount of snowfall, 2,900 firefighter callouts were made and 75,000 homes in Rzeszów were left without power.To add to the chaos, an Embraer E170STD aircraft, capable of carrying 80 passengers, veered off the runway on to a grass verge on a flight from Warsaw to Vilnius in Lithuania.

Sri Lanka typically receives between 250mm and 300mm (10-12in) of rain in November. In a 24-hour period, more than 250mm fell in many parts of Sri Lanka, which led to widespread flooding and more rain is expected in the coming days.Up to 425 homes have been damaged by mudslides, 1,800 families are being housed in temporary shelters, 40 people are dead and 10 injured. Eighteen of those who died were from the mountainous tea-growing regions of Badulla and Nuwara Eliya, 300km (186 miles) east of the capital, Colombo.View image in fullscreenRescue workers use a digger after a landslide in the mountainous tea-growing region of Badulla, Sri Lanka.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockThe unique topography of the area increased rainfall by a process known as orographic enhancement. As clouds are forced to rise over mountains, the air begins to cool. When the air cools enough, it reaches its dew point and condenses. As a result, orographic clouds form. The continuous ascent and condensation lead to the formation of cloud droplets. Preexisting rain from higher-level clouds falls through the newer, lower orographic clouds and binds together by a process called accretion. This process makes each rain droplet larger, hence higher rainfall totals in mountainous areas.Explore more on these topicsSnowWeather trackerPolandSri LankaExtreme weatherEuropeSouth and central AsiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The borough of Hammersmith and Fulham was also affected and has said it is “working around the clock” to restore its systems.Westminster said in a statement on Friday that the attack had affected IT systems shared by all three councils. It added that it was working with the NCSC to maintain essential services.RBKC said it was also working with the National Crime Agency, the Metropolitan police and the NCSC to identify the assailants.‘Scamming became the new farming’: inside India’s cybercrime villagesRead moreThe council said it faced at least two weeks of “significant disruption” and was working to bring its systems back online after services were affected.Public bodies and private businesses across the UK have been hit in recent years byransomware attacks, where criminal gangs typically based in the former Soviet Union lock up a target’s IT systems with malware and extract data at the same time. The gang members then demand a payment in cryptocurrency for the systems to be decrypted and the data returned.None of the councils have indicated whether ransomware was involved. Westminster and Hammersmith and Fulham have not confirmed if data was stolen in their attacks. In 2020, a ransomware attack on Hackney council accessed and encrypted 440,000 files, resulting in a reprimand from the UK’s data watchdog.The councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Conservative leader of RBKC, said warning residents their data might have been taken was “the right thing to do”.She added: “All I know is – as a resident myself – I would want to know this information as soon as possible and then be able to make my own choices, follow advice and protect myself if I think necessary.”Explore more on these topicsLocal governmentLondonCybercrimeInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

They will also decide whether the party should support socialist independents in the 2026 English local elections.Each of the party’s MPs is expected to give a speech, alongside a series of grassroots community organisers and leftwing politicians from across Europe.Ahead of the conference, Corbyn said: “Over the last few months I’ve travelled the length and breadth of the country, speaking to people, and learning about their visions for a member-led party.“I am very excited to get this party started and begin the work of building a majority for real political change. This is our chance to create a mass, democratic, socialist party that can be a voice for economic justice and peace.”Your Party said its approach to the conference showed they were prepared to do politics differently.Sultana said: “I’m looking forward to the Your Party founding conference, where we’ll work collectively toward our shared socialist vision. We’re building a new kind of party – rooted in and democratically accountable to a mass movement.”The conference coincided with someYour Partymembers having their membership cancelled over their membership of other parties such as the Socialist Workers.Despite this ban, Sultana is backed by the Socialist Unity Platform, a lobby organisation comprising groups including the Communist party of Great Britain.Explore more on these topicsJeremy CorbynZarah SultanaLabourEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

A prominent member of the Ukip and Brexit party groups, he had pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery between 6 December 2018 and 18 July 2019.Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) documents used in Gill’s case showed him and Voloshyn apparently discussing how much should be set aside for Coburn, who was also an MEP for Reform UK’s precursor, the Brexit party.View image in fullscreenNathan Gill was sentenced to 10 and a half years in prison on charges of accepting bribes.Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockThe messages were sent in April 2019 before a meeting at the European parliament of the editorial board of 112 Ukraine, a pro-Russian Ukrainian channel, whose membership included Gill and Coburn.Later that day, there was discussion between Gill and Voloshyn regarding money, which the latter had given to be distributed between Gill and another MEP identified as “D” and “David”.“I’m seeing D. In the morning. How much was for him?” Gill Messaged Voloshyn, who replied: “6.5 USD.”The MEP called David, apparently Coburn,was also mentioned in other messages between Gill and Voloshyn, who was working for Viktor Medvedchuk, Vladimir Putin’s most important ally in Ukraine in the years before Russia’s full-scale invasions.“There is a big request to you and David,” Voloshyn messaged Gill, going on to outline “a smart idea”, which he said Medvedchuk had.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But millions of pensioners already get state pensions above the tax threshold and nothing has so far been done for them. So there is a real risk that pensioners on the new system will be more favourably treated.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And the new rules will mean that a pensioner just above the tax threshold will pay no tax whilst an employee on exactly the same income will pay both tax and national insurance contributions which seems unfair.”Webb added that there was no costing for the policy in the budget documents, suggesting this may still be at the ideas stage. The main document states: “The government is exploring the best way to achieve this and will set out more detail next year.”Webb said: “It will be incredibly difficult for the Treasury to come up with something that is workable and fair.”Explore more on these topicsTaxIncome taxPensionsRachel ReevesBudget 2025EconomicsBudgetnewsShareReuse this content"

Shifting them to accompany national guard troops could undercut the reason the troops were sent to the city in the first place.“Law enforcement agencies across Washington, DC, including the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), are working in close coordination with the National Guard to ensure the safety of our community,” an MPD spokesperson said, without confirming that any changes were yet in effect, but adding, “MPD does not comment on staffing, tactics, or operations.”Around 2,000 members of the national guard members are deployed toWashington DC, as part of Trump’s “Safe and Beautiful Task Force”. However, they are do not have the same training as city police officers.On Wednesday, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said 500 additional national guard troops would be deployed to the US capital.The changes come as the suspect in Wednesday’s shooting faced upgraded charges to first-degree murder after army specialist Sarah Beckstrom , 20, died from her wounds from the attack. Rahmanullah Lakanwal is also accused of shooting Andrew Wolfe, also a member of the West Virginia national guard, who remains in critical condition.In West Virginia, officials honored the two members of the state’s national guard.The state’s governor Patrick Morrisey asked all West Virginians to observe a moment of silence or prayer on Friday afternoon, and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in recognition of Beckstrom’s death.“These two West Virginia heroes were serving our country and protecting our nation’s capital when they were maliciously attacked,” Morrisey said. “Their courage and commitment to duty represent the very best of our state.”Morrisey said after Trump announced Beckstrom died on Thursday evening that she “served with courage, extraordinary resolve, and an unwavering sense of duty to her state and to her nation”.Explore more on these topicsWashington DCTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump has also claimed many times, without evidence, that the Biden administration officials may have forged their boss’s signature by using the autopen and taken broad actions he was not aware of.Trump has also obsessively cast doubt on the validity of pardons and other documents that Biden signed with an autopen, even though other presidents have also relied on the device to sign key papers for decades. The Justice Department in 2005 said the president does not need to sign a bill by hand and can direct an official “to affix the president’s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen.” Trump himself has alsoused an autopen in the past.The sweeping announcement left many questions about how Trump would actually nullify Biden’s pardons and executive orders, given that US presidents are allowed to use the autopen – and that there has been no concrete evidence of any attempt to bypass Biden’s will at the end of his second term.Nonetheless, Trump’s post was swiftly celebrated by Republicans.Oversight Project, a branch of the conservative Heritage Foundation started in 2022 with a mission of “increasing aggressive oversight of the Biden administration”, and which has relentlessly promoted the narrative about Biden’s use of autopen, thanked Trumpin a post on X.“Thank you President Trump for taking our historic Autopen investigation and findings seriously and ordering your Administration to take action,” the group said.Congressman James Comer, the Republican chair of the GOP-led House oversight committee, alsowelcomed Trump’s announcement, writing on X: “I applaud President Trump for deeming President Biden’s autopen actions NULL AND VOID.”The oversight committee released a report in October on Biden’s use of the autopen that made many sweeping claims but did not include any concrete evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without Biden’s knowledge or that he was unaware of laws, pardons or executive orders signed in his name.The report alleged a “cover-up of the president’s cognitive decline” orchestrated by Biden’s inner circle and pushed contested claims that the president’s mental state had declined to such an extent that White House officials were able to enact policies without his knowledge, and focused heavily on the pardons he granted in office, many of which infuriatedDonald Trump.Democrats on the committee denounced the report as a “sham”, highlighting that the report included no evidence to support the allegations. Legal experts have also warned that attempts to void past executive actions could set a problematic precedent, given that so many other presidents have utilized the autopen.Conservative legal commentator Ed Whelan said on social media that Trump was free to revoke executive orders whether or not Biden personally signed them.“But he doesn’t have the same freedom with respect to ’anything else’ (e.g., bills enacted by Congress, pardons) that Biden directed be signed by autopen.”Agencies contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJoe BidenTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

She offered them her ID card from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon but was told by an ICE agent that “anyone can make that.”Miles, who also appeared in The Last of Us, Smoke Signals, The Business of Fancydancing and Skins, told the ICE agents to call the tribal enrollment office number on the card.College student deported when flying home for Thanksgiving, despite court orderRead moreAccording to a report of the encounterby the Seattle Times, the officers refused. Miles called the office herself, whereupon one officer tried to take her phone but failed. Then the men released her and departed in their vehicles.Miles alleges that a similar thing has happened to her son and uncle – they have previously been detained and later released by ICE officers who would not initially accept their tribal identification.According to a post onFacebookby the Lakota People’s Law Project, Miles told the group: “Tribal IDs—the government issued those damn cards to us like a pedigree dog! It’s not fake!”Miles’ account chimes with others of Native Americans being swept up in theTrump administration’s immigration crackdown.Native News Online reportsthat an Indigenous woman born in Phoenix was mistakenly detained by immigration authorities after being released from jail in Des Moines, Iowa.“What we’re talking about here is racial profiling,” Seattle-based Indigenous rights attorney Gabriel Galanda told theSeattlenewspaper. “People are getting pulled over or detained on the street because of the dark color of their skin.”ICE detained teenaged US citizen during school lunch break, family saysRead moreGalanda said that the agents’ refusal to accept Miles’ ID points to “a fair amount of ignorance about tribal citizenship generally in society and in government”.According to the outlet, the actor’s encounter with ICE agents came on the same day that ICE agents made several arrests at Redmond’s Bear Creek Village shopping center, prompting city council to switch off its license-plate-reading cameras.Earlier this year, the Navajo nationannounced it was taking stepsto protect its community from federal immigration actions, amid reports that some Indigenous Americans have been swept up in US deportation raids.After Miles was detained, she said she was now afraid to leave the house alone or at night. Galanda said that the prospect of Native Americans being detained is reminiscent of the country’s troubled history withIndigenous peoples.“It’s also deeply troubling that in 2025, the first people of this country have to essentially look over their shoulders,” she added.Explore more on these topicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)US immigrationNative AmericansSeattleIndigenous peoplesWashington stateWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Dans aimed to assemble some 20,000 potential recruits.One way in which the database was grown was Heritage’s invitation for applications to the Presidential Administration Academy. The academy, and the open application process, were widely publicized in conservative media in early 2024.Videos from that academy’s training curriculum leaked in August 2024, significantly raising public awareness of Project 2025.The materials analyzed by the Guardian are applications for the Presidential Administration Academy. It contains 13,726 applications, a small minority of which are clearly intended tolampoon Heritage and the Trump movement.Applicants were asked to characterize their political beliefs according to a drop-down menu, spell out their political philosophy, identify the primary influence on their politics, to name a book and a public figure who had influenced them, and then to say whether they agreed with political proposals such as whether the US should increase legal immigration.Project 2025 was subject to aseries of cybersecurity incidentsfrom mid-2024.In June 2025, the transparency non-profit Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDOSecrets) released the contents of a database containing more than 13,000 submissions to an online application form by individuals interested in working on the Project 2025 initiative. The identity of the hackers is unknown.The Guardian sourced the data from DDOSecrets and analysed it.All individuals named in this reporting were contacted for comment via contact information in their applications, and professional email addresses where these were available.Sources at Heritage said they would not know the political views of applicants applying through a public link nor be able to screen them.A Heritage spokesman said: ‘The Guardian is a leftist gossip rag. Its dishonesty is matched only by its uselessness. We don’t waste time answering its half-baked questions.’”Carl SchmittDozens of applicants expressed admiration for Carl Schmitt, a German political theorist who has been called the “crown jurist of the Third Reich” and whose intellectual legacy is inseparable from his collaboration with the Nazi regime.Ville Suuronen, a research fellow at the University of Turku in Finland who has written extensively on Schmitt’s legal and political theories, said: “After Schmitt joined the Nazi party in late April of 1933, he revolutionized his legal theory according to the ideological principles of National Socialism and did everything he could to legitimize the Nazi party and the policies of Adolf Hitler.”Suuronen added: “Schmitt legitimized the murders of ‘Night of the Long Knives’ by describing Hitler as the highest judge in Germany”, and also “characterized the Nuremberg Laws as the ‘constitution of freedom’ and organized a deeply antisemitic conference ‘The Jewry in Legal Science’ in Berlin in October 1936”.Applicants who cite Schmitt include Paul Ingrassia, who was last weektapped for a new jobas deputy general counsel of the General Services Administration, leaving his former role as White House liaison to the Department of Homeland Security.Last month, Ingrassia’s nomination for special counsel to the United Statesfounderedafter group chats leaked in which he told other participants that he had “a Nazi streak” and that holidays commemorating Black people should be “eviscerated”.The Interceptreported in Julythat Ingrassia’s application was a part of the Project 2025 trove, but did not mention his expression of admiration for Schmitt’s books.In the application, Ingrassia listed Carl Schmitt’s Concept of the Political, Political Theology, and Constitutional Theory among the books that had influenced him.Ingrassia’s sister, Olivia Ingrassia, also now works in the Trump administration, also had a Project 2025 application exposed in the hack, and also cited Schmitt as an influence.According to her LinkedIn account, Ingrassia has worked in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) since August, after completing a four-month internship there earlier this year.Under director Russell Vought, who once said of federal workers “We want to put them in trauma,” the OMB hasaggressively moved to dismantle federal agenciesand consolidate executive power. There’s no suggestion that Vought himself has praised Carl Schmitt.Other Schmitt-positive applicants include a Heritage employee who has since landed in the administration. Max Matheu is now an attorney adviser at the State Department, according to his LinkedIn page.Last year, he was still lead attorney in the Heritage Foundation’s own Oversight Project. Previously, he served as a congressional intern for Florida congresswoman Laurel Lee, and controversial former legislator Matt Gaetz, according to congressional information service LegiStorm.For Heritage, he acted as an attorney in several Freedom of Information Act (Foia) suits brought against the US government following up on theblizzard of tens of thousandsof Foia requests Heritage made during the life of the Biden administration.In his Project 2025 application, in response to a question about which books have influenced him, Matheu nominated The Concept of the Political by Carl Schmitt, adding that “The friend/enemy distinction is the cardinal concept that undergirds all politics. The Left has been making the distinction since Gramsci and other cultural marxists captured the media and academic institutions to subvert Heritage Americans and the shared ideals this country once held.”Matheu’s use of “Heritage Americans” invokes aslogan popular on the new nativist right that supports Donald Trump and the Maga movement. Criticshave saidit can be used to convey white nationalist sentiments in softer language, though Matheu does not identify as a white nationalist in his application.Elsewhere in his application, Matheu wrote: “Our specific social, cultural, and religious heritage define American politics. Our shared cultural identity is necessary to achieve the common good and share a unified political vision for conservative politics.”The Guardian reached out to Matheu directly for comment. A State Department spokesperson replied that in the future the Guardian should “​​feel free to submit a formal inquiry rather than contact the individual via their personal email”.They added: “The essay highlights how the left adopted and applied Schmitt’s philosophy against Americans, hijacking and corrupting traditional nonpartisan institutions like the media to expand its power,” a reply that appeared to bear little relationship to Matheu’s application.On the friend-enemy distinction, Suuronen, the academic critic of Schmitt, said “For Schmitt, the ideals underlying liberalism – not only rational discussion, but also the idea of inviolable and universal human rights – were nothing but an illusion,” and he “developed a theory of ‘the political’, according to which the fundamental political distinction was that between the friend and the enemy. For Schmitt, politics was not about individuals, but about the potentially violent confrontations of homogeneous groups.”Other applicants teamed apparently racist sentiments with invocations of Schmitt.Joe Amato,a former Publius fellow at the right-wing Claremont Institutelisted as a member of Project 2025’s advisory board in theMandate for Leadership document it published in 2023and currently chief of staff at anAI-driven law and regulation startup, according to his LinkedIn bio, wrote in his application that “Carl Schmitt’s The Concept of the Political has most shaped my political philosophy for the moment we live in.” It’s central thesis is that the core of politics is the friend-enemy distinction.He added: “Given that the Left is waging an all out war against the Right, we must remember this distinction in all our actions. No Leftist or Democrat is our friend, nor any Republicans who oppose the America First agenda. If those on the Right want to actually win, we must support those friendly to us, and ruthlessly destroy our enemies.”In the application, he echoed beliefs associated with theGreat Replacement conspiracy theory, writing, “It’s clear that the Democratic Party is importing a blue wave of voters to illegally register. This unprecedented wave of migration is nothing short of a barbarian invasion … Cities will be overrun and become like third world slums. Our women and young women will be raped and sexually assaulted. Our young men will be attacked.”According to his Claremont Institute biography, Amato “received an inaugural Passage Prize for poetry”.In May 2024, the Guardianidentified Jonathan Keepermanas the founder of Passage Press, the far-right publisher that sponsored the Passage Prize.The Guardian has also reported extensively on Claremont’s ties with asecretive far-right men-only network of fraternal lodges, theemergence of its board chair and biggest funderas a conservative megadonor, and itslinks to JD Vance staffers.Claremont’s links to the Trump movement have seen it labeled as thenerve center of the American right.Gais, the SPLC analyst, wrote “Even just within the United States, Schmitt’s theories have nurtured any number of anti-democratic impulses, ranging from the ‘war on terror’ to the Maga right’s extreme rhetoric against the left.”BukeleDozens of other applicants expressed their admiration for El Salvador’s authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele.Bukele’s brutal prison system came into focus earlier this year when the Trump administrationsummarily deportedhundreds of Venezuelans and Salvadorans to that country. According to ahumanitarian organizations, some 250 of those deported endured systematic torture.One applicant, Jackson Kitchin, now serves as a federal law clerk in the eastern district of North Carolina according to his LinkedIn profile, and previously clerked for the supreme court of North Carolina and the US Senate judiciary committee, according to his LinkedIn and thewebsite of his alma mater, George Washington University Law School.In his Project 2025 application, Kitchin wrote that “Bukele has shown the world that morality is objective, that societies which understand this prosper, and that decline is a choice. He has been outspoken in his belief that God’s will ought to be done, and that political leaders ought to actively seek out God’s will.”He added: “Bukele has defied a global majority which claimed these things could not be done. The same voices make similar claims about the United States. It is my fervent belief that we can prove them wrong as well.”He looked forward to a time when the US president likewise had more centralized power, writing “Over the last fifty years, our nation has seen an attack on the Article II powers of the Presidency. Over the course of this attack, the President has been stripped of his authority to see that the laws are faithfully executed. “On the law, Kitchin wrote: “Any institution which reflects God’s moral order will govern a more virtuous people, achieving societal prosperity.”Another Bukele admirer, Justin Henle, now works as a staffer for the House administration committee under Wisconsin according to Legistorm. Previously, he worked as a intern for Virginia Republican, Bob Good.In his application, he described Bukele as “a public figure I admire” whose “tough on crime measures brought El-Salvador into a period of prosperity and safety”.Fringe figuresSeveral applicants nominated Jared Taylor as an influence on their thought. Taylor is a prominent white nationalist, and the founder of the American Renaissance website, journal, and annual conference. For decades, Taylor has denied that he is a white supremacist.Others found inspiration from other, lesser-known far-right figures.One is a senior figure in for the New Hampshire Department of Corrections, according to a LinkedIn page and thedepartment’s staff directory.In their application, they express admiration for Neema Parvini, a current British writer who,according to UK anti-fascist non-profit Hope Not Hate, lost an academic position over his far-right activism, has attended far-right conferences, and claimed on social media that black and white people are “different species”.They wrote that Parvini’s book the Populist Delusion is “A thorough and concise overview of political philosophers from history which more directly addressed the myriad problems faced by our nation and some of the mechanisms by which Trump was prevented from governing successfully”.Elsewhere in the application, they said “I gravitate towards antebellum writers more than modern ones”, and said that the Fourteenth Amendment, passed in the wake of the civil war and granting citizenship to formerly enslaved people, should be repealed, since “Nearly all of our modern problems are descended from this verbose and destructive inversion of sovereignty signed under duress.”The Old Glory ClubThere were at least seven applicants who the Guardian identified as members of the far-right, men-only secret society, the Old Glory Club, although none of them appear to have been offered jobs in the administration so far.Although none appear to have gone on to find employment in the Trump regime, they made little attempt to hide their nativist views.Last July,the Guardian reportedthat the Old Glory Club had established at least 26 clubs nationwide, had ties with similar far-right groups in the UK and antisemitic activists, had held in-person meetups, and represented a “new breed of extremist organisation which aims first to build an offline social network before taking over society”.Ryan Turnipseed is a founding member of the Old Glory Club who appears to have made an application to Heritage that includes his personal email address and phone number.In describing his beliefs, Turnipseed wrote that he supported “Freedom of association and the right to discriminate. They are both one and the same, just worded differently.” He added: “I believe that one’s freedom to associate is vital for a healthy, productive, sane, and morally upright civilization, and that the enshrining of anti-discrimination laws into the American legal system has been disastrous.”In February 2023, Turnipseed wasidentified by antifascist researchersas a member of what they called a rising “white supremacist faction within the Lutheran faith”. Later that month, the president of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synodcalled forthe excommunication of those “propagating radical and unchristian ‘alt-right’ views”.The Guardian cross-referenced application materials with company records for the Old Glory Club umbrella organization and local chapters to identify six other members who had applied to Project 2025.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Donald Trump hasbatted awayquestion after question from reporters on concerns over higher prices, just a year after he won an election promising to bring down costs.While the White House has tried toreduce concern, floating tariff-funded $2,000 stimulus checks and removing import levies on certain agricultural imports, many consumers remain anxious.Preparing for the holiday season, and bracing for the spending it often demands, Guardian readers across the US expressed apprehension – and explained how they plan to spend – in this economy. Many said the higher cost of necessities, like groceries, was imposing on their ability to buy gifts for family and friends.“I love giving people gifts,” said Grace Brown, 34, of Charlotte, North Carolina. “I’m a person that pays attention all year and will keep notes in my phone if someone mentions something in July they may want.”But this year is different. As prices have climbed over the last year, Brown said that her budget for gifts has shrunk. Things already feel squeezed: she and her fiance are already limiting eating out, and have agreed they won’t exchange gifts with each other this holiday.“Prices for everything have gone up,” Brown said. “It’s kind of hard to have luxuries.”Collection of key pricing data was halted during the shutdown, so it’s unclear how much higher prices have been rising. In September, the latest available reading, prices went up 3%, compared with 2.3% in April.Regardless of the official data, consumers feel like prices have been climbing. On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidencehad fallento its lowest level since April, when Trump first announced his full slate of tariffs. The University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers, another measure of consumer sentiment, similarlyshoweddrops in confidence after the summer.“Being on a fixed income, we have had to cut way back on our spending for the holiday,” said Jeffrey Larimore, 68, of Caldwell, Idaho. “We had enough disposable income to go out to dinner, take weekend trips and spoil [my granddaughters]. Since the tariffs have raised the cost of living, we have cut out all of that.”Ryan, a retired law enforcement officer in Texas, who wished to withhold his last name, said his family “can barely put food on the table” let alone do holiday shopping for his young children.“I’m scrambling to find some way to preserve some aspect of magic for them,” he said. “I spent my life in service to my country. What he [Trump] has done in less than a single year breaks my heart.”Recent surveys indicated that Americans are set to cut back on holiday shopping this year. Deloitteestimatedthat spending could be down 4% compared with last year, while the National Retail Federation said that after hitting a record high last year, the amount of money Americans are planning to spend this year isdown1.3%.In addition to prices going up, more Americans are concerned about the labor market. While expectations of unemploymentdroppedafter Trump’s election, it has been climbing up over the last year. This sentiment tracks with the slow rise in unemployment, which was 4.4% in September – the highest it’s been since October 2021. For many, this means that higher prices aren’t the only concern.“My homeowner’s insurance is up, 2026 health insurance is up, property taxes are up for 2026,” said Sarah Tenbensel of Minneapolis. “I may need a second job very soon.”Shari Dunn, 57, of Oregon, said that in addition to prices going up, “there is fear regarding employment and contacts”. “It’s more than just tariffs – it’s everything. The instability and fear,” she said.Dunn said she is participating in the economicboycotttaking place over the Black Friday shopping holiday, one of a handful ofconsumer boycottsthat have been organized since Trump started his second term.For some, this past year has meantopting outof the economy in frustration with national politics. Linda McKim Bell, 79, of Portland, Oregon, said that she has tried not to buy anything new since Trump took office.“I have shopped all year at online thrift stores for my family gifts,” she said. “I am making the rest of our holiday gifts: orange marmalade and homemade pastries make great gifts. Will continue to buy items that are used as much as possible.”Brown said that even though she and her fiance have agreed not to exchange gifts, she may make a trip to Asheville, North Carolina, and support local artists there as the community continues to recover from Hurricane Helene.“Whenever we have money to spend, we try to spend it there with small businesses,” Brown said. “One thing I just remember from high school is my teacher would always tell us ‘you vote with your dollars’.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyChristmasTrump tariffsUnemploymentEconomicsTariffsDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Staley has already beenbanned from the UK banking sectorforplaying down his relationship with Epstein.While the regulators would not publicly confirm whether they were opening formal inquiries, their directors assured Warren they would take action over any potential misconduct.“While it would be inappropriate to comment on any specific ongoing supervisory matter, I take very seriously any allegations of wrongdoing or abuse by banks and bank executives,” the comptroller of the currency, Jonathan Gould, said in a letter to Warren, who is the lead Democrat on the US Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs.“We appreciate the seriousness of this matter and will continue to examine banks, includingJP MorganChase Bank, NA, within the scope of our authority, including to ensure banks address safety and soundness concerns and violations of law under our jurisdiction,” Gould added.Warren’s original letter raised questions over JP Morgan’s wider banking relationship with the sex offender, noting that Epstein was one of the bank’s most profitable clients before being dropped in 2013, five years after he was jailed for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The well-connected financier died in prison in July 2019, while awaiting trial over child sex trafficking charges.The FDIC’s acting chair, Travis Hill, said the regulator took“unlawful activity involving the banking sector, including possible insider involvement in illicit activity,very seriously”.His letter, dated 17 November, said “if this type of activity is identified” the watchdog would follow standard protocol: collecting and reviewing potential evidence, before escalating the matter to the FDIC’s inspector general’s office, which has law enforcement powers.Wrongdoing could result in a fine and a potential ban from working in the US banking sector.The FDIC and OCC declined to comment. The Guardian contacted Staley’s legal representative for comment.Warren said in a statement: “Regulators need to investigate and hold accountable Epstein’s enablers – and I’ll believe they’re taking action when I see it. Americans deserve to know that their banking system isn’t facilitating the disturbing crimes of the rich and powerful.”A spokesperson for JP Morgan did not directly comment on Warren’s correspondence with regulators but in relation to Epstein said: “We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts. We ended our relationship with him six years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges. The federal government had damning information about his crimes that they failed to share with us or other banks.”Last week Warren used an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to urge the JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, to testify in front of the US Senate banking committee.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They did more than a billion dollars in transactions for Jeffrey Epstein … He literally could walk into the bank and get $50m from JP Morgan Chase.“So, what I’d like to do, over on the banking committee, is I’d like to have Mr Dimon and some of those other bankers come in and, under oath, testify about exactly what the financial trail is that kept Jeffrey Epstein afloat for so long.”JP Morgan said in a statement: “Jamie never met with Epstein, spoke with him, emailed with him, and was not involved in any decisions about his account, to which he testified under oath. There are over a million pages of emails and other documents produced in this case, and not one comes even close to suggesting otherwise.”The bank’s spokesperson added: “We will follow the law, including responding to a subpoena. Our involvement with Epstein is largely a matter of public record, with millions of pages of discovery from litigation already publicly available.”The correspondence between Warren and US financial regulators comes days after Donald Trump waspressed into signing a billthat will lead to the US justice department releasing all of its unclassified records, documents, and communications related to Epstein and the co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.It follows initial backtracking by the US president, who had come under fire for his own ties to the sex offender, having been friends with Epstein before the pair fell out in 2004, before Epstein’s conviction. The documents are expected to be released within 30 days, on or about 19 December.Quick GuideContact Guardian Business about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact the Business team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Staffers are calling on the company to power all its data centers with clean energy, make sure its AI-powered products and services do not enable “violence, surveillance and mass deportation”, and form a working group comprised of non-managers“that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact”.The letter was organized by employees affiliated with theadvocacy groupAmazon Employees for Climate Justice. One worker who was involved in drafting the letter explained that workers were compelled to speak out because of negative experiences with using AI tools in the workplace, as well as broader environmental concerns about the AI boom. The staffers, the employee said, wanted to advocate for a better way to develop, deploy and use the technology.“I signed the letter because of leadership’s increasing emphasis on arbitrary productivity metrics and quotas, using AI as justification to push myself and my colleagues to work longer hours and push out more projects on tighter deadlines,” said a senior software engineer, who has been with the company for over a decade, and requested anonymity due to fear of reprisal.Climate goalsThe letter accuses Amazon of “casting aside its climate goals to build AI”.Like other companies in the generative AI race,Amazon has invested heavily in building new data centers to power new tools – which are more resource intensive and demand high amounts of electricity to operate. The company plans to spend$150bn on data centers in the next 15 years, and just recently said it willinvest $15bnto build data centers in northern Indiana andat least $3bn for data centers in Mississippi.The letter claims that Amazon’s annual emissions have “grown roughly 35%since 2019”, despite thecompany’s promisein 2019 to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. It warns many of Amazon’s investments in AI infrastructure will be in “locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plans online or build new gas plants”.“‘AI’ is being used as a magic word that is code for less worker power, hoarding of more resources, and making an uninformed gamble on high energy demand computer chips magically saving us from climate change,” said an Amazon customer researcher, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation for speaking out. “If we can build a climate saving AI – that’s awesome! But that’s not what Amazon is spending billions of dollars to develop. They are investing fossil fuel energy draining data centers for AI that is intended to surveil, exploit, and squeeze every extra cent out of customers, communities, and government agencies.”In a statement to the Guardian, Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser pushed back on employees’ claims and pointed toward the company’s climate goals. “Not only are we the leading data center operator in efficiency, we’re the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for five consecutive years with over 600 projects globally,” said Glasser. “We’ve also invested significantly in nuclear energy through existing plants and new SMR technology–these aren’t distractions, they’re concrete actions demonstrating real progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to reach net-zero carbon across our global operations by 2040.”AI for productivityThe letter also includes strict demands around the role of AI in the Amazon workplace, demands that, staffers say, arose out of challenges employees are experiencing.Three Amazon employees who spoke to the Guardian claimed that the company is pressuring them to use AI tools for productivity, in an effort to increase output. “I’m getting messaging from my direct manager and [from] of all the way up the chain, about how I should be using AI for coding, for writing, for basically all of my day-to-day tasks, and that those will make me more efficient, and also that if I don’t get on board and use them, that I’m going to fall behind, that it’s sort of sink or swim,” said a software engineer who has been with Amazon for over two years, requesting anonymity due to fear of reprisal.The worker added that just weeks ago she was told by her manager that they were “expected to do twice as much work because of AI tools”, and expressed concern that the output expected demanded with fewer people is unsustainable, and “the tools are just not making up that gap.”The customer researcher echoed similar concerns. “I have both personally felt the pressure to use AI in my role, and hear from so many of my colleagues they are under the same pressure …”.“All the while, there’s no discussion about the immediate effects on us as workers – from unprecedented layoffs to unrealistic expectations for output.”The senior software engineer said that the adoption of AI has had imperfect outcomes. He said that most commonly, workers are pressured to adopt agentic code generation tools: “Recently I worked on a project that was just cleaning up after a high-level engineer tried to use AI to generate code to complete a complex project,” said this worker. “But none of it worked and he didn’t understand why – starting from scratch would have actually been easier.”Amazon did not respond to questions about the staffers’ workplace critiques about AI use.Workers emphasized they are not against AI outright, rather they want it to be developed sustainably and with input from the people building and using it. “I see Amazon using AI to justify a power grab over community resources like water and energy, but also over its own workers, who are increasingly subject to surveillance, work speedups, and implicit threats of layoffs,” said the senior software engineer. “There is a culture of fear around openly discussing the drawbacks of AI at work, and one thing the letter is setting out to accomplish is to show our colleagues that many of us feel this way and that another path is possible.”Explore more on these topicsAmazonArtificial intelligence (AI)E-commerceMetaGoogleMicrosoftAppleShareReuse this content"

Speaking to Yahoo Sports recently about the launch of Project B, a startup global women’s basketball league, co-founder Grady Burnettdeclaredthat “women’s basketball is growing right now as fast as AI”. Come again? There’s no question that women’s basketball is growing nicely, a development that we should all cheer: this year’s WNBA seasonwas the most watched ever. But it is testing credulity to suggest that the sport is growing at anything like the same speed as AI, which since 2022 has gone from the technological margins to the very center of the US economy: by some reports, AI spendingaccounted forhalf of the growth in US GDP in the first half of this year. Perhaps I’m missing the real story here and the Federal Reserve is actively keeping tabs on attendance figures at Washington Mystics v Golden State Valkyries games for signs of potential overheating in the US economy. But it seems unlikely.Claims like Burnett’s are par for the course in the hyperventilating world of sports investment, in which new leagues intent on world domination are launched seemingly every week and the pitches, delivered at investment conferences by slick men with gleaming teeth and spotless sneakers, grow more and more clammily self-satisfied by the hour. Burnett’s league, which he co-founded with former Skype co-founder Geoff Prentice, was briefly associated with Maverick Carter and LeBron James over the summer but that pair now seemsto have been removedfrom the picture, and the league is emerging from “stealth mode”, to use a wormy bit of tech jargon, as the pure, uncut essence of bored Silicon Valley rich guy calculation. In a crowded field, Project B may be the most insanely overcaffeinated, tech bro-addled pitch for a new sports league yet.A recent publicity tour to promote the league has offered a masterful demonstration of Silicon Valley’s matchless gift for repackaging the concept of professional athletes performing in an arena – what you or I might call “professional sport” – as some uniquely daring feat of disruption. Project B, Burnett has said, will be a “Formula 1-style circuit played on a global stage, physically in a location where the fans exist, and digitally available to everybody”; the league, in thegloss of one journalist covering its launch“aims to employ tech strategy to a sports framework, with the goal of developing a globally-played, globally-distributed array of sports that allocates time-tested assets – i.e. games and players – in a modern, technology- and media-enhanced context.” In other words, Project B will be played in front of fans and available to watch on TV, like every other decently popular professional sport on the planet. Get a load of that blue-sky thinking, baby.The stadium myth: new grounds won’t rescue your club – or your cityRead moreThe league will be based in Singapore but stage games in six cities scattered around the globe; in years to come, the cry will be heard across the continents from harassed dads trying to corral their children in time for Project B tip-off: “Come on kids, let’s get along to the time-tested asset and watch some of our favorite time-tested assets in action!” Burnett, who made his money as a top executive at Facebook and Google, has unrolled every tech cliché imaginable in his blitz of promotion for the league: he’s talked about the “supply-demand mismatch” in women’s basketball; he’s name dropped TikTok, Web3 (a bit passé but I suppose dads need to get their fun somewhere), and Drive to Survive, the series that popularized Formula 1 in the US (as mandatory a benchmark for the modern sports investor as“Singapore” is for the aspiring autocrat); he’s boasted that “I come from a tech lens” (might be time to get a new set of spectacles) and has a “focus on eyeballs” (stop staring Grady, you’re making everyone uncomfortable); he’s rhapsodized about working with investors who can “lean in” and drive a “platform shift” (which platform he’s referring to and in which direction it is shifting remain unclear).He’s even suggested, in the context of his league’s projected content “play”, that “we have an opportunity to discover culture and interaction through the eyes of basketball and the eyes of sports, similar to what Anthony Bourdain did with food”. Coming to your screen soon: a five-part Netflix series about Kelsey Plum eating a shawarma. If you’ve been impressed by Brittney Griner’s performances on the court, just think of what she’ll produce once she’shandeda baguette and unleashed on the cafe terraces of Paris.There’s talking up the brand and then there’s this: a stream of smooth-brained tech bro gibberish whose only tangible effect is to suggest that the “leagues” to come will be airless little exercises in profit maximization, bearing only a superficial resemblance to what we commonly know as sport. For years, sports were the realm of the proudly inarticulate, players content to do their talking on the field and taciturn coaches who grunted through press conferences with minimal concession to syntax.Now the talk in sports is as much about ecosystems, value-adds, core unlocks and “strategic strengths across brand, engagement and audience retention” (I just made this up but it sounds believable) as it is about trades, transfers, formations, and selections. The linguistic molestation of sport – not only in the US but in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, whose sporting landscapes are rapidly being reshaped by American-led investment and the cultural preferences that come with it – has proceeded directly from its financialization.“You’re going to see an expansion of the definition of sports to be more focused around fandom and engaged consumers that broadens it versus just sports teams or sports adjacency businesses,” Greg Bettinelli, a partner at The Chernin Group, which has invested in Barstool and youth venture Unrivaled Sports,saidat a recent sports investment conference. OK Greg, that sounds awful. Project B takes its place in a women’s basketball landscape already crowded with new entrants like the three-on-three team competition Unrivaled and Athletes Unlimited, which crowns an individual winner after a month-long competition in which players accumulate points based on their own performances and the outcome of each game in which they compete. The explosion in competitions like these is not the product of some native rise in popular hunger for weird sporting innovations; it’s driven entirely by the financialization of professional sports, and by the swarm of investors who are entering sport ravenous for places and people to inject their money into.View image in fullscreenSports such as padel are seen as fertile ground for investors.Photograph: Enric Fontcuberta/EPANaturally, the big leagues in the US and Europe still attract the largest sums but there’s also considerable growth away from the “bigs”, in volleyball, professional bull riding, mountain biking, pickleball, and elsewhere. Like second rate Warren Buffetts, the tech bros and private equity goons are sniffing for value on the fringes, in lesser known leagues and sports whose diminished present status conceals, they hope, a vast reserve of potential gains.“I see the league growing by leaps and bounds in valuations,” David Eisen, an investor in the North American Pro Padel League, one of many recent attempts in the world of racquet sports to take down tennis (what’s wrong with tennis?) and reinvent squash for the Uber Black brigade,toldThe Athletic. What about growing by leaps and bounds in participation, access, popularity, cultural influence? Well, that might happen too but it’s secondary to the real business of sports investment, which is – very transparently, I should add; none of this is denied or hidden – to make money for its owners and investors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s also possible; to hear these investors speak, it often feels as if the audience they’re interested in cultivating has nothing to do with traditional fans, that what they really seek is a future in which enjoying and attending sport are the privilege of those at a higher altitude (their own altitude). This explains their smug style of speech, their preference for communicating only in chartspeak and tech squeaks. According toMarcos Del Pilar, one of the competition’s co-founders, the Pro Padel League “is a networking superconductor for athletic, like-minded, like-moneyed masters of the universe.” To which the only honest response can be: yuck, dude.The financialization of sport is not just a bad deal for anyone priced out of live game attendance or astronomical streaming subscriptions, or anyone icky at the thought of being “targeted” by various Big Tech-derived engagement cons. It’s an offense to anyone who wants to read words in English without feeling like their brain is a ball in the latest padel match between a pair of green-juiced bigjaws who made squillions stiffing gig workers and boosting rage bait in the 2010s.The bros are thinking big – about the size of their own future bank accounts, but also about the beautiful horizons that will open up once sport’s capture in the sticky web spun by capital and tech becomes secure. NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum last weekofferedan update on plans for the world’s biggest basketball league to expand to Europe, sketching out a vision in which “long-term down the road” you have “world-class infrastructure” in European cities and “supersonic travel becomes a reality”, enabling Europe to become a conference of the domestic NBA. In the future everything will be beamed and smoothed exactly to the owner-investors’ specifications. A brain-computer sporting interface, feeding live sport directly into our frontal lobes without the messy need for in-person attendance or spectatorship before a screen, may only be a decade or so away.But in the meantime, the work of our collective lobotomization proceeds one investment soundbite at a time. “I think you can make a fortune of money investing in sports,” former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry, who launched a dedicated sports investment fund last year,saidrecently, expressing a thesis shared by virtually every investor intent on disrupting the staid old worlds of basketball, football, trekking, and canoe. “You just don’t have much competition right now. You’ve got probably a trillion dollars’ worth of opportunities, and probably ten billion dollars of capital that’s going against it.”Against that you also have more than a thousand years of the English language, which may be the first casualty of money’s relentless colonization of modern sport.Explore more on these topicsSportUS sportsBasketballTennisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The McLaren driver beat the Mercedes of George Russell into second and, with Lando Norris in third, it was the result the Australian required for his world championship ambitions and allows a chance to narrow the gap to the leader Norris. The other title contender, Max Verstappen, was furious with his Red Bull’s erratic performance and will start in sixth.Quick GuideF1 title race: how they stand and what's still up for grabsShowDrivers' championship standings1Lando Norris (McLaren) 390pts2Oscar Piastri (McLaren) 3663Max Verstappen (Red Bull) 366Despite being level on points, Piastri (7 wins) holds second place due to more GP victories than Verstappen (6 wins) this seasonPoints still availableGP1st 25pts, 2nd 18, 3rd 15, 4th 12, 5th 10, 6th 8, 7th 6, 8th 4, 9th 2, 10th 1Sprint race1st 8pt, 2nd 7, 3rd 6, 4th 5, 5th 4, 6th 3, 7th 2, 8th 1Remaining race weekends29-30 Nov Qatar (sprint race and GP)6-7 Dec\tAbu Dhabi (GP only)What Norris needs• He needs to emerge from the weekend having scored two points more than Piastri and Verstappen to be sure.• There are a maximum of 58 points left for each driver to win: eight in today’s sprint, 25 in tomorrow’s race and 25 in Abu Dhabi next Sunday.• If two drivers are level on points in the standings the driver with most race wins would be champion. If they still cannot be split it goes to most second-place finishes, and so on until a point of difference is reached. The McLaren drivers are level 7-7 on wins, with Verstappen on six, but Norris is 8-3 ahead of Piastri on second places.• Norris is aiming to become the 11th British champion after Mike Hawthorn, Graham Hill (2), Jim Clark (2), John Surtees, Jackie Stewart (3), James Hunt, Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill, Lewis Hamilton (7) and Jenson Button.McLaren sealed the constructors' title with in October, with six races remainingWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.On the first hot runs in Q3 Piastri set the pace with a 1min 20.241sec lap, four-hundredths quicker than ­Norris. However Verstappen was complaining his car was suffering with bouncing through the corners, lacking the stability in the fast turns that had been a strength of the car and an issue he had also experienced in the only practice session. Going off wide on his first run he did not set a competitive time on his first run.Lando Norris calm in the maelstrom as three-way title race enters final straightRead moreThe track had rubbered in for the final laps and Verstappen was the first out. He did put in a clean lap but he was still struggling and the cars behind him were improving as the track ramped up, with his teammate Yuki Tsunoda faster than him in fifth.It was Piastri however who took the top slot with a finely judged lap of 1:20.055 and was followed home by Russell splitting the two McLarens as Norris went wide pushing hard on his final lap.Norris leads Piastri and Verstappen by 24 points and with 58 still available the title cannot be won or lost in the sprint but it could well be a factor in whether Norris is able to close it out on Sunday, or whether his rivals can force it into the final round next week in Abu Dhabi.Lewis Hamilton’s trying season continued as he was eliminated in Q1, managing only 18th on the grid. “The car won’t go any quicker,” he said, which might well sum up his first year with Ferrari.The sprint on Saturday will have a mandatory two stops, after Pirelli limited the use of tyres to a 25-lap stint as a precaution against punctures on what is an enormously demanding circuit with high lateral loads. With 57 laps to be completed all the teams will have to stop twice.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Formula OneMotor sportOscar PiastrinewsShareReuse this content"

He has faced calls to drop the under-performing Ibrahima Konaté and Mohamed Salah in recent days, or to shake up his style in an attempt to halt the slide.But the head coach has insisted a radical overhaul is not the solution, or even an option given his injury problems in defence and the lack of training time during Liverpool’s run of seven games in 22 days.Defiant Arne Slot vows to ‘fight on’ after meeting with Liverpool sporting directorRead more“Is the question: ‘Should I change dramatically?’” Slot asked. “I don’t know what is in your head but if, for example, you want another system with five defenders that could be an issue. I don’t even have five defenders.“The system we are playing now suits the players best. They have played this system probably throughout their whole career and there is hardly any training time for us. So it is almost impossible to change our complete idea about football if we play every two days. I think we have played a lot of different lineups for reasons I prefer not to do because everyone was not available. We have used our whole squad constantly.”Slot is adamant that Liverpool’s quality will prevail and turn their season around. The head coach accepted the experience of Manchester City last season, who endured a run of one win in 13 games but havere-emerged as title contendersthis season, is a fair comparison.“I said already multiple reasons, and I can come up with an extra five or six, for why we are on a run of form like this, but they will never be enough to make up for the results that we have,” added Slot. “I am not sure but Pep [Guardiola] will probably have said the same. For example, we had injuries last season as well. So it is not like this season we have injuries and last season we didn’t so that helped us with a better run of form.”“But indeed [the example of City is valid] because they have quality and we have quality. The best chance to come out of a situation like this is that we as a team and me as a manager bring the best out of these players again to bring us back to winning ways. If we didn’t have the quality we would have had a big problem. I think we have the quality and we have to bring the best out of them again.”Slot revealed he has received more support than usual from his father, Arend, during Liverpool’s sequence of nine defeats in 12 games. The 47-year-old said Slot Srcould be critical of his title-winning team last seasonbut is acutely aware of the difficulties his son is currently going through. “As a dad, he knows how difficult it is for me,” said Slot. “To give me another hit is not the best thing you can do as a dad. He is a bit more supportive now than when we are winning.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotnewsShareReuse this content"

In July, the 24-year-old won her first Wimbledon title and sixth grand slam title in all,crushing a hapless Amanda Anisimova6-0, 6-0 in the final.It was the undoubted highlight of an up-and-down year for the Pole, who struggled on her best surface of clay but who will end 2025 ranked No 2, her fourth year in a row finishing inside the world’s top two.Tennis burnout on the rise as grind of long season brings stars to their kneesRead moreIt is a quirk unique toWimbledonthat the singles’ champions are given honorary membership to the All England Club, granting them access any time they choose. Like many before her, Swiatek is keen to experience the sport’s most storied venue when fans and her fellow players are not around.“I wonder how it feels,” she says. “I will be back for sure. I would love to. I have no idea how that works, though. I heard once Roger [Federer] wasn’t let in when he didn’t have a proper badge or something, so I would need to get ready.” The Swiss was initially turned away in late 2022 when he did not bring his membership card.So strong on clay, with fourFrench Open titlesin the past six years, Swiatek had previously regarded Wimbledon with caution, wary of the surface, unsure if her skills would translate. But after an unusually tough time on the red stuff, she gained extra practice by playing in a warm-up event in Germany and found her game to record a stunning triumph.“Any season that has a Wimbledon win, I would take without hesitation,” she says. “I’m super proud of this achievement. This is something I wasn’t expecting to happen this year. I thought I [would] need a couple more years to learn how to play on grass and to use my skills for the surface. But I felt great.“We worked hard before Wimbledon to change some tactical patterns I also had in my head and wasn’t really using in previous years. I felt, day by day, I had my game, and I really used the opportunity. Having that win changed everything.”View image in fullscreenIga Swiatek screams with joy after winning Wimbledon, her first title at SW19.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianUntil that point, her season had been largely disappointing, at least by the incredible standards she has set in recent years. One point away from reachingthe Australian Open finalin January, she did not make a final until June. There were surprise losses on clay, although her run to the semis at the French Open seemed to restore belief.At Wimbledon, from 2-2 in the first set of her semi-final against Belinda Bencic, she won 22 straight games, blitzing Anisimova in the first double bagel in the women’s final since 1911. It was a crowning moment for Swiatek, even if she found some of the questions immediately after a little baffling.“I wasn’t really thinking about how it looks, I was just playing, and I didn’t want to give any points for free,” she says.“It’s a Wimbledon final, I wanted to win it really bad.“After, for sure, there were a lot of crazy things happening. I remember all these interviews about the score, journalists asking questions if I should let Amanda win one game or something like that. It was pretty different.“I can only say that this tournament shows tennis is [such a] mental sport. This part of the game has a huge impact on everything and on the results of each player. I’m really happy I handled the pressure well, because after the final, everybody was talking about Amanda being stressed or something, but I was also stressed as hell; playing the final of Wimbledon on Centre Court is a surreal experience.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After a brief holiday in Mauritius, pre-season begins for Swiatek in early December and though all top players are mandated to play a minimum number of events, she is planning to cut down her commitments in 2026.“I would like to try missing maybe two tournaments – maybe the ones I feel I haven’t been playing well at anyway – just spending this time on grinding and getting the technique better,” she says. “I think it will help me also play a little bit better under stress, because my body will remember the proper movements and what it learned during this practice time.View image in fullscreenIga Swiatek’s season ended with a group-stage exit at the WTA Tour finals in Saudi Arabia.Photograph: Stéphanie Lecocq/Reuters“Mentally, it can give me a lot of confidence, knowing I worked hard. Then I can come to tournaments a little bit better prepared, because for sure, playing all mandatory tournaments now, most players will tell you they’re not always 100% ready to play every one of these.”Swiatek needs the Australian Open to complete the career grand slam, something only 10 women have accomplished. It will not be easy, not just with Aryna Sabalenka ahead of her at No 1, but with a top 10 she feels has bunched up over the past 12 months. Not surprisingly, she and her coach, Wim Fissette, have a plan to stay on top.“There is a lot of stuff I learned this year that I started doing, but couldn’t really mix it well with how I’ve been playing for the past seasons,” she says.“My goal overall will be to combine that with good balance, still keep my good game on the slower surfaces … to really feel more comfortable with the variety I’ve got and know exactly where to use what skill.”Explore more on these topicsIga SwiatekWimbledonTennisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

An exemption to the ban was granted to athletes, coaches or “persons performing a necessary support role” who were travelling for the World Cup or “other major sporting event”, but appears not to have been applied in this instance.“We have informed Fifa that the decisions taken are unrelated to sport and that the members of the Iranian delegation will not participate in the World Cup draw,” the federation spokesperson Amir Mehdi Alavi was quoted as saying by the English language newspaper the Tehran Times.View image in fullscreenIran played the USA at the 2022 World Cup.Photograph: Wolfgang Rattay/ReutersAccording to the newspaper, the president of the FFIRI, Mehdi Taj, was one of three individuals denied a visa by the US state department, while four people – including the head coach, Amir Ghalenoei – were granted one. Reports in October suggested both Taj and Ghalenoei had seen their visa applications rejected, with the Tehran Times reporting that the FFIRI had taken up the issue personally with Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino.Infantino has previously pledged that “everyone will be welcome” at the World Cup, which begins in Mexico City on 11 June. Speaking on the sidelines of an assembly of the European Football Clubs organisation on 9 October, he had sought to calm concerns that visas could be denied to athletes or officials.“We have excellent discussions with the US government. There is a White House task force chaired by President Trump, and all these topics are discussed there,” Infantino said. “With all the relevant secretaries of state, there will be no issues with regard to visas, obviously for the participating teams and delegations, and we are working on something as well for fans. Hopefully, some good news will come out very soon.”Fifa has since confirmed the creation of the Fifa Pass, a scheme that will allow World Cup ticket holders priority access to the visa application process before the tournament. Applications are not guaranteed to be successful, however. According to reporting in Politico, fans of Haiti – who qualified for their second World Cup last week but whose nation is also on Trump’s restricted travel list – are able to submit visa applications but “may be ineligible for visa issuance or admission to the United States”.Fifa, the FFIRI and the US Department of State have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026IranWorld CupnewsShareReuse this content"

Ukraine’s Ruslan Ponomariov had been a year younger in 2002, but that World Cup had also doubled as the Fide world championship in a period when the global title was disputed.Wei was the favourite, but handicapped himself by poor time management inthe decisive game. He declined a draw and could have gained an advantage by 52 Qg6! when Black’s king was trapped on the back row, and right at the end could have drawn by 57 Kg2! Qh4 58 Rf8+! when White can force perpetual check. Instead, he blundered into a checkmating attack.The eight candidates and their November world rankings are: Hikaru Nakamura (USA, 2), Fabiano Caruana (USA, 3), Anish Giri (Netherlands, 5), Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu (India, 7), Wei Yi (China, 11), Javokhir Sindarov (Uzbekistan, 25), Andrey Esipenko (Russia, 41), Matthias Blübaum (Germany, 43).View image in fullscreen4000:GM Jakob Kosakowski v IM Alan Merry, CSC/ Kingston v Barbican, 4NCL 2025. Black chose 1...Rxe2 and lost. Can you do better?Caruana will be the favourite, as he already tied a world title match with Magnus Carlsen in London 2018 and narrowly missed a playoff with Gukesh in 2024. However, both Americans are in their 30s and are the two oldest players in the event.Giri is currently in good form, but the Dutchman’s well-known penchant for too many draws will count against him. Praggnanandhaa has had some major successes recently, and his best successes probably still lie ahead. He still needs to play in a tournament with more than 50 competitors to confirm his Fide circuit place, so the 19-year-old is in action at the London Fide Open. From the viewpoint of global interest in chess, two young Indians would not be preferable for a world title match.Sindarov has already proved himself on the verge of joining the elite and will be supported by the high profile of chess in Uzbekistan. Esipenko will surely have massive help, as Russia eyes the chance to restore Soviet glories. The style of the 23-year-old’s elegant win inhis final qualifying gamewas reminiscent of the great Paul Keres. Blübaum looks the most likely tailender.Who do Guardian readers predict to win the Candidates?

Round one clashed with the Arsenal v Bayern Munich in the Champions League, so was played at a private venue.In the event, all five games were drawn, includingGawain Maroroa Jones v Nodirbek Abdusattorovwhere the 2024 British Champion correctly predicted a Caro-Kann 1 e4 c6 by the top seed and prepared a spectacular variation where at the end it is risky for Black to avoid perpetual check. Abdusattorov, taken by surprise, opted for the early draw.Thursday night’s second round was a setback for English hopes, as Luke McShane blundered a piece against Alireza Firouzja while Greece’sNikolas Theodorou checkmated Maroroa Jones.There was almost a major upset in the Fide Open when the top-seeded Praggnanandhaa missed Stanley Badacsonyi’s knight sacrifice and was losing for several moves, but the north London 16-year-old eventuallywent down in an endgame.4000:1…Bxf2+! 2 Qxf2 Rxe2 3 Rxe2 (if 3 Nc4+ Rxf2 4 Nxd6 Rxe1+ 5 Kxf2 Re6 Black is rook for knight up) Qd1+ and 4…R or Qxe2 wins.

Francis Drake, Lord Nelson, Admiral Cunningham … and, of course, SirBen Ainslie. The most successful Olympian in sailing’s history is also the sport’s equivalent of The Hulk: you really don’t want to make him angry.So perhaps it’s a good thing that there has been plenty to annoy him this year, not least thatacrimonious splitfrom his America’s Cup team owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe. In true Ainslie style, it only seems to have made him more dangerous. His Emirates GBR team top the SailGP championship going into this weekend’s grand final. And on Wednesday, they were named 2025 winners of its Impact League, which ranks the racing teams on the contribution they have made to their social and natural environment.Ben Ainslie’s choppy seas: SailGP, the America’s Cup and a split with IneosRead moreIf you haven’t come across SailGP before, it’s where the world’s best sailors compete when they’re not at the Olympics or the America’s Cup. Launched four years ago, it gave the sport an F1-style calendar, in which a fleet of foiling catamarans race each other over a season of grand prix weekends. Its F50s are the fastest sailing boats on the planet, and the racecourses are close enough to the shore that spectators feel the full thrill of their speed.That short-form fleet racing is not the only revolutionary thing about it. SailGP was founded to make sailing more viable as a career – in other words, sustainability was a core motivation. Its organisers have embedded that principle within the very competition itself by awarding side-by-side trophies – one for what happens on the water, and another for what happens off of it. For the past four years its Impact League has been just as fiercely fought as any of the grands prix themselves.Its creation has modelled a completely new way for sport to operate. Across each year the teams’ activities are closely measured – and credibly judged – against a wide range of criteria. The more they cut their carbon use, or reduce waste, or use their platform to educate and influence, the higher they rank in the Impact League. In the first year of the competition alone, teams found ever more ingenious ways to reduce their carbon footprint, from removing plastic from their boats to reducing the fuel they were using in their support craft. Three members of the GB team even cycled from their homebase to the Plymouth Grand Prix – a total of more than 450 miles.Gamification is often talked of as a way to change human behaviour, and hyper-competitive types such as athletes don’t need much encouragement if you tease them with a trophy, not to mention prize money of more than £100,000. Some changes – such as swapping out meat for plant-based proteins in their nutritional plans – have become commonplace, as everyone looks for marginal gains over their rivals. Hannah Mills, the double Olympic champion who is Emirates GBR’s strategist on the water, says it has been “a real education” for all the athletes on what is possible.View image in fullscreenBen Ainslie during last year’s America’s Cup before his split with Ineos. He has since led his new Emirates GBR team to the Impact League title.Photograph: Bernat Armangué/AP“Often you’re so head-down, focused on performance and trying to win, that you don’t necessarily realise the impact and responsibility you have outside of that,” says Mills. “This has opened our eyes to the difference you can make in so many areas. Particularly when you incentivise it around competition – that’s definitely created more change than if there wasn’t that format around it.” The steps that teams have taken to become more climate and socially conscious have been so swiftly effective that the Impact League has to keep making the points criteria harder each year.“It means a lot to everyone to win, and every year the level is getting higher and the projects are getting better,” says Mills. By last season the British team were using portable solar and wind installations to power their entire events base and creating so much renewable energy they could send it back to the grid to be used by other teams. Just as importantly, they had created a model they could then share with other sports organisations.The education charity that Emirates GBR have established, the 1851 Trust, now works with more than 40% of the UK’s secondary schools to teach children about climate action and one of their 2025 winning projects created a platform that engaged and encouraged 250,000 young people in Stem subjects. Another found ways to repurpose team kit that previously had to be replaced each time a new sponsor came on board – including lifejackets fitted with Velcro pads so that branding is easily interchangeable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From their girls’ training programmes to their development scheme for inner-city youth, they are already reaping the rewards of their efforts. Kai Hockley was still at school in Haringey, north London, when he first interned with Ainslie’s team in 2024. Twelve months later he is a full-time professional training towards a role on their SailGP boat.View image in fullscreenHannah Mills at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. She is now Emirates GBR’s team strategist.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images“Watching his career develop has been a highlight for me,” says Mills. “It’s incredible to be showing people a world they would probably never get the chance to see otherwise.” When she and her teammates are not training or racing, they’re engaged full-time on these “impact” projects. “It’s tons of work, but equally there’s so much reward, including for our own performance.”As current championship leaders, the British team already had a target on their back at this weekend’s grand final in Abu Dhabi. The fact they’ve secured the Impact League for the second year running will only further pique the Australia and New Zealand teams challenging them (“No one wants us to do the double,” says Mills). Off the water, however, the sense of collective purpose among the SailGP athletes is utterly unique. As a former Olympian, Mills has worked with athletes in many fields, all wanting their governing bodies to take a lead in social and climate issues.Sailingmay be a niche sport – but if it can model a more purpose-driven sporting landscape, the Impact League could have an impact far greater still.Explore more on these topicsSailingBen AinsliecommentShareReuse this content"

The correct answer would have been “Don Welsh bad”, given he was the last Liverpool manager to preside over nine defeats in 12 games, back in 1953-54. But the on-the-spot consensus was “Brendan bad” for reasons that may increase anxiety at Fenway Sports Group as the club’s owners desperately await a recovery under Arne Slot.The Roy Hodgson era, airbrushed from history by some atLiverpool, is too low a base for comparisons with a Premier League champion. There are, however, some parallels between the current Liverpool crisis and the final 16 months of Brendan Rodgers’ reign at Anfield. The 2014-15 season was the last time confidence in a Liverpool manager or head coach began to drain. It was also the last time the impressive development of a Liverpool team – one that went agonisingly close to an unexpected title triumph in Rodgers’ case – not only came to an abrupt halt but veered into a steep decline with several new signings on board. FSG must hope the comparisons go no further, because that decline was precipitated by self-sabotage in the summer transfer window of 2014 and there is no conclusive evidence so far that it has avoided an expensive repeat in 2025.Can Arne Slot revive this Frankenstein’s monster of a Liverpool side? | Barney RonayRead moreResponsibility for Liverpool’s ridiculous and unbelievable collapse – to use Slot’s own descriptions – is on the shoulders of a head coach who has struggled to find solutions and faces a critical run of Premier League fixtures in the next week against West Ham, Sunderland and Leeds. The affable, honest Dutchman has never shied from that responsibility and accepts that questions over his future are legitimate, only six months after leading Liverpool to theirsecond league title in 35 years. He is not bringing the best out of an unquestionably talented group, whose commitment towards the end of the losses toPSVandNottingham Forestwas questionable.Slot spoke with Richard Hughes, Liverpool’s sporting director, to dissect the PSV defeat on Thursday, as he does after every game, and came away reassured that the club’s hierarchy still back him. But he knows faith in football is finite and the current rate of losses is unsustainable. The conversation and the questions should not be one-way, however, whenthe most extravagant transfer windowin Liverpool’s history has failed to improve a title-winning team after 20 games. An outlay approaching £450m, that included committing to break the British transfer record twice in one summer, has brought only disruption and imbalance so far.Liverpool’s fall is unprecedented, even with echoes of 2014 taken into account. Status, pulling power and finances comfortably restored thanks to Jürgen Klopp, and Slot’s success last season, Liverpool today have their choice when shopping at the high end of the market.Selling Luis Suárezand buying Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Lazar Markovic with the proceeds this is not.View image in fullscreenArne Slot has not managed to get the best out of Mohamed Salah this season.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/ReutersLiverpool’s transfer strategy is led by Hughes and Michael Edwards, chief executive of football at FSG. Slot has input and a say on transfer targets but, as his head-coach title demonstrates, his role is to work within the system FSG put in place after Klopp’s departure and coach the team. That is worth considering as the clamour among Liverpool supporters for Klopp to return gathers pace. FSG does not want an all-powerful manager in charge. Edwards would in all likelihood have not agreed to return to the club in March 2024 had that been the plan.Edwards’ and Hughes’ reputations for astute, intelligent transfer dealings and long-term planning are well established. But, with Slot under intense pressure and Liverpool in the bottom half of the table – albeit while three points off fourth place – their approach to the summer window invites as many questions as the team’s results.Were last season’s champions really crying out for theaddition of Florian Wirtz’s creative class at a cost of potentially £116m? Whysign Hugo Ekitikéfor up to £79mplus Alexander Isak for £125mwhen there is so little cover on the flanks, especially after the departure of Luis Díaz? Why sign a right wing-back in Jeremie Frimpong when a bona fide full-back was required? Liverpool will be paying a considerable price for the foreseeable future if, and it remains an if given the calibre of Wirtz and Isak, they have got this one spectacularly wrong.Questions at right-back have had a destabilising effect on the Liverpool team. The club were powerless to preventTrent Alexander-Arnold leaving on a free for Real Madridbut the consequences of his acrimonious exit have been extensive. Conor Bradley’s struggles with injury were well known before Alexander-Arnold went, hence the need for an established addition in that position. One did not arrive. Bradley, Frimpong, Joe Gomez, Curtis Jones, Calvin Ramsay and Dominik Szoboszlai have been deployed at right-back this season. The high turnover has undoubtedly affected Mohamed Salah’s form. Switching Szoboszlai to defence has also deprived the Liverpool midfield of the team’s most effective player this term.‘I’m feeling safe’: Arne Slot insists he retains Liverpool’s support after PSV humiliationRead moreSlot had hoped Wirtz would provide the ingenuity needed to break down low blocks and turn the slender victories of last season into more emphatic routs. It has not happened. The Germany international, who could return from injury at West Ham on Sunday, may have been lured with promises of a team being built around him, as Arsène Wenger has claimed, but has had minimal impact in the Premier League when playing as a 10. Slot’s search to accommodate the playmaker continues.Isak’s start to life at Liverpool has been worse than Wirtz’s. The most expensive signing in British football history was excused for a sluggish introduction by Slot on account of missing pre-season at Newcastle while effectively on strike to force a move to Merseyside. Two months into his Liverpool career, the Sweden striker remains short of match sharpness. One can only wonder what the rest of the Liverpool dressing room makes of his behaviour at Newcastle this summer.The new signings owe Slot but are not solely responsible for the downturn of a champion team reeling from theimmeasurable loss of Diogo Jotaand in uncharted territory on the pitch too. It was noticeable how often Slotused the word “fight” during his press conference to preview the West Ham game. Liverpool must show more over the next week, or the unthinkable will come a step closer.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotanalysisShareReuse this content"

Arsenal lead second-placed Chelsea by six points and Arteta has not lost at Stamford Bridge in six visits as a manager.Declan Rice cranks up volume to show he is Europe’s best player right now | Nick AmesRead moreArteta signed Rice from West Hamin 2023 and said even he had been surprised by the26-year-old’s progressionsince the £105m move. He was asked whether he thought Rice had reached his peak.“Probably yes, a year or two ago, yes,” Arteta said. “But now being with him every single day and understanding and connecting with him in the way that I’ve done, we’re going to get more. Because he wants more and he’s going to get more. The team knows him better, his role is growing around the team, the impact that he has on the team is huge and we’ll find ways to make it even better.”Rice was signed as a defensive midfielder but has evolved into a box-to-box player that Arteta believes allows the England international to have more influence. “He can adapt to anything that you throw at him,” he said. “But at the moment that forward thinking and anything that is in front of him is probably much more positive for the team. He has earned the right to increase that role, to be more and more important, to be very present in everything that we do.“He’s in the leadership group, which is very important as well, and it’s a real presence. Sometimes you don’t need to just wear the armband to feel really connected, really powerful and really important in the team.”Rice, who joined West Ham after being released by Chelsea, was namedman of the match against Bayern. He told the former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry in an interview for American television after that there was “an anger in our players this season” and that they have “that fire in our stomach” after finishing as runners up for three successive campaigns. It is a feeling clearly encouraged by Arteta.“Yes, but I sense that for a long time and that’s a great thing,” Arteta said. “That desire, that willingness to win and to do everything that we have in our hands to be the best that we can. It’s unquestionable and they show with [their] actions every single day.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since joining from Manchester City in 2023, he has recorded 45 goals and 29 assists in 101 matches for the Blues. “He is our best player, we are happy he is back, we need to give him time to be 100% fit. He has done fantastic in the past and no doubt he is going to do very good for this club in the future,” Maresca said.Reuters2.‘No reason’ given for Gueye’s failed red-card appealEverton have failed with an appeal against Idrissa Gueye’s red card forfighting with his teammate Michael Keanein Monday night’s1-0 win at Manchester United. Gueye saw red 13 minutes into the match at Old Trafford, slapping Keane as they argued over a misplaced pass, and then needed to be hauled away by Jordan Pickford before the referee Tony Harrington sent off the veteran midfielder for violent conduct.View image in fullscreenIdrissa Gueye slaps his Everton teammate Michael Keane.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAGueye immediately apologised and it was all smiles during training this week as he and Keane staged a mock boxing match on social media, but the 36-year-old Senegal midfielder must still serve a three-match ban which leaves Everton shorthanded for Saturday’s match against Newcastle.“We have appealed it and our appeal was turned down,” Moyes said. “We haven’t been given any reason why it was turned down but we did appeal it.” Asked if there had been any further fallout this week, Moyes added: “It was over immediately, it was done, that was it, we moved on quite quickly and it was all sorted within the dressing room.”PA Media3.Wissa trains for first time at NewcastleYoane Wissa, who suffered a knee injury days after his arrival at Newcastle from Brentford in September, has trained with his new club for the first time, Eddie Howe said on Friday, without disclosing a possible return date.Newcastle signed the striker for £55m to replace Alexander Isak, who joined Liverpool for a British record transfer fee. But the 29-year-old was injured on national duty before he was due to make his Newcastle debut.View image in fullscreenYoane Wissa was injured on national duty before his Newcastle debut.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA“He is doing well, he trained with us for the first time on Wednesday, so I was really pleased with how he looked. That’s his first time competitively with the group. Let’s see how he responds today,” Howe said in the buildup to Saturday’s game at Everton. “We’ve got [a return date] in mind, but it’s probably best if I keep that to myself. We don’t want to disappoint anyone. Of course, we want to involve him as soon as possible.”Kieran Trippier, however, will be sidelined for a month with a hamstring injury.PA Media4.Liverpool slump ‘doesn’t matter’, insists NunoNuno Espírito Santo insists Liverpool’s poor form “doesn’t really matter” as West Ham prepare to take on the ailing Premier League champions. Arne Slot’s side may have lost six of the last seven in the Premier League to drop out of the top 10, but the Hammers’ head coach maintains there can be no sense of complacency on Sunday at the London Stadium.“Liverpool is a good team and in football, what matters is what you do on the day,” Nuno said. “So what we expect is the champions of the Premier League, players that are talented and capable of doing good things, so we have to get ready.View image in fullscreenWest Ham will have Lucas Paquetá available following suspension.Photograph: Nigel French/PA“The history of the results before, the form of the teams, doesn’t really matter. It is about the day. Knowing that we are going to face a very good team, that has players capable of doing fantastic things, so we have to get ready, to compete.”West Ham will have Lucas Paquetá available after suspension, while Crysencio Summerville and Dinos Mavropanos are stepping up their recovery from injury.PA Media5.Gibbs-White in frame to face BrightonSean Dyche hopes Morgan Gibbs-White will be fit for Nottingham Forest’s home match against Brighton on Sunday. The England international missed Thursday’s Europa Leaguesaunter against Malmöwith a back injury. “Hopefully it’s settling down,” the Forest manager said as he prepared to face Fabian Hürzeler’s side, who have taken seven points from their past three matches.View image in fullscreenMorgan Gibbs-White missed Thursday’s Europa League saunter against Malmö with a back injury.Photograph: Matt West/Shutterstock“It’s like a bad back, but a waking-up sort of injury, one where you just sleep funny or twist funny.

So we’re hopeful that it’ll be right for the weekend.”Murillo was feeling his hamstring after the 3-0 European win and Dyche said the defender “should be fine”. Ola Aina (thigh injury, Douglas Luiz (thigh), Dilane Bakwa (hamstring), Chris Wood (knee) and Oleksandr Zinchenko (hip) are expected to miss out.PA Media6.Glasner: European loss will not peg back PalaceOliver Glasner feels the disappointment of Thursday night’s Conference League defeat in Strasbourg is a sign of how far Crystal Palace have come in looking to be challenging on two fronts. The FA Cup winners went ahead at Stade de la Meinau through Tyrick Mitchell’s first-half goal, only to be pegged back by Liam Rosenior’s side, who moved up to second in the table.View image in fullscreenOliver Glasner is confident his side can keep themselves in contention for the top four.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockThe Eagles return to the Premier League at home against Manchester United and Glasner is confident his side can keep themselves in contention for the top four. “Maybe like the late defeat at Everton, it just feels that it was completely unnecessary and it is our fault,” Glasner said. “On the other side, we have to accept it. The effort was there but it is a game we shouldn’t definitely lose. It just shows how much it means for this club and then of course everybody is playing on their top level, highly motivated.”Glasner confirmed Borna Sosa would not be available for Sunday’s game after he did not travel to France, but Will Hughes, who went off during the first half against Strasbourg, should be in the matchday squad.PA MediaExplore more on these topicsChelseaThe talkEvertonNewcastle UnitedWest Ham UnitedNottingham ForestCrystal PalacenewsShareReuse this content"

From April 2027 these will be subject to the 45% top rate of income tax, rather than the corporate tax rate of 25%.Some Premier League players signed from overseas are understood to have clauses in their contracts that make their clubs liable for any significant changes to the UK’s tax regime but those who do not are likely to demand higher wages.Many players negotiate contracts based on net pay, with clubs taking care of their tax affairs, a trend likely to continue. Image rights payments often make up a notable portion of players’ salaries, which is permitted by HMRC if the amount is deemed commercially realistic and does not exceed 20% of total earnings, so the increased tax liability for clubs may be considerable.The government’s move follows a long-running clampdown by HMRC on footballers’ earnings, which has recovered hundreds of millions of pounds in unpaid tax.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The plan was to be front foot-footed. We weren’t. After Sunday I was angry, painful, hurt. [After PSG] I was irritated, but the feeling in the body was better because we really, really, really competed.

Tottenham have the second-worst home record this season with five points from six games, having secured only three victories in 20 home league matches, most played under Ange Postecoglou last season. Frank has emphasised the need for patience but remains hopeful that he can create a similar chemistry to the one he had at Brentford.“There, it was a little bit of a journey together and the team clicked at that time,” he said. “They had a front four with Yoane Wissa, Bryan Mbeumo, Kevin Schade and Mikkel Damsgaard.

The head coach made 10 changes for the Champions League match and said those selected had not taken the risks needed to win.After two straight losses, City hope to return to form when Leeds visit on Saturday. Daniel Farke’s side have won once in their past six Premier League games, leaving them in the relegation zone. Guardiola is likely to recall many of those rested from the start on Tuesday.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreThose who did play from the outset against Leverkusen tried to get home supporters to make noise on what was a quiet night at the Etihad Stadium to little or no avail. Guardiola did not blame them.“As a fan, I would not cheer my team, playing in the way we played,” the head coach said. “We didn’t try and in football when you play on the green you have to try things and we didn’t try. Maybe I have a theory to rotate because it’s impossible to sustain but I had a lot of confidence in them and I still do. I have a huge value for what they are as football players. Maybe I think higher of them than they think about themselves. It was a good lesson for me, as experienced as I am as a manager it was a good lesson for me for the future.”With City playing twice a week until mid-January, Guardiola will need to rely on his entire squad but some are facing a crisis of confidence. “I’m pretty sure that they, surrounded by other players, will play good,” he said. “I think they played not to make mistakes, not to play to do something. That is so difficult. In football, you have to play defensive and offensive and you have to try. They played to be safe, to not make mistakes and that’s why it’s so difficult.”Erling Haaland has scored 14 of City’s 24 Premier League goals this season, with no one else in the squad registering more than one goal. Guardiola insisted that is not a “main concern”. Rodri, meanwhile, remains absent with a hamstring injury but, according to the manager is “not far off”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We knew they would be dangerous and have their chances. Fortunately, they didn’t put them in.”The Germany forward Klara Bühl played a starring role, but her threatening dribbles and powerful shooting could not get the better of the Spanish defence, and the Germans were almost caught out when Esther González hit the woodwork for Spain just after the break.Despite difficult conditions with rain falling steadily through the second half, Bühl never relented and she finally got a shot past Coll, only to see it bounce back off the foot of the lefthand post and away to safety.Winger Jule Brand followed up that effort with a shot that skimmed off the top of the crossbar in the 76th minute, but despite 19 attempts on goal for Germany and nine for the visitors, neither side managed to score, leaving the tie delicately balanced ahead of the second leg.View image in fullscreenGermany’s outstanding Klara Bühl tries to get the better of Spain's Ona Batlle in Kaiserslautern.Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw/Reuters“Everyone who saw today’s match knows that we didn’t just keep up but played really well,” the Germany defender Janina Minge said. “If we can convert our chances and keep defending as we did we can get the win on Tuesday.”Spain’s first victory over Germany came at the 2025 European Championship semi-finals where Aitana Bonmatí scored in extra time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Seeing all the different nations, the cultures, the diversity, the inclusivity, was really special to be involved with. The fact that it’s a World Cup [means] it is worldwide and all eyes will be on us and people will want to come and be a part of it.”Among the 22 stadiums proposed as potential host venues for a tournament the FA believes will be eight times bigger than the 2022 Euros in terms of ticket sales are some undergoing redevelopment and the proposed new stadiums of Birmingham Cityand Manchester United. Any new Chelsea stadium would also come into ­consideration, as would ­Stamford Bridge and ­Wrexham’s stadium if redeveloped to meet Fifa requirements.Sixteen of the stadiums are in England, three are in Wales, two are in Scotland and one is in ­Northern ­Ireland. Fifteen host cities are ­potential venues (the bid officially lists 16, counting Trafford as distinct from Manchester).“Sixty-three million people live within two hours of a match venue that we’re proposing, so we think it brings together the whole country and some of the most recognisable cities and stadia that we have,” the Football Association’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said.Quick GuideThe 15 potential host cities and 22 potential stadiumsShow•Belfast•Birmingham(Villa Park and proposed new Birmingham City stadium)•Brighton•Bristol(Ashton Gate)•Cardiff(Cardiff City Stadium and Principality Stadium)•Edinburgh(Easter Road)•Glasgow(Hampden Park)•Leeds•Liverpool(Hill Dickinson Stadium)•London(Emirates Stadium, Selhurst Park, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Wembley, any new Chelsea stadium or a redeveloped Stamford Bridge if it meets Fifa requirements)•Manchester(Etihad Stadium, Old Trafford or new Manchester United stadium)•Newcastle•Nottingham(City Ground)•Sunderland•Wrexham(if redevelopment meets Fifa requirements)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“We’ve also included some stadia that have not been built.

Photograph: BAE SystemsAs navies seek to counter submarines and protect cables, startups and big defence companies fight to lead marketByJasper JollyFri 28 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 09.18 ESTShareFlying drones used during the Ukraine war havechanged land battle tacticsfor ever. Now the same thing appears to be happening under the sea.Navies around the world are racing to add autonomous submarines. The UK’s Royal Navy is planning a fleet of underwater uncrewed vehicles (UUVs) which will, for the first time, take a leading role in tracking submarines and protecting undersea cables and pipelines. Australia has committed to spending $1.7bn (£1.3bn)on “Ghost Shark” submarinesto counter Chinese submarines. The huge US Navy is spending billions on several UUV projects, including one already in use that can be launched from nuclear submarines.Autonomous uncrewed submarines represent “a genuine step-change in the underwater battle space”, said Scott Jamieson, the managing director for maritime and land defence solutions at BAE Systems, Britain’s dominant weapons company and builder of its nuclear submarines. The new drones under development would allow navies to “scale up in ways that just weren’t available before”, at “a fraction of the cost of manned submarines”, he said.The opportunity of a huge new market is pitting big, experienced defence companies, including BAE Systems and the US’s General Dynamics and Boeing against weapons tech startups such as the American firm Anduril – the maker of the Ghost Shark – and Germany’s Helsing. The startups claim they can move faster and cheaper.View image in fullscreenAnduril’s Ghost Shark is an extra-large autonomous underwater vehicle (XLAUV) that has been ordered by the Royal Australian Navy.Photograph: Rodney Braithwaite/Australian Defence Force/AFP/Getty ImagesThe struggle for undersea dominance has been almost constant in peacetime and war for most of the last century.The first nuclear-powered submarine (the US’s Nautilus, named after Jules Verne’s fictional vessel) was launched in 1954, and nuclear-armed vessels are now the centrepiece of the armed forces of six countries – the US, Russia, the UK, France, China and India – while North Korea may have recently become a seventh. That is despite deep controversy over whether the weapons represent value forhuge sums of money, and whether such a destructive arsenaltruly acts as a useful deterrent.Those armed forces are playing a constant game of hide and seek on the oceans. In order to avoid detection, the submarines rarely surface: maintenance problems on other vessels recently forced some British submarinersto spend a record nine months underwater, carrying Trident nuclear missiles that are theoretically ready to strike at any time.Tracking Russia’s underwater nuclear arsenal – which has become quieter in recent years – is a key focus of the Royal Navy, particularly focusing on the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) gap, a “chokepoint” that allows Nato allies to monitor Russian movements in the north Atlantic. A weapons executive said the South China Sea was another promising market, as China and its neighbours face off in atense, long-running territorial dispute.Greenland-Iceland-UK gap graphicUnderwater drones offer the promise of making it easier to track rivals’ submarines. Some sensors are designed to be dropped by other UUVs to lurk on the seabed for months at a time, according to an executive hoping to sell to the UK.The second spur has been the increasing number of apparent attacks on oil and gas pipelines, such as the Nord Stream attack in 2022, for which Germanyhas identified a Ukrainian suspect, and damage in 2023 to the Balticconnector pipeline between Finland and Estonia. Undersea power and internet cables are also crucial to the global economy. An underwaterpower cable between Finland and Estoniawas hit last Christmas, two months aftertwo telecommunications cablesin Swedish waters in the Baltic Sea were cut.The UK government last weekaccused Russia’s Yantar surveillance shipof entering British waters to map undersea cables. Itsaidthe UK had seen a 30% increase in Russian vessels threatening UK waters in the past two years.Parliament’s defence select committee has raised concerns over the UK’s vulnerability to undersea sabotage, known as “grey zone” actions that can cause big disruption but are likely to fall short of acts of war. Damage to the 60 undersea data and energy cables around the British Isles “could have devastating consequences for the UK”, the committee said.Andy Thomis, the chief executive of Cohort, a British manufacturer of military technology including sonar sensors, said the crewed ships, planes and submarines used up to now to track nuclear-armed subs or sabotage vessels were “very, very capable and very, very expensive”. But, he said, “by combining those with uncrewed vessels, you get the decision-making abilities that humans can give you without putting them in very dangerous proximity”.A video of BAE Systems’s Herne uncrewed underwater vehicle in testing in 2024. Source: BAE SystemsA video of BAE Systems’s Herne uncrewed underwater vehicle in testing in 2024Cohort hopes that some of its towed sensors (named Krait, after a sea snake) could be used on smaller autonomous vessels.The newest vessels contain as many as five times more sonar sensors than submarines in service. Lower power requirements are particularly important for smaller, uncrewed vessels, which do not have the luxury of a nuclear reactor on board. Passive sensors – which do not send out a sonar “ping” – make it harder to detect and destroy.The Royal Navy, and the armed forces in general, are not known for getting the latest technology into action quickly. However, Ukraine’s forces have learned that speed and low cost are crucial when it comes to building drones for the air and the sea. For the undersea drones, the Ministry of Defence is trying to learn that lesson, asking for rapid development of tech demonstrators under “Project Cabot”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Helsing has recently opened a facility in Plymouth, where the Royal Navy also has a base, to produce underwater drones. Anduril, which is run by the Donald Trump fundraiser Palmer Luckey, is eyeing up UK manufacturing sites.The initial contract awards are expected this year, followed by testing, likely to be in north-west Scotland by the defence company QinetiQ, and a full-scale order for one or two companies, named Atlantic Net, to fill the GIUK gap with sensors.The Royal Navy has described the project as “anti-submarine warfare as a service”, riffing on the much more common “software as a service”, according to a£24m tender noticepublished in May.View image in fullscreenAnduril’s Dive LD autonomous underwater vehicle. The US company is eyeing up UK manufacturing sites.Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersSidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow on sea power at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said the submarine-hunting strategy of recent decades “doesn’t scale in a conflict” because it required an expensive mix of big “exquisite assets”.Warships tow cables more than 100 metres long containing arrays of sonar sensors to try to pick up the faintest and lowest-frequency sounds. Planes such as the UK’s Boeing P-8 fleet drop disposable sonobuoys to detect submarines through the depths of the sea, satellites scour the surface for signs of wake left by a submarine communications mast, and a scattering of hunter-killer submarines patrol beneath the waves.The idea of cheap drones taking on a chunk of this work is attractive. Yet Kaushal warned that the price advantage “remains to be seen”. Industry figures warn that a big fleet of UUVs would still come with significant maintenance costs.For protecting undersea cables, too, it could be a double-edged sword: sabotage will be cheaper and easier as well. The prospect of drones firing on one another underwater is “absolutely realistic”, one executive said.The Ministry of Defence described it as “contractor owned, contractor operated, naval oversight” – meaning that privately owned vessels will be charged with anti-submarine warfare for the first time, potentially making them military targets.“The first thing the Russians will do is go out and test this, and push it,” said Ian McFarlane, the sales director for underwater systems at Thales UK, which already supplies the Royal Navy with sonar arrays towed by submarine-hunting ships, uncrewed surface boats and flying drones and hopes to play a part in Cabot, integrating that data.However, the attraction of getting companies on board, McFarlane said, was that the Royal Navy and its allies were looking for “mass and persistence now” to counteract “an aggressor who is ramping up”.This article was amended on 28 November 2025. An earlier version said Helsing was building a facility in Portsmouth; however, the factory is located in Plymouth and has recently opened.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorDefence policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Staffers are calling on the company to power all its data centers with clean energy, make sure its AI-powered products and services do not enable “violence, surveillance and mass deportation”, and form a working group comprised of non-managers“that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact”.The letter was organized by employees affiliated with theadvocacy groupAmazon Employees for Climate Justice. One worker who was involved in drafting the letter explained that workers were compelled to speak out because of negative experiences with using AI tools in the workplace, as well as broader environmental concerns about the AI boom. The staffers, the employee said, wanted to advocate for a better way to develop, deploy and use the technology.“I signed the letter because of leadership’s increasing emphasis on arbitrary productivity metrics and quotas, using AI as justification to push myself and my colleagues to work longer hours and push out more projects on tighter deadlines,” said a senior software engineer, who has been with the company for over a decade, and requested anonymity due to fear of reprisal.Climate goalsThe letter accuses Amazon of “casting aside its climate goals to build AI”.Like other companies in the generative AI race,Amazon has invested heavily in building new data centers to power new tools – which are more resource intensive and demand high amounts of electricity to operate. The company plans to spend$150bn on data centers in the next 15 years, and just recently said it willinvest $15bnto build data centers in northern Indiana andat least $3bn for data centers in Mississippi.The letter claims that Amazon’s annual emissions have “grown roughly 35%since 2019”, despite thecompany’s promisein 2019 to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040. It warns many of Amazon’s investments in AI infrastructure will be in “locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plans online or build new gas plants”.“‘AI’ is being used as a magic word that is code for less worker power, hoarding of more resources, and making an uninformed gamble on high energy demand computer chips magically saving us from climate change,” said an Amazon customer researcher, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation for speaking out. “If we can build a climate saving AI – that’s awesome! But that’s not what Amazon is spending billions of dollars to develop. They are investing fossil fuel energy draining data centers for AI that is intended to surveil, exploit, and squeeze every extra cent out of customers, communities, and government agencies.”In a statement to the Guardian, Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser pushed back on employees’ claims and pointed toward the company’s climate goals. “Not only are we the leading data center operator in efficiency, we’re the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for five consecutive years with over 600 projects globally,” said Glasser. “We’ve also invested significantly in nuclear energy through existing plants and new SMR technology–these aren’t distractions, they’re concrete actions demonstrating real progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to reach net-zero carbon across our global operations by 2040.”AI for productivityThe letter also includes strict demands around the role of AI in the Amazon workplace, demands that, staffers say, arose out of challenges employees are experiencing.Three Amazon employees who spoke to the Guardian claimed that the company is pressuring them to use AI tools for productivity, in an effort to increase output. “I’m getting messaging from my direct manager and [from] of all the way up the chain, about how I should be using AI for coding, for writing, for basically all of my day-to-day tasks, and that those will make me more efficient, and also that if I don’t get on board and use them, that I’m going to fall behind, that it’s sort of sink or swim,” said a software engineer who has been with Amazon for over two years, requesting anonymity due to fear of reprisal.The worker added that just weeks ago she was told by her manager that they were “expected to do twice as much work because of AI tools”, and expressed concern that the output expected demanded with fewer people is unsustainable, and “the tools are just not making up that gap.”The customer researcher echoed similar concerns. “I have both personally felt the pressure to use AI in my role, and hear from so many of my colleagues they are under the same pressure …”.“All the while, there’s no discussion about the immediate effects on us as workers – from unprecedented layoffs to unrealistic expectations for output.”The senior software engineer said that the adoption of AI has had imperfect outcomes. He said that most commonly, workers are pressured to adopt agentic code generation tools: “Recently I worked on a project that was just cleaning up after a high-level engineer tried to use AI to generate code to complete a complex project,” said this worker. “But none of it worked and he didn’t understand why – starting from scratch would have actually been easier.”Amazon did not respond to questions about the staffers’ workplace critiques about AI use.Workers emphasized they are not against AI outright, rather they want it to be developed sustainably and with input from the people building and using it. “I see Amazon using AI to justify a power grab over community resources like water and energy, but also over its own workers, who are increasingly subject to surveillance, work speedups, and implicit threats of layoffs,” said the senior software engineer. “There is a culture of fear around openly discussing the drawbacks of AI at work, and one thing the letter is setting out to accomplish is to show our colleagues that many of us feel this way and that another path is possible.”Explore more on these topicsAmazonArtificial intelligence (AI)E-commerceMetaGoogleMicrosoftAppleShareReuse this content"

The information could have been obtained consensually or it could have been obtained by coercion, manipulation or created using artificial intelligence.Perpetrators can be strangers, suchas sextortion gangs, or someone the child knows, such as a friend or schoolmate. The blackmailer can also demand a range of things in exchange for not sharing information, such as money, more images or staying in a relationship.The NSPCC said its definition of blackmail overlapped with sextortion but included a wider range of scenarios. “We chose the term ‘blackmail’ in our research because it allowed us to include extortion using other types of information that a child might want to keep private (eg their sexuality, images showing them without a religious garment) as well as a range of both sexual and non-sexual demands and threats,” the charity said.The report also advised against “sharenting”, which refers to parents sharing photos of and information about their children online.Experts recommendtelling children what a sextortion threat looks like and being aware of who they are talking to online. They also advise creating everyday opportunities for children to talk to adults, such as during meals together or regular car trips, so that teenagers feel they have a space where they can reveal they have been targeted by blackmail.“Knowing how to talk about online blackmail in an age-appropriate way and creating an environment where children feel safe to come forward without fear of judgment can make all the difference,” said Govender.The NSPCC also interviewed young people about why they might choose not to reveal a blackmail attempt to their parent or carer. The reasons for not disclosing the crime, according to the responses, include feeling embarrassed, preferring to talk to a friend first and feeling they “can handle it themselves”.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetySextortionChildrenYoung peopleInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t need three kinds of carry-on suitcases; I just needone I can rely on for every trip.I started my search for deals by outlining the key items every traveler should own. I also considered the “nice to haves,” or things that have made travel easier for me over the years. Then, I went to work hunting down those specific pieces from reputable retailers and brands – most of which I frequently shop from – and determining if the discounted prices were worthwhile. The ones that made the cut are featured below.At a glance: the very best Black Friday and Cyber Monday travel dealsThe best luggage deal:Away Packing Pro BundleNow $257, originally $343 at AwayThe best travel tech deal:Apple AirTagsNow $62.99, originally at $99 at AmazonThe best travel clothing deal:Forever Fleece Relaxed Crew SweatshirtNow $53.40, originally $89 at AthletaThe best luggage dealsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AwayJUST ADDED: Away Featherlight CrossbodyNow $43, originally $58 at AwayThis is, hands down, one of my favorite luggage items of 2025. The crossbody, which is part of Away’s sitewide sale, is one of those pieces that just make travel easier. I first brought it with me on a trip to Alaska, and it fit everything I needed for daily excursions: snacks, a water bottle, sunscreen, a book and even an extra layer.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJUST ADDED: Wrangler 3–Piece Smart Luggage SetNow $112.18, originally $131.99 at AmazonThere’s something so aesthetically satisfying about traveling with complementary luggage, but you also want each piece to actually be functional. The Wrangler Smart Luggage Set is the best of both worlds. Each suitcase features a built-in cup holder, a USB port and even a phone holder – and they’re designed to expand when you need a bit of extra room. Several stylish colorways are on sale right now, including an olive green and a slate gray.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AntlerAntler Lightest Expandable Carry-On LuggageNow $220, was $275 at AntlerI’m Team Hardside, but I still understand the appeal of softside luggage. A softside suitcase is often lighter and can be expanded when you require extra space. If I were going to invest in this type of bag, I’d definitely go with the Antler Lightest Expandable Carry-On Luggage – a top-rated style that’s compact, durable and designed for convenience (the front pocket is ideal for the items you need easy access to).View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of CuyanaCuyana Classic Easy ToteNow $238.40, was $298 at CuyanaWhen it comes to leather travel bags I know I’ll use forever, I always turn to Cuyana – and I’ve been using the Classic Easy Tote for years. It’s the definition of a timeless piece: stylish, simple and incredibly functional. My favorite part of its design? It can fit my 16-inch laptop, which, as a freelance writer, I never travel without.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonEtronik Overnight Duffel BagNow $19.99, originally $36.99 at AmazonQuick overnight or weekend trips don’t always require a suitcase. Most of the time, you really only need a change of clothes, some pajamas and a small toiletry bag, all of which can fit in the Etronik Overnight Duffel Bag. The weekender has received more than 1,500 five-star reviews, with shoppers praising its pockets, spaciousness and durability. Inside, there’s even a zippered wet bag to hold anything you may want to keep separate (a wet bathing suit, makeup, etc).View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSamsonite Freeform 2-Piece Luggage SetNow $196.34, originally $479.98 at AmazonEven if you’re a self-proclaimed carry-on-only type, it’s still a good idea to have a checked bag at the ready. This luggage set from Samsonite – a carry-on and a large spinner suitcase – covers all your bases. It comes in a variety of colors that will stand out at baggage claim, so you’ll never have to second-guess which luggage is yours. And at 59% off? This is truly one of the best earlyBlack Fridaytravel deals.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of LeatherologyTransit Travel ToteNow $348.75, was $465 at LeatherologyWith the entire Leatherology site currently up to 25% off with code HOLIDAY25, I took the liberty of finding the most useful, marked-down item. You can carry Transit Travel Tote with the long straps or the short straps, and there’s even a hidden trolley pocket that allows you to slide it over your suitcase’s extended handle. What’s more, you can personalize with up to five letters.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of CalpakCalpak Terra 26L Laptop Duffel BackpackNow $158.40, originally $198 at CalpakI started using the Calpak Terra 26L Laptop Duffel Backpack last winter and was immediately blown away by the sheer amount it can comfortably carry. I’d even say it holds as much as my suitcase – and it will still fit underneath the airplane seat. The clamshell opening to a spacious main compartment makes packing a breeze, and the interior compression strap ensures everything stays secure. Part backpack, part duffel – you’re basically getting two bags for one.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AwayAway Packing Pro BundleNow $257, originally $343 at AwayI travel 200,000 miles a year. This is the best travel backpack I can’t leave home withoutRead moreAway is my go-to brand for luggage. I’ve used the Bigger Carry-On for years, and I firmly believe (after trying at least 10 other suitcases) that it holds more than any other carry-on out there. The bundle comes with a set of packing cubes – which are helpful with suitcase organization – so it’s a great starter pack for anyone just beginning their travel journey or those who tend to overpack.Away’s early Black Friday sale means everything from the luggage brand is 25% off, but you’ll want to stay focused on the items with the best cost-per-use. For the everyday traveler, that is the Away Packing Pro Bundle. The set includes the Bigger Carry-On and the Insider Packing Cubes (set of four), two travel essentials that can be used together or separately. Bonus: you can opt to get both in the same color or mix and match.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of RoamRoam Check-In ExpandableNow $545, originally $725 at RoamMake no mistake, high-quality checked suitcases are expensive, so I always recommend waiting to purchase one until it’s on sale. While the Roam Check-In Expandable suitcase is still on the pricier side, it’s the kind of suitcase you only need to buy once. Designed with an expandable feature (a 2in zipper expansion) and compression boards, it’ll comfortably hold between 10 and 13 outfits.The best travel tech and gear dealsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJUST ADDED: European Travel Plug Adapter SetNow $12.66, originally $16.99 at AmazonIs European travel in your future – or maybe you need a practical present for someone heading abroad? If the answer is yes, grab this European travel plug adapter set while it’s on sale (25% off). It comes with one Type-C plug adapter (works for Americans traveling to Germany, Italy, France and Spain, among other countries) and one Type-G mini adapter, which you’d use in the U.K.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonEpicka Universal Travel AdapterNow $17.99, originally $24.99 at AmazonInternational travel requires all sorts of preparation: passports, visas, currency exchange and adapters. I can’t help you too much with the first few, but I can assist with the travel-adapter situation. I’d recommend picking up something like the Epicka Universal Travel Adapter, which ensures you’re covered in 200-plus countries and regions – and it can even charge up to six devices at once.EOS R100 BodyView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of CanonNow $459.99, originally $559.99 at CanonThe Black Friday sale period is one of the best times to find deals on pricier travel pieces – like a nice camera you can bring on a safari or a long-awaited family trip to Europe. The EOS R100 Body is a great option for beginners or amateur photographers; it’s definitely an upgrade from your smartphone, but it’s not the type of technology that will overwhelm you with all of its features.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonVeken Packing Cubes, Set of 8Now $19.99, originally $31.99 at AmazonRegular packing cubes have a slightly different function than compression packing cubes, but they’re still an integral part of any traveler’s arsenal. I like to use a set similar to this one from Veken for organization – T-shirts and tanks in one, socks and undergarments in another, etc. It’s also a good idea to carry an extra packing cube to hold your dirty clothes. If you aren’t totally sure you’ll use packing cubes (although, spoiler alert: you probably will), try out the set in Indigo Teal at nearly 50% off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Filter USFree weekly newsletterA guide to buying fewer, better products.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While wearing them, you can use transparency mode or choose to go full noise canceling, focusing instead on just your music. These are also great for a long flight; a single charge gets you 10 hours of listening, with the use of the charging case, that extends to 45 hours.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAnker 633 Magnetic BatteryNow $35.99, originally $59.99 at AmazonCarrying a portable charger is a non-negotiable for me when I travel. I never know when the charging port on the airplane or in the airport will be defective, and I refuse to arrive at my destination without a fully charged phone. That’s where the Anker 633 Magnetic Battery comes into play. It can recharge your phone about two times, and it’s small enough to be carried in a purse or handbag. Plus, it’s highly rated and marked down by 40% – now’s the time to snag one.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonTrtl Neck PillowNow $41.99, originally $64.99 at AmazonI’m not a fan of the classic bulky travel pillows. In my eyes, they’re simply not worth the hassle of hauling them around the airport. But I still believe in comfort, particularly on red-eye flights. That’s why I’ll frequently tuck this Trtl neck pillow in my personal item bag. It’s light and compact while still providing the proper neck support to get some sleep on the plane. I also love that it’s machine-washable, and I’ll toss it in the laundry after most trips.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonTravel Inspira Luggage ScaleNow $7.80, originally $12.99 at AmazonSearching for a stocking stuffer? The Travel Inspira Luggage Scale is the type of item most people don’t realize is missing in their life until they experience the reassurance that comes with weighing a suitcase before arriving at the airport. You simply loop the weighing belt through your luggage handle and hold it up to get a read. Yes, the sale price saves you a few dollars, but you’ll also never pay an overweight luggage fee again.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJBL Tune 720BT Wireless Over-Ear HeadphonesNow $44.95, originally $89.95 at AmazonAs someone who has lost too many AirPods while in transit, I’m a full headphones convert. This pair from JBL is 50% off and highly rated by thousands of shoppers. If you’re not totally sold on larger headphones but want to give them a try (without splurging on a pricier version), this is the way to go. Not to mention, it comes in a handful of colorways, including purple and blue.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonApple AirTag 4-PackI’m a digital nomad who works on the road. These seven travel gadgets go with me everywhereRead moreNow $62.99, originally at $99 at AmazonThere are certain things you can’t control at the airport – ahem, lost luggage – but you can arm yourself with tech that can track your belongings. Keeping an Apple AirTag in both my checked bag and carry-on gives me peace of mind when I’m making a tight connection or using a transfer service. If you haven’t invested in your own set of AirTags, now is the time.If you went to Apple.com to purchase a four-pack of AirTags right now, you would pay full price. But on Amazon, the nifty tracking devices are under $65. While they’re definitely useful while traveling, AirTags can also do wonders in your daily life: attach one to your keys, throw one in your purse, or slip one in your wallet.The best travel clothing dealsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of LululemonJUST ADDED: Lululemon Men’s Soft Jersey Tapered Pant RegularNow $69, originally $98 at LululemonWinter is the time to make sure your wardrobe has an appropriate amount of comfortable basics, whether you’re wearing them for travel or relaxing days at home. Lululemon’s Black Friday sale includes tons of styles, like the Soft Jersey Tapered Pant, that fit the bill. These are lightweight, stretchy and sweat-wicking, while still having a streamlined, elevated silhouette – AKA the perfect plane pant.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Garnet HillJUST ADDED: Garnet Hill Washable-Cashmere HoodieNow $119.40, originally $199 at Garnet HillI firmly believe that anyone who travels frequently should have a go-to cozy set they can wear on a long-haul or red-eye flight – and Garnet Hill is a great place to start your search. Right now, the brand is offering 40% off cashmere and flannel (plus 30% off everything else), which means you can pick up the incredibly soft Washable-Cashmere Hoodie andmatching joggerswhile they’re marked down.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AyrJUST ADDED: AYR The Deep End ShirtNow $132, originally $165 at AYRMy personal favorite travel-day uniform nearly always includes a plain white, slightly oversized button-down, like this one from AYR. The brand rarely marks down its evergreen styles. Made of 100% cotton, it can be thrown in the wash without losing its shape, and you can wear it with anything. I usually pair mine with breezy linen pants if I’m headed somewhere warm, or straight-leg jeans for a more everyday look.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of SpanxScuba Micro Flare LeggingNow $49, was $118 at SpanxIf I’m boarding a flight longer than a couple of hours, I’ll typically opt to wear leggings. But while I love my athletic leggings as much as the next person, I like to feel a bit more put-together while traveling, so I look for something like the Spanx Scuba Micro Flare Legging (currently $70 off). The scuba fabric is a bit more elevated than your classic polyester blend, and the shaping waistband gives just the right amount of support without being constrictive.Allbirds Tree Runner NZView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AllbirdsMen’s:Now $66, was $110 at AllbirdsWomen’s:Now $66, was $110 at AllbirdsAllbirds’ Black Friday sale, up to 50% off select styles, is your chance to grab a new pair of travel sneakers. The Tree Runner NZ – available in bothmen’sandwomen’s sizes– is made of a light, breathable knit, and the cushioned memory foam will keep your feet happy, even when you’re sprinting through the airport. The shoes are also machine washable, which means you’ll have these in your rotation for many trips to come.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonFitrell Compression Socks, Pack of 3Now $12.99, originally $26.99 at AmazonCompression socks are the type of travel essentials that you don’t want to knock until you try them for yourself. They might not be the most fashionable, but they are extremely functional. This type of footwear is designed to help with joint and muscle stiffness and avoid any blood pooling in your feet – all of which can happen if you sit still for too long on a plane.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of La LigneTerry Colby SweatpantNow $61.25 originally $175 at La LigneI wear a lot of La Ligne – a brand that almost never goes on sale, but just launched its only sale of the year. I’m all for being comfortable on a plane, but I also like to arrive to my destination looking somewhat put-together. The Terry Colby Sweatpant immediately stood out to me as a piece that I, and you, will probably wear for every flight in the foreseeable future.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonWomen’s Pioneer Camp Packable PufferNow $37.76, originally $55.99 at AmazonChoosing outerwear is always one of the hardest parts of packing. The general rule of thumb is to wear your jacket or coat while in transit (so you don’t have to fit it in your suitcase), but sometimes you want to bring an extra layer. In that case, I’ll go with something like the Pioneer Camp Women’s Packable Puffer – a lightweight, water-repellent style that can be packed down into its carrying bag. The timing of the sale is perfect, too; this is the type of piece you need for most winter travel.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AthletaWomen’s Forever Fleece Relaxed Crew SweatshirtNow $53.40, originally $89 at AthletaI’m a firm believer that travel outfits should be both comfortable and presentable. I tend to stick with sweats and loungewear in solid, neutral colors, like the Forever Fleece Relaxed Crew Sweatshirt from Athleta. Not only will it never go out of style, but the dark navy also masks any inevitable travel stains.The Athleta Friday sale – 30% off everything – is incredibly tempting for those who live inathleisure, but don’t go crazy just yet. Instead, only invest in the pieces that deserve a coveted spot in your suitcase. This cotton crewneck sweatshirt is machine-washable (a crucial trait for travel clothing) and comes in a ton of solid, neutral colors. Read: it will work for most, if not all, of the trips you have on your calendar.Lydia Mansel is a travel writer and founder of the travel newsletter Just Packed.

With 70 watts of output, it can handle charging many laptops (check the label on yours) with capacity to spare for a phone on the additional USB outlets. Six styles of retractable prongs work in 200 different countries, and it works as a pass-through plug converter, too.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAmazon Fire HD 10 tabletNow $69.99, originally $139.99 at AmazonWhether I’m reading or watching a movie, the Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet has a beautiful screen and just the right amount of power to stream content: you don’t need much computing muscle to turn pages of a book or play back a video. It’s also very durable, so it’s great for coffee table reading. While a Fire tablet isn’t as useful as a full Android tablet, at 50% off it’s still a great deal, even if it only ends up as your Netflix screen to go.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonBlink Outdoor 4 Wireless smart security camera$51.99, originally $129.99 at AmazonSmart cameras typically come with a big trade-off: you need to either run an ugly wire to them or change the battery every couple months. But the Blink Outdoor 4 Wireless camera sidesteps both with a battery that can last up to two years. I’ve had one for about a year so far, and the battery shows no signs of stopping. You can put this camera anywhere it has access to wifi and basically forget it exists, except when you want to see what’s going on in your yard. At 60% off, it’s worth grabbing a few for different parts of the house and yard.The 11 best US Black Friday and Cyber Monday travel deals already taking offRead moreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus$24.99, originally $49.99 at AmazonThe Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K plus remains the single easiest way to turn a regular TV into a smart TV. Just plug it into your TV and a power source, and just like that you have access to streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu, Amazon and Blink camera feeds, and of course Alexa. The ultra-simple remote makes for easy navigation, and has a built-in mic for voice commands (“Hey Alexa, play The Office.”) At 50% off, you can grab one for every TV in the house, or even one to travel with – it’s tiny.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJBL Live Pro 2$89.95, originally $169.95 at AmazonJBL is an iconic name in sound, and the JBL Live Pro 2 are some of my favorite earbuds. They have excellent Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which makes it easier to listen to your music at a lower volume to avoid hearing damage. You also get excellent battery life, at up to 10 hours on a single charge, so these can be a great musical companion for the vibe-coders in your life to blot out the world for hours while they crack on the next big thing. I’d heartily recommend them at full price, so at half-off they’re a no brainer.Home entertainmentView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJUST ADDED: Nex PlaygroundNow $199, originally $249.99 at AmazonThe Nex Playground is like a game console where you’re the controller. A front-facing camera tracks your motion allowing you to interact with elements on the screen, for instance, waving your hands to slash at on-screen targets. After trying it at a trade show, I quickly got one for my own entertainment center. It comes preloaded with five games – my favorite is Starri, a sort of Beat Saber clone that will get your heart rate up.Lock in a year of cheap TV with the best US Black Friday streaming dealsRead moreView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonRoku Streaming Stick HDNow $15, originally $29.99 at AmazonIn a world of algorithms competing to serve you content in increasingly convoluted ways, the Roku interface is refreshingly simple: it’s just a list of apps. That’s it. Even as a technologically literate Gen Xer, I dig that. If you already have a streaming system that works for you, this could still be a good gift for older or less tech-savvy folks in your life. Just set it up with their account logins for Netflix, Hulu, Disney and the like, and they’ll learn the nice, clean interface in no time.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of WalmartHisense 75” Class H5 Series QLEDNow $378, originally $499 at WalmartWe live in an amazing time when you can buy a 75in 4K TV for under $400. This model even uses QLED technology for better color accuracy, which used to be a premium feature just a few years ago. Since it’s a Roku TV, all of your streaming services are at your fingertips right out of the box. This is a one-off model that appears to be exclusive to Walmart, so you won’t find reviews on it, but Hisense is a reputable brand and TVs have matured so much that even budget models hold their own to most eyeballs.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of SamsungSamsung OLED S90F 4K TV$1,399.99, originally $2,499.99 at Samsung (44% off)For color fidelity and contrast, most home theater enthusiasts still turn to OLED screens, but they seldom come cheap. This is a great deal on a high-end example, just one rung below Samsung’s flagship S95F. Gamers will appreciate the 144Hz refresh rate for smoother action, and the AI processor for 4K upscaling means that even older shows and movies will make use of every pixel.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonMeta Quest 3SNow $329, originally $399.99 at AmazonMeta has been leading the way in theVRspace for a decade, and the Meta Quest 3S is the most accessible headset on the market today.

It can fly preprogramed routes to capture the scenery around you or follow you around, dodging obstacles along the way. When I tested this drone, I rode an electric bike for five miles under and around trees, and it kept up beautifully. It’s foldable and fits neatly in a jacket pocket.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSony Bravia Theater Bar 6$498, originally 699.99 at AmazonFew flat-screen TVs come with sufficient built-in sound, and even if yours seems OK, a soundbar takes things to another level. This Bravia Theater Bar 6 comes with a separate subwoofer and two rear-channel speakers to fill your room with sound, and the rear channels are wireless for easier installation. Once you hear it, you will never want to watch TV again without it.How do Apple’s AirPods Pro 3 compare against hearing aids?

Just keep in mind that they only work with iPhones – so check out the Samsung below if you’re on Android. I love the app support in particular, which means I can arm my home security system, order a pizza and get directions all from my wrist.

The speakers are also pretty good for listening on the go without blocking out the world as earbuds do. I use them on bike rides to get that pseudo-GoPro experience, and at trade shows so I don’t miss notifications arriving on my phone while it’s in my pocket.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSeagate Portable 4TB External Hard Driveskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Filter USFree weekly newsletterA guide to buying fewer, better products.Enter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Seagate is a name known for reliable storage space, and while this hard drive isn’t the fastest, when you’re storing backup files, you don’t necessarily need speed. Just don’t use this drive for installing games or editing video files - it’s not built for that, but it’s priced right for cheap bulk storage.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSamsung Galaxy Watch 8Now $249.99, originally $349.99 at AmazonSamsung’s latest smartwatch brings a ton of improvements to your wrist, including totally redesigned software that makes it easier to use. Like most smart watches, it can track your sleep and monitor your heart rate during exercise, but it also performs some unique feats such as measuring antioxidants to help suggest dietary changes, and tracking blood-oxygen levels to flag potential health issues. It all comes wrapped in an attractive package that lasts for almost two days on a charge.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAmazon Fire HD 8 Tablet Plus Standing Cover Bundle$79.98, originally $132.98 at AmazonThe Amazon Fire HD 8 is a slightly smaller version of the aforementioned Amazon Fire Tablet that is better suited totravel. This particular bundle also includes a case with an origami-style leg to prop up the tablet up for watching shows on the go. Like the larger model, it’s mainly a media machine, so imagine it more like a portable TV than a full-fledged tablet. At this price, it’s still well worth it.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra$1,019.99, originally $1,419.99 at AmazonI review phones year-round, and this is the one I go back to when I’m not reviewing anything else. It’s simply one of the best Android smartphones. It has an amazing camera setup great for ultrawide snaps and zooming in to a crazy degree, onboard AI including Gemini Live, epic battery life (easily a day and a half), and a built-in stylus for those times you want precision in your tapping and swiping. This price tag may not seem like much of a discount since the S25 Ultra usually starts at about $1,200, but this is the upgraded model with 512GB storage, which you’re going to want.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSamsung Galaxy S25 FE$534.99, originally $709.99 at Amazon (25%)Samsung’s “fan edition” (FE) devices are designed for buyers who want a flagship phone experience at a lower price point. That means the S25 FE phone has most of the same chops as its larger siblings, including all the same AI tricks, and an impressive triple-camera setup that’s no joke. It’s a great value even at full price, and at 27% off one of the best phone deals out there for Black Friday.Personal audioView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonSHOKZ New OpenRun Pro 2Now $124.95, originally $179.95 at AmazonBone-conduction headphones don’t go in your ears – they sit above the ear and transit crisp, clear audio with a full range of tones by simply vibrating against your head. That means you can still hear everything going on around you, making them ideal for runners. But they’re great for non-runners too – like me! I use them often on bike rides.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonBose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones$199, originally $349 at AmazonBose has been a leader in noise-cancelling headphones for decades, and the QuietComfort series of headphones carry on the legacy. These headphones are great for frequent travelers as they can cancel out the drone of planes, trains, or automobiles, while you enjoy the film Planes, Trains and Automobiles. You don’t often see these headphones at this price, so these would be a great pickup.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonBose QuietComfort Earbuds$129, originally $179 at AmazonIf the traveler in your life doesn’t want to carry a bulky set of over-the-ear headphones (like me), earbuds like these are a great solution. Like their bigger brothers, these offer outstanding active noise cancellation to drown out airplane noise, but they’re also compact and still have good battery life. Since they’re earbuds, they form a great seal in your ear canal, which passively seals out noise even when ANC isn’t active. At this price, these earbuds are hard to resist, especially when compared to their peers at $130.The best Black Friday and Cyber Monday home deals in the US – so farRead moreView image in fullscreenA pair of black Sony WF-1000XM5 EarbudsPhotograph: Courtesy of SonyWF-1000XM5 Earbuds$229.99, originally $329.99 at SonySony headphones are a cut above the rest in terms of sound quality: when I tested the WF-1000XM5, I heard tones in music that I had never heard before. I believe they’re the best-sounding earbuds you can buy, and the Guardian’s reviewerloved them too. Their popularity means Sony seldom needs to discount them, so 30% off is hard to ignore. If you know someone who loves music but still listens with cheap headphones, this will open a whole new world.Smart homeView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of SegwayJUST ADDED: Segway Navimow X315 Robot LawnmowerNow $1,999, originally $2,299 at SegwayThis past summer, I tested nine different robot lawnmowers, including the Navimow X350 – a version of this with a slightly larger battery. I set it up and I never had to mow my lawn for the entire summer. Neither did my elderly neighbor — I set it up to mow his lawn too. The mower uses GPS and a beacon for centimeter-level accuracy to efficiently mow your lawn as often as you want; I set mine to mow three times per week. I named it Ziggy.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJUST ADDED: Skylight 15in Digital CalendarNow $249.99, originally $319.99 at AmazonI never thought I needed a digital calendar until I got one, and now I can’t live without it. Yes, I can always open my phone or laptop to see my Google Calendar, but having it up on my wall is a game changer. The Skylight now occupies a prominent spot in my kitchen, and my whole family has quickly adopted using it. It syncs with most major calendar services, and can also serve as a large photo frame if you want. As someone who lives and dies by his calendar, I leave mine on the calendar view all the time.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonJJUST ADDED: Dwarf 3 Smart TelescopeNow $494.10, originally $549 at AmazonI wouldn’t go so far as to call myself an amateur astronomer, but I love gazing at the stars. The Dwarf Telescope 3 pairs with your phone to track the skye and follow astronomical phenomena, taking long exposures to give you amazing photos. It comes with its own carrying case and it’s so small, I was able to include it in my suitcase on a trip to Hawaii. It can also work during the day as a telephoto camera for wildlife photography.Ignore all the smart home gimmicks.

I particularly enjoy mine because it looks great, and allows me to adjust the temperature in my home (in multiple zones) using my voice or the app. When I do, the thermostat remembers my preferences and integrates them into an automatic schedule. Eventually it just does its thing on its own, and saves you money while you’re at it.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of AmazonAmazon Echo DotNow $31.99, originally $49.99 at AmazonOf all the voice assistants I’ve used (all of them), Alexa is the best, providing fast, accurate answers and controlling your smart home devices just as quickly.

A multicolor bulb like this Kasa model also lets you set the mood with one of 16m colors.

A mesh system uses multiple access points to blanket your home in signal, and automatically switches your devices to the closest one, so you’ll no longer drop Zoom calls when you walk into that one corner of your basement. This system comes with three points, which should be plenty for most homes, but you can easily add more.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Filter USGadgetsSmart homesHeadphonesTelevisionSmartwatchesTablet computersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But with so many websites being shouty about their Black Friday offers, the best buys aren’t always easy to spot. So before you splash the cash, it might pay to do some research – and look closely at the specification.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I know this may not be welcome advice. After all, the thought of drawing up a spreadsheet of memory configurations and pricing history might put a slight dampener on the excitement that builds as Black Friday approaches. But buy the right laptop today and you can look forward to many years of joyful productivity. Pick a duff one, and every time you open the lid you’ll be cursing your past self’s impulsive nature. So don’t get caught out; be prepared with our useful tips – and a roundup of the Filter’s favourite laptop deals.Before you make the jump, also be sure you really need a new laptop withour guide to making the most out of your existing one.How to find a genuinely good Black Friday laptop dealView image in fullscreenFind out what a laptop is really like to use to ensure it’s right for you.Photograph: Oscar Wong/Getty ImagesDon’t sweat the CPUMany people get hung up on processor power, but this is the one thing you rarely need to worry about these days. Although new processor models come out with alarming frequency, almost any AMD Ryzen, Intel Core or Apple M-series chip of the past few years will be fine for everyday web browsing and office tasks. High-end models are only really needed for particularly demanding workloads; a quick trip to Google (or your AI chatbot of choice) will help you see how different processor models measure up.Plan ahead with plenty of RAM and storageEvery laptop needs a decent amount of memory. If the system is starved of RAM, then performance will be sluggish, regardless of the CPU’s speed. While Windows 11 runs acceptably in 8GB, a minimum of 16GB will help ensure that future updates continue to run smoothly. Some models are upgradeable, so you can start with a basic allocation of RAM and add more as your needs grow, but this certainly isn’t something you can take for granted.Laptop storage is also rarely expandable, except by plugging in a USB flash drive or an external SSD. That might be fine if your device will spend much of its time on a desk, but if you want to carry it around with you – not an unreasonable ask for a computer of this type – it’s a drag. So while a base-level 256GB SSD might suffice for home-working, consider stepping up to 512GB or even 1TB of internal storage, especially if you want to edit videos or play big 3D games. Look into battery life, weight and overall dimensions, too, if portability is a priority.Find out what it’s really like to useSome important considerations – such as the quality of the screen and keyboard – don’t show up on the spec sheet, yet these things are arguably just as important as the processor and memory. If the display is dim and blocky, and typing emails feels like pressing Scrabble tiles into a flannel, it will make day-to-day working more difficult.Since online retail doesn’t give you an opportunity to try tapping out “the quick brown fox” for yourself, the next best thing is to read reviews of other people’s hands-on experience. Pay particular attention to the model number, though: laptops often come in a few variants, including a high-end version that will usually get great reviews – and a more cheaply made model that can be flogged for a knock-down price on Black Friday.Is this a genuine special offer?The final thing to check is whether the bargain that’s flashing up on your screen is actually a deal at all. You can look up past prices for a vast range of items by going toCamelCamelCamel– yes, really – and either typing in a laptop model number or pasting in the web address of an Amazon product page. You may find that the heavily promoted Black Friday price is identical to last month’s standard price on Amazon. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad deal, but it signals that you probably don’t need to race to grab a once-in-a-lifetime bargain (we’ve made sure to list this price history on all the laptop deals below).Indeed, with Cyber Monday, pre- and post-Christmas sales, Easter specials, Amazon Prime Day, back-to-school offers and so forth, you’re rarely more than a few weeks away from the next big discount event – so don’t let the excitement of Black Friday encourage you into making a hasty purchase.Darien Graham-SmithFor more, read the Filter’s roundup of thebest Black Friday dealsQ&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best Black Friday laptop deals in 2025A decent ChromebookView image in fullscreenAsus CX34 Chromebook Plus£299 at CurrysThe CX34 provides a palatable, lightweight computing experience for a reasonable price in this Currys deal.

It’s sleek, portable and stylish, although it lacks ports, so you may need to pick up a cheap USB-C adapter to supplement. The 13.6in Liquid Retina screen is sharp and detailed, while 18 hours of battery life is sure to keep you up and running for a couple of working days away from the mains.Price history:this is the lowest ever price.A top-end MacBook AirView image in fullscreenApple MacBook Air M4 13in£849 at Amazon£849 at CurrysThe current flagship MacBook Air has dropped back to its lowest ever price for Black Friday, complete with its capable M4 chip inside.

Otherwise, this is the same modern MacBook Air we know and love, with a dazzling Liquid Retina screen and up to 18 hours of battery life.

It benefits from clever software integrations such as the Photo Eraser editing trickery seen on Pixel phones, Offline File Sync for accessing Google Docs and so on offline, and Google Meet effects such as auto-framing and background blur.Price history:this is the best price at the moment – but it was lower earlier this Black Friday in a deal that’s now expired.A respectable Arm-based choiceView image in fullscreenAsus Vivobook 14£449.99 at John LewisThis Asus Vivobook 14 model is a compact and potent choice that won’t break the bank. Its Snapdragon X processor provides enough power for basic tasks and enables 19 hours of battery life per charge.

It has everything you could want from a modern laptop: a compact 14in 1,920 x 1,200 OLED screen for dazzling results; an eight-core Snapdragon X Plus chip for zippy performance; and excellent battery life – Lenovo says the laptop can last for up to 20 hours or so on a charge, providing all-day working and then some. For multitasking and intensive tasks, 16GB of RAM provides plenty of headroom, while a 512GB SSD is fine for storage at this price.Price history:this was briefly cheaper in the summer.A powerful and portable ultrabookView image in fullscreenAsus Zenbook 14£999.99 at AmazonThis Asus Zenbook 14 is a very capable choice. The Intel Core Ultra 9 285H processor with its 16 cores means it will be able to handle any tasks you throw at it, and 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD provide lots of capacity for multitasking and dealing with heavier, creative workloads. Elsewhere, the 14in 3K OLED screen is bright and delivers good detail, and a weight of just 1.2kg makes the Asus super portable. There’s a decent selection of ports, too –and its dark-blue chassis oozes class.If you don’t necessarily need the power of the Core Ultra 9 285H, and you’re happy with a slightly lower-end Core Ultra 7 model (which performs quite similarly in some tests) with 16GB of RAM, then that model is £799 from John Lewis, too.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A Zenbook with a high-resolution displayView image in fullscreenAsus Zenbook S 16 OLED£1,229.99 at AmazonThe Asus Zenbook S 16 OLED is one of the most complete ultrabooks you can buy today, making no real sacrifices anywhere. The star of the show is the gorgeous 16in, 3K-resolution screen, which delivers superb detail and general sharpness. On the inside sits a 12-core Ryzen AI R9 HX 370 processor, alongside 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. There’s a decent set of ports and the casing is made from the same innovative ceraluminum material as the Zenbook A14 above, meaning it’s durable and stylish, too.Price history:this is its lowest ever price, and it’s cheaper than lower-spec deals on the same laptop.A high-spec touchscreen LenovoView image in fullscreenLenovo Yoga Slim 7x£799 at CurrysThis Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x option provides a very rich set of specs for the price. The 12-core Snapdragon X Elite processor delivers both in terms of performance and efficiency, with the laptop rated to last for up to 24 hours on a single charge. Add to this a decent 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.Its compact 3K-resolution OLED screen displays plenty of detail in a smaller space, and up to 500 nits of brightness means images are sharp and vibrant. The Yoga Slim is also a touchscreen, giving you the flexibility to use it for more creative or design-type tasks. Go for the blue colourway to add some style to your workspace.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A portable Asus laptopView image in fullscreenAsus Vivobook S 14£549 at AmazonThe Asus Vivobook S 14’s portable form factor houses an eight-core AMD Ryzen 9 270 processor, plus 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, and should prove ample for general work tasks, whether at home or on the move. The 14in 1,920 x 1,200-resolution IPS panel might not be an OLED, but it’s still perfectly capable for what this laptop is designed for. The port selection here is also pretty good, providing decent connectivity for most people’s needs.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A well-priced Lenovo laptopView image in fullscreenLenovo IdeaPad Slim 5£469.99 at AmazonThis Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 is a slightly older variant of the one above, arriving with a larger 16in, 1,920 x 1,200-resolution IPS screen, as opposed to that model’s 14in OLED. The eight cores and 12 threads of the Intel Core i5-13420H processor here deliver solid productivity performance, with room to step up to more intense workloads if the need arises. Elsewhere, 16GB of RAM and a capacious 1TB SSD are excellent for the price, plus there’s a decent port selection that includes USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, a microSD reader and more besides.Price history:this matches its lowest ever price.A slim ultrabook with an OLED displayView image in fullscreenAcer Swift X 14 AI£1,199.99 at AmazonThe Acer Swift X 14 AI is a slim and powerful ultrabook, featuring a dazzling 14in 2,880 x 1,800 OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth and responsive on-screen action. Its AMD Ryzen 7 AI 350 processor can handle anything from productivity tasks to more intensive work, with Nvidia’s RTX 5050 GPU stepping up where extra graphical horsepower is required. Elsewhere, the port count includes USB-C, USB-A, microSD and HDMI, all present in a chassis that’s less than 20mm thick and 1.57kg in weight.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A lightweight LG laptopView image in fullscreenLG Gram Pro 17Z90TR£1,669.99 at AmazonLG’s Gram laptops have long been lightweight and slender choices in their size classes, and this 17in model is no exception, weighing in at just 1.479kg. It’s also just 14.5mm thick, but maintains a decent port selection with Thunderbolt 4-capable USB-C ports, USB-A and HDMI options.The 17-inch 2.5K resolution screen with 144Hz refresh rate is zippy and responsive, thanks to an Nvidia RTX 5050 paired with a powerful Intel Core Ultra 7 255H processor. In spite of this power, LG says this laptop will last for up to 27 hours on a charge, giving you several days of work away from the mains.Price history:this is a match for its lowest ever price.A larger-screen Windows laptop for under £500View image in fullscreenAsus Vivobook 16 X1605VA£479.99 at AmazonFor a larger-screen Windows laptop for productivity tasks and the odd bit of more intensive work, this Asus Vivobook 16 is perfect. Performance is decent, thanks to a 10-core Intel Core 7-150U processor, plus 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for your storage needs. The 16-inch 1,920 x 1,200 IPS screen is pretty standard at this price, but a lay-flat hinge makes this laptop great for collaborative working. You also benefit here from a full-size keyboard, while USB-C, USB-A, HDMI and a headphone jack make up the port count.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An upgrade on the Acer aboveView image in fullscreenAcer Aspire 14 AI£699.99 at AmazonThe Acer Aspire 14 AI is different to the model above: it comes running an eight-core AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 chip, with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, rather than the Arm-based Snapdragon processor. Display-wise, you get a 14in 1,920 x 1,200 OLED panel that delivers deeper blacks and stronger contrast and colour accuracy, and a good selection of ports. This model is a little more expensive than the other version, but I’d argue the expense is justified.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A lightweight 16in laptopView image in fullscreenLG Gram Pro 16Z90TS£1,029.99 at Amazon£1,149 at CurrysIn keeping with the portable laptop theme, this LG Gram Pro 16Z90TS provides one of the lightest 16in laptops you’ll find, delivering a good selection of ports and solid performance, with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Intel’s Core Ultra 7 256V processor with eight cores and eight threads, plus its potent integrated graphics, provide enough oomph for both basic workloads and more intensive tasks. It’s a shame the 16in 2.5K 144Hz panel isn’t OLED; but it’s a decent IPS screen – it’s responsive and delivers good detail. Lasting for up to 25.5 hours on a charge, you’ll get a few days away from the mains.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.The best Windows MacBook Pro alternativeView image in fullscreenAsus ProArt P16 (2025)£2,279.99 at AmazonThe Asus ProArt P16 (2025) is a creative’s dream, providing one of the most compelling Windows alternatives to a MacBook Pro. This RTX 5070 variant isn’t lacking in power for everything from video and photo editing to gaming, especially when paired with a AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor. There’s also a generous 64GB of RAM and 2TB SSD.The real kicker with this ProArt laptop is the display: a 16in 4K (3,840 x 2,400) 120Hz OLED screen that’s one of the best on the market for detail, clarity and generally sharp images – and I also found it pretty bright in my testing. There’s one of the best port selections out there, plus a comfortable keyboard, huge trackpad and stylish chassis. You are paying out for it, but this is a really excellent laptop.Price history:this is the best ever price for this model.The best gaming laptop dealsAn adequate 1080p gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Nitro V15£849.99 at AmazonThe Acer Nitro V15 is a respectable affordable gaming laptop and it’s dropped to its lowest price. It features a solid core for Full HD gaming, pairing Nvidia’s modest RTX 5060 GPU with a decently potent Intel Core i7-13620H processor. That might not be the latest in Team Blue’s catalogue, but it’s still capable, with 10 cores and 16 threads. Elsewhere, there’s a 15.6in Full HD IPS screen for solid detail, plus a 165Hz refresh rate for slick motion. There’s not too much of a gamer aesthetic, and there’s a solid set of ports, with everything from Ethernet for wired networking to USB-A and USB-C for expansion. The 1TB SSD is generous at this price.Price history:this is the best ever price by £50.An Asus ROG for lessView image in fullscreenAsus ROG Strix G16£1,599 at AO£1,599 at VeryAsus’s ROG gaming laptops typically carry a premium, but this Strix G16 is one of the cheapest RTX 5070 Ti-powered gaming machines available right now. Pairing it with a 16-core AMD Ryzen 9 7940HX processor will yield very capable gaming performance at this laptop’s native 1,920 x 1,200 resolution.The display also has a 165Hz refresh rate for more responsive onscreen action. Modern AAA games can be a storage hog, but the 1TB SSD means there’s enough headroom for a good few here, while 16GB of RAM is enough for gaming loads.Price history:not available, but cheaper than the closest equivalent on Amazon.A mid-range gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Nitro V16 AI£1,089.99 at Amazon£1,099 at VeryAcer’s Nitro V16 is a strong mid-range gaming laptop, especially in this spec, which pairs an RTX 5070 graphics card with AMD’s eight-core Ryzen AI 7 350 processor. The setup delivers solid performance at 1080p and the laptop’s native 2,560 x 1,600 resolution – although the higher resolution may benefit from reduced settings and some upscaling. A 180Hz refresh rate makes for a smooth and responsive panel, and the laptop comes with a well-rounded port selection, too. Acer rounds off the package with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A sub-£1,000 gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAsus V16£799 at AmazonAt £799, the Asus V16 is quite a feature-rich gaming laptop, as long as you don’t mind its modest 1080p display. The 10-core, 16-thread Intel Core 7 240H processor paired with an RTX 5060 laptop GPU brings solid performance to the table, alongside the powers of Nvidia’s DLSS4 upscaler and the multi-frame-gen tech, if you want it. The 16GB of RAM will be good to run most modern games, with the 1TB SSD generous for storage. All of this helps to drive a large, 16in, 1,920 x 1,200-resolution, 144Hz-refresh-rate screen for a solid blend of detail and responsiveness. An array of USB-C, USB-A, HDMI ports and more deliver decent connectivity, too.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A decent laptop for 1080p gamingView image in fullscreenHP Victus 15-fb2008na£899.99 at John LewisIf you’re after a decent gaming machine for 1080p duties, then this HP Victus 15-fb2008na model packs a punch for a decent price. It might feature the latest components inside, but it’s one of the better budget gaming laptops out there, pairing an RTX 4060 GPU with a six-core AMD Ryzen 5 8645HS processor.There’s a 15.6in Full HD 144Hz IPS screen, plus 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Connectivity is very capable for the price, too, with USB-As, USB-C, HDMI, wired Ethernet and an SD card reader.Price history:this is the best price for this model, although Amazon doesn’t stock it.A gaming laptop with heaps of styleView image in fullscreenAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2025)£1,999.99 at John LewisAsus’s gaming laptops carry a bit of a premium, and arguably none more so than its Zephyrus line. This is Asus’ most stylish set of laptops, pairing beefy internals for gaming grunt with a compact, suave chassis. In this example, there’s an RTX 5070 GPU and an AMD Ryzen 9 270 processor, plus 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. That’s a good core for playing games at both 1080p and 1440p. The display here is a dazzling 14in 3K (or 2,880 x 1,800) 120Hz OLED screen for sublime detail, clarity and smooth motion, plus we’ve got a slim and slender chassis for such a powerful laptop that has a good set of ports. It includes a pair of USB-C ports, plus two USB-As, HDMI and more.Price history:£50 off the best price ever from Amazon.A high-performance gaming laptopView image in fullscreenAlienware 18 Area-51£2,899 at Amazon£2,998.99 at DellIf it’s averycapable gaming laptop you’re after, this Alienware 18 Area-51 is one of the strongest options you’ll find. A 24-core Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX and Nvidia’s second-in-command RTX 5080 laptop GPU deliver the goods for gaming on its huge 18in QHD+ resolution screen. The IPS panel here is strong, too, with its super-high 300Hz refresh rate bringing impeccable motion handling. There’s 32GB of DDR5 RAM and a generous 2TB SSD. Sporting Alienware’s classic space-age looks, you’ll need some muscle if you plan to use it on the move – this laptop is big and bulky; but the extra room also means it arrives with an enviable set of ports.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An attractive Acer laptopView image in fullscreenAcer Predator Helios Neo 16 AI£1,599.99 at AmazonThe Acer Predator Helios Neo 16 AI is one of the best value gaming laptops in its price class – but it’s become an even stronger proposition with a £300 price cut. On the inside beats an RTX 5070 Ti GPU alongside the same beefy Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor as the Alienware option above to handle the most demanding of games on its 16-inch, 2,560 x 1,600-resolution screen. The panel’s 240Hz refresh rate delivers smooth motion, plus you also get 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Those looking for style as well as substance won’t be disappointed, as the Acer is quite a looker compared to other gaming behemoths out there. If price-to-performance is the name of the game, this is a candidate for the best we’ve seen this Black Friday so far.Price history:this is its lowest ever price, although it was only 1p more for a period in September.Reece BithreyFor more:How to shop smart this Black FridayHow to avoid bad Black Friday TV dealsThe best Black Friday dealsThe best Black Friday beauty dealsThe best Black Friday deals under £50Explore more on these topicsLaptopsThe FilterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here we round up some of the best TV deals in this year’sBlack Friday sales, before giving detailed advice on what to look out for.Q&AHow is the Filter covering Black Friday?ShowAt the Filter, we believe in buying sustainably, and the excessive consumerism encouraged by Black Friday doesn’t sit easily with us. However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best 4K TV deals this Black FridayA highly capable TVView image in fullscreenHisense U7Q Pro Mini LED, 55in£429 (was £999) at AmazonThis very feature-rich 55in Hisense U7Q Pro model has a searingly bright Mini LED panel, and supports up to 4K/144Hz gaming with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro VRR and ALLM support over its HDMI 2.1 ports. The built-in speakers support Dolby Atmos for more immersive audio, and it even has a built-in subwoofer to provide stronger bass extension. HDR support is great, with Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10+ and HDR10 – it seems HLG is missing. This is one of the best sets of specs we’ve seen for the £429 asking price, though.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A new low on a top-class Fire TVView image in fullscreenAmazon Fire Omni QLED, 50in£299 (was £649) at AmazonThis capable 50in tellyoffers a very solid performance for the money. It supports a full complement of HDR standards, with Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10+ Adaptive, HDR 10 and HLG. It’s a QLED with capable local dimming, so images are vibrant with a good amount of depth. If it’s a gaming TV you’re after, this probably isn’t the best choice: there’s one HDMI 2.1 eARC port and three HDMI 2.0 ports, and the refresh rate is limited to 60Hz. Nonetheless, with Amazon’s Fire TV smart stuff built in, this is a good TV for the price.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A budget 4K TVView image in fullscreenAmazon Fire TV 4-Series, 55in£289.99 at AmazonAmazon’s own budget 4K TV has dropped to its lowest price ever for Black Friday Week, and is a decent offer for its modest price tag. This deal is on the mid-size 55in model, which provides good detail alongside decent HDR support with HDR10 and HLG supported. It’s a smart TV, and uses Amazon’s Fire system, which will be familiar to anyone who owns a Fire Stick – it’s like having one built in to your telly, providing access to streaming apps and Amazon’s Prime Video service at the touch of a button.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A cheaper, smaller Fire TV optionView image in fullscreenTCLPF650K, 43in£187 at AmazonThis 43in 4K TCL TV is at its best price in a few months. As has become common for TCL’s TVs, it punches above its weight in terms of specs, supporting Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos audio with its built-in speakers. It also has three HDMI ports, with support for HDMI 2.1 with ALLM and VRR for gaming. It maxes out at 60Hz, though, so if you’re looking specifically for a gaming TV there are better choices on this list.Price history:this is its lowest ever price. It was discounted in July, but only to £199.An affordable 55in TVView image in fullscreenHisense A6Q LED, 55in£299 at Argos£299 at AmazonFor such an affordable mid-sized TV, this Hisense A6Q ticks most of the boxes, with a 4K resolution and a pleasant complement of HDR standards (Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG) that can provide vivid highlights in supported content. Freely is built in to provide access to live and on-demand TV out of the box, with no aerial or set-top box required. For gaming, there’s support for Auto Low Latency Mode, although the refresh rate tops out at 60Hz (120Hz or higher is preferable for smoother onscreen action with recent consoles). Connectivity is limited to three HDMI 2.1 ports.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A bargain TCL TVView image in fullscreenTCL C6KSQD-Mini LED, 50in£349 at Argos£349 at AmazonThe TCL C6KS seems too good to be true, packed with higher-end features at a bargain-basement price. It’s a modest 50 inches, but its Mini LED panel is bright and sharp with 160 dimming zones, allowing for surprisingly vibrant and saturated images for a television at this price point. Its new HVA panel helps in providing more depth to its overall images, top. For this price, the fact that it supports HLG, HDR10, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision is excellent. Many TVs several times more expensive can’t say that.Gaming performance is fine – it’ll do up to 4K/60Hz with VRR and ALLM – although the lack of higher-refresh-rate output means it isn’t optimal for powerful home consoles or PCs. In terms of connectivity, there are three HDMI ports, one of which supports eARC to hook up a soundbar or speakers for improved audio. The Onkyo-branded system with this TV is surprisingly detailed, though – you may be able to get away with using it for some time before feeling the need to upgrade to separate speakers.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A quality Sony TV for a low priceView image in fullscreenSony Bravia KD55X75WL, 55in£499 at AmazonWhile this isn’t Sony’s latest and greatest option, it’s a quality telly for a great price. It’s a moderate size that should be good for most rooms, and HDR support is reasonable, with HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision all supported.This Sony TV also comes with four HDMI ports for inputs, plus support for eARC to connect a soundbar or supported speakers. For gaming, it has ALLM, a custom screen size setting, a black equaliser and an onscreen crosshair – features more commonly seen in monitors than TVs.Smart TV duties are handled by the familiar Google TV OS, providing good access to smart apps, and it bundles in 15 credits of Sony Pictures Core and a 24-month streaming package.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An affordable TV for gamingView image in fullscreenTCLT8C, 55in£356.73 at Amazon£357 at HughesThis is an excellent value pick if you’re after a TV for gaming. It features four HDMI ports, with two that support full 4K/144Hz HDMI 2.1 output, making it ideal to pair with a games console or living-room PC. It also supports VRR and ALLM for the most optimal experience. This screen also has rich HDR support – supporting Dolby Vision, HLG, HDR10 and HDR10+ – and it has a decent Onkyo-tuned Atmos-capable speaker setup. For well under £400, this feels like quite a steal.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A bright Mini LED TVView image in fullscreenHisense U7Q ProMini LED, 65in£899 at John Lewis£899 at CurrysThis large, feature-rich Mini LED TV looks like a capable option for everything from games to films.There’s a rich set of HDR support (Dolby Vision and Dolby Vision IQ, plus HDR10+, HDR10 and HLG) and the Mini LED screen allows for some serious depth and searing brightness (Hisense claims a peak brightness of 2,000 nits).The integrated speakers provide up to 50W of power and support Dolby Atmos and DTS:X surround standards. There are different sound modes to dig into, too, as well as different picture modes, so you can optimise image quality as you wish.It has four HDMI 2.1 ports with full support for 4K/120Hz gaming, so will play nicely with modern games consoles (and if you’re a PC gamer looking for a living-room monitor, you’ll be glad to know that refresh rate can be overclocked further up to 165Hz). Support for variable refresh rate and ALLM further enhances the gaming experience.Price history:not available, but this is its lowest ever price at Currys.An entry-level LG OLED for lessView image in fullscreenLG B5OLED, 55in£686.99 (including membership cost) at AO£899 at AmazonLG’s B5 OLED is the most affordable entry in the brand’s 2025 OLED lineup, adding a new processor, improved connectivity and an updated UI to last year’s B4 model.It comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports with full support for 4K/120Hz output, and also offers VRR and ALLM for gaming. In terms of HDR, the B5 supports Dolby Vision IQ, Dolby Vision, HDR10, HLG and Cinema HDR, offering impactful highlights in supported content.

It provides you with plenty of screen real estate and Philips’ own TitanOS smart system for accessing smart TV apps.There is decent HDR support for such an affordable television, with HDR10 and HLG, plus compatibility with HDR10+, and it has three HDMI ports – one of which is an eARC port for soundbars. It also supports HDMI VRR and ALLM for gaming. With this in mind, though, its maximum refresh rate is 60Hz rather than 120Hz. Its 20W speakers also have Atmos support.What’s unique about Philips TVs is the presence of the company’s Ambilight system, which provides atmospheric lighting on the rear of the unit that projects on to the surface behind it.

It means this telly provides sublime image quality. HDR support consists of HDR10, HDR10+ and HLG; Samsung still isn’t supporting Dolby Vision.The four HDMI 2.1 ports are welcome, and offer support for proper 4K/120Hz gaming, with up to 144Hz for PC gaming. There is also support for variable refresh and ALLM, alongside Samsung’s Game Hub menu.Price history:this is its lowest ever price at Amazon.Sony’s best OLED TVView image in fullscreenSony Bravia 8 IIQD-OLED, 65in£2,199 at John Lewis£2,199 at CurrysSony’s Bravia 8 II is one of the best TVs currently available – with a price to match. The QD-OLED panel is 25% brighter than on the A95L model it replaces, with even sharper picture quality, not least with HDR enabled. There’s support for Dolby Vision, HLG and HDR10, and claimed peak brightness is a searing 4,000 nits.The Acoustic Surface Audio+ speaker system is widely well reviewed, providing surprisingly solid audio for a set of TV speakers. Gaming support is strong, too, with 4K/120Hz input supported over HDMI 2.1, plus VRR and ALLM. There’s even an ‘optimised for PS5’ mode that automatically optimises the TV’s settings when it detects that the PlayStation is plugged in. Unlike Samsung and LG’s flagships, however, there are only two HDMI 2.1 ports here (one of which is an eARC, if you did want to connect a soundbar).Price history:this is its lowest ever price.An LG mid-range TV for a little cheaperView image in fullscreenLG C5OLED, 55in£929.99 (including membership cost) at AOLG’s latest mid-range C-series model OLED offers an improved operating system and a new processor over last year’s C4. The new processor helps it to better upscale content to 4K than previous models, too, which is handy if you watch a lot of older and lower-definition content.There are four HDMI 2.1 ports for 4K/144Hz gaming (or up to 4K/120Hz on consoles), with VRR and ALLM supported on all of them. HDR support comes in the form of HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision, and this 55in model benefits from LG’s Evo panel for even stronger brightness.As you’d expect from an LG OLED, it comes with dazzling image quality with inky blacks, sublime contrast and wonderfully accurate colours that make viewing everything from games to movies a pleasure.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.A great mid-range Sony OLEDView image in fullscreenSony Bravia 8A OLED, 55in£1,169 at Amazon£1,299 at John LewisThe Sony Bravia 8A was initially more expensive than the standard Bravia 8, but as pricing has settled, this A variant has become a more compelling choice. One of Sony’s 2024 TV models, it comes with an OLED panel that it claims is 10% brighter than its predecessor. HDR support comes in with Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG (no HDR10+). It also comes with Sony’s AI-enabled Bravia XR processor inside, plus the same Acoustic Surface Audio+ sound system for surprisingly decent audio. The Google TV operating system also provides a familiar experience.As an OLED, image quality looks to be rather excellent, and gamers should be decently happy with HDMI 2.1 support for 4K/120Hz output with VRR and ALLM. As with the other Bravia above, this comes with the caveat that HDMI 2.1 is supported on only two of this TV’s four HDMI inputs.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.The small 42in smart OLED TVView image in fullscreenLG C5OLED, 42in£764 at Amazon£849 at ArgosThis 42in TV is the most compact OLED you can buy in the current LG range, making it a dead cert if you’ve got a smaller room like me, or want to use this TV as a super-size monitor.There are four HDMI 2.1-enabled ports with 4K/144Hz capability (and up to 120Hz on consoles), plus VRR and ALLM support for gaming. There’s also solid HDR support with HDR10, Dolby Vision and HLG. LG’s new webOS 25 brings small upgrades, such as the ability to hide apps on the front screen, and it’s a reasonable smart TV system to use every day.It also comes with a new AI Magic Remote with what LG calls ‘AI buttons’ – voice controls and drag-and-drop functions.Price history:this is its lowest ever price.The surprising Mini LED standout 65in TVView image in fullscreenTCL C7KQD-Mini LED, 65in£749 at CurrysTCL has become known for its more affordable, feature-rich televisions in recent years. The C7K is a shining example of this, providing excellent image quality at a modest price point for its 65in size. A particular highlight is its fantastic black levels, contrast and dynamic range, helped along by a bright QD-Mini LED panel with 1,008 dimming zones and a claimed peak brightness of up to 2,600 nits.It also has a full complement of HDR support, with HLG, HDR10, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision for impactful highlights. Gaming support is great, with two out of the four HDMI ports supporting 4K/144Hz HDMI 2.1 powers with VRR and ALLM. Plus, if you’re willing to drop the resolution down to Full HD from 4K, it can double the refresh rate to 288Hz. That’s a feature more typically found on a PC monitor than a TV, but if you have a powerful PC connected and want to maximise performance in high-refresh-rate games, then the C7K should allow you to do so.This new model also adds in a Bang & Olufsen stereo with 60W of power, replacing TCL’s previous collaboration with Onkyo, as well as support for Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundtracks.If you’re after an even bigger screen, the 75in version is£948 at AmazonandAO.Price history:it’s only £40 cheaper than it’s been at Currys all month, but it’s still its lowest ever price.A big-screen LG OLEDView image in fullscreenLG C4OLED, 77in£1,799 at AmazonLast year’s mid-range LG OLED, the C4 was the first LG C-series OLED to support native 4K/144Hz output over its four HDMI 2.1 ports – a boon for gamers. It also brings proper Nvidia G-Sync certification for one of its supported VRR standards.The presence of webOS 24 brings benefits such as a built-in Chromecast for easy wireless casting right out of the box, and the Alpha 9 processor brings AI smarts to enhance the clarity of onscreen dialogue and to bring even more channels of virtual surround sound. The internal 40W speakers have Atmos support to provide more cinematic audio in supported content.Price history:this is higher than it was during Prime Day – but only by 2p.Reece BithreyBlack Friday TV deals: what to look out for – and how to avoid the bad onesView image in fullscreenSteer clear of the bargain aisle if you want your new TV to make a statement.Photograph: Pressmaster/Getty ImagesDesign is importantDesign counts. If you want that new TV to be a statement in your living space, stay clear of the bargain aisle – that’s where you’ll find cookie-cutter designs with flimsy plastic pedestal stands. If you’re not wall mounting, pay particular attention to the feet. Are they placed close to each edge? On a TV 55 inches and larger, that could mean you’ll also have to factor in new furniture just to accommodate it.Central pedestal stands are always the easiest to live with, and some models also have a swivel so that you can angle the screen to best suit your seating. It’s a little bonus well worth having.Think about when you’ll use itAre you buying a TV for everyday use, or do you hanker after a special screen for movies? If it’s the latter, buying an OLED will generally be your best bet. Unlike LED-based TVs, there’s no need for a backlight, because OLED pixels are self-emitting. This means when you dim the lights, black levels stay nice and inky and shadow detail is retained, giving your pictures cinematic depth. Conversely, LED models (be they LCD LED, QLED or Mini LED) tend to look their best in rooms with ambient light, and therefore make better daytime TVs.Connectivity countsDon’t just look at the front. The cheapest TVs you’ll see during the Black Friday sales will only offer three HDMI inputs at the back. This may be fine if you don’t plan on connecting much equipment, but it could prove limiting in the long term. Cheap televisions tend to offer poor audio, so one of those HDMI ports will probably be assigned to a soundbar. That just leaves two to share between games consoles, set-top boxes and Blu-ray/DVD players.View image in fullscreenMaximise gaming performance by playing at a higher refresh rate.Photograph: simpson33/Getty ImagesConsider what you need for gamingIf you plan to play video games on your new set, check to see if those HDMIs support a 120Hz high refresh rate. If you own a PlayStation 5 or current Xbox, you can maximise performance (and therefore improve your chances of winning against your mates) by playing at a higher refresh rate. These 120Hz-capable TVs also tend to offer VRR (variable refresh rate) and ALLM (auto low latency mode), acronyms that add to the gaming experience.Incidentally, if you buy a Sony Bravia, there’s a good chance it will also have PS Remote Play, meaning you can enjoy your PlayStation console while it’s not even in the same room as the TV.Of course, you can always play games on standard 60Hz TVs, and if you have an older console or just like casual family games, you’ve nothing to worry about.Don’t avoid last year’s modelsMany TV makers use Black Friday to offer cheap deals on older stock, to clear inventory. This is where you really can grab a killer deal, particularly at the mid-to-higher end of the market.For example, a 2024 LG OLED C5 55in screen has a sale price of £1,199. The 2025 G5 OLED, also on sale, still commands a premium of £1,599. Last year’s top models will still impress 12 months after release.Buying a well-reviewed older TV is almost always better than buying a newer model that’s been stockpiled to shift in volume during the sales.Not all HDR is worth havingIt’s worth bearing in mind that not all HDR (high dynamic range) TVs are created equal. While every 4K model sporting a Black Friday price tag will boast HDR compatibility, there can be huge differences in performance. Entry-level screens – typically those 50in models selling for little more than £200 – will invariably lack the brightness to make HDR programmes really shine. Indeed, in their attempt to make HDR details (such as bright street lights, fireworks, explosions and so on) pop, the rest of the show can look unnaturally dark. These HDR ‘lite’ TVs are actually better suited to non-HDR programmes, such as regular SDR (standard dynamic range) channels on Freeview, rather than streams from Netflix and Co.The good news is that HDR performance improves dramatically from the mid-range upwards, and is a real differentiator at the posh end of the market.Be aware also that HDR comes in different flavours. In addition to standard HDR10, there’s HDR10+, Dolby Vision and cleverly ‘Adaptive’ versions of each on top, able to react to the light levels in your living room. Film fans favour screens that offer Dolby Vision, but not every brand has it. Samsung is the most prominent outlier.Sound adviceFinally, listen out for audio. It’s a fact that thin, inexpensive TVs generally tend to sound awful. They lack bass and become painful when you crank the volume. But there are exceptions that could save you from shelling out on a soundbar.Samsung QLED TVs boasting object tracking sound (OTS) offer far better audio than you might expect, and tend to have innovative processing that can enhance dialogue and combat extraneous noise, making them great for family use. Meanwhile, Sony OLED TVs have a clever Acoustic Surface Audio sound system, which uses actuators on the rear of the OLED panel to produce impressive high-fidelity audio. And if you want the full home theatre audio enchilada, Panasonic’s best sets have a full 360-degree sound system with front, side and up-firing speakers tuned by sister brand Technics, able to produce convincing Dolby Atmos cinema sound.And here’s a closing tip. Even if your Black Friday bargain TV doesn’t have decent sound onboard, check to see if it passes a Dolby Atmos signal out over the e-ARC HDMI connection, because you can always add a great-sounding Dolby Atmos soundbar during the January sales.Steve MayFor more:How to shop smart this Black FridayHow to avoid bad Black Friday laptop dealsThe best Black Friday dealsThe best Black Friday beauty dealsThe best Black Friday deals under £50Explore more on these topicsThe FilterThe FilterTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The original Outer Worlds dazzled our eyeballs with its art nouveau palette and charmed our ears with witty dialogue, sucking us into a classic mystery-unravelling story in one of my favourite “little man versus evil corporate overlords” worlds since Deus Ex. It didn’t have the most original combat, but that didn’t matter: it was obviously a labour of love from a team totally invested in the telling of this tale, and we all fell under its spell.Well, when I say all of us, I mean myself and the three kids. My wife did not play The Outer Worlds, because none of those worlds featured Crash Bandicoot. But the rest of us dug it, and the kids particularly enjoyed that I flounced away from the final boss battle after half a day of trying, declaring that I hadpretty muchcompleted the game and that was good enough for a dad with other things to do.My son completed The Outer Worlds 2 first. “How was it?” I asked.“You are going to hate it,” he replied.What? How dare he have the arrogance to predict my gaming tastes! If it wasn’t for me, none of these urchins would have played a video game in the first place. It’s bad enough that they destroy me at Mario Kart. Now they’re robbing me of potential gaming joy. I was now determined to enjoy The Outer Worlds 2 just to prove him wrong.Reader: I did not enjoy it.View image in fullscreenMost of the dialogue is people moaning about their bosses … The Outer Worlds 2.Photograph: Obsidian EntertainmentWhile the combat is top notch, the character skill trees sophisticated, and the speed and smoothness (on the Xbox Series X version) unmatched (especially when rushing away from combat as an ageing gamer is wont to do), the story is awful.The first hour of play hits you with so much tedious factional politics it makes the opening crawl of The Phantom Menace look like Serious Sam. Most of the dialogue is people moaning about their bosses or their charges. Everything is broken. People are starving and miserable, bereft of doctors and medical supplies. It’s basically 2025 but in space, expressed in words so clunky and boring that it feels like reading through LinkedIn comments.“I was right, wasn’t I?” said my son smugly, when I gave up after 20 hours, on the third planet I visited.“How can you tell?”“I haven’t heard you curse at a game this much since you played online Fifa.”“How did they get it so wrong, son?” I asked.“There’s no real heart and soul in the game. They just phoned in the story.”Then we talked. At length. About role-playing games in general; what works and what doesn’t; what makes some great and others tedious. And we agreed that RPGs require a storyteller’s commitment to make it believable. This genre has its roots in Dungeons & Dragons, which in essence is just people sitting in a basement conjuring up great stories. If the Dungeon Master is no good, it’s just a number-crunching, dice-rolling slog but, with a storyteller in charge, it is magic. World building is crucial, too: the lush highlands of Skyrim, the dark conspiracy-poisoned streets of Deus Ex, the techno-magical dystopia of Gaia in Final Fantasy VII.And, like tabletop D&D, the graphics don’t really matter. Decades ago, I spent a brilliant month inside the batshit crazy apocalyptic demonic faith-fest that is Shin Megami Tensei, and that whole world was conjured from tiny pixels on the screen of a Game Boy Advance.View image in fullscreenMy weak bladder and need for sleep were the only things that ever dragged me away from the inhabitants of The Witcher 3.Photograph: CD Projekt REDThat world must have characters you care about. My weak bladder and inconvenient need for sleep were the only things that ever dragged me away from the inhabitants of The Witcher 3. But I couldn’t care less about any of the characters in The Outer Worlds 2; I felt I had seen them all before. Throw in the needlessly dense, grey dialogue and I couldn’t stay focused on the game for longer than five minutes outside battles.In a real world where we have less control than ever, when “truth” is just what the richest liar purports and fairness has been eradicated, it’s increasingly difficult to win in life by working hard. That is what makes the genuine meritocracy of role-playing games so appealing to me. In all video games, if you have skill (or develop it), then you can progress. But in RPGs, even if you weren’t born with talent, you can work hard, grind up levels, and get more skills that lead to more rewards. In contrast to a horrible world that has 3,000 billionaires and yet still leaves most of its inhabitants living in poverty, RPGs are a model of what a just world would be like – with added armour and shields, and hopefully fast travel points.The Outer Worlds 2 was a disappointment for me, but instead of escaping into an immersive RPG as I had hoped, I instead escaped into a glorious chat with my son about them. Again, I realised how much games have given our lives, and how they’ve deepened our relationship with each other. And I realised that sometimes a game’s terrible dialogue can spark a fascinating one in the real world.Explore more on these topicsGamesXbox series S/XfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Equipping Kyiv with the resources to fight on is the quickest route to a just settlementFri 28 Nov 2025 13.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 14.11 ESTShareAs Donald Trump’s Thanksgiving Day deadline for a Ukraine peace agreement came and went this week, the Russia expert Mark Galeottipointedto a telling indicator of how the Kremlin is treating the latest flurry of White House diplomacy. In the government paper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a foreign policy scholar close to Vladimir Putin’s regime bluntly observed: “As long as hostilities continue, leverage remains. As soon as they cease, Russia finds itself alone (we harbour no illusions) in the face of coordinated political and diplomatic pressure.”Mr Putin has no interest in a ceasefire followed by talks where Ukraine’s rights as a sovereign nation would be defended and reasserted. He seeks the capitulation and reabsorption of Russia’s neighbour into Moscow’s orbit. Whether that is achieved through battlefield attrition, or through a Trump-backed deal imposed on Ukraine, is a matter of relative indifference. On Thursday, the Russian presidentreiteratedhis demand that Ukraine surrender further territory in its east, adding that the alternative would be to lose it through “force of arms”. Once again, he described Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government as “illegitimate”, and questioned the legally binding nature of any future agreement.The simultaneous assertion that a peace plan discussed by the US and Ukraine this week could “be the basis for future agreements” is therefore as bogus as Mr Putin’s empty praise for Mr Trump’s previous diplomatic efforts. The plan – which emerged as a counter to White Houseproposalseffectively copied and pasted from a Kremlin wishlist – reportedly calls for an end to the fighting as a precondition for talks over territory. This is precisely the route that the Kremlin remains determined to resist. News that Mr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, has resigned after being placed underinvestigationby anti-corruption authorities – a damaging development that could scarcely come at a worse moment for Ukraine’s president – makes it still less likely that Mr Putin will be persuaded to make concessions he has never before contemplated.Mr Trump is being strung along again. But the clear and present danger is that a combination of “peacemaker-in-chief” presidential vanity, a desire to do business with Russia and Mr Zelenskyy’s sudden political vulnerability will tempt him to do Mr Putin’s dirty work for him. After four years of resistance, sacrifice and suffering, Ukraine must not be bullied into a cynical carve-up, which would leave it permanently vulnerable to Russia’s aggression, jeopardise Europe’s future security and inspire authoritarian regimes worldwide.Responsibility for ensuring this does not happen lies with Europe. Though Russian forces continue to make small, incremental gains in Ukraine’s east, their advance is painfully slow and at enormouscost. By signalling a commitment to provide Kyiv with sufficient financial and military resources to resist in the medium term, European leaders can begin to alter the dynamic of negotiations in the present.Whether such aid is to come through a “reparations loan”underwrittenby frozen Russian assets, from the EU budget, or via common borrowing by member states, must be resolved quickly after months of delay. A signal needs to be sent to both Mr Putin and Mr Trump that Europe will resolutely defend Ukraine’s right to a just peace. As the Kremlin seeks leverage via the killing fields of eastern Ukraine and within the corridors of the White House, Mr Zelenskyy must urgently be given some of his own.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, spoke of “substantial progress” after Ukraine-US talks in Geneva. On Monday night, Vladimir Putin made his countermove:another massive barrageof missile and drone strikes on Kyiv.The sequence of contrasting events captured the grim essence of the outgoing year. By day, diplomatic battles are fought: hopeful statements are issued from Washington, London, Brussels and Kyiv. Immense energy is expended on containing Donald Trump’s initiatives. By night, Putin brutally reminds the world that, for him, war remains the primary tool for achieving “peace”.As Russia’s attack unfolded into the early hours of Tuesday, the immediate reality of Ukraine’s vulnerability was laid bare.Ukraineis able to track missile launches from Russian territory, a capability afforded by timely US intelligence. Outside my window, two Ukrainian air force fighter jets, which had been scrambled to intercept incoming cruise missiles, roared overhead – American F-16s, supplied to Ukraine by one of its European allies.Moments later, Kyiv’s air-defence systems thundered: two sharp launches fired to intercept a Russian ballistic missile. This was a Patriot system at work, most likely delivered by the US or Germany. Every launch jolts you unexpectedly, shaking the windows. The instant of fear quickly gives way to grim resignation: perhaps the incoming missile won’t strike its target this time, sparing the city from devastation and another blackout.Soon after, a heavy machine gun opened up on a drone somewhere nearby, part of a mobile-fire group – almost certainly a US-madeBrowning. Unfortunately, the bullets missed the Iranian-made Shahed drone – it pressed on overhead, toward its destination.With pauses, this continued until dawn. Kyiv awoke to the morning news: seven people killed, destruction and heating outages in many homes as a result of the night’s assault. As always, everyone still went about their day – living the war. But those 24 hours encapsulated Ukraine’s critical military reliance on the US – a dependence thatEuropeis demonstrably unable to fill in the short term.The28-point planfrom Washington sparked intense emotion, debate and deep concern – and temporarily diverted attention from Ukraine’s largestcorruption scandalin years. Yet, we have seen this script before, afterthat disastrous meetingbetween Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in February, and after theAlaska summitin August.Every new initiative from Washington unfolds according to the same pattern: a diplomatic cavalry charge against Ukraine, which Kyiv, with other European capitals, manages to fend off. They stabilise the situation but never actually win the battle. This pattern will, no doubt, persist.It is tempting to accuse Trump of consistently pushing Russia’s terms. But that does not seem to be the whole story. Washington operates on a premise well known to American diplomats: you cannot win at the negotiating table what you have lost on the battlefield. The White House presumes that it is impossible to force Russia to relinquish the territory that it already controls in Ukraine’s south or east.The problem is that while recognising this factual reality, Washington does nothing to deter Moscow, through words or deeds, from thinking that the situation will shift further in its favour in the coming year.Therefore, Putin is convinced that time is on his side – that Ukraine and its partners are approaching exhaustion. His motivation to sign a deal that does not give him the maximum possible gain is close to zero. There may be many attempts to end hostilities, but they will continue as long as Russia’s leader remains supremely confident in the outcome.On the contrary, Zelenskyy believes that Ukraine can still hold out, slowly losing people and territory but avoiding a total frontline collapse until circumstances change in its favour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now, subjective factors are entering the equation: Trump’s desire to broker a ceasefire andpave his wayto a Nobel peace prize, and Zelenskyy’s twin challenges – on one hand, not to alienate a key ally, and on the other, to rally Ukrainians around the flag against any US initiative Kyiv finds unacceptable, so that their focus does not switch to domestic problems. And although his task will now be much harder after anti-corruption authoritiessearched the homeof his most trusted confidant, Andriy Yermak, it remains highly unlikely that this will change his overall approach.These two forces are driving the talks.It took a mere seven days to killthe 28 pointsof the latest plan. Aggressive and erratic handling of the matter by Washington, pushback by Ukraine and the rest of Europe, along with the soothing efforts of Rubio, and finally,the leaks about Witkoff, all did their job.While new plans based on old ideas are imminent, Kyiv, London and other European capitals should draw one fundamental conclusion: Ukraine and Europe will only be able to fend off diplomatic offensives from Washington that are based on Russian demands and reflect Trump’s reluctance to change the course of events, if they stand together and strengthen their defence capabilities at a much faster pace. If they do, neither Trump nor Putin will be able to break them. In the meantime, Ukraine’s ability to repel nightly air assaults will, for the foreseeable future, largely rely on the US.Dmytro Kuleba was Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs from 2020 to 2024Explore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpMarco RubioEuropeEuropean UnioncommentShareReuse this content"

Take, for instance, Simcha Rothman, a member of the Knesset (the Israeli parliament) for the Religious Zionist Party, who spoke on 28 October in an international summit in Hungary organized in support of Israel. “If we want to destroy the idea of genocide,” hesaid, “if we want to destroy [it] and we should destroy the idea of Muslim Brotherhood that takes over the entire west, the Middle East, but after that, the entire world, the entire western civilization, we have to define it as the enemy.” “The enemy in Gaza,” he continued, “are not the terror tunnels, the enemy in Gaza are not the missiles, the enemy in Gaza are not even the terrible people who took the hostages; the enemy in Gaza is the idea of a genocide, the same idea that echoes in mosques all around Europe, the same idea that echoes in mosques in the US, in campuses, in encampments, the same idea, this is the enemy.”This portrayal ofGazaas “the idea of a genocide,” a genocide against Jews, and against Jews as foundational in “western civilization,” figures within a long history of perpetrators of very real genocides who perceived themselves as acting in defense of “barbarians” threatening “western civilization.” The war in Gaza, then, has not ended, according to Rothman, because it was never a war in Gaza, but a war on Gaza.“A war that is not only between Israel and Hamas,” as Israeli President Isaac Herzogadmittedopenly already in December 2023. “It’s a war that is intended, really, truly, to save western civilization.” Rothman is a far-right religious politician, Herzog once stood at the head of the left-wing Labor Party, but they share the same vision: Israel’s attack on Gaza is “not only between Israel and Hamas,” but a contemporary crusade. It is, to quote one of the hundreds ofvideosby Israeli soldiers and officers – the Israeli crusaders – a “real war of the people of Israel,” in which “moral is to understand that every Arab is a suspect. Maybe he is good, maybe he is a bomb, but he is suspect. Moral is to execute all the terrorists after interrogating them. Moral is to conquer and settle all of the Land of Israel, and every place we will leave a wasps’ nest, they will retaliate against us, sooner or later.” This is the morality of “the most moral army in the world”: all Arabs are suspects, terrorists, killable.The war in Gaza has not ended, because it was never a war in Gaza but a “Gaza Nakba,” as Israeli cabinet member and minister Avi Dichtersaidin November 2023 and as Israel’s former military intelligence chief Aharon Haliva confirmed in summer 2025 when hesaid, coldly, that “the fact that there are already 50,000 dead in Gaza is necessary and required for future generations. … It doesn’t matter now if they are children. … They need a Nakba every now and then to feel the price.”This is not a war, the Israeli general is telling us, but a Nakba. And this Nakba has not ended – not in Gaza, much of which Israel has “turned to rubble” and “flattened,” which Israeli political and military leaders had promised in October 2023, and not elsewhere in Palestine, as demonstrated by the nearly complete forced displacement of Palestinian shepherd communities in theJordan Valley, where Israeli state authorities and settlers have created a wild west that targets Palestinians, their property, lands, and animals in an unending celebration of extreme violence.The Gaza Nakba has not ended, because it did not begin in October 2023, but in the 1948 Nakba, whenIsraelemerged on the ruins of Palestine and Palestinians. This reality immediately clashed with the idea of Israel as a unique state, the state of survivors of the unique evil of the Nazis, which made it seem unimaginable that Israel could perpetrate any crime in international law, let alone genocide, the new crime that was formulated also in 1948.No one used the word “Holocaust” at the time to refer to the Nazi genocide against Jews, but the idea that it is a unique genocide emerged with the genocide concept in the year of the Nakba, which meant that the new crime of genocide, which bestowed impunity on the new Israeli state, could make sense only in tandem with Nakba denial. But now that Israelis from top to bottom cannot but desire Nakba – in their government and parliament, on their news shows, in social media and grocery shops, in their living rooms – Nakba denial has shifted to Nakba justification: a war, a war against “human animals,” a war against the biblical evil of Amalek, a war against terrorists, and a war, to return to Rothman, against “the idea of genocide” against Jews, that is, a war against Nazis.It was only natural, then, for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to respond to the charge of genocide that South Africa brought against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023 bydepictingPalestinians as Nazis: “In the murder tunnels of Gaza, our forces have found copies of Hitler’s Mein Kampf. In a home in Gaza, they found a child’s tablet with a picture of Hitler as the screensaver.” More than a year and a half later, on 24 July 2025, after Israel had destroyed over 80% of homes in Gaza and killed more than 20,000 children, Israeli Heritage Minister Amihai Eliyahuwantedmore: “all Gaza will be Jewish … the government is pushing to wipe out Gaza. Thank god, we are wiping out this evil. We are wiping out the population that has been educated on Mein Kampf.” Direct and unashamed: “the government is pushing to wipe out Gaza” – the government, we are told by one of its ministers; it is government policy to “wipe out Gaza” and its “population.” Israel’s portrayal of Palestinians as Nazis – this grotesque weaponization of the Holocaust – cannot but reveal the truth about its function as justification for Israeli genocide.The war in Gaza has thus not ended, because it is a war only insofar as it is a genocidal war, a war that aimed not to defeat Hamas, as Herzog admitted in December 2023, but to destroy a people, so that Gaza “will be Jewish” – a government policy of settler colonial genocide that officers like Captain Hemo understood precisely as intended. Many others saw and heard genocidal intent: when the ICJ reiterated in March 2024 its decision from the previous January that Israel was plausibly perpetrating genocide in Gaza, Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusufnotedin a separate declaration that “all the indicators of genocidal activities are flashing red in Gaza.” Indeed, “plausible” here means a clear risk of genocide, which activates the legal obligations of states that signed and ratified the UN Genocide Convention to prevent and punish genocide (Article I) and not to be complicit in it (Article III).The unimaginable has thus happened: the crime of genocide became a tool in the struggle against Israel’s ongoing Nakba rather than a mechanism of its denial. Yet, by March 2024, genocide prevention – the promise of a post-Holocaust world of “Never Again” – had already failed miserably in Gaza. Israel had killed by mid-March, according to officialfigures, more than 32,000 Palestinians, including at least 13,000 children, leaving over 70,000 injured. Israel had also damaged more than 60% of all housing units, including hospitals and dozens of other healthcare facilities, while a million Palestinians were facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity and hundreds of thousands were suffering from acute repository infections and acute diarrhea.And all along, Israel’s allies, primarily in the west, continued to provide Israel with weapons, ammunition, essential parts, and diplomatic cover that made the genocide possible, making hash of even a façade of international law with their complicity with genocide, with every bullet sold to Israel, with every lie that criticism of Israeli genocide is antisemitism, with every US veto of Gaza ceasefire resolutions in the UN Security Council.With genocide prevention in shambles and with crude complicity in genocide on display, can we expect accountability? Netanyahu and his former war minister Yoav Gallant face arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity, but not genocide, and in any case, it seems that it would take a miracle for them to stand before judges in The Hague one day.But perhaps we should look elsewhere for accountability. After all, major Nazi criminals stood trial in Nuremberg after World War II, which changed nothing in the ideological and political structures that had brought them to power in the first place – that is, the exclusionary nation-state system that emerged after World War I and overlapped with the white supremacy that stood at the heart of European empire building, colonialism, and settler colonialism. The “Third Reich” was indeed a vision of a white supremacist empire, based on extreme nationalism, “purified” of its racial others and enemies, with “Aryan” settlers tilling the land in its vast occupied regions in eastern Europe, always ready to replace the pitchfork for the gun to fight for their superior civilization.But the victors of World War II had no intention of coming to terms with white supremacy, because the US, the UK, and France were white supremacist empires themselves. The victors of World War II similarly sought no accountability for nationalism, because they were, all of them, including the Soviets, nationalists and true believers in national “homogenization” as the essential precondition for security and peace. Nowhere was the meaning of such peace, this post-World War II reproduction of nationalism and white supremacy, clearer than in the Israeli state, a self-proclaimed exclusionary nation-state and a self-proclaimed exclusionary settler state – what Ze’ev Jabotinsky, the father of revisionist Zionism, described in his well-knownessayfrom 1923 as a settler colonial project that can only work with an “Iron Wall.”The genocidal war in Gaza, the ongoing Nakba, cannot therefore end within the international political and legal system that had envisioned it from the outset, even if Netanyahu and Gallant find themselves somehow in The Hague. As the current crisis inBosnia and Herzegovinamakes clear, that former Serbian president Slobodan Milošević ended up in unexpected circumstances in The Hague in 2001 changed nothing in the conditions and dynamics that led to the mass violence in the Former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, including the Srebrenica genocide.We live not in a post-Holocaust world of “Never Again,” but in the same world that led to the Holocaust, a world of “Again and Again,” a world that has therefore cast beyond its borders, quite literally, nearly120 millionforcibly displaced people, including more than9 million Palestinians, among them survivors of the 1948 Nakba and their descendants. We also live in a world heating at a pace beyond what anyone could have imagined just a decade or two ago, which means that we will likely facehundreds of millionsof people on the move by mid-century.In this context, for Israel and its supporters, the Gaza genocide is a model. It is not only that Israeli soldiers and officers who have documented their own crimes in Gaza and uploaded them to social media are unashamed; they help spread the message of lawlessness: this is what awaits people who will dare to resist whatever measures imposed on them by extremely violent states in a world shaped by brute force, now without even the pretense of Holocaust memory and international law.But most people around the world do not want this future, this present. Most people see through the doublespeak of their leaders who claim to meet in Sharm El-Sheikh to make peace, as they continue the flow of the means of destruction to Israel and, while they’re at it, promise a phone call from Eric because, you know, peacemaking is a business. Most people know that their governments, left and right, do not represent them, do not care for them, nor for the future of their children.Most people know that day is not night, and they refuse to say otherwise. And many, many people around the world have taken to the streets, risking arrest, violence, losing their jobs, facing stigmatization as antisemites, drifting apart from family members and close friends – yet they have showed up, and they continue to show up, because the struggle continues, for Gaza, for Palestine, for their lives, for our world.

Starmer survives another week, and it’s only cost us £26bnMarina HydeLabour can proudly say this was a budget for working people – that is, if your job happens to be prime ministerFri 28 Nov 2025 10.14 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 14.18 ESTShareThanks to Labour’s incredible Black Friday deal, breaking manifesto policies is buy-one-get-one-free. As part of its all-promises-must-go drive, it’s ditching its flagship policy giving the right toclaim unfair dismissal from day oneof employment. Employers will now have up to six months to summarily sack workers who don’t pan out – unless they’re the government, in which case people have to wait till 2029.The employment rights bill was drawn up and championedby Angela Rayner, who resigned in September following a series of discoveries about her tax affairs. Weird to think that Rayner could easily have been in the I’m a Celebrity camp right now. The former deputy PM reportedlygot pretty far along in her discussions with ITV in terms of booking a spot on the current series of the fauna-testicle-based format, and could at this very moment have been giving us her Queen Over the Water/Queen in the Jungle Shower for 80 minutes of primetime a night. But in the end, Rayner seems to have concluded – or had it concluded for her – that there wouldn’t be a way back to frontline politics if she took that particular leave of absence.Such are the sliding-doors moments in our very serious politics. Who’s to say for sure, but maybe Rayner will now be thinking that declining the ostrich anus was the right call as she does the House of Commons tearoom trial over the coming days. According tobriefings, she’ll be taking soundings from the various malcontents who seemingly run the party from the backbenches, who got most of what they wanted in the budget this week, and who still see themselves as victims of something or other. Arguably, Labour backbenchers should count their blessings. Unlike most of the rest of the country, they have guaranteed jobs for the next few years, unless they sexually harass a junior staff member or whatever. And, on the parliamentary standards form book, even if they do. In recent times, employment rights for MPs seem all too frequently to have been modelled on those of medieval feudal lords.Anyway, whichever way you slice it, the government is back in a familiar place: arguing about whether it did or didn’t break a manifesto commitment, just as it has spent the past few days doing over its tax-raising budget. It is also arguing about whether or not it was lying on Monday when it insisted it wasn’t going to water the employment rights bill down, even though it was meeting business leaders and unions on that same day to discuss doingjust that.First out to defend all this hokey cokey was business secretary Peter Kyle, who always comes off as a man playing a businessman in a play about business. According to Kyle, the pledge ditch doesn’t break the manifesto because “the manifesto committed us tofinding compromise”. Did it though? By chance I have the document in front of me on my desk – they are always worth hanging on to, I find – and there is precisely nothing about compromise in it as far as I can see. Maybe there was a limited-edition manifesto with bonus material? Or maybe talking about all this is better than talking about our absent friend – growth.And so to Rachel Reeves’s budget. From almost the minute she took office, no one seems to have been more surprised by economic realities than the chancellor. OK – with the possible exception of the prime minister. Remember that during last year’s general election campaign, Keir Starmer wentabsolutely nutsat Rishi Sunak for suggesting that Labour would, in fact, need to raise taxes to pay for all the things it said it was buying. Sunak was lying, insisted the Labour leader, and had seriously breached the ministerial code by doing so. “He knew very well what he was doing,” Starmer fumed to the cameras back then. “He lied about our plans. And that is a true test of character. As we go to the polls it is important for voters to know about the character of the two individuals who want to be prime minister.” Mate, they know a lot more now.In fact, blissful ignorance is very much off the menu all round. Spool forward to the immediate aftermath of this latest budget, and Helen Miller, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS),said: “Before this budget, the UK was faced with lacklustre economic growth, stagnating living standards, and a dizzying array of fiscal pressures. The same is still true after this budget.” The tax burden that went up by £40bn last November went up a further £26bn this week – and the IFS wascrystal clearthat rises in national insurance in the budget did represent a manifesto breach. A moment for reflection in Downing Street? Not so’s you’d notice. When the Conservatives were in power, Labour could never stop talking about the IFS, refusing to even name it without prefixing it with its epithet “the trusted”. Now, strangely, it doesn’t want to talk about the IFS at all.As for what the upshot of all this will be, it was great to learn today that the budget’s apparently overriding aim – not to offend Labour backbenchers – has been judged sufficiently successful in that regard thus far tokeep Starmer’s job safetill after the May elections. You’ve heard of a budget for jobs. Sadly, we can’t have that. What we seem to have had instead is a budget for job: one in particular. Unfair dismissal may be in the headlines now; fair dismissal is likely to be more of a preoccupation in the coming months.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They survive only in some English-speaking countries as quaint relics of medieval jurisprudence. They deserve dispatch to the world of ducking, flogging, drawing and quartering.As it is, criminal courts have built up ahopeless backlogin England and Wales of almost 80,000 cases, with some hearings postponed to 2029. A surge in rape cases has led to a two-year delay, withtwice the number of complainantswithdrawing as five years ago. Britain’s prison population threatens to break the 100,000 barrier, or twice its size in the 1990s. These are not just convicts. A fifth of cells contain remand prisoners spending months awaiting trial. This is a parody of justice.Jury trials are flawed and unwieldy – but vital for justice being seen to be done | Gaby HinsliffRead moreThe justice secretary, David Lammy, knows it cannot go on. He proposes that juries be confined to extreme crimes, such as rape, manslaughter and murder, with the rest defaulting to a single judge. This year, the Leveson review of the criminal courts warned of a “total system collapse”. Brian Leveson, a former judge, proposed most trials go before a judge with two magistrates in attendance. In the jury-loving US, a similar crisis has led to 98% of criminal cases now beingsettled informally, in out-of-court negotiations with prosecutors. This ishardly justice seen to be done.Almost no other European country uses juries, except sometimes in exceptional cases. Most use judges and examining magistrates. They treat trials as matters of possibly contested evidence, most often a matter for scientific expertise and discussion. Dramatised rituals are the preserve of Britain’s justice system.British juries have already been abandoned for civil trials – curiously so, as in matters of libel public opinion could be of some relevance. They have also been discontinued for financial trials, which frequently went far over the heads of “12 good citizens and true”. Meanwhile, most people seem unaware that the overwhelming majority of criminal cases are conducted in magistrates courts, already without juries. Even among cases that go to crown courts, only one in five are now decided byjuries. Yet they occupy a ludicrous amount of time and bureaucracy.I have done jury service on three occasions and have never seen such a waste of time and money. What should take two or three hours would take two or three days. Two of our cases involved nothing more serious than grievous bodily harm, and one was a fraud that few of us understood. None needed a jury. All we knew was that a guilty verdict leading to a jail sentence would be grotesque. Going to prison is not a matter of months. For most people, its consequence is a sentence for life.In the courts, we heard arguments of extreme guilt against extreme innocence. There was little discussion of mitigation, previous records or background circumstances.Barristersoften seemed ill-briefed, while solicitors sat silent, sometimes with their heads in their hands. This division of Britain’s legal profession between solicitors and barristers is as costly and archaic as are juries.The only people who love juries are barristers, fiercely defending them in the media. This is understandable, as juries are their audience and their bread and butter. Many crooks also like them because they believe juries are lenient, and it may be that in some cases a jury is more lenient than a judge. When I was recently prosecuted for driving too often over 20mph, I would love to have pleaded my case before a jury.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

England and Wales imprisons 145 of its citizens for every 100,000. Jury-free Germany imprisons 71, the Netherlands and Norway just 54. I do not believe that Britons are twice as criminal as Germans, or three times as Dutch or Norwegians. The jury-loving USimprisons 541.British crime and punishment is prison-obsessed. Not a week passes without some MP demanding long sentences for everyone from hate speakers to water board chairs. Jurisprudence is stuck in a rut and hostile to new ideas. Crime is seen not as a societal disease, requiring professional analysis and cure. There seems no scope for restorative justice or the role of rehabilitation in sentencing, as there is in Scandinavia. Discussion is over retribution and deterrence – a deterrence that is patently ineffective in areas such as cybercrime and sexual violence.The legal profession is lobbying frantically to keep its place on stage. It accuses opponents of wanting “to go back to the star chamber”. Anyone who says that should be compelled to spend a week studying justice in Norway – and join the 21st century. Now push has come to shove. The British system is broken. Justice is being denied.

Everyone knows that the courts are in crisis, that we can’t go on like this. Traumatised victims can’t keep being told that the earliest available date for a trial is 2029,so they’re either going to have to live with it hanging over them for another four years or drop out. (And nor can defendants put their lives endlessly on hold, worrying that witnesses’ memories will only fade with time.) Something obviously needs to change. But the idea that the only solution is toscrap jury trialsin all but the most serious cases of rape, murder and other offences with sentences longer than five years – as a leaked letter from the justice secretary, David Lammy, suggests – should ring alarm bells nonetheless.Anyone who has sat in a courtroom for long enough, never mind on a jury, will know that it isn’t exactly 12 Angry Men out there. Members of the public obliged to dispense amateur justice have the same flaws, limitations and tendency to fall asleep in the boring bits – or, as onone memorable occasionat the Old Bailey, repeatedly ask if the hot witness is single – as the rest of us, and unlike judges they aren’t obliged to give their reasons for sometimes baffling decisions. Juries are notoriously resistant to convicting in all but the most straightforward rape trials, andexpert doubtsraised over Lucy Letby’s murder conviction make a strong case for removing them from cases with very complex medical evidence. All that said, however, they’re absolutely vital to justice being seen to be done.David Lammy is right to slash the use of juries – it’s an open-and-shut case | Simon JenkinsRead morePublic confidence in institutions depends, as the prime minister’s one-time legal mentor Lady Helena Kennedy KCput it this week, on public involvement in an establishment that can otherwise appear remote. Jury service is the only chance most people ever get to see the legal sausage getting made, and while the results aren’t always edifying, being excluded from the process seems even less likely to inspire confidence. Meanwhile for defendants and their families, the right to be judged by one’s peers – including people more closely resembling the person in the dock than the one in the wig – matters.Even with an increasingly diverse judiciary, juries are seen as a safeguard against racism, as Lammy himself used to argue before getting this job: 12 people riddled with competing biases may paradoxically have a better chance of collectively cancelling out each other’s assumptions and blind spots than one however highly trained to be impartial.And at the risk of sounding faintly paranoid, juries represent a safeguard against the politicisation of the courts that is not to be taken lightly in the current climate. Judges are appointed – a process much more easily hijacked by future governments of malign intent than the act of picking random names from a phone book.Perhaps it would be worth overriding all those fears if juries were the main cause of gridlock. But when only a tiny1% of criminal casesin England and Wales actually end up in front of one, at best this feels like a cover for the real problem: public reluctance to pay for the services we want.As with NHS waiting lists and asylum seekers cooped up for years in hotels, the judicial backlog is the legacy of previous governments’ spending choices, for which this one is getting unfairly blamed. The system has gummed up thanks to the chronic underfunding of not just the courts but of other public services on which they depend. Long delays getting mobile phone data analysed or obtaining reports from probation officers and social workers before sentencing all add up, and so does the time wasted by defendants who don’t qualify for legal aid attempting to use ChatGPT toconduct their own defence.The untold side of the story meanwhile is the growing complexity of the law – usually as a result of parliament satisfying public demands for “something to be done” – and more proactive policing of complex historical sexual abuse and exploitation, otherwise known as police and prosecutors doing exactly what society is asking of them, but without the funding to see it through.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(Scrapping jury trialsdoesn’t save much money, but Leveson calculates it would free up 20% of court sitting time, allowing more cases to be heard within existing budgets.) It’s the same gamble underpinningRachel Reeves’s budgetthis week – the hope that something will turn up before 2029, allowing harder choices to be avoided – with all the same potential risks and rewards.Justice delayed is, as the saying goes, justice denied.

Keir Starmer, a methodical person as well as a former director of public prosecutions, is so keen on orderliness that in 2022 his close colleague Lisa Nandy called him “Mr Rules”.There are things to be said for this approach. Many voters have been saying for at least a decade that they want politicians to exert more control over Britain’s erratic trajectory. Meanwhile the recentcatastrophic administrationof Boris Johnson, with its vast carelessness about Covid deaths, Brexit and immigration, still looms over our politics as a demonstration of what happens when governments have little interest in rules. As tech oligarchs, bond traders, international criminals, and digital and physical viruses increasingly prey on vulnerable people, it can be argued that a libertarian or fiscally loose government is a luxury most Britons can’t afford.And yet, so far, Labour’s politics of rules isn’t working. Last week’s immigration announcements, which “will make Britain’s settlement system by far the most controlled and selective in Europe”, according to the home secretary,Shabana Mahmood– rapidly becoming an even more severe figure than Starmer – have not lifted Labour’s dire poll ratings. This week’stax-raising budget, which prioritised reassuring the bond markets that the government will keep to its “iron-clad” fiscal rules, also feels unlikely to dramatically improve Labour’s standing – despite the inclusion of some redistributive measures, such as a mansion tax, which may match many voters’ anti-elite mood. Although much of the financial establishment, media and electorate believe that Britain is in an economic and social crisis, the more Starmer and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, offer to restore order, the more the public seem to dislike them.Why are Mr Rules and Labour’s sober remedies so widely rejected? His and Reeves’s limits as communicators have clearly played a part. So have the damagingly regular occasions when ministers have failed to behave with rectitude themselves. Although this government’s scandals have been far smaller than those of its Tory predecessors – Angela Raynerunderpaying stamp dutyhardly compares to neglecting to properly organise the evacuation of Afghanistan – they have enabled Labour’s enemies to deploy a favourite and effective weapon: the claim that anyone at all leftwing is a hypocrite at heart. Rather than really considering Starmer’s programme, many voters have thus been able to stay in an almost nihilistic comfort zone, believing his government is no better than Johnson’s.There are also deeper reasons for the failure of Starmer’s emphasis on rule-making. The capacity of the British state to enforce ever more rules – for example, checking that millions of immigrants who want to be Britons have been model residents – has almost certainly been diminished by Tory austerity. Not recognising this is one of the many ways in whichLabourappears to have underprepared for power.Even if the state’s ability to manage much of society can eventually be restored – and even if you think such a situation would be desirable – by then many voters may have moved on in terms of how they conceive of the government being in control. EU membership used to be the supposed source of our national instability; now it’s our porous borders (even though immigration is actuallyfalling fast); next year, it might be multiculturalism – already a target for rising hard men of the right such as Robert Jenrick andMatthew Goodwin– or the crime rate, already being talked up by Nigel Farage.The claim that this country is in chaos is one that rightwing journalists and politicians have a vested interest in making, particularly during a Labour government, as it enables them to scapegoat groups they don’t like and demand authoritarian solutions. In this context, voter anxiety is constantly shape-shifting, and hard for even a competent, well-resourced government to address for long. During the calmest, most popular years of Tony Blair’s premiership – which seem another world now – plenty of Britons still believed that his government needed to “get a grip”, as focus groups regularly told Blair’s pessimistic public opinion guru, Philip Gould.Even more challengingly for Starmer, while many voters say they want a government in control, they are often drawn to politicians promising something else: risk, radical change or simply entertainment. Over the past decade, Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn, Farage and Zack Polanski have all enjoyed surges of support. Sterner, more orthodox party leaders such as Starmer, Rishi Sunak and Theresa May have often left voters cold.“In the Britain we make, we will all play by the rules,” Starmer pledged in 2022. But the disruption of politics and everyday life by digital technology, the addictive rebelliousness of populism, and the widespread, justified conviction that conventional politics is exhausted and insufficient for today’s huge crises all mean that making Britain orderly again is an old-fashioned, perhaps impossible goal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More like Operation Save Our Skins | Aditya ChakraborttyRead moreIf Labour’s mood and popularity don’t improve soon, the party may decide to pursue a different project under a different leader. Under the ideologically flexible Andy Burnham, or the combative Rayner, or even Wes Streeting – currently trying to shed his reputation as a rigid Labour rightwinger – the government could conceivablyreinvent itselfas a less rule-fixated, more nimble administration that better fits the times. In Spain, the centre-left premier Pedro Sánchez has won three elections in a row, despite a rightwing populist upsurge, partly by presenting immigration and liberal social change as opportunities rather than threats, and partly by taboo-breaking parliamentary moves, including coalitions with the radical left.However, given the long history of Labour prioritising respectability, especially when in trouble, it’s just as likely that the government will become even more fixated on control under Mahmood or another disciplinarian. Labour has always been a complicated party, with both authoritarian and libertarian traditions, but both inside and outside Labour the severe approach is often seen as the realistic one – even when it’s clearly not working well.Labour governments, assuming that there are further ones, will always need to impose some new rules – to prevent this country lapsing back into ancient hierarchies or lurching forward into even worse forms of inequality. But if Labour is going to inspire voters again, rules are not enough.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

But European leaders should be working for peace, not preparing young people to fight and dieFri 28 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 08.22 ESTShareWhen I was growing up, the most German sentence imaginable was: “We’ve lost two world wars and we’re proud of it.” We were so anti-military, we even gave our policemen green uniforms, to make them look more like foresters than soldiers. Now, the chancellor, Friedrich Merz, wants our army to become thestrongest in Europe. I mean, what could go wrong?After we lost the second world war – or, as we prefer to say,after we were liberated by theallies– we swore “never again”: never again to war, and never again to Auschwitz. Admittedly,Germanyrearmed in 1955, but just as “citizens in uniform”, not as soldiers following orders. Mind you, that didn’t mean that you could say “no” to an order; it just meant that we had conscription for most young men until 2011.If that sounds incredible, for us it was incredible that the British army, among others, fought wars all over the globe. For most of my life, the German army didn’t venture beyond our borders. Then came reunification in 1990, and during the first sitting of the all-German Bundestag, the then chancellor, Helmut Kohl, announced that we had to step up internationally: in 1994, the law was changed accordingly to allow the Bundeswehrto be deployed “out of area”again.Nonetheless, Germans remained squeamish about the idea that our soldiers might actually do what they have been trained for. So we convinced ourselves they were “only digging wells”. I kid you not: that was the standard reply to the worried pacifists of Germany, which accounts for a large proportion of people who have experienced the German education system – and heard those “never again” messages over and over.That all changed in 1999. I always try to convey to people outside Germany theseismic shiftthat occurred that year, when our then foreign minister Joschka Fischer declared we had to let go of “never again to war”, in order to honour “never again to Auschwitz” – because Serbia was planning what Fischer called a “new Auschwitz” in Kosovo. Invoking the Holocaust was the only way to get the German public to accept our participation in international wars again.So now we’re bringing back conscription – only we call it voluntary conscription. What could be more “Newspeak” than that? How about awarding a major peace prize, theInternational Peace of Westphalia award, to Nato? As it happens, Germany has just done that. Even Germany’s Protestant church has been re-evaluating its stance on war and the atom bomb this month, publishing a149-page report, with the following conclusion: in these troubled times, “Christian pacifism is ethically not justifiable”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In an imitation of The Hunger Games, our cabinet has proposed tolet a lottery decidewho will have to fight for Germany, if not enough young people join the army voluntarily. Presseclub, a popular TV current affairs programme,suggested conscription is good for you, because – wait for it – when you’re called up for national service an examiner inspects your genitals, so it’s like a free prostate cancer screening. This goes beyond merely cultivating support for remilitarisation – it’s telling the German people: we think you’re stupid, and we’ll treat you as such.Maybe we are stupid. A few months ago a prominent German feminist pointed out it was against equal rights that our sons had to go into the army. You bet it is! But then she went on toask for conscription for our daughtersas well. Feminism does not mean this kind of equal injustice for all, but liberating our sons from having to die for their country as well.The Guardian view on an EU army: leadership and unity remain elusive | EditorialRead moreAnd die they will, if we enter the Ukrainian war with manpower, as well as with arms exports. Patrick Sensburg, president of the Bundeswehr Reservists Association,warned that 1,000 soldiers would dieor be seriously maimed every day. So is he warning against this sort of madness? No. One of his main concerns was how to replace 1,000 dead human beings each day. The solution: conscription. Now Sensburg is not only a reservist, he is also a former member of parliament with the governing CDU. So when he talks about replacing 1,000 dead boys – and maybe dead girls – daily, as if that were inevitable, he speaks from a position of proximity to power. Likewise, Chancellor Merz knows he is helping to reconstitute the national mood and set a new agenda whenhe says: “We are not at war. But we are no longer at peace.” So does nearly every politician and – I’m ashamed to admit – nearly every journalist in Germany. They are participating in what propaganda researchers callcognitive warfare.Advocating for pacifism does not mean abandoningUkraine.I agree the war in Ukraine is a crime – so why aren’t we doing everything in our power to end it? Why aren’t our politicians talking about detente, 24/7? This is precisely why I oppose the reintroduction of conscription: a country that isn’t doing everything to prevent wars has lost the right to ask its citizens to participate in them.But ask we do, and the answer is overwhelming: “No”. Most Germans under 30are against conscription– and it’s only Germans that are too old to go to war thatare in favour. The German Peace Societyreported a sharp uptickin interest in conscientious objection during the summer. Indeed, it has just updated its strategy: it is now advising that young people refuse conscription preventively, after the Federal Court of Justice ruled that conscientious objection is prohibited in times of war. You know what else is prohibited? Wars. Banned since 1928, when Germany signed theKellogg-Briand Pact, designed to prevent another world war.

It would be remiss of me not to refer specifically to the appalling and outrageous casualty list of Palestinian journalists and other media workers in Israel’s war on Gaza since the brutal attack by Hamas on Israeli citizens two years ago.Having excluded independent global media access inside Gaza, leaving us all to rely on local journalists to bear witness to the devastating effect of Israel’s bombardment on the civilian population of Gaza and the famine that has accompanied it, Israel has failed dismally to explain with any credibility why so many journalists have been killed.Importantly, what we should acknowledge is the impact those Palestinian journalists have had in return for their sacrifice.Teens seek urgent high court injunction to block Australian government’s social media banRead moreThey have confronted the world with powerful evidence that has gradually taken on the look and feel of genocide in real time – in our living rooms as well as the corridors of the UN and its agencies.It is significantly due to the courage and stubborn determination of those journalists that no reasonable citizen of the world has been able to look away.In a world that is becoming more and more ill-liberal, including now the most powerful democracy of all, the message is becoming stark for our own country.When the president of the United States sits in the White House with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, as he did a week ago, and seeks to dismiss the brutal murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalist and Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi by agents of the Saudi government as: “things happen” – THINGS HAPPEN – and castigates the journalist who dares to ask the Crown Prince about it, it illuminates just how far the ground has shifted for journalism in the United States.All those massive lawsuits against mainstream media outlets Donald Trump regards as the enemy, that are designed to intimidate against continuing to chronicle his alarming demolition job on the institutions that underpin democracy in America, are testament to the clear and present danger for a strong, free, effective and independent media everywhere.And don’t kid yourself it can’t happen here.On this night six years ago, as chair of the Walkley Foundation, I highlighted a rare unity of purpose within our industry called the Right to Know coalition to pressure the Morrison government to strengthen press freedom in Australia after separate federal police raids on the ABC’s Sydney headquarters and journalist Annika Smethurst’s home in Canberra.Israel has failed dismally to explain with any credibility why so many journalists have been killedNine days later, December 7, 2019, Anthony Albanese, as opposition leader, attacked the Morrison government for its failure to support press freedom, in which he referred to the raids as reflecting “something sinister”.There have been two parliamentary inquiries into press freedom since then, with some 30 recommendations for reform, and Albanese has now been prime minister for three-and-a-half years, but still raids like those on both the ABC and Smethurst could happen again, with a not terribly robust hurdle to jump.In his 2019 speech, Albanese declared “journalism is not a crime. It’s essential to preserving our democracy.”One test of his resolve would be to deliver uniform national shield laws to allow journalists to protect their sources without the threat of imprisonment. But today, although there are shield laws of one sort or another in place in every state as well as nationally, the overall framework has been likened to Swiss cheese, and despite ongoing appeals there’s no obvious sign of a process to harmonise shield laws.All-male lineup take top slots at ABC Sydney after Chris Bath’s shock departureRead moreIn 2019, Albanese said, “We don’t need a culture of secrecy. We need a culture of disclosure.”Well, in 2023, his government’s own formal review put the number of secrecy provisions in commonwealth law at 875. Two years later, there are more, not fewer secrecy offences. Not a good sign.“Protect whistleblowers,” Albanese said in 2019. “Expand their protections and the public interest test.”We’re waiting on the government’s revised whistleblower reforms to be tabled in parliament, and if it’s still wedded to the establishment of a whistleblower ombudsman, rather than a strong independent whistleblower protection authority casting a wider net, then we should be seriously disappointed that the government has fallen short of the expectation Albanese raised six years ago.The lives of whistleblowers, David McBride and Richard Boyle, were upended because they were courageous enough to blow the whistle, in one case, on war crimes in Afghanistan, and the other, on indefensible debt collections on behalf of the tax office.One big test of this government’s credibility will be whether a McBride or a Boyle would still face jail in the future under the new laws. Right now, that’s still possible. If these things are not in the public interest, what on earth is?The lives of whistleblowers, David McBride and Richard Boyle, were upended because they were courageous enough to blow the whistle“Reform freedom of information laws so they can’t be flouted by government,” Albanese said in 2019. But we’re told his proposed new freedom of information laws will have the opposite effect.So on reflection, this government’s scorecard against the benchmarks Albanese set in 2019 as opposition leader is mixed. He’s certainly talked the talk, and to a degree he’s walked the walk, but given what’s at stake now – and I haven’t even mentioned where AI is going to take us even five years from now – we as an industry cannot afford to lose sight of important unfinished business. And in that regard, where is the Right to Know coalition now? The one that united our industry six years ago? Our broad challenges are growing, not lessening.In September, the remarkable Filipino-American journalist Maria Ressa addressed our National Press Club. Her shared Nobel peace prize in 2021 – in her case, for safeguarding freedom of expression in the Philippines, particularly during the authoritarian reign of Rodrigo Duterte – brings compelling authority to the warning note she sounded directly to Australia.Ressa contends that: “The greatest threat we face today isn’t any individual leader or one government. It’s the technology that’s amplifying authoritarian tactics worldwide enabled by democratic governments that abdicated their responsibility to protect the public … Tech platforms have become weapons of mass destruction to democracy.” If you haven’t seen her speech,do so, as a priority.Bevan Shields steps down as Sydney Morning Herald editor, chief reporter Jordan Baker named as replacementRead moreShe commends Australia for taking on the digital giants with a world-first social media ban for children under 16 but says it was a mistake for the government to abandon its proposed law to tackle disinformation on digital platforms last year. We’ve caught the world’s attention on this. Let’s not stop there.No one, including Ressa, is saying it’s easy. But we all have to be invested in this. Let’s not allow ourselves to get intimidated or derailed by those who would seek to distort the concept of freedom of speech for money and power.After all my decades in journalism I have an unshakable belief in an unquenchable public hunger for news that informs, that feeds our curiosity and fires our imaginations; that stimulates crucial debate and can be trusted. That hunger is not just going to evaporate.And if we thinkwe’redoing it tough trying to cut through the shroud of institutional secrecy, or trying to call out those who would polarise our communities for grubby political ends, remind yourself of those journalists in Gaza or Ukraine, or Russia or China, or Myanmar or Afghanistan who’ve been shut down or gone to prison, or gone to their graves for an ideal – for seeking to report the truth.We are all one community of journalists and there’s something powerful we can harness in that, that we should never lose sight of. That’s really why we’re here tonight.

Kiefer Sutherland dives into the world of pantoHollywood megastars hit Leeds this year to make Tinsel Town, a feelgood festive comedy about panto. The 24 star, Rebel Wilson and more talk about their addiction to Greggs sausage rolls – and epic brawls with Danny DyerHollie RichardsonFri 28 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 08.22 ESTShareTwenty-odd years ago, I binged a TV series on DVD for the first time. At my mate’s house in a village outside Harrogate, I was glued toJack Bauershooting his way through24. We probably only made it to episode six before surrendering to sleep for school the next day.Fast forward to the start of this year, and photos are all over the local news ofKiefer Sutherlandout and about in nearby market towns Knaresborough and Wetherby. The real Jack Bauer in Yorkshire! He and Rebel Wilson are in the area making Tinsel Town, a British Christmas film about pantomimes. By March, I am invited to a Leeds studio, where they are filming, and find Sutherland dressed as Buttons on a stage. His glittery eyeshadow shimmers as he smiles and dances to Katy Perry’s Roar with the Cinderella cast. He repeats this showstopper scene about 15 times. It’s a surreal full circle moment; I half expect him to pull a pistol out on the ugly stepsisters.Sutherland is in Paris when I explain the connection later. “That’s very funny,” the Canadian laughs down the phone. “I ended up loving it; Leeds is a fantastic city.” Locals might have spotted him on weekend walks around the university, or at the pub he filmed in. “They had regular customers in, and they were just being really nice.” He also continued his obsession with Greggs sausage rolls, which started on tour with his band – “it was like the heavens had opened up” – and arranged for the bakers’ van to visit the set. Does he have a gold card? “I did for one tour. It was great, but I didn’t use it. I could afford my own sausage roll and a Steak Bake!”View image in fullscreenSetting the stage … Sutherland with Savannah Lee Smith and Lucien Laviscount in Tinsel Town.Photograph: Sky UKTinsel Town is a feelgood family comedy, directed by Chris Foggin (Bank of Dave,Fisherman’s Friends). Sutherland gamely leans into a meta role for it: Bradley Mack, a washed up Hollywood action star who thinks a stint in the West End will save his career. Except, when he arrives in England, he realises his stage debut will be in a small theatre production of Cinderella in a northern town called Stoneford. “It’s funny to watch his descent into actor hell,” says Sutherland. But it’s moving, too, as Bradley realises he needs to get himself together for his semi-estranged daughter. “It’s a lesson to a lot of parents out there who might actually be the children in that relationship. Certainly there were times where I could definitely say the same thing about myself.”Ultimately, though, this is a very sweet call to arms to save pantomime – and a “booo!” to anyone who sneers at it. The ensemble boasts stage icons such asDerek JacobiandMeera Syal. “My first glimpse of theatre was attending panto at a little church group – there was nothing else to do in the village I grew up in,” says Syal, taking a breather in her trailer on set. “I’ll never forget the feeling of the lights going down, the music starting, the actors coming on.” She played Fairy Mermaid (“obviously”) in Birmingham Hippodrome’s production of Peter Pan in 2018. “Wearing a fishtail three times a day – you really had to work out the toilet breaks. It’s really hard work. But you get that joy of seeing kids absolutely spellbound. It’s very life-affirming.”Panto isn’t just about tradition – it keeps the arts financially afloat. “The revenue from those pantomimes keep those theatres going for the whole year,” says eight-time Olivier award nomineeMaria Friedman. “I haven’t got enough time to tell you how dismayed I am about where the arts are – it’s just terrifying.” Friedman starred in Chicester Festivals’s 1982 production of Jack and the Beanstalk with “greats of comedy” Frankie Howerd and June Whitfield. In Tinsel Town she plays the fairy godmother. Her version of the classic panto goodie? “She loves a drink, she loves a joint, she’s permanently on heat. She really feels she’s in with a shot with Brad.”View image in fullscreenMan and van … Sutherland with Rebel Wilson in Tinsel Town.Photograph: Matt Squire/© Sky UKRebel Wilson cheerily walks on set at the end of the day in a green jumpsuit, charming the crew around her. She plays choreographer Jill, who champions the performance from the stage wings. And yes, she attempts a Yorkshire accent.“The Yorkshire accent is hard,” Wilson admits to me later. “But I tried to do my best!” (Last year, sheconfessed: “I don’t think my Yorkshire accent is that great.”) Her favourite bit of dialect? “My classic Yorkshire line was, ‘Hiya luv!’”. She got into the local spirit by joining Sutherland in loving the local delicacies: “I can’t go past a Greggs sausage roll but I also like their doughnuts any time of the day.”Jill helps Bradley to embrace theatre life. “It was fantastic working with Rebel,” says Sutherland. “Obviously her comedic skills are world renowned but she also brought real heart to the film. I don’t want to speak for her, but I think it was exciting for her on that level.” As well as singing a lively Christmas number for the first time in a film (a good use of his country music success), Sutherland shares a schmaltzy waltz with Wilson: “It was a bit foreign for both of us but I think we had fun.”Wilson is no stranger to pantoland: “I have fun memories of seeing pantomimes in Australia when I was a kid. They were on at our local Returned and Services League club – my relatives fought in the wars. My mum also said that when I was two, she took me to my first pantomime in Sydney. They asked for volunteers from the audience and I ran up on stage and sang a song. She was shocked. I was normally so shy.”What was working with Hollywood stars in Yorkshire like for the rest of the British cast? By all accounts: lovely. “Kiefer actually told us about a great pie shop [in Wetherby],” says Ray Fearon, who plays the baron. “The funniest moment was a scene withMawaan[Rizwan] driving a VW minibus,” addsLucien Laviscount, who plays Prince Charming. “Kiefer was in the front seat – Mawaan hadn’t driven manual for a good few years and tried to get the car started. We’re all in stitches in the back and Kiefer’s just breathing down his neck saying, ‘More gas! More gas!’ He stalled it about eight times.”View image in fullscreen‘Worst fighters’ …  Sutherland fights Danny Dyer in Tinsel Town.Photograph: Sky UKHowever, the best scene for viewers is undoubtedly the pathetic scrap between Sutherland andDanny Dyer, who plays Jill’s troubled hard-man ex. “Danny, I absolutely adore him,” says Sutherland. “He’s known as a tough guy in his films; I had 24 in my back pocket. It was just like, look, the way this is going to be funny is that these two guys really can’t fight very well at all. They’re the worst fighters on the planet but it ended up being one of my favourite fight sequences ever in my career.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Them two got on straight away. We filmed some scenes at [a] Wakefield theatre and in between rehearsals they would go off and fight with a stunt coordinator.”Foggin speaks from his Hertfordshire home over Zoom. After 2022’s This Is Christmas, Tinsel Town is the second festive film from the director, who was born in Sunderland and grew up in Durham. Is he the northern Richard Curtis? “He’s the reason I wanted to make movies. He’s a bit of an idol to me,” Foggin smiles. “When I think of Christmas, I think of Love Actually. I always wanted to make something – and who knows if this is going to be that film – like that: without looking at the TV listings, no matter what happens, Love Actually is always replayed at some point in the Christmas period, and the whole family still gets together to watch it.”View image in fullscreenAlways on the go … Sutherland as Jack Bauer in 24.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarSutherland was the first choice, says Foggin, and he immediately got the assignment: “He’s got a lot of [British] sensibilities.” It makes sense: he was born in London and his grandparents were Scottish (his Falkirk-born politician grandfather, Tommy Douglas, went on to become the “father of universal healthcare” in Canada), which means he’s been back and forth all his life. Wilson, meanwhile, has spent a lot of time in the UK recently. Responding to reports that she has relocated to the Cotswolds, she says she remains rooted in LA. “My family and I love London,” she says. “I’ve been getting into UK TV shows like Slow Horses and Downton Abbey (yes, I know I’m a bit late) and the Celebrity Traitors.”But hold on. Sutherland’s transatlantic background makes an earlier revelation he made even more shocking: “I’ve never seen a pantomime. I was so bummed. We arrived in the first week of January. I dropped my bags off, went for a walk around town, and one of the first things I saw was a big poster for a pantomime. I got so excited: ‘Oh my gosh, I’m gonna go see the panto tonight!’ It was a big part of my research. Of course, it had closed the night before.”There’s always this year though, right? “That I will be able to do.” First though, it’s business as usual in Paris: “I’m about to go to a fight rehearsal for this film I’m doing.”Tinsel Town is on Sky Cinema from 5 December.Explore more on these topicsKiefer SutherlandComedy filmsTelevisionRebel WilsonMeera SyalDanny DyerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianThe actor and crime novelist on telling stories, not slowing down and the lessons his mother taught himGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailBySteve DowFri 28 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTShareBryan Brown gives a barely perceptible nod of welcome after I arrive by ferry at Balmain wharf, as he steps out from under the semicircular roof of the late 19th-century timber shelter here, the last of its kind on Sydney harbour.“How’s it going?” he asks, his Australian drawl at once familiar from his roles in 80-plus films and television series.The actor wears a straw hat and sunglasses with a waist-length jacket partially zipped against a rugged late-afternoon north-westerly. He looks like a mysterious character from his recent career as a writer of crime novels populated by police, perverts and dope peddlers.View image in fullscreenBalmain Power Station in Sydney’s inner west.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The Guardian“I get the ferry from here [to Cockatoo Island] every now and again when I got nothin’ to do,” he says after we walk past hundreds of donated books lining the walls of the shelter, which doubles as a street library.Brown is a “bit of a potterer”. He will have coffee in various shops along these streets before sitting at his desk between 11am and 1pm to write daily for “two hours, no more than that”. His second novel, The Hidden, just released, includes drug running in regional Australia by bikie gangs, hidden cameras and cockfighting.‘It helps disguise me’: Bryan Brown on getting recognised, stolen cars and identifying with objectsRead moreHe insists he doesn’t have a style – though he writes in workmanlike, staccato sentences, emphasising a Strine vernacular. “For the past 50 years, I’ve been telling stories and working in film and television. I work with writers, I do produce as well. So, maybe, that lends itself to how I see stories.” He’s ever curious about people, asking about how I got my start in journalism.Given the windy day, we forgo our mooted plan to walk up along the water edge, instead heading inland up steep, narrow streets past a mix of weatherboards and double-storey Victorian brick terraces. Now a three-times grandfather, Brown is not as tall as you might anticipate given his charismatic screen presence, but at 78 he is lean and agile thanks to stretching, bending and weight resistance each morning, having taken up pilates 10 years ago.There’s a busyness to Brown, his next acting gig always in plain sight. His latest feature,The Travellers, filmed in Western Australia, was released in cinemas in early October, reuniting him with director Bruce Beresford more than 40 years after they madeBreaker Moranttogether. There are plans to make a third series of comedy-mystery Darby and Joan, in which Brown co-stars with Greta Scacchi, with his wife, Rachel Ward, continuing to direct some episodes. “I don’t like the idea of sitting in, stopping or anything,” he reflects. “I don’t even think about not working, you know?”View image in fullscreenBrown writes between 11am and 1pm every day.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianWard, whom Brown met when they were cast together in the 1983 miniseries The Thorn Birds, spends much of her time in the Nambucca Valley, 500km north of here, having turned their one-time pig and cattle property investment into an exercise in regenerative farming.Brown has no plans to go and live permanently in the Nambucca Valley himself, however. “I can’t,” he says. “Well, I mean, maybe one day, but I can’t [now] because I film.”Nambucca is clearly an inspiration for the New South Wales north coast setting for The Hidden. Besides guns being run, there is meth, coke and heroin in the community.“It’s a work of fiction, of course, but you’d be a dope not to know that drugs are in society,” he says in his laid-back, straight-talking way, as we puffily continue our ascent via McDonald Street.“There’s a lot of people struggling with housing, struggling with jobs, and struggles can sometimes lead to people going, ‘I need some relief’ and the next minute they’re into something, and that could be the downward spiral.”Brown, born in 1947, grew up with his sister in Panania, a south-western Sydney suburb, raised by their mother, Molly, whom he sometimes accompanied when she cleaned people’s houses. “She never envied them or anything, she always was admiring that people had done things, but it never made her feel less, you know?”His father, Jack, a salesman, left the family when Brown was a toddler, and the future actor only saw his father again a handful of times. As a child he spun the false story that his father had been killed in the war.Perhaps he was a storyteller of sorts even if he could never imagine being a novelist back then, I suggest after we sit on a park bench.The Travellers review – sentiment smothers Bruce Beresford’s heartfelt filmRead more“Yeah, maybe,” he smiles. “I didn’t want to say the truth, I guess. I don’t know if I was ashamed or went, ‘I’m not going to tell people that I’ve got a dad who’s never at home.’ So, the easiest thing was to say ‘ain’t around’, and [if they asked] ‘what happened?’ ‘Oh, he died in the war.’”Brown then segues into how years later he had to set an old friend straight about this lie. As he talks about this time in his upbringing, he seems a little as though he’s writing a plot twist about a fictional character.At age 20, Brown might have become a salesman himself had he not been invited to audition for an end-of-year review at the AMP insurance company where he’d been working and studying to become an actuary for three years.“I joined an amateur theatre for four years, until I went, bugger this, I’m going off to England to become an actor,” he recalls, frustrated that Australian theatres mostly then favoured British and American plays over local stories anyway. “That comes down to Mum too. Like, ‘Bugger this – you wanna do it, do it properly, get on a plane, go over there, knock on doors.’ I think I found rejection quite easy because I’d been a salesman.”In 1972, Brown went to Britain and “became a Pom” for two-and-a-half years, eventually winning some roles at London’s National Theatre in 1974, returning to Australia for a holiday in 1975 to discover a new wave of Australian voices: David Williamson in theatre, for example, and Fred Schepisi, Phillip Noyce and Bruce Beresford in film. Brown acted in productions for all of them. This new wave brought Brown back to these shores for good.The eccentric character of Fred in Beresford’s new film The Travellers was written especially for Brown, but has elements of Beresford’s own father and story, concerning the tussle that ensues when an artist seeks creative fulfilment on international shores but is cut down as a tall poppy by some when returning to his home town.Whether he is interpreting a character written for him or writing a novel, Brown believes everyone has a story, not least people from working-class communities like the one he grew up in. “Some of the stories just make you stand there with your mouth agape at the struggle that someone’s gone through,” he says. “And they don’t necessarily see that as a story, because they see a story as someone who becomes a fucking billionaire or a massive pop star. They don’t see their own life has a value and a respect, you know?”A large, light brown curly furred canine drops its squeaky play ball at our feet. It has “assistance dog” written on its bib. Brown looks nonplussed at the expectant pooch, so I throw its ball, which it promptly catches and returns, hoping it will be thrown again.View image in fullscreenBrown says there are many untapped stories in working-class communities like the one he grew up in.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianRight now, as we head back down the street towards the wharf, Brown is marvelling at this new vocation of writing stories. A production company has picked up an option on his previous novel, The Drowning, but he won’t be writing the script.“I’m not having anything to do with it,” he insists about any screen adaptation. “I’ve been a producer, where I buy the rights to scripts, and then the writer wants to start putting their two cents in there and be a pain in the arse.”Brown is content right now to bask in being interviewed for audiences about his novels and screen roles on his book tour, happy enough for scriptwriters to run with his own words.“I’m not gonna be the pain in the arse to someone else.”The Hidden by Bryan Brownis out now ($34.99, Allen & Unwin)Explore more on these topicsWalk with ...Australian booksAustralian filmCrime fictionAustralian televisioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Well, not from where I’m standingFri 28 Nov 2025 10.06 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 13.22 ESTShareCrisis? What crisis?British Theatre Before and After Covid, a report released this week, is like a comedy-tragedy mask rendered in academic form. If you look at it one way, you see smiles. Look at it another, you see only things to cry about. The media coverage of the report, by the British Theatre Consortium, focused on the latter, with industry bible the Stage reporting: “‘Sharp decline’ in new plays since Covid.” Between 2019 and 2023, the number of new plays produced dropped by almost 30%. If vindication was needed for much recent angsting about the condition of new writing in UK theatre, this report seems to provide it.So is playwriting in crisis? I’m in a decent position to comment, at least insofar as that question applies in Scotland. I run A Play, a Pie and a Pint (PPP), the Glasgow theatre institution producing more new plays than any other theatre in … Europe? The world? The known universe? (We wait in vain for someone to tell us we’ve been trumped.) Based on our experience – fielding hundreds of scripts a year, producing and touring new plays every week, year-round – there is plenty to be concerned about. But there are also reasons for optimism, some evidenced by the report, which was written by director Dan Rebellato and playwright David Edgar.A healthy culture is one that doesn’t just regurgitate old stories, but tells itself new ones – lots of themThe undeniable bad news is the steep drop in the number of new plays being produced (proportionally higher than the overall decline in theatre production). That corroborates a widespread grassroots sense that opportunities are diminishing for playwrights to get their work staged, and chances shrinking that one might ever make a living as a playwright alone. The report also documents the closure of many smaller theatre spaces, where new plays used to be offered a soft landing. At PPP, we are inundated with plays, and the frustration – particularly among the younger generation – is palpable that beyond Òran Mór, where our work is presented, options for new writers to be staged, or playwrights to develop their craft, are sparse.Why then this tailing off of new play production? It seems likely to be commercial conservatism post-Covid – that notorious idea that audiences are scared of new drama. And here’s where Rebellato and Edgar get more interesting, and substantiate what my daily experience lays bare. Because while there are fewer new plays, “[the] new plays that did get on had longer runs, bigger audiences in bigger houses, and attracted bigger box office income than in 2019”.View image in fullscreenNo fear of novelty … Dancing Shoes at Òran Mór, Glasgow.Photograph: Tommy Ga-Ken WanMore and more people are coming to see new plays. And if we widen our lens to consider new work (including new musicals, devised shows, and original Christmas shows), we see that audiences certainly do not fear novelty. As the report states, new-work attendance accounted for just over 40% of all productions in 2023 – an increase of almost 50% compared to 2019.Isn’t the story then that the demand for new work is soaring – if only we could get it to market? To see the production of new plays slump over that 2019-23 period isn’t just shameful, it’s shortsighted. A healthy culture is one that doesn’t just regurgitate old stories, but tells itself new ones, lots of them – and makes space for new storytellers too. But as this report demonstrates, we shouldn’t be staging new plays for some abstract common good – we should (contrary to received wisdom) be doing it for our bottom lines, too.If you’re a theatre producer heaving yet another Arthur snore Miller or Anton zzzzz Chekhov (just kidding!) on to the stage, because that’s all your audience will accept – well, you’re not doing your job properly. Where is the buzz in theatre? What gets audiences out of their seats? This season, it’s Sophia Chetin-Leuner’sPorn Playat the Royal Court, or Uma Nada-Rajah’s NHS fantasiaBlack Hole Sign, or James Graham’s smash hitPunchon the West End. Or (dare I say) Éimi Quinn’s Hauns Aff Ma Haunted Bin! at PPP – by some measures the biggest-selling show in our 21-year history – orDancing Shoesby Stephen Christopher and Graeme Smith, a feelgood hit so adored by our audiences in the spring it’s being revived for Christmas at the Traverse.At PPP, we stage only world premieres – no old plays allowed – and we get audiences of 150-200 pretty much every lunchtime, six days a week. They come as a habit, for the pies and the craic as well as the plays. And so for thousands of people in the West End of Glasgow, watching new plays is a cheerful part of their everyday life – like reading a book, or switching on the radio, or going to a food market.Cheer is a part of it. Note that the BritishTheatreConsortium classified all new plays as “drama” – overlooking that some may be comedies. (And don’t get me started on classifying Scotland as a “region”). Maybe if we stopped talking about new plays as if they were a penance, the wholefood of the entertainment world, we might attract more people to engage with them. But – judging by these latest findings, and all those millions of people happily flocking to new plays – we’re doing an OK job of that already.Now we just need bolder programming, more confident promotion, and more – lots more – opportunities for writers to present their work on stages big and small, commercial and subsidised, London and beyond. Give them those opportunities and the audiences will follow. The data doesn’t lie!Dancing Shoes is at the Traverse theatre, Edinburgh, 4 to 20 December.Explore more on these topicsTheatreOpinionComedycommentShareReuse this content"

It’s a poem to rest inside, with its gently tumbling sentences and twinkling memories of Christmases past.Emma Rice’s exquisite adaptation shares these qualities. There are just five performers – one pianist and four actors – but they bring a flurry of characters to life. There is a little bit of magic in every scene, all of which glow with a very Thomas-esque combination of hope and melancholy.The ensemble performs in theEmma RiceCompany’s new home, a converted church in Frome. It’s tiny. The audience sits on plastic chairs and – perhaps this is just Thomas’s poem casting its spell on me – but it feels like the memory of past communal gatherings lingers here. When encouraged to join in with the carols, the audience responds quickly and with relish. We throw snowballs and socks at the actors and pass around family photos of the characters in the play, handling them as fondly as if they’re our own.View image in fullscreenPassion and clarity … Katy Owen in A Child’s Christmas in Wales.Photograph: Steve TannerThe stage is backed by two giant weathered wooden doors, with the adults mostly inside and the children on the outside. It’s a doll’s house, a chocolate box theatre, an Advent calendar being opened. Inside sit the uncles and aunts, “like faded cups and saucers”. Outside the kids roam. In one scene, the children walk through the town in the pitch black and imagine dinosaurs roaming the street. The delicious joy of being afraid when you’re young and the relief of returning home (“everything was good again”) radiates from the tiny stage.The ensemble shines. Tom Fox excels at clowning and contorting his face in every way possible; narrator Katy Owen reads Thomas’s poem with such passion and clarity; Robyn Sinclair’s singing has a lovely vulnerability to it; Ian Ross’s songs wind gracefully through the whole production and Simon Oskarsson’s trumpet playing could just about stop time. It isn’t perfect and a framing device about Thomas feels forced and unnecessary. But it isn’t meant to be perfect. It’s Christmas: maddening, difficult and sometimes impossibly sad. Yet somehow still special, full of love, music and moments to remember.AtThe Lucky Chance, Frome, until 21 DecemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreEmma RiceDylan ThomasreviewsShareReuse this content"

A new guidebook from Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore may change his mindAlexis PetridisFri 28 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 08.36 ESTShareIn the 1980s, Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore asked his friend, the writerByron Coley, to furnish him with a selection of jazz tapes to listen to on tour. Moore had experienced New York’s fabled avant-garde jazz loft scene first-hand in the late 1970s but “wasn’t so clued in”, he says. “Perhaps I was too young and too preoccupied by the flurry of activity in punk and no wave.” Now, he was keen to learn more.View image in fullscreen‘Freedom to experiment’ … Thurston Moore.Photograph: Vera MarmeloThe tapes, “of Coltrane, Mingus, Dolphy, Sun Ra, Monk et al”, led him by degrees to free jazz: the style of jazz unmoored from standard rhythms and phrasings, resulting in arguably the most challenging and far-out music one can listen to. “A music both liberated and yet wholly indebted to the learned techniques of its tradition” is how Moore enthusiastically describes it. “In some ways, it’s similar to noise and art rock, where the freedom to experiment with open form comes from a scholarship of the music’s historical lineage … truly a soul music, both political and spiritual.”Moore became a longstanding booster of this music. Sonic Youth played live with fabled avant-garde jazz ensemble the New York Art Quartet, while Moore released free jazz albums on his own Ecstatic Peace! label. His latest project is the bookNow Jazz Now: 100 Essential Free Jazz and Improvisation Recordings 1960-80, co-written with Coley and Swedish saxophonist Mats Gustafsson.An attempt to counter what he calls “dry and academic writing” on the subject – “enthusiasm is key, we didn’t want to couch it in too much of a smarty-pants vibe” – the book is intended to introduce the music to a broader audience. It is beautifully assembled, featuring some fabulously engaging two-fisted writing (“Many listeners deny it’s jazz of any kind,” offers the entry for a 1980 album byBorbetomagus, “but those bow-tie ass-wipes can take a flying fuck at the moon”) and it comes with a foreword by Neneh Cherry. She grew up with many of the albums mentioned in the book, thanks to her stepfather, Don Cherry, a trumpeter who worked with Ornette Coleman, the saxophonist who invented the term free jazz with the 1961 album of the same name. “I feel that I know free jazz as a spirit,” she writes. “I’ve thought about it as a commitment and a necessity, such as food.”View image in fullscreenDon Cherry at the Louvre, 1967.Photograph: © Philippe Gras/Courtesy of Suong GrasNevertheless, it’s tempting to say that Moore and co have their work cut out for them. Free jazz, Moore says, “was critically derided”, often described as “noise, or nonsense”. NowJazzNow recommends Free Fall, a 1963 album by Jimmy Giuffre, a celebrated west coast clarinettist and key figure in the development of “cool” jazz, but notes that its release was “a complete commercial failure … Giuffre took a 10-year hiatus from recording afterwards”. He also disbanded the trio who made it after a gig at which they made 35 cents each. Early on, major labels and august jazz institutions, including Impulse!, were willing to dabble, but very swiftly it became the province of tiny independents and musicians self-releasing their work.Decades later, it still seems to carry a uniquely forbidding aura to the average listener, as Joakim Haugland – who runs the Oslo-based label Smalltown Supersound – attests. A Sonic Youth fan, he discovered free jazz via an album Moore released –Arthur Doyle’s Alabama Feeling– and was instantly smitten, recognising the same unpredictablility he’d found at punk and alt-rock gigs. “I had become very tired of live gigs, because I felt they were more of the same: people were dressing up and doing the right moves,” he says. “Free jazz is something created on the spot; you can recognise when it works and doesn’t work. I love the fact that some parts of the concert are 100% connected and sometimes they drift apart. It’s about feelings, physicality, happening in the moment.”Haugland’s label is best known for releasing dance music, by Lindstrøm, Todd Terje and Kelly Lee Owens, among others. It also releases a lot of free jazz, but “not because it’s selling; it’s something I need to do for myself”. He has also published a book on the subject, Johannes Rød’s exhaustiveFree Jazz and Improvisation on LP and CD 1965-2024. But, as Haugland cheerfully admits: “I almost always play free jazz in hiding, when I’m alone, because people think I’m mad to listen to it, that it’s impossible to like. There’s an old expression: ‘It sounds like Polish free jazz or something.’ Like ‘Polish free jazz’ was the worst thing in the world.”I know what he means. I am not a listener who requires music to be melodic or rhythmically straightforward. I am the proud owner of the notorious Swans live albumPublic Castration Is a Good Idea– the original, I might add, not the recent reissue – and an 11-album box set of recordings from the extreme electronic labelCome Organisation, hours of wilfully hideous noise for which I happily shelled out nearly 300 quid a few years back. I genuinely love Lou Reed’s Metal Machine Music and prefer Yoko Ono’s early 70s albums to those of her husband. And I love jazz, a late-flowering passion, and not just the perennially hip stuff: I’m as happy listening to Fats Waller or Duke Ellington’s late 20s Columbia recordings as I am Bitches Brew or Coltrane’s Africa/Brass. And yet, somehow, free jazz has remained a closed book to me.View image in fullscreen‘Furious and unremitting’ … Peter Brötzmann live at Cafe Oto, London, 10 February 2023.Photograph: Dawid Laskowski/The GuardianBoth Moore and Haugland are kind enough to offer recommendations for a relative neophyte. Moore suggestsMachine Gun by the Peter Brötzmann Octetor Afrodisiaca byJohn Tchicai and Cadentia Nova Danica. Haugland opts forJoe McPhee’s Tenor, which he describes as “poetry; I feel like McPhee is pouring his whole soul through the saxophone”, andSilent Tongues, a 1975 live album by pianist Cecil Taylor, a titanic figure in free jazz. (If you want an idea of how reviled the genre is in some quarters, hasten to Ken Burns’ epic, beautifully researched, hugely illuminating but crushingly conservative 2001 documentary series Jazz, in which Taylor’s approach to music is dismissed as “bullshit”). “I love to listen to it on low volume, as it fills my living room with an emotion I cannot describe,” says Haugland. “To me it is relaxing and beautiful.”Peter Brötzmann obituaryRead moreI’d heard of Brötzmann’s Machine Gun, an album preceded by its reputation as a particularly confrontational listen, but even one of the best-known free jazz albums is harder to find than you’d think: it’s been removed from streaming services and YouTube, and vinyl pressings are the province of secondhand retailers. I eventually find it on the Internet Archive, and discover that its advance publicity was not exaggerated. It’s furious and completely unremitting, like a bomb that won’t stop going off for the best part of an hour.And yet I don’t find it unlistenable at all, perhaps because I can contextualise it culturally. Brötzmann was part of the same artistic ferment that gave the world krautrock, and Machine Gun strikes me as grappling with the same issues as Can or Faust: how to make original music, with an identity distinct from Anglo-American musical traditions, in a country whose own sense of national identity had been horribly scarred. Its sound also seems to speak loudly of the tumult and upheaval of 1968, which means it works perfectly amid the tumult of 2025. And if you like Haugland’s idea of free jazz as analogous to the unpredictable wildness of a punk gig, well, here’s the evidence.It also works as a kind of palate cleanser: everything else I’m recommended feels positively dulcet by comparison, a breeze. On Afrodisiaca’s 21-minute title track, long passages of solo trumpet or fluttering woodwind give way to ominous silences or explosive, rattling crescendos, to startling effect. The tracks on side two feel less structured, but they never completely give up on the idea of melody.View image in fullscreen‘Fascinating complexity’ … Cecil Taylor.Photograph: INA/Getty ImagesI try Cecil Taylor’s Silent Tongues on low volume, as recommended, but that doesn’t work at all. It’s too complex and distracting to act as ambient music. Nevertheless, there’s something fascinating about its complexity – and as with Brötzmann in post-Nazi Germany, there is a political implication to Black artists determinedly expressing their freedom in a US that so often denied it.The astonishingly dextrous runs on Silent Tongues’ Jitney No 2 show incredible artistic technique being put to an alternative use. I don’t respond to it in the purely emotional way Haugland does, but it draws me closer to what Moore said about free jazz being “wholly indebted to the learned techniques of its tradition”. It’s not so much musicians doing exactly what they want, more that they are guided through the idea of free self-expression by what they already know – a useful corrective to the commonly held notion that it’s a racket anyone could make.‘It didn’t adhere to any of the rules’: the fascinating history of free jazzRead moreBut with Joe McPhee’s Tenor, I do get that instinctive emotional response. The sound of McPhee playing, unaccompanied, in a Swiss farmhouse, it is immediately and completely spellbinding. It shifts from a kind of melancholy, bluesy lyricism to piercing discordancy, carrying you along with them. However far out it gets, nothing about it feels jarring or difficult – the opposite of Machine Gun, which feels like being pinned against the wall. You’d have to pick your moment and mood with the latter – not that I have a problem with that – but not with Tenor: you could call it beautiful without fear of being seen as deliberately contrary.I’m not sure how many of the other albums in Now Jazz Now would fit that description, but, in Thurston Moore’s view at least, exploration is the point. “The records are the research,” he says, “and the research is the spirit of so much of this music’s essential vocabulary. Research and reveal and join the revolution of the free!” Perhaps I will.Now Jazz Now: 100 Essential Free Jazz and Improvisation Recordings 1960-80 is published by Ecstatic Peace Library on 5 December.

Ancient Greek artists competed to paint the most accurate bunch of grapes and depictions of foodstuffs decorated houses in Pompeii. The genre was revived around 1600 by artists including Caravaggio and Jan Brueghel the Elder. By the time this was painted in 17th-century Amsterdam there was a flourishing market for pictures with no story, no symbolic meaning – just a finely focused attention to the yellow of lemon peel, the way light is held by a wine glass, the silvery glint of opened oyster shells. This humble arrangement of food and drink is actually a humblebrag: oysters may not have been so hard to come by in the sea-surrounded Netherlands but lemons were posh in northern Europe four centuries ago, and that’s no common wine glass but a richly made, expensive one. So with quiet spiritual calm, a merchant might contemplate this image of passing pleasures and earthly wealth, and look forward to supper.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get in touchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To her right, a boy’s face is frozen in a Greek tragedy mask of pain. To her left, two other Vietnamese children run away from the bombed village of Trảng Bàng. Behind them, an indistinguishable group of soldiers and, behind them, a wall of black smoke.‘The public has been lied to’: secretly made documentary insists that aliens existRead moreWithin hours of publication in June 1972, the photo, officially titled The Terror of War but colloquially known as Napalm Girl, went the analog version of viral; seen and discussed by millions of people around the world, it’s widely credited with galvanizing public opinion against the US war in Vietnam. Susan Sontag laterwrotethat the horrifically indelible image of nine-year-old Kim Phúc in distress “probably did more to increase the public revulsion against the war than a hundred hours of televised barbarities”. Sir Don McCullin, the legendary British photojournalist who covered the conflict, deemed it the single best photograph of what would later be called “The Television War”. Napalm Girl is, “simply put, one of the most important photographs of anything ever made, and certainly of the Vietnam war”, said Gary Knight, a British photojournalist with decades of combat photography experience.For 53 years, Napalm Girl was credited to Huynh Cong “Nick” Út, a then-21-year-old South Vietnamese photojournalist working for the Associated Press in Saigon. But a controversial new documentary onNetflixargues that the iconic photograph long considered the pinnacle of war journalism – one which brought Út a Pulitzer prize, amid other international acclaim – was actually taken by a different man on the scene in Trảng Bàng that day.According to The Stringer, directed by Bao Nguyen and narrated by Knight, the Terror of War was actually taken by a freelancer, or “stringer”, who sold his photos to the AP. The claim, and the film’s subsequent investigation, originates with a man named Carl Robinson, a former AP photo editor in Saigon who alleges that Horst Faas, the bureau’s legendarily domineering photo chief, ordered him to change the image’s credit from the stringer to Út, the only AP staff photographer on site that day.Robinson, now in his 80s, emailed Knight out of the blue in 2022, seeking a journalist’s help in finding the unknown photographer – should he still be alive, he said, he wanted to offer an apology. Knight thought of the freelance photojournalists he met through his non-profit, the VII Foundation – “the stringers of today”, who, like Vietnamese freelancers during the war, are “often overlooked. Their work is often questioned. They work under much more difficult circumstances. They’re not insured. They don’t have pensions. They don’t have support. They often don’t have good equipment, and they are incredibly vulnerable photographing in their own communities.”Knight wondered: “What must it feel like to be the man who took this photograph, if indeed Nick Út didn’t take it?” As a photographer, he imagined, it would be extraordinarily painful. As a student of photojournalism, particularly the vaunted war photography of Vietnam, it would be earth-shattering, perhaps reputation-threatening. The hallowed legacy of the photograph among Vietnamese-Americans is such that Nguyen, whose parents emigrated during the war, was hesitant to take on the project. “I didn’t want to disrupt this long-held narrative that Nick had taken the photograph,” he said. “And I didn’t want to disrupt the status quo of a community that always looked up to this achievement.”But both Knight and Nguyen agreed: it was worth asking the question. “If journalists are going to hold everybody else in the world to account,” said Knight, “we have to be able to ask difficult questions of ourselves.”The Stringer follows Knight, along with fellow journalists Fiona Turner, Terri Lichstein and Lê Vân, as they pursue their own investigation, from eyewitness interviews, to call-outs in present-day Ho Chi Minh City, to archival research from other footage taken that day (the film-makers say they were not given access to the AP’s archive). Their efforts eventually yield a name: Nguyễn Thành Nghệ, a driver for NBC that day who occasionally sold photographs to international news outlets as a freelancer. In the film, an emotional Nghệ, now also in his 80s and living in California, attests that he sold the photograph to the AP for $20 and a print, only to be haunted by the lack of credit for decades.Nghệ appears, in the film, reserved and thoughtful, but his story proved incendiary within the world of photojournalism. Days before The Stringer’spremiereat the Sundance film festival in January – in which an emotional Nghệ appeared as a surprise guest, assuring through a translator that “I took the photo” – the AP published alengthy reportdisputing the film’s account via its own internal analysis, describing Robinson as a “disgruntled” former employee, and standing by Út, who retired from a distinguished career with the organization in 2017. Several prominent photojournalists dismissed Nghệ’s claim outright, and campaigned against the film’s distribution; others expressed concern, given the current political environment, over any challenge to journalistic credibility. “We had people suggesting that we should drop the investigation because it was a bad time for journalism,” Knight recalled. “But when is there ever a good time?”View image in fullscreenKim Phuc, center, runs with her brothers and cousins, followed by South Vietnamese forces, down Route 1 near Trảng Bàng after a South Vietnamese plane accidentally dropped its flaming napalm on its own troops and civilians on 8 June 1972.Photograph: Nick Ut/AP“The investigation has to live independently of those kinds of concerns,” he added. “The process of self-examination might be inconvenient, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be done.”In May, the AP released a more extensive report andvisual analysiswith new insights – for one, as argued in The Stringer, the photograph was probably captured by a Pentax camera, not a Leica as Út has long claimed. The internal study, based on “extensive visual analysis, interviews with witnesses and examination of all available photos” concluded that it was “possible” Út took the photo. “None of this material proves anyone else did,” the AP said, thus the findings did not meet the “definitive evidence” required by its standards to change the credit. (Út, who declined to participate in The Stringer, has categorically denied the film’s claims, maintained authorship, and threatened to sue for defamation.)Days later, World Press Photo, which awarded Napalm Girl the 1973 Photo of the Year award,releasedits own independent investigation concluding that two people – Nghệ and photographer Huỳnh Công Phúc – were better positioned to take the photo. The organization rescinded Út’s credit but left official authorship unknown, with an open-ended epigraph: “This remains contested history, and it is possible that the author of the photograph will never be fully confirmed.”Findings from both investigations, including details from the AP’s archive, were used to refine the film’s own forensic analysis, conducted independently by the French NGOIndex. The final version, updated from the one screened at Sundance, finds that, based on images taken by and of Út that day, the AP photographer would have had to sprint about 560ft forward, snap the famous photo, then run back 250ft, then turn around to be seen walking toward NBC News cameramen – “an extremely implausible scenario”. Nghệ, they conclude, was in the right position for the shot.All this may seem, to outsiders, like splitting fine hairs, unnecessarily digging into the second-by-second, frame-by-frame, meter-by-meter minutiae for a photograph whose authenticity and import remains unquestioned. Indeed, reading each report, with its flurry of details and assumptions, can feel more confusing than clarifying. But the film-makers maintain that the quest of The Stringer was never about official reattributions – rather, honest reappraisals. Nguyen sees Nghệ as part of a “generation of Vietnamese who left their lives behind, and carried their stories quietly”, and who “still believe that they don’t have the agency and the space to talk about their stories from the past. In many ways, this film was about reclaiming that space, for dignity and truth and memory that is often neglected.”View image in fullscreenNguyễn Thành Nghệ on stage during a Q&A for a screening of The Stringer in Los Angeles, California, on 19 November.Photograph: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for Film IndependentView image in fullscreenNguyễn Thành Nghệ at Sundance.Photograph: Maya Dehlin Spach/Getty Images“I have the utmost respect for AP and news organizations that have upheld journalism for over a century,” he added. “And so I hope that we all can look deep inside ourselves and have a reckoning when it’s necessary.”The Stringer posits a number of overlapping, murky factors for the alleged misattribution: that the Saigon bureau was cutthroat and competitive; that stringers operate on the margins of the profession; that Faas felt some guilt over sending Út’s older brother, Huỳnh Thanh Mỹ, to his death on AP combat assignment in 1965; that Faas could get away with keeping the credit in-house because Vietnamese journalists – particularly non-employees such as Nghệ – were, as Knight put it, “outsiders in their own country” without leverage or recourse.Knight cited a recent event with journalists in London, in which he asked attenders if they knew the names of any Vietnamese war journalists besides Nick Út. None of them did. “To be fair, I couldn’t name anyone other than Nick Út before I started this story, and I’m a student of that war,” he said. “But dozens and dozens of them were working for the foreign press.”Part of the film’s mission, he said, was to re-examine the narration of history – how the story is told, who is doing the telling, who is given the credit. “Vietnamese journalists have really been erased from the narration of their own war,” said Knight. “And I hope that this story won’t only start to rebalance that a little bit, but will also demand of the audience that we examine who is telling today’s stories, and where the power structures in journalism lie.”Both Nguyen and Knight state, for the record, that they have little doubt as to the authorship of the famous photo. But regardless of one’s view, Nguyen said, “I hope people come in watching the film with an open heart and open mind. I think individuals like Nghệ deserve that.”The Stringer: The Man Who Took the Photo is out on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsVietnam warNetflixSundance film festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Illustrations spark young imaginations, solve problems, present information - and shape our world, says the children’s author on National Illustration DayFri 28 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 11.15 ESTShareSince the origin of our species, humans have tried to make sense of chaos, to understand ourselves, and – at least until the divisiveness of social media – to understand each other. We have always relied on communication to do this. And thousands of years before we had written language, and possibly before even complex spoken language, we used pictures.This makes sense: as children, we learn to read facial expressions, body language and images long before we learn to read words. We all grow up with an instinctive urge to make visual marks and tell stories. If constellations were humanity’s first attempt to understand the universe, then they were also our first illustrated stories. Humans are and have always been a story-driven species, and we tell these stories in myriad ways.So, what is thestoryof illustration?View image in fullscreenHarry Beck’s 1930s London underground map.Photograph: Reproduced with permission of Transport for London (TfL).Before we answer that, we should first define what illustration is. As someone who has, for decades, been an illustrator, an artist, a storyteller – and several other titles, I may be reasonably placed to attempt an answer.For many people, illustration is simply a set of pictures that accompany or clarify a text or idea. But that mindset overlooks the speed, agility, draftsmanship and tactile intelligence required to make an illustrationwork. It also ignores how effective it is as a communication tool.Anyone who has ever referred to a safety card on an aeroplane, navigated an unfamiliar city using a subway map, or followed a visual guide to assemble flat-pack furniture understands the power of images to communicate quickly and clearly.View image in fullscreenAn American wartime propaganda poster,  1943.Photograph: US National Archives/AlamyAnd this is before we even discuss the emotional weight and beauty of this art. Whoever coined the phrase “never judge a book by its cover” clearly doesn’t participate much in society – as we all judge covers, every day. Presentation matters.As the art of illustration has advanced over the last several generations – often edging closer to its nearest bedfellow, fine art – and as technology and the rise of AI cast an uncertain mist over its future, perhaps now is the moment to reconsider the role of illustration in modern culture and what distinguishes “art” from “illustration”.In illustration, the objective is usually to visually solve other people’s problems, whereas in art you invent your own problems and rarely solve them. In illustration, financial compensation is generally agreed before the mark-making begins and someone gives you approval – a thumbs up, so to speak; in art, you marinate perpetually in existential self-doubt. You make the work and then figure out how (or if) you’ll get paid.Where they donotdiffer is in the visual success they have in making us feel something. Whether that something is simple comprehension, love, horror, deliberate confusion, disgust or joy is secondary to the reality – that they are generally marks made by people and intended to be viewed and interpreted by other people.View image in fullscreen‘One city, Five Hours: Paris’ from a series of maps that Oliver Jeffers created for United Airlines inflight magazine, Hemisphere.Illustration: unknown/Oliver JeffersThe idea of “art” as we know it today has also evolved dramatically over generations. Much of what we now classify as art was, in practice, closer to illustration when it was created. Think of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel, or much Renaissance work, and how easily it fits the distinctions above. The concept of individual mark-making as a financially rewarding and celebrated expression of a single person is relatively new; the notion of art as an industry is only a century or two old.In the end, perhaps one traditional distinction remains useful: art is often created to be encountered as a unique original, while illustration is frequently designed with reproduction in mind.We have countless centres championing art throughout the world – museums and galleries, as they’re better known – and it is long overdue that the UK has a centre dedicated to championing illustration, how it has helped shaped our idea of our world, and the role it will assume in an unknown future. As a board member of the soon-to-openQuentin Blake Centre for Illustration,I’m proud to say that is exactly what is happening. Andon the UK’s National Illustration Day, it’s worth pausing to think about the role illustration plays in our culture, and why it matters now more than ever.View image in fullscreenA cartoon by Abu Abraham for the Observer, 29 March 1959, depicting a pastiche of the legend of the three wise monkeys who hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil with Mao Zedong, preventing Indian PM, Jawaharlal Nehru from taking action in support of Tibet.Illustration: Abu Abraham/The ObserverFor many, “illustration” conjures nostalgia for children’s books. And yes, these are vital; they are often a child’s first encounter with their cultural world, and the physical archive of the powerful bond between parent and child. But illustration extends far beyond childhood. It has shaped the world we recognise: wartime propaganda, the branding boom of the 1950s, political satire, fashion, advertising. A lecturer once told me you can learn more about a decade from its adverts than from its articles. Illustration has always been the visual record of how we aspire to live, and what we hope to pass on.Modern illustration was born of the Industrial Revolution and reached its full power in the age of mass production. And as industry changes, so does the illustrator’s role. AI now threatens to make creativity accessible to the wealthy while making wealth inaccessible to the creative. But is this really the future that awaits? I don’t fully believe so. I certainly don’t hope so.View image in fullscreenArtistry worth celebrating … a 1962 advertisement designed by George Him.Photograph: The Estate of George HimWhile the invention of cars did by and large eradicate the need for horseshoe makers, it also created a swathe of new jobs for mechanics. Illustrators will need to adapt, for sure, but photography did not replace painting. Video didn’t kill the radio star. The art of illustration will not be replaced by machines.Just as the NFT bubble burst when people realised they don’t necessarily feel a human connection with something so … well … digital, we are already beginning to see a small but steady return to the handmade. Yes, AI means that a large portion of editorial and advertising visuals will be taken away from humans – temporarily anyway – and given to machines (creating huge opportunities for creative writers, however – the result is only as good as the prompt in AI). But we as a species will always have a need to visually clarify, connect and communicate on a human level and children’s books, album art, theatre posters, protest placards and the visual languages we build together all ultimately exist closer to the centre of the human experience than to the machine experience.View image in fullscreen‘An Artist Rethinks Climate Change in Words and Pictures’ by Oliver Jeffers to illustrate his opinion essay in the New York Times, October 2024.Illustration: Oliver JeffersMaya Angelou was right: people seldom remember what you said, but they remember how you made them feel.That, ultimately, is illustration’s power. And it’s why I am excited about the beginning of a national institution dedicated to visual literacy – especially in an age of misinformation – and about a permanent home where every facet of illustration can be explored, celebrated and understood.

The film is long, atmospheric and as ponderous as the taciturn antihero Meursault, played by Benjamin Voisin, a French settler in Algiers.His failure to show emotion after his mother’s death and cold detachment after he kills “an Arab” on a beach sees him condemned to death by decapitation.In 1967, the Italian director Luchino Visconti made the first film of the novel, starring Marcello Mastroianni, but it was viewed as a failure. Visconti had wanted Alain Delon in the role but was reportedly overruled by the film studio.Nedjib Sidi Moussa, a political scientist, teacher and author of several books on Algeria, said the new film succeeded in conveying the absurdity of Camus’s first novel.“Ozon was faithful to the text in that he accurately conveyed what L’Étranger is: a novel of the absurd. Meursault is not condemned to death for killing an Arab. Colonial justice would not condemn a European to death for killing an indigenous person.“Meurseult is condemned for his indifference, for not crying at his mother’s death, because he has an extramarital relationship and is an atheist. All this clashes with the values of European colonial society and this is why he is condemned. L’Étranger isn’t an anti-colonialist manifesto, Camus is painting a picture of a society he knows well.”View image in fullscreenLuchino Visconti directs Marcello Mastroianni in the first film of the novel, released in 1967.Photograph: ScreenProd/Photononstop/AlamyCamus, who won the 1957 Nobel prize in literature, was born in French Algeria topied noirparents–of French and European descent, born under French colonial rule. As a French citizen, even a poor one, he would have enjoyed rights not afforded to the country’s majority Arabs or Berbers.Sidi Moussa said Ozon had made subtle references to the dehumanising side of colonial society, for colonised and coloniser.“The film is daring and faithful to the book in that respect and with these little personal touches it reconstructs the story to speak to today’s audiences. It’s pretty well done from that point of view,” he said.A review by the cinema programmerJacques Déniel for Causeur magazinewas less enthusiastic.“Ozon’s adaptation fluctuates between a certain fidelity – Mersault’s indifference and lack of human compassion – and blatant betrayal owing to its lack of metaphysical ambition and its politically correct interpretation of the novel,” Déniel wrote.View image in fullscreenOzon’s L’Étranger stars Rebecca Marder and Benjamin Voisin.Photograph: BFA/Gaumont/Alamy“In Camus’s work, absurdity springs from the clash between man and the world. In Ozon’s work, it dissolves into a seamless mise-en-scène. François Ozon’s L’Étranger is a polished, thoughtful, masterful film, but one that lacks inspiration. The film-maker does not adapt Camus: he comments on him.”Catherine Brun, a professor of literature at the Sorbonne, said L’Étranger continued to divide French society because the story was opaque.“The novel remains an enigma on to which everyone can project their own interpretations. Much like Camus,” she said. “It is as much about what is not said; the silences in the book over the question of French colonialism over which there is no consensus.”View image in fullscreenAlbert Camus, photographed in October 1957.Photograph: Smith Archive/AlamyBrun added: “With L’Étranger, Camus can be seen as being on either side of the polemic. He mirrors the tensions and contradictions. Everyone finds something in it to back their argument or settle scores. Nobody can have the last word. As a subject it is inexhaustible.”Camus died in a car crash in January 1960 aged 46. Catherine Camus, 80, his daughter and the custodian of his work, said she liked the film, though she also thought Ozon had fallen victim to political correctness in playing up the role of the murdered Arab’s sister, called Djemila. In the novel neither are named; in the film, the final shot is of her at her brother’s grave marked with his name in Arabic, Moussa Hamdani.“I thought the film was very good but not the role he gave the sister at the end,” Camus said. “She is shown at her brother’s grave; this is not in the book and I felt it was a contradiction. I think François Ozon did it to satisfy wokeism.”Ozon visited Catherine Camus’s home in the village of Lourmarin in Vaucluse, where the author had lived and worked, and told journalists he persuaded her to trust him with the adaptation. “I was very happy about that because I knew she had turned down other film-makers. I was aware of the responsibility that fell on me,” he said.View image in fullscreenFrançois Ozon, Rebecca Marder and Benjamin Voisin attend the film’s premiere at the Venice film festival in September.Photograph: Abaca Press/AlamyIn a statement to theEuropean Film Awards, Ozon said: “It was a huge challenge to adapt a masterpiece that everyone has read and every reader has already visualised and staged in their own mind.”He said giving the Arab’s sister greater presence in the film felt like “pulling on a thread that Camus had woven without developing”.“Djemila … has a conscience and a voice in the film. She is there to bear witness to the fact that, in this story and at the trial, her brother is never mentioned, even though he is the one who was murdered,” he said.“It was important, through her character, to stage how the Arab is rendered invisible, to show that two worlds lived side by side without seeing each other. They did not mix on the streets or the beach. And they certainly did not have the same status. Camus was aware of this unease between the two communities.”Explore more on these topicsFrançois OzonAlbert CamusColonialismAlgeriaFranceEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Live music should be affordable and accessible and we need to find a new way of making that possible. BE BETTER.”Ticketmaster initially replied: “We support artists’ ability to set the terms of how their tickets are sold and resold. @OliviaDeano, we will cap resale prices on our site at face value and hope other resale sites will follow.”The ticketing company subsequently said it is in the process of “refunding fans for any markup they already paid to resellers on Ticketmaster”.In a statement, Michael Rapino, CEO of Ticketmaster’s parent company Live Nation Entertainment, said: “We share Olivia’s desire to keep live music accessible and ensure fans have the best access to affordable tickets. While we can’t require other marketplaces to honour artists’ resale preferences, we echo Olivia’s call to ‘do better’ and have taken steps to lead by example.”Reselling tickets for profit to be outlawed in UK government crackdownRead moreDean subsequently posted on Instagram, in part addressing her fellow artists: “Touts steal from artists and they steal from fans. They create inequality and hysteria. I am lucky to have had an education about the complexities and corruption of ticketing from @dicefm and will always choose to partner with them where we can. But know that you have power with other partners.“Capping resale at face value is your right and we have a duty to encourage a fair resale market. We are often made to feel we don’t have a choice but there is always space to ask why and it is always your right to say no!”The UK government recently confirmed that it would make it illegal for tickets to live entertainment and sport events to be resold for more than their original cost, after lobbying from acts including Coldplay and Dua Lipa.Dean is the UK’s biggest breakout artist of the year. She has four singles in the UK Top 20 – chart rules only allow three as a solo artist, but one of them, Rein Me In, is a duet with Sam Fender. Her second album,The Art of Loving, has also spent eight weeks in the Top 5 after debuting at No 1.Explore more on these topicsMusicTicketmasterPop and rockTicket pricesConsumer affairsOlivia DeannewsShareReuse this content"

The new English-language lyrics were written by Peter Gabriel.Eno said in a statement: “After a year defined by unimaginable loss, grief and injustice, we want to end with an act of love for Palestine’s children. Lullaby reflects their beauty, their longing and their hope. If we rally together and download it, we have a real shot at landing Christmas No 1 – and turning that moment into vital life-saving support for Gaza’s families.”Released on 12 December, it will raise money for the Choose Love charity’s Together for Palestine Fund, which supports Palestinian-led frontline organisations such as Taawon, the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund and the Palestine Medical Relief Society.View image in fullscreen‘An act of love for Palestine’s children’ … the artwork for Lullaby.Illustration: Malak MattarThe song was arranged and recomposed by Kieran Brunt and Nai Barghouti, and also features Amena El Abd, Dan Smith of Bastille, Lana Lubany, London Community Gospel Choir, Sura Abdo, Tyson, Yasmeen Ayyashi and Ysee, along with Brunt and Barghouti .Barghouti, who is Palestinian, said: “This lullaby from our Palestinian musical heritage has been with me since early childhood. Today, it returns at a much-needed time as a reminder of what Palestinians will never lose: hope, defiance, beauty, and dignity.”The artwork is by Gazan painter Malak Mattar.Mabel said: “The song holds a special place for many reasons, but mostly as it’s the first time I’ve sung with both my mum, Neneh, and sister, Tyson, and for it to be a traditional lullaby in tribute to the mothers and children of Gaza means the world. I hope you feel the strength in our voices.”The organisers are urging fans topreorder the singleto help its push for Christmas No 1. Its current competitors are Kylie Minogue, whose song XMAS was recorded exclusively for Amazon Music – and is the first track played if Alexa users request Christmas music – Denise Welch’s Slayyy Bells, and the usual suspects of Wham! and Mariah Carey.The UK’s Christmas No 1 will be announced on 19 December.Explore more on these topicsMusicBrian EnoPalestineNeneh CherryNadine ShahCelesteGazanewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: KanalKanal is 95% complete and on schedule but plans to slash its budget mean conversation around its opening have moved from ‘when’ to ‘if’ByPhilip OltermannEuropean culture editorFri 28 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 07.19 ESTShareA year before its scheduled opening on 28 November 2026, building works atKanal, a new contemporary art museum in Brussels, are running on time.Housed in a remodelled former Citroën garage on the north-western edge of the city centre, the centre is 95% complete. Curators are putting the finishing touches to an opening show that will feature works by Matisse, Picasso and Giacometti on loan from the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Trilingual wall texts in English, Dutch and French have already been signed off.With 12,500 sq metres of exhibition space over five floors, an architecture centre, restaurants and live performance venues, themuseum will be bigger than the original Tate Modern in London, thePalais de Tokyoin Paris and the Guggenheim Bilbao. The investment reflects a will to turn the administrative capital of Europe into a cultural destination in its own right.But in recent weeks, the conversation around Kanal’s opening has moved from “when” to “if”. A year and a half on from Belgian regional elections, a functioning government for the semi-autonomous Brussels-Capital region is still nowhere in sight. The only certainty seems to be the predicted austerity measures and mooted plans to slash Kanal’s budget by more than half.“We never anticipated that 12 months before opening, and 18 months after the election, there would be no government,” said the museum’s director,Kasia Redzisz. “If there isn’t a decision on the budget, we risk having to stop construction, threatening the entire project’s future.”Plans to equip the Belgian capital with a museum that doesn’t just showcase but also collects contemporary art go back at least a quarter of a century. Neither Brussels’ modern art gallery Wiels nor the more classical Bozar Centre for Fine Arts have their own collections. In the absence of such an institution, collections by significant Belgian artists such as Marcel Broodthaers have beenbought by MoMAin New York and shipped to the US.In 2001, the American curator Michael Tarantino was recruited to head up an arts centre but the project was hampered by political infighting and shelved afterTarantino’s death in 2003.Thirteen years later, under the watch of the governing socialist PS party, a compromise was reached to transform the 1934-built former Citroën garage on the Place de l’Yser into Kanal.The sheer scale of the plans drew criticism from the outset.View image in fullscreenThe formalised partnership with the Centre Pompidou in Paris, limited to five years, will cost Brussels €2m a year.Photograph: Secchi Smith for Atelier Kanal“It’s a nation state-sized project done by a regional government, a technocratic decision that has been amplified out of all proportion by consultants and advisers,” said Dirk Snauwaert, the director ofWiels, which does not receive structural financial support from the Brussels region. “Who thinks this is doable?”The formalised partnership with the Centre Pompidou, limited to five years after Kanal’s opening, will cost Brussels €2m (£1.75m) a year. The connection with the Paris arts complex has been greeted with scepticism by some Flemish speakers, who make up 60% of Belgium’s population but who are a minority in the capital, raising suspicions of French colonial attitudes.“Kanal is a really significant project, but the relationship with the Pompidou was complicated and confusing from the outset,” said Chris Dercon, the Belgian former director of Tate Modern who now runsFondation Cartierin Paris. “Why do we need the Pompidou collection in Brussels when we have some of the best private collections in Europe right here in Belgium?”Kanal’s supporters say such controversies are inevitable for a project with global ambitions and that similar objections were levelled at arts centres now seen as indispensable to the fabric of their cities such as Tate Modern and Paris’s own Centre Pompidou.Redzisz said that Kanal, under her leadership, would focus on championing contemporary artists who were either born in or who live in Belgium, and said the museum would create 780 direct and indirect jobs and inject €144.4m into the Brussels economy every year.The arts complex includes 20,000 sq metres of public space and a playground designed by the Turner prize-winning collectiveAssemble. Kanal has also organised workshops to prepare children from 27 nearby schools for the opening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will have to see what is possible with a smaller budget.”According to reports in the newspaper L’Echo, the liberal party MR has proposed reducing Kanal’s €35m annual operating budget by 60%, though it has not made this proposal official.Wiels’s Snauwaert is urging officials to find savings in the costly tie-in with the Pompidou. “We all hope our money won’t be wasted,” he said. “But the wise decision would be to cut ties with the Pompidou and invest the money in culture instead.”Redzisz said: “There is a new fiscal reality, which we understand, and we are prepared to take a cut like everyone else.“I still believe that politicians will realise the huge potential of this project as a destination, as a landmark for Brussels. Abandoning Kanal now would amount to cultural suicide.”This article was amended on 28 November 2025. An earlier version said Kanal will be bigger than the Tate Modern; in fact, it will be larger than the original Tate Modern before its extension in 2016.Explore more on these topicsBelgiumEuropeMuseumsArtHeritagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

You got naggy’: Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater on power, combovers and Blue MoonXan BrooksAhead of their 11th movie together, the actor and director discuss musicals, the legacy of Philip Seymour Hoffman and what being bald and 5ft tall does to your flirting skillsFri 28 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 28 Nov 2025 05.36 ESTShare‘Ilike this, it’s good,” Ethan Hawke tells Richard Linklater, midway through a lively digression that has already hopped from politics to the Beatles to the late films ofJohn Huston. “What’s good?” asks Linklater. “All of this,” says Hawke, by which he means the London hotel suite with its coffee table, couch and matching upholstered armchairs; the whole chilly machinery of the international press junket. “I like that we get to spend a couple of days in a room,” he says. “It feels like a continuation of the same conversation we’ve been having for the past 32 years.”It’s all about the conversation with Linklater and Hawke. The two men like to talk; often the talk sparks a film. The director and actor first met backstage at a play in 1993 (“Sophistry, by Jon Marc Sherman,” says Linklater) and wound up chatting until dawn. The talk laid the ground for what would eventually becomeBefore Sunrise, a star-crossed romance that channelled an off-screen bromance as it sent Hawke and Julie Delpy wandering around mid-90s Vienna, walking and talking and stopping to kiss. “Yeah, that was the moment. That set the tone,” says Linklater, remembering. “Meeting Ethan backstage, then flying out to Vienna.”Blue Moon, Linklater and Hawke’s 11th collaboration, might be their splashiest number to date in that it’s a posh period drama – a tale of 1940s Broadway. Hawke plays the jilted lyricist Lorenz Hart, propping up the bar on the opening night of Oklahoma! as his former writing partner, Richard Rodgers, celebrates alongside Oscar Hammerstein. Hart dresses sharp and talks fast but he’s barely holding himself together, and so it was with the production itself. Blue Moon was shot at speed in 15 days on an Irish soundstage that masqueraded as midtown Manhattan. The ritzy trappings belie its indie roots.For Hawke in particular, it was a tough film to get right. In previous collaborations, he has essentially played a version of himself, or some amalgamation of himself and Linklater, whereas Hart was a stretch and required a much bigger performance. It was as though he’d grown used to being a member of the band and then suddenly had to learn a whole different instrument.Blue Moon review – Ethan Hawke is terrific in Richard Linklater’s bitter Broadway breakup dramaRead more“Yeah, you play the drums on this one,” says Linklater.Hawke nods. “But workwise, that put us in a different position. It felt dangerous. You got kind of naggy. It felt like I was hitting the wall of my talent.”“That’s the place where you want to be,” says Linklater.Hawke isn’t certain. “Well, you want it when it’s over. Afterwards, my son asked, ‘Was it fun?’ and I said that it was like going down a ski slope that’s too difficult. When you land safely, you say, ‘That’s amazing.’ But I’m not sure I would have said it was amazing when I was trying to maintain some sense of grace. When I was trying not to hit all the trees.”View image in fullscreenMargaret Qualley as Elizabeth Weiland and Ethan Hawke as Lorenz Hart in Blue Moon.Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/Sony Pictures Classics/APGraceful or not, it’s an eye-catching display, a flamboyant old-school physical transformation. Hart was bald and 5ft tall, so Hawke shaved his head and stood in a trench to appear shorter than his co-stars. This literally gave him a fresh view on the world. “Because the world is heightist. It’s ingrained in our culture, it’s in our language. Tall and handsome. Proud and strong. It’s tough when people don’t want to flirt with you. It changes how you see yourself.”He had an actor friend on the set, he recalls, who was helping him with the sightlines. The friend positioned himself in the trench, with his wife close by; suddenly she towered over him. “Wow, that’s so interesting,” she said. “I definitely wouldn’t have married you.”Hawke winces at the memory. “Because that’s shocking, right? That this woman who he’s been married to for 20 years should be put off by something so superficial. Not his brain, not his talent, not his looks, not his essence. You’re short and you’re bald. That’s not masculine to me.”Linklater chips in. “Yeah, but your wife said that, too.”“Yeah, OK, she did,” Hawke admits, laughing. The actor has been married to Ryan Shawhughes since 2008. It’s a good marriage; she loves him, although even she has her limits. “It wasn’t the height or the balding that bothered my wife,” he says. “It was the combover. The disguise is always worse than the thing itself. I dyed my hair, very obviously dyed, and then I did the combover. And Ryan came to visit the set one day, and she looked at me and said: ‘You know what, I’m leaving. I didn’t marry Larry Hart.’”Hawke is 55 and Linklater a decade older. Their films have tracked and mapped their lives, moving from the weightless youthful joy of Before Sunrise through the burdensome adult responsibilities of its sequels (2004’sBefore Sunset; 2013’sBefore Midnight). The sublimeBoyhoodwas pieced together over a 12-year period and featured Hawke as a deadbeat Texas dad who eventually straightens up, settles down and swaps his vintage sportscar for a family-friendly minivan. And now along comes Blue Moon, which is jaundiced and gin-soaked and pines for a world that’s moved on. It is – dare one say it – their first sad old man movie.“Uh-oh,” says Linklater. “I think I know what you’re saying here: ‘You’re in the final chapter, buddy.’”That’s not quite what I’m saying; they have plenty of road left to run. Certainly Hawke and Linklater have little in common with Hart, a brilliant, raging alcoholic who effectively died in the gutter at the age of 48. If anything, they resemble the duo that overshot and outlasted him: they’re the indie equivalent ofRodgers and Hammerstein.Probably every profession contains people like Hart: tortured and talented, and finally too much trouble. Sooner or later, something has to give. “I’ve had my own artistic breakups,” says Linklater. “And it’s always for the same reason – addiction. It’s sad, it’s poignant. It’s the worst. But when you’re in a position of responsibility, you have to make a decision for the good of the ship. ‘We’ll send you to rehab, but you can’t stay here, you got to get out.’”The tyranny of the sudden, early death is that it backshadows a life. Hawke began his career acting alongsideRiver PhoenixandRobin Williams. He performed oppositePhilip Seymour Hoffmanin the 2007 thrillerBefore the Devil Knows You’re Dead. All three have since been posthumously framed as brilliant, tragic figures. According to Hawke, this was only ever half true. “Because there was nothing tragic about those people,” he says. “If they were sitting here on the couch, you’d see how utterly un-tragic they were.”It isHoffman’s death– in 2014 of a drug overdose – that remains the hardest to process. “To understand Phil, you have to understand how many days he beat addiction,” Hawke says. “Phil had a problem. He lost one day. But he won all the other days, for twentysomething-odd years. I don’t want to say that he had no agency in his death. But it was a difficult period and he was taking [his sobriety] seriously. He was on his way to a meeting [the day that he died].” He shakes his head as though to clear it. “And I know other talented people – less famous – who have been lost the same way.”“Too much success or too much failure,” says Linklater. “You can react badly to both.”The secret might be to maintain a nice even keel – or, failing that, have a regular collaborator to measure your own life against. Technically, Hawke and Linklater don’t need one another. Each man has forged a perfectly successful career of his own (Hawke is appearing in the lucrativeBlack Phonehorror franchise; Linklater will soon release his jaunty, black-and-white Nouvelle Vague, all about the making of Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless). But it may be this independence which keeps the relationship healthy and the partnership balanced.“Yeah, my wife once said the same thing,” Hawke says. “She said: ‘Oh, well, it’s easy for them, because they’re on the same level.’ And maybe that’s right. Status plays such a big role in the world. “There are actor-director relationships where the actor becomes huge and is doing the director a favour by being in their movie. Or the reverse – the director becomes a big shot and starts doling out the favours.“And yet, luckily, life has kept us steady.”“We both percolate,” says Linklater. “Our underachieving careers have served us well.”Hawke shrugs. “Well, it makes the friendship easier. I mean, when Ryan said it, I didn’t like how it sounded. I don’t want to think of myself that way. I like to think that I’m not status-conscious and can maintain a friendship with anyone. But she’s not wrong, it makes it easier.”View image in fullscreen‘Life has kept us steady’ … Hawke and Linklater.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThere are other factors to consider. “There’s the business side, too. One of the things that’s hard on an actor is that if you don’t make films that make money, people can’t hire you anyway. If I didn’t have what’s perceived as a successful career, I’d put Rick at a disadvantage. It doesn’t matter that he likes me; he wouldn’t get any funding. So I have to take care of that part of the ship by myself.”Life is long and the film business is tough. Making independent movies doesn’t get any easier. This last one, says Linklater, was especially difficult. But the director feels good, full of energy as he approaches old age. Besides, film-makers aren’t like professional athletes, he adds. It’s not as though they start to lose a crucial step every year.Now it’s Hawke’s turn to chip in. “I know what people lose. They lose idealism and curiosity. The profession beats you up. You get cynical and you lose the curiosity.”“That’s depression, though,” Linklater says, frowning. “To not be interested in things. To think: what’s the point, why bother?”“Yeah, but that’s just what I’m saying,” says Hawke, almost spluttering. “You haven’t lost that at all. I mean, look, we’re sitting here with this little indie movie that we had to make in 15 days.” He turns towards me. “There are directors of Rick’s age and in Rick’s position who would quickly lose interest in working that hard.”“For no money,” adds Linklater. “They think: ‘Wait, this is where I started out. Why should I go back to the minor leagues?’”“But you’d never think of it as the minor leagues,” says Hawke. “That’s because you never equated success with money. It’s nothing to do with the salary, it’s about making good art. That’s why we’re here.” He gestures at the suite: the coffee table, the couch and the matching armchairs. “And you know where we are? You know what this is?”“The major leagues,” says Linklater and laughs.Blue Moon is out in the UK on 28 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmRodgers and HammersteinMusicals (Film)Musicals (Stage)Richard LinklaterEthan HawkeinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The real-life story of the Von Trapp family’s flight from occupied Austria may contain lashings of melody and a prickle-eyed love story – but it also becomes a tale of personal loss, political integrity and the healing power of music.This was Rodgers and Hammerstein’s final musical together – Hammerstein, the lyricist, died just months after the opening in 1959 – and the tunes don’t hang about. The title song launches a first half driven by Maria’s dreams and desires, especially her love for the widowed Captain von Trapp. Molly Lynch’s tremendous Maria, scrambling through pools and over rocks on Michael Taylor’s mountain set, has rambunctious vim – more pagan than pious. Endearingly full-throttle, she launches into her numbers with a guitar hero flourish.View image in fullscreenFamily flight … the Von Trapps in The Sound of Music.Photograph: Marc BrennerThis was far from the only musical Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote about damaged men and surrogate mothers. Here, David Seadon-Young’s walking wounded Captain is bearishly ill at ease, caught in the grief that disfigures his enjoyment of family life.He seems even more lost in what is predominantly a musical world of high, female voices, harmonising in unison: nuns (warmly led by Joanna Riding’s abbess), piping children, blazing Maria. Male authority, especially after the Anschluss, is confined to flat, humourless dialogue. The valet eavesdrops, the telegraph lad collaborates, and the first Hitler salute we see cools the mood considerably.Foster’s production ripples with feeling, especially in the first half. This is also where the bangers live, tune after lilting tune. Hammerstein’s lyrics are drolly unforced (“underneath her wimple she has curlers in her hair”) and Rodgers’ melodies filtered to alpine purity. The second half is busy with plot and reprises – though Seadon-Young delivers Edelweiss with a memorably forlorn defiance.The show’s central characters are adrift with loss: Lynch’s Maria helps them all to play. A bed becomes a galleon, walls shuffle aside to make room to romp. The little Von Trapps (there are three alternating casts) embrace Ebony Molina’s lolloping choreography and wonderfully darting moves, relishing the chance to sing and dance and feel again.AtCurve theatre, Leicester, until 17 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsThe Sound of MusicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Six weeks in to her first major concert tour in a decade, she arrived at the Royal Albert Hall to lead what in some ways felt like a celebration – a sort of super-polished jam session, punctuated by friendly, unpolished chat from the stage. Musically, though, if this were a party she was serving canapes – lots of small, delicious things, but not quite a proper meal.And yet those bite-size pieces offered a lot of enjoy. Benedetti’s supporting ensemble is an unconventional but inspired combo of cello, guitar and accordion: Maxim Calver, Plínio Fernandes and Samuele Telari were tight, flexible and responsive partners, and together the quartet created some intriguing sonorities, which came across in this hall better than some of the finer details.The music fell loosely into three categories. There were the romantic salon pieces, including beautifully done arrangements of the Sicilienne attributed to Maria Theresia von Paradis but written by Samuel Dushkin, and Debussy’s Beau Soir. Benedetti’s generous tone and velvety phrasing could have been made for these; the supporting trio, sounding beautifully relaxed, conjured an ambience that explained the title ofViolin Café, the recording released to accompany the tour.Then there were Scottish folk tunes, for which the players were joined by Fin Moore on the smallpipes, first providing just the drone background, then taking up the melody as Benedetti extemporised above. The encore, Peter Maxwell Davies’s Farewell to Stromness, harked back to these.And – in case anyone might have thought that the job of running the Edinburgh international festival would have dented Benedetti’s rock-solid technique – there were the show-off numbers: a Wieniawski polonaise and Paganini caprices, with No. 1 performed solo, as written, and No 24 given in a sparky arrangement that arguably lost some of the wow factor given that all those notes weren’t coming from just one violin. For Sarasate’s Navarra, a virtuoso but formulaic violin duet, Benedetti brought on Emma Baird as her partner. The same composer’s Carmen Fantasy was the final showstopper from a violinist still at the top of her game.At the Lighthouse, Poole, on Saturday, thentouring in the UKuntil 4 December.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicNicola BenedettireviewsShareReuse this content"

To mark the milestone comes String of Hearts, a collection of covers and remixes featuring an all-star cast of friends and collaborators, from next-gen underground favourites like Coby Sey to fellow old-school experimentalists Liars. This brilliant, genre-agnostic record allows you to trace the breadth of the Melbourne band’s shapeshifting sound, echoes of which can now be found all over underground and commercial music, without leaning too hard on nostalgia.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for String of HeartsThe record spans HTRK’s early hits right up to their most recent albumRhinestones, a period in which they’ve shifted from a darker, industrial palette to warmer territory. Not that you’d be able to tell here: instrumentals are reshaped by Loraine James’s IDM-style glitches and Zebrablood’s atmospheric breaks, while Jonnine Standish’s disaffected vocals are transformed into desperate alien wails by Liars.Some tracks are warped beyond recognition, using just a synth or lyric as a jumping-off point. The gruff, brooding Ha is reinvented by sound artist Perila into an ambient composition so sweeping and gorgeous it veers towards the sublime – the only perceptible similarity lingers in the layered rendition of those once-sneering vocals. Siren Song, originally a 49-second interlude, is stretched out by Kali Malone and Sunn O)))’s Stephen O’Malley into a droning six-minute soundscape, where the simple, mumbled lyric is repeated like an absent-minded mantra.Others lurk more closely to the original tracks, but with exciting adjustments: Sharon Van Etten’s cover of Poison has less smog and more kick; Double Virgo’s take on Rentboy adds percussion, strings and peppy discordance. These are the standout moments, but it’s hard to fault any of the tracks here: all feel imaginative yet faithful to the magic of HTRK.Also out this monthThe mysterious Belgian-Italian duoSexo y Fantasiaremould their low-slung cosmic synth sound into something darker on their brilliant third albumTrabajando El Flex(Pinkman). The icy synths, robotic vocals and skulking dub undertones, paired with their signature erotic themes, conjure up an image of some seedy, haunted club.Radioweaveris the latest record from London-based artistthe Narrator, also of the collective, label and self-proclaimed “gesamtkunstwerk” Life Is Beautiful. Across the eight tracks, dreamy vocals interlace with instrumentals that are both lovely and uncanny, where celestial synthsand strings are occasionally interrupted by glitching samples and unexpected turns. Inspired by theatre, Fellini and dreams,Cinecittàx(Disques de la Spirale), the debut album by Brussels-based artistChe Vuoiis as eccentric as you might expect. In these jittery, lo-fi collages, there are elements of spoken word, post-punk, cabaret and downtempo electronic music, complete with nature samples and toybox percussion.Explore more on these topicsMusicExperimental album of the monthAustralian musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Putting their own vocals at the forefront of their music for the first time, Chen becomes a charismatic and haunting pop presence. Sometimes, they play the role of warm R&B vocalist (Listen to Your Heart); at other times, such as on the nervy, hypnotic Whatchureallywant, they’re seductive and steely, commanding the dancefloor over production that draws equally from bass music and South African amapiano.View image in fullscreenIkonika has long been an established presence in underground electronic music. They have been signed to the Hyperdub label for nearly 20 years; muscular, sprightly releases such as 2020’s Your Body and 2018’s The Library Album have contributed to their reputation as a brash, warm-spirited producer. But Sad has the feel of a debut, centring sounds from northern and southern Africa (Chen is part-Egyptian) on tracks like Sense Seeker and Gone. Their lyrics draw on ideas of safety and care, pushing their persona past “party starter” and into more complex territory.Chen tends to repeat lyrics like mantras: “Feel it now, feel your love” on Sense Seeker; “Is it illogical? Is it impossible?” on Take Control. It makes listening to Sad feels a little like reading someone’s journal, full of earnest middle-of-the-night thoughts and raw desire. Its mission statement arrives early on: “Are you even listening? Listen to your heart.” It announces Ikonika’s entry into the brave new world of pop without sacrificing the complexity that made their name.Explore more on these topicsMusicElectronic musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

The original Outer Worlds dazzled our eyeballs with its art nouveau palette and charmed our ears with witty dialogue, sucking us into a classic mystery-unravelling story in one of my favourite “little man versus evil corporate overlords” worlds since Deus Ex. It didn’t have the most original combat, but that didn’t matter: it was obviously a labour of love from a team totally invested in the telling of this tale, and we all fell under its spell.Well, when I say all of us, I mean myself and the three kids. My wife did not play The Outer Worlds, because none of those worlds featured Crash Bandicoot. But the rest of us dug it, and the kids particularly enjoyed that I flounced away from the final boss battle after half a day of trying, declaring that I hadpretty muchcompleted the game and that was good enough for a dad with other things to do.My son completed The Outer Worlds 2 first. “How was it?” I asked.“You are going to hate it,” he replied.What? How dare he have the arrogance to predict my gaming tastes! If it wasn’t for me, none of these urchins would have played a video game in the first place. It’s bad enough that they destroy me at Mario Kart. Now they’re robbing me of potential gaming joy. I was now determined to enjoy The Outer Worlds 2 just to prove him wrong.Reader: I did not enjoy it.View image in fullscreenMost of the dialogue is people moaning about their bosses … The Outer Worlds 2.Photograph: Obsidian EntertainmentWhile the combat is top notch, the character skill trees sophisticated, and the speed and smoothness (on the Xbox Series X version) unmatched (especially when rushing away from combat as an ageing gamer is wont to do), the story is awful.The first hour of play hits you with so much tedious factional politics it makes the opening crawl of The Phantom Menace look like Serious Sam. Most of the dialogue is people moaning about their bosses or their charges. Everything is broken. People are starving and miserable, bereft of doctors and medical supplies. It’s basically 2025 but in space, expressed in words so clunky and boring that it feels like reading through LinkedIn comments.“I was right, wasn’t I?” said my son smugly, when I gave up after 20 hours, on the third planet I visited.“How can you tell?”“I haven’t heard you curse at a game this much since you played online Fifa.”“How did they get it so wrong, son?” I asked.“There’s no real heart and soul in the game. They just phoned in the story.”Then we talked. At length. About role-playing games in general; what works and what doesn’t; what makes some great and others tedious. And we agreed that RPGs require a storyteller’s commitment to make it believable. This genre has its roots in Dungeons & Dragons, which in essence is just people sitting in a basement conjuring up great stories. If the Dungeon Master is no good, it’s just a number-crunching, dice-rolling slog but, with a storyteller in charge, it is magic. World building is crucial, too: the lush highlands of Skyrim, the dark conspiracy-poisoned streets of Deus Ex, the techno-magical dystopia of Gaia in Final Fantasy VII.And, like tabletop D&D, the graphics don’t really matter. Decades ago, I spent a brilliant month inside the batshit crazy apocalyptic demonic faith-fest that is Shin Megami Tensei, and that whole world was conjured from tiny pixels on the screen of a Game Boy Advance.View image in fullscreenMy weak bladder and need for sleep were the only things that ever dragged me away from the inhabitants of The Witcher 3.Photograph: CD Projekt REDThat world must have characters you care about. My weak bladder and inconvenient need for sleep were the only things that ever dragged me away from the inhabitants of The Witcher 3. But I couldn’t care less about any of the characters in The Outer Worlds 2; I felt I had seen them all before. Throw in the needlessly dense, grey dialogue and I couldn’t stay focused on the game for longer than five minutes outside battles.In a real world where we have less control than ever, when “truth” is just what the richest liar purports and fairness has been eradicated, it’s increasingly difficult to win in life by working hard. That is what makes the genuine meritocracy of role-playing games so appealing to me. In all video games, if you have skill (or develop it), then you can progress. But in RPGs, even if you weren’t born with talent, you can work hard, grind up levels, and get more skills that lead to more rewards. In contrast to a horrible world that has 3,000 billionaires and yet still leaves most of its inhabitants living in poverty, RPGs are a model of what a just world would be like – with added armour and shields, and hopefully fast travel points.The Outer Worlds 2 was a disappointment for me, but instead of escaping into an immersive RPG as I had hoped, I instead escaped into a glorious chat with my son about them. Again, I realised how much games have given our lives, and how they’ve deepened our relationship with each other. And I realised that sometimes a game’s terrible dialogue can spark a fascinating one in the real world.Explore more on these topicsGamesXbox series S/XfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And a very good way to achieve this is to bring a tower of puffy choux buns to the table and pour over a jugful of boozy chocolate sauce and coffee caramel while everyone looks on in awe. To help avoid any stress on the day, most of the elements can be made ahead: the chocolate sauce and caramel can be gently reheated before pouring, while the choux shells can be baked the day before and crisped up in the oven for 10 minutes before filling.Coffee caramel and rum choux towerPrep10 minCook1 hr 15 minServes10-12120ml milk120g butter½ tbsp sugarA pinch of salt160g strong white flour4-5 large eggs,beatenDemerara sugar, for sprinkling400ml double cream½ tsp vanilla bean paste½ tbsp icing sugarFor the coffee caramel140ml double cream2 tsp instant coffee or espresso powder110g sugar50g unsalted butterA big pinch of flaky sea saltFor the chocolate sauce150g dark chocolate1½ tbsp brown sugar2-3 tbsp rumA pinch of saltHeat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½ and line two large baking trays with baking paper. To make the choux, put the milk, 120ml water, butter, sugar and salt in a saucepan and bring to a rolling boil. Tip in the flour and stir quickly until you have a thick dough. Cook for a minute, then transfer to a clean bowl and leave to cool for five minutes.Add some beaten egg a little at a time, beating well after each addition until the mix takes on a slightly thick, smooth dropping consistency (you may not need all the egg). Spoon the dough into a piping bag and snip off the end (or fit with a round nozzle).Pipe roughly 4cm-wide rounds of dough on to the lined trays, leaving just under 2½cm of space between them. Sprinkle generously with demerara sugar and bake for 25-28 minutes, until deeply browned and puffy. Set aside to cool completely.For the coffee caramel, heat the cream and coffee in a small saucepan until warmed through and the coffee has dissolved.Put the sugar in a large saucepan and heat gently until it completely dissolves and turns a deep amber colour. Add the butter, whisking well to combine, then slowly pour in the coffee cream – be careful, because it will bubble and spit. Simmer for 30 seconds, take off the heat and stir in the salt. Leave to cool and thicken.For the chocolate sauce, put the chocolate, 120ml water and sugar in a saucepan and simmer until melted. Once smooth and glossy, stir in the rum and salt, and take off the heat.To assemble, whip the cream, vanilla and sugar to soft peaks. Fill a piping bag with the whipped cream, and fill a second one with three-quarters of the cooled caramel. Use a knife to make an opening in the base of each choux bun and fill three-quarters full with cream. Top up with caramel. (Alternatively, cut each bun in half and spoon in the cream and caramel.)Pile the filled buns on a large plate or platter, using a little caramel as glue to help. To serve, gently reheat the chocolate sauce, if it has cooled and thickened, then pour all over the buns. If the leftover caramel has also thickened, reheat in a pan until runny and pour over the top, too. Serve immediately.Explore more on these topicsChristmas food and drinkThe sweet spotFoodDessertCakeBakingChristmasChocolaterecipesShareReuse this content"
