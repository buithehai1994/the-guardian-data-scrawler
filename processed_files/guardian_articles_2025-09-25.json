Photograph: Richard Isaac/Rex/ShutterstockAs Nick Cave and Kylie Minogue’s Where the Wild Roses Grow turns 30, we count down pop’s finest two-handers, from career-revivers to celebrity meta-textsByAlexis PetridisThu 25 Sep 2025 10.07 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 20.14 EDTShare20. Katy B – Lights On (ft Ms Dynamite) (2010)Most pop/hip-hop collaborations don’t qualify here – commissioning a verse from a rapper to increase your single’s “reach” does not a duet make – but Lights On does. It moves back and forth between both participants, and moreover, it’s superb: a perfect evocation of the night ending before the stimulants have worn off.19. Bobbie Gentry and Glen Campbell – Mornin’ Glory (1968)View image in fullscreenCampbell and Gentry at the 1968 Grammy awards.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveThe whole of Gentry and Campbell’s eponymous duets album is a delight, but if you had to pick a highlight, their version of the Gentry-penned Morning Glory is the one. It’s a spectacularly lovely song, its drowsy but glowing mood – a one-night-stand gone right, a rarity in pop – amplified by the twin vocals.18. Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle – Picking Up After You (1982)There’s an argument that Tom Waits’ soundtrack to Francis Ford Coppola’sOne From the Heartis significantly better than the film itself. The weary after-hours jazz of Picking Up After You – in which a marriage gone stale is picked over with scabrous relish by both parties – is particularly splendid.17. Otis Redding and Carla Thomas – Tramp (1967)The genius of Otis Redding and Carla Thomas’s splendidly argumentative take on the old Lowell Folson blues number (aside from its implausibly funky breakbeat) is the way Thomas’s disparaging vocal undercuts Redding’s super-slick soul-man image: “You know what, Otis? You’re country … you wear overalls … and you need a haircut!”16. Prince (with Sheena Easton) – U Got the Look (1987)The kind of improbable masterpiece that only Prince in his pomp could have dreamed up, then executed so convincingly: funk with squealing rock guitars, former MOR favourite Sheena Easton recast as strutting temptress, the whole thing held together by spoken-word sections that compare sex to baseball. The end result is, unaccountably, incredible.View image in fullscreenFlack and Hathaway.Photograph: GAB Archive/Redferns15. Roberta Flack – Back Together Again (ft Donny Hathaway) (1980)Infamously, Back Together Again was recorded the day Donny Hathaway took his own life: the studio session had already been abandoned due to his erratic behaviour. And yet the song is a joy-bringing delight. That such transcendent, life-affirming music could have emerged from such desperate circumstances is testament to the singers’ power and chemistry.14. George Michael and Elton John – Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me (1991)George Michael’s Cover to Cover tour saw him tackling everything from David Bowie’s Fame to Adamski’s Killer, but a surprise London guest appearance by Elton John deservedly provided a transatlantic No 1. The song’s considerable emotional heft was further amplified by the fact that John had only recently emerged from rehab.13. Dan Hartman (with Loleatta Holloway) – Vertigo/Relight My Fire (1979)Take That’s cover might be better known, but the original is the masterpiece: an epic of high-drama disco delirium, squelching synth and cinematic strings. The moment, three minutes in, when the familiar riff kicks in is euphoric, the arrival of the queen of Salsoul three minutes later unfeasibly thrilling.12. Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood – Some Velvet Morning (1967)You’re spoilt for choice when it comes to Sinatra/Hazlewood duets – from the hilarious Jackson to the drowsily erotic Summer Wine, they’re all great. But Some Velvet Morning is the best: darkly sexual and faintly baffling, filled with disorientating shifts in time signature and references to Phaedra (“a sad-assed broad,” as Hazlewood once put it bluntly).11. William Bell and Judy Clay – Private Number (1968)Late-60s Stax at its vertiginous height. Everything about Private Number is exquisite, from its atmospheric intro to the subtle orchestration to Bell and Clay’s vocals, pleading but restrained. The lyrical plot twist is neatly done, and the song’s emotional shift from moody verses to jubilant chorus offers guaranteed elation.10. The Pogues – Fairytale of New York (ft Kirsty MacColl) (1988)View image in fullscreenShane MacGowan of the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl.Photograph: Patrick Ford/RedfernsTry to banish the thought of its festive ubiquity for a moment and instead luxuriate in its exemplary use of the duet as a storytelling device, gradually dragging the grim saga of its dissolute relationship from early optimism through furious rancour to a kind of battered, unpromising reconciliation.9. Charli xcx and Lorde – The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde (2024)Charli xcx rerecorded her song about her fraught relationship with Lorde days after its release, with its subject answering all her accusations. Equal parts psychodrama and fourth-wall-breaking play on fans’ obsession with linking pop lyrics to IRL events, it is unequivocal evidence of its authors’ mastery of modern pop stardom, and all that comes with it.8. Brandy and Monica – The Boy Is Mine (1998)The negative image of Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney’s similarly titled but hopelessly drippy The Girl Is Mine. Brandy and Monica dish up five minutes of acidic fingernails-in-the-hair spite (“there is no way you could mistake him for your man – are you insane?”) over a superb, bumping Rodney Jerkins beat.7. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds + Kylie Minogue – Where the Wild Roses Grow (1995)Cave’s 1996 duet with PJ Harvey, Henry Lee, is magnificent, but Where the Wild Roses Grow has the extra improbability factor. At the time of its release, the very idea of Kylie recording a brooding murder ballad with Nick Cave seemed quite remarkable, let alone with results this powerful.6. Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash – Girl From the North Country (1969)First recorded six years earlier on The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan, Girl From the North Country was powerfully reinvented in Cash’s company. Slower and sadder, it now sounds impossibly careworn, as if the two of them are competing to see who can sound the most dejected and heartsick.5. Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton – Islands in the Stream (1983)View image in fullscreenRogers and Parton.Photograph: Gary Gershoff/Getty ImagesThe Bee Gees’ post-disco era of writing songs for other artists offers an embarrassment of riches, but Islands in the Stream is the jewel. It was originally a Motown pastiche intended for Diana Ross, but Parton and Rogers’ country reading is so definitive, it’s hard to imagine it any other way. WhenRogers played Glastonbury, the crowd insisted he sing ittwice.4. Queen and David Bowie – Under Pressure (1981)A duet in which the voices appear to be singing completely different songs – Bowie’s angsty state-of-the-world address alternating with Freddie Mercury’s airy scat vocals – before they suddenly turn to the same page two-and-a-half minutes in, leading to a fantastically powerful finale. It was an unlikely chart-topper, but then so was Bohemian Rhapsody.3. Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell – You’re All I Need to Get By (1968)View image in fullscreenTerrell and Gaye.Photograph: GAB Archive/RedfernsIt’s hard to pick a favourite from the succession of fabulous duets Gaye and Terrell recorded: Ain’t No Mountain High Enough, California Soul, Ain’t Nothin’ Like the Real Thing. But the glorious You’re All I Need to Get By – more obviously gospel-influenced than your usual Motown track – just clinches it.2. Pet Shop Boys with Dusty Springfield – What Have I Done to Deserve This? (1987)Dusty Springfield’s stock was so low that the Pet Shop Boys’ label argued they should record What Have I Done to Deserve This? with Tina Turner instead. What that would have sounded like boggles the mind. It certainly couldn’t have improved on the magical blend of Springfield’s husky pleading and Neil Tennant’s icy lugubriousness.1. Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush – Don’t Give Up (1986)Compiling a list of the greatest duets is a thankless task: even if you confine yourself to rock and pop, and exclude artists for whom duetting is inbuilt or internal (so no Ashford and Simpson or Sam and Dave and no Don’t You Want Me) it’s a vast area to narrow down. Picking a chart-topper is more thankless still, but Don’t Give Up exudes an extraordinary emotional power, linked to the contrast between Gabriel’s utter hopelessness and misery and Bush’s patient expressions of unconditional love: “You still have us”; “You worry too much.” That the latter don’t seem to impact on the former at all makes it devastating, but unforgettable.Explore more on these topicsRankedPop and rockPeter GabrielKate BushfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s been quite the week for rightwing populists shooting their mouths off. Trolling the world. We’ve had Donald Trump at the UN. Rubbishing medical science by advising pregnant women not to take Tylenol. Telling the Europeans they were all going to hell. Claiming to have brokered a peace with countries that weren’t even at war with one another.We’ve had Nigel Farage on LBC radio. Insisting that London wanted to “go to sharia law”. Because a taxi driver from Buckingham had told him so. Sparking fear among swans in every royal park that they were about to be eaten by filthy foreigners. Threatening to deport anyone who had been granted indefinite leave to remain.So it was probably only a matter of time beforeBoris Johnsonput his head above the parapet. After all, an attention-seeking narcissist is always going to seek attention. It’s just that these days Boris struggles to get a platform. No 15-minute slot stretched out to an hour in front of a captive audience of politicians from around the world. No news channels breaking off their schedules to broadcast uninterrupted coverage of a press conference that ticks well beyond 60 minutes. Instead, Boris has to live more on the margins. Be grateful for a 45-minute slot on the Harry Cole Saves the West YouTube channel, hosted by the Sun’s editor-at-large.There’s something ineffably sad about Johnson these days. You can almost see the pathos in his eyes. A man struggling to understand how it has all come down to this. Back in 2019, he was king of the world. The prime minister with an 80-seat majority whom everyone believed would be resident in Downing Street for a decade at least. Britain had been bent to his will and he had the country at his feet. Yet in under three years he had been forced to resign in disgrace. Rejected by his own party and the country.Sure, he now had the money. More than he had ever imagined. And that was something. He had always felt a bit hard up compared with others. But there was still that huge hole – that gaping need – inside him.Where was the fun in being lavishly overpaid for your opinions if no one was interested in them? Above all, he couldn’t escape the feeling of being hard done by. Betrayed by an ungrateful world.TrumpandFarage had built careers on making misleading claimsand no one cared. In fact they went from strength to strength. Yet Boris’s lies had been his downfall. It wasn’t fair.Cole started withUkraine. This used to be Boris’s specialist subject. He had been the first western leader to champion Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now he was on the sidelines. The Ukrainian president never called any more. The world had moved on. But any audience was better than none. Boris could feel his self-importance rising. Someone somewhere cared what he was thinking. He was alive. A player again. Perhaps he would rise from the ashes.We needed to take Trump at his word when he said Ukraine could retake all its territory, Boris insisted. Cole’s scepticism was evident. That was the last thing anyone should be doing. Everyone knew The Donald made things up as he went along. But Johnson was adamant. Trump had had a Damascene conversion and seen the error of his ways. Russia was finished. The west should impose more sanctions on Russian oligarchs. Were Johnson more self-aware he might have recalled the lavish hospitality he had enjoyed at the Lebedevs at this point. But Boris is Boris, so instead he called for British fighter jets to shoot down Russian planes.“Are you sure?” said Cole. “You want to start a full-scale conflict with Russia?” When Harry Cole is the voice of reason in a two-way conversation then you know you are in deep trouble. Boris scratched his head. Maybe he had been a little hasty. Perhaps that wasn’t such a good idea. How about just shooting down a few drones instead. Third world war averted.The interview skipped through net zero, fracking and free speech. At which point, you realised we were in new territory. Because Boris has been many things in his time. Mendacious, infuriating, challenging, even humorous. But never boring. Yet boring is what he had become. Because nothing he says really mattered. So he was just another bloke wanging on about world affairs while saying nothing that you hadn’t already thought for yourself.Luckily, Cole could sense the show was in danger of dying on its feet and skipped to immigration. Here things became rather more interesting, because it became evident that Boris is stuck in a political time warp of 2019. His golden time. The British public were right behind him. Always had been, always would be. He had given themBrexit. That’s what the country had been crying out for. To have full control of its borders. It was just that he had chosen to dramatically increase inflation. People loved him for it. It was illegal migration that was the problem.This was Boris’s Norma Desmond moment. Cole was almost apologetic as he pointed out that the country had moved on. As if he was intruding on a private grief. The tragedy was that Boris had never felt more alive in the 45-minute interview than now. His smile widened. He had found his voice.We had regressed six years. He was the prime minister again. The universe refashioned in his own image. He talked of Refund, Regurgitate – he enjoyed the schtick even if no one else was taken in by it – ah yes, Reform. Putin apologists. If only the country could see the architects of Brexit fighting like rats in a sack. The Labour party full of Marxist Corbynistas. Only the Tory party could save us.The mirror cracked. Was there any way back for you, asked Cole. Here history played out as tragedy. Normally Boris is the first – and sometimes last – person to talk up Boris. No comeback too improbable, too outlandish. But now reality crept in. Even he couldn’t imagine a political future with him in it. He was the past. Yesterday’s man. Taxi for Boris.Explore more on these topicsBoris JohnsonThe politics sketchYouTubeThe SunBrexitUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

It made me think of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol; what drives normal working class Americans to make these life choices? I’m counting on the UK to celebrate this film, because I think it’s a little too smart for the American audience, frankly. A more European sensibility is going to respond more powerfully than an American one.Does the Highlander remake fill you with dread, indifference, or cautious optimism?ArcadianSeanHighlander is one of my favourite films. It’s an incredible movie of sword-fighting with Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery and Clancy Brown as the Kurgan, the evil Russian villain, who I’d take over Darth Vader any day. The soundtrack is by Queen. It’s insane. Chris Pratt had never seen Highlander, so I booked a screening room in the middle of the afternoon at the studio where we were shooting Parks and Recreation, and we watched it by ourselves. To answer the question: I like to be supportive of my fellow artists. I’m not a cynical person. I hope that, somehow, it’s even greater than the original. Why aren’t I in the remake? That’s a great question. There’s this Australian bloke … Russell something … and people seem to keep leaning in his direction.View image in fullscreen‘Playing a tech god was fascinating’ … Offerman with Sonoya Mizuno in Devs.Photograph: Raymond LiuWhat was it like working with the genius that isAlex Garland in Devsand playing the role of a technological god?PaulsaxonshawAlex Garland is one of the most underrated of our modern film-makers. He asks these big questions on behalf of all of us. With Devs, the question is: should we give power to the controllers of our technology without any checks and balances? Playing a tech god was fascinating, done with authentic human drama and interpersonal relationships. We filmed in Santa Cruz, San Francisco and London. The Devs building was in a giant sound stage in Manchester. I love Manchester. It’s a wonderful, hardworking city. It reminds me of Chicago, full of charm, populated by working people who love a sausage roll. It’s tough to beat a Greggs. I’ve tried the posh ones. It needs to be a little dirty.I’d never seen anything like your performance inThe Last of Us on TVbefore – a mature gay relationship treated with such tenderness, seriousness and depth. How did Bill’s love story affect you?DancingLashaTumbaiThank you for the compliment. If I succeed at that level, it’s because the writing is that exquisite. Everyone agrees that script was like a piece of wizardry.One of the things I love about my dad [a social studies teacher and woodworker called Ric] and my larger farm family is that we all teach. Everybody can back up a vehicle, park a wagon, dig a hole, bake a loaf of bread or gut a fish. We are self-sustaining. The problem is that it ruins TV and film for me. I get cast as people who use tools or drive vehicles, and it’s excruciating because I never let a stunt person do it. The whole time, my dad is sitting on my shoulder with his arms crossed, watching me. Playing Bill was the most exquisite experience, but when I was processing a deer I’ve just shot, or pulling a carrot out of the earth, all I was thinking was: “Is my dad gonna buy this?”Filming those scenes with Murray Bartlett [from White Lotus] … we were violinists, playing beautiful sonatas of our emotional journey that sounded so sweet together. That’s why the world responded so explosively, because it boiled down to the essence of every novel and work of art: “What the fuck is the point of all of this?” The point is that other people are your purpose. If you’re not living to make them happy, then whatisthe fucking point? I’m going to cry.Having started out on the baritone sax and winning the Louis Armstrongjazzaward in1988, were your initial career aspirations more music focused?JimmySlideMy dad had an old tenor saxophone he’d played as a kid. We were that kind of frugal household: “You wanna play music? Here’s your pick.” I was in a small town marching band. If you’re strong, no matter what instrument you play, they hand you the big drum, tuba or baritone sax. As a teenager, I had aspirations to become an actor, but I lived in a cultural vacuum. My guidance counsellor wanted to hear: doctor, lawyer, barrister. They didn’t want to hear: “I want to be an actor.” They said: “I don’t believe that’s one of the options.” I said: “I guess I want to be a musician.” They said: “I don’t think so, buddy. What kind of life would that be?” Fortunately, I discovered you could get paid to be in plays in Chicago. I’m grateful that I got turned on to music, even though it didn’t end up as my career path.View image in fullscreenPlaying Ron Swanson, with Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope.Photograph: NBCU Photo Bank/Getty ImagesHave you done much Shakespeare? I’d love to see you performPolonius’ “To thine own self be true” speech from Hamlet.gummitchThat’s very generous: Polonius is a helluva nice role. I have done a handful of Shakespeare. I wanted to end up at the RSC or Old Vic. I hope to do more Shakespeare before I’m done – I think I’ve still got a couple of years left in my Romeo before they age me out.Love the moustache. But how do you manage beard itch? Drives me spare.CathChakravartyandJustSomeDadI have obvious physical deformities that have kept me from being considered one of the great beauties of my age. On the plus side, I am able to grow prodigious whiskers. If I put my thumb in my mouth and blow, I can grow about an eighth of an inch. It has been a wonderful boon as an actor to achieve every possible iteration of facial hair. Given my druthers, I would have a big beard all the time, because that’s what mother nature intended.There are two kinds of itch. The first is when it’s breaking the skin. That also causes burn on your partner, so you have to be careful when engaging in any form of canoodling. The other itch is once your beard gets full and you begin storing things in it, like gravy or Guinness. A makeup artist taught me to use an astringent, such as Sea Breeze. Once a week, I’ll give it a good scrub, and that keeps the soup cleaned up.View image in fullscreenWith wife Megan Mullally in Parks and Recreation.Photograph: NBC/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesWhat are the best and worst things about being married toMegan Mullally? Did you have trouble keeping a straight face to her terrifying sexual performance as your ex-wifeTammy II in Parks and Rec?ReckonerandNeckron666She’s an exquisite goddess. She’s the funniest person I’ve ever met – and I’ve met Mel Brooks and John Cleese. She dances, she sings. She’s a dramatic and comedic genius. She has astonishing taste – with a few obvious lapses. We’ll come to blows over who left the cap off the toothpaste. But I’m very grateful that after 25 years, she is still choosing me. The worst part is, in the same way that when I back up a truck and my dad is sitting on my shoulder, when I’m performing, especially singing, Megan is very much on my shoulder. When you’re married to the Lionel Messi of performing, it can be tough to keep your shots on goal.The craziest thing about her dangerous sexuality was that, inParks and Recreation, I was known for keeping a straight face. Chris Pratt would come out of leftfield and make me giggle, but I enjoy deadpan humour, so generally, nobody could make me laugh. Megan would walk into the room and I would be done because, by definition, she knows what buttons to push. All our scenes are her using her sexuality as a weapon against me, and I lost that battle long, long ago.Sovereign is on digital platforms.

While Moscow is enduring its toughest period since the chaotic first days of the invasion, few analysts believe its economy is on the brink of a total collapse, and fewer still expectVladimir Putinto adjust his war plans in the short term.“For the first time since the invasion, the government is confronting a genuine trade-off: whether to build a tank or invest in the civilian economy,” said Maria Shagina, a Berlin-based senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktank.GDP“For the Kremlin, the choice will always be military spending. But a widening deficit, soaring defence outlays and shrinking revenues are making that choice harder,” Shagina added.By every metric, the economy is under strain. The finance ministry projects GDP growth in 2024–25 at less than 1%, compared with earlier forecasts of 2.3–2.5%.German Gref, the powerful chief executive of the state-owned banking and financial services company Sberbank, conceded earlier this month thatRussiahad slipped into “technical stagnation”.View image in fullscreenA Moscow resident inspects fruit at a local market. While the war brought a boom for some people to begin with, that is appearing to stall.Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesTo bolster state coffers, Moscow announced this week it would increase VAT from 20% to 22%, reversing one of Putin’s earlier promises. Russians will now finance the war more directly, with defence spending – outstripping the combined defence budgets ofEurope– accounting for about 40% of the Kremlin’s total outlay this year.Putin, who for much of his rule prided himself on fiscal conservatism and economic stability, is facing a new reality.Between January and July alone, the federal budget deficit hit 4.9tn rubles ($61bn), surpassing the full-year target; by 2026, the gap is forecast at about 4.6tn rubles ($55bn).inflationTwo-thirds of the national welfare fund – touted as Russia’s rainy-day reserve – had been spent, said Shagina.The picture is a sharp contrast to the first two years of the war, when massive state spending acted as a powerful stimulus, with the economy growing by 4-5% annually.Factoriesproducingweapons, uniforms and equipment ran at full tilt, resulting in record-low unemployment and lifting wages in provincial towns. For many Russians, the war economy translated into previously unimaginable higher salaries, even if inflation eroded some of the gains.In his annual televised call-in last year, Putin told viewers: “The economy is developing, moving forward actively. Overall, the situation in Russia is stable, and growth continues despite all external threats and attempts to pressure us.”But the wartime boom now appears to have run its course. “Russia can’t keep increasing military spending by 30% every year,” said the Russian economist Vladislav Inozemtsev. “Once the money stops flowing, the growth slows down too. It was never sustainable – that’s why the boom is over.”View image in fullscreenThe deputy chair of Russia’s security council, Dmitry Medvedev, and officials visiting a military vehicle manufacturing plant in Kurgan.Photograph: Sputnik/ReutersThe government is expected to cut spending across the board – from corporations to infrastructure, healthcare and housing – to plug the gap. Still, many inUkrainebelieve western sanctions have failed to land the crippling blow Washington and Brussels had hoped for.After the west weaned itself off Russian oil and gas, Moscow redirected its energy exports to India, China and Turkey, relying on a flotilla of “shadow fleet” tankers that proved difficult to bring under sanctions.The Kremlin has also softened the impact of restrictions on critical goods by cultivating a thriving trade in parallel imports, exploiting what critics havecalleda “sanctions hole”.Semiconductors, aircraft parts and consumer electronics such as iPhones are routinely funnelled into Russia through intermediaries in Turkey, the UAE and former Soviet states, including Armenia and Kazakhstan.“If all sanctions had come in the first 60 days, Russia’s economy would have been destroyed,” said Inozemtsev. “Spread over four years, adaptation was inevitable,” he added.In Brussels, there is little appetite to heed Trump’s call for Ukraine’s European allies to slap 100% tariffs on India and China, the biggest buyers of Russian oil, to end their trade with Moscow.View image in fullscreenA petrol station in Moscow, where fuel prices have soared amid shortages.Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, Hungary and Slovakia havevowedto keep importing Russian energy.Ukraine has sought to counter western hesitation with a huge wave of dronestrikeson Russia’s oil infrastructure in recent months. Open-source data suggests that 16 of the country’s 38 refineries have been hit since August, sending diesel exports to their lowest levels since 2020 and causing widespread fuel shortages.Initially confined to remote regions, reports of closed petrol stations have now emerged in the capital. More troubling for Moscow is that shortages are being reported in diesel, the fuel that underpins the Russian economy and its war machine.“It will be truly crazy if, by the fourth year of the war, we still haven’t destroyed Ukraine’s energy sector, and they end up destroying ours,” one Russian pro-war blogger wrote this week.Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed the drone strikes, calling them “the most effective sanctions, the ones that work the fastest”.View image in fullscreenA cyclist passes a billboard in Moscow promoting army service.Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile long lines for fuel are a frustration for Russians, the central question is whether mounting economic pressures will be enough to compel Putin to alter his course in Ukraine.Trump suggested in a Truth Social post that once Russians realised what was “really going on with this war” and with the Russian economy, some sort of popular revolt could follow. But observers caution against such expectations: Russians are accustomed to enduring hardship, and with dissent criminalised, they have few ways to express discontent.“Russians can live with zero growth,” said Inozemtsev. “They lived through long periods of falling incomes without political cost to Putin. In the west, zero growth sparks panic. In Russia, it’s just normal.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineDonald TrumpEuropeArms tradeVladimir PutinanalysisShareReuse this content"

But it’s easier if you find something specific to do togetherRead moreLeading questionsEleanor Gordon-SmithThu 25 Sep 2025 16.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 20.23 EDTShareI am 86 and have been on my own for many years. However, despite being financially secure, it is a lonely life and I realise I’ve fallen into a materially comfortable rut. Come 6pm I eat a meal, usually microwaved, have a shower, put my PJs on, lock the doors, put the TV on and settle down to another boring evening. My children live far away and have their own lives, although I do encourage them to visit me as much as they can and my grandchildren do, for the occasional weekend. Sometimes, though, I can go days without talking to anyone.I used to belong to several singles groups but Covid caused them to close and not reopen again. I am in reasonably good health, although walking any distance is a problem now. My question is: there’s a nice lady, a little younger than myself, who lives next door and we have chats over the fence. I would love to know her better and think she feels the same, but I feel if I asked her out for a coffee away from our homes but got a rebuff, it could spoil our current friendship. Any advice?Eleanor says:I think the best advice I ever got for getting closer to people is to act like you already are. Not in a creepy way, obviously – I don’t mean you ask personal questions or presume you’re invited without being asked. I just mean, you suggest doing something together as though you already do things together. I’m not sure whether your hope for taking the friendship further is romantic or platonic, but this idea could apply to either circumstance.I can’t read anyone’s body language and I feel flirt-illiterate. How do I meet new people? | Leading questionsRead moreThat awkward stiffness we sometimes feel when we try to progress a relationship one notch closer – I think that’s both people feeling they don’t quite know the rules of the new, closer interaction. It could be asking a colleague out socially, a group friend for a one-on-one outing, or an acquaintance to do something more romantic. There’s always that first moment in new territory – oh, we do this together now? If the primary feeling in that moment isthat it’s new,it can kind of judder the existing relationship.If instead, you extend the invitation with the ease you’d have talking to someone you know well, it feels more like you’ve been close all along. “Fancy a cup of tea?”, easy as you like, a canoe gliding off the bank.The second-best advice I ever got was to do things that aren’t sitting on opposite sides of a restaurant table looking at each other. It’s easier to get to know someone if we find things todotogether that aren’t just being together.Does anything need potting? Is there a little practical problem you’ve talked about that you could offer to solve, a game or puzzle you’ve mentioned, a shared interest that connects to an exhibition or a book event or concert you’d like to go to, a skill she has that you want to learn (or vice versa) such that one of you could teach the other? Perhaps you simply have too much cake in the house and need someone to share the burden of eating it.The advantage of that sort of thing is it feels like an extension of your existing relationship rather than a change to a new one. If it doesn’t go well, you can both de-escalate with plausible deniability. That’s what I’d look for at first if I were you – ways to spend more time chatting that don’t feel like big threshold-crossing moments.I was reading some dating advice from the 1930s recently, expecting to laugh a bit, and was duly humbled by the fact that many suggestions were totally evergreen. In particular, everybody said they wanted someone “of good cheer”. Vim and laughter are such good fuel for any kind of companionship. Cheerful foot forwards. Leave any slightly lonely feet at home.There are many fun ways to get to know each other that will be absorbing, warm and entertaining, long before proffering a formal invitation that could be rejected. Indeed, these little steps may be the best path to her wanting to accept such an invitation when it comes.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsFriendshipLeading questionsAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He dismissed the Conservative party as “basically dead”.During his speech on Friday, he will set out his view that the far right is injecting a “poisonous” discourse into national life, saying: “At its heart – its most poisonous belief – on full display at the protests here in London, just a week or two ago, that there is a coming struggle, a defining struggle, a violent struggle for the nation. For all our nations.“Now – you don’t need to be a historian to know where that kind of poison can lead. You can just feel it. A language that is naked in its attempt to intimidate.”But he will also explain his belief that immigration and borders need to be controlled, saying: “For too many years it’s been too easy for people to come here, slip into the shadow economy and remain here illegally.”Starmer will add: “It is not compassionate leftwing politics to rely on labour that exploits foreign workers and undercuts fair wages. But the simple fact that every nation needs to have control over its borders.”In an article for the Telegraph, Starmer said he believed thatLabourpreviously got it wrong on migration.He also argued that it was legitimate to have concerns about immigration levels, while rejecting Reform’s “toxic” and divisive approach.Starmer said: “There is no doubt that for years leftwing parties, including my own, did shy away from people’s concerns around illegal immigration. It has been too easy for people to enter the country, work in the shadow economy and remain illegally.”The Guardianrevealed in Junethat Downing Street was exploring proposals for a digital ID card to crack down on illegal migration, rogue landlords and exploitative work.The idea came from a Labour Together paper given to the No 10 policy unit proposing a Brit Card, which it claimed could help avoid another Windrush scandal.The thinktank also said it would help reduce vast numbers of visa overstayers, saying half of those whose asylum claims were turned down over the past 14 years were probably still in the UK. It proposed a free, secure digital ID, stored on a person’s smartphone using a planned gov.uk Wallet app, rebranded as the Brit Card app. That could then be verified by employers, immigration, banks and landlords using free software.Under the likely plans, the technology is expected to be built on the government’s existing “One Login” infrastructure, which already allows citizens to access about 50 government services, from applying for a job as a teacher to using a lasting power of attorney.The report’s author and the thinktank’s director of technology, Kirsty Innes, is now a special adviser to Liz Kendall, the technology secretary. When the paper was published, she said: “A progressive society can only work if we have meaningful borders. BritCard would make it far harder to flout the illegal work and illegal rent rules, and far easier to identify and punish exploitative illegal employers and landlords.”The plans were welcomed by the Tony Blair Institute, with its director of government innovation,Alexander Iosad, saying: “Make no mistake, if the government announces a universal digital ID to help improve our public services, it would be one of the most important steps taken by this or any government to make British citizens’ everyday lives easier and build trust.”However, they were opposed by David Davis, the Conservative MP and former cabinet minister, who led the charge against Blair’s ID cards decades ago.Davis said: “No system is immune to failure, and we have seen time and again governments and tech giants fail to protect people’s personal data. If world-leading companies cannot protect our data, I have little faith that Whitehall would be able to do better.”The Liberal Democrats said they could not support “a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives”.The Conservatives did not give a position, but its leader, Kemi Badenoch, said: “There are arguments for and against digital ID, but mandating its use would be a very serious step that requires a proper national debate.“Instead, this is a throwaway conference announcement designed to distract attention from Andy Burnham’s leadership manoeuvrings and the crisis in Downing Street over the prime minister’s chief of staff.”Jim Killock, the executive director of Open Rights Group, highlighted that the digital ID card scheme was not in Labour’s manifesto, arguing that it was “the last thing this government should be embarking on during a cost of living crisis”.“The digital visa schemes that are already in place for migrants are a stark warning of the harms caused by data errors, systems failures and an indifferent, hostile Home Office. People have been unable to travel, lost job offers and even been made homeless because of existing digital ID schemes,” he said.“Labour are at risk of creating a digital surveillance infrastructure that will change everyone’s daily lives and establish a pre-crime state where we constantly have to prove who we are as we go about our daily lives.”David Rennie, a former official at the Home Office’s identity cards programme and now chief trust officer at the startup Orchestrating Identity, said it was “absurd” to suggest a digital identity would stop illegal migration.“Proposing a headline-grabbing ‘government digital identity for all’ as a way of combating illegal migration shows a lack of understanding or learning from the last 20 years,” he said. “Employers already have to prove a prospective employee’s right-to-work in the UK or receive a £45k fine.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourImmigration and asylumPrivacyData and computer securitynewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile Israel, which has won the contest four times since its debut in 1973, has continued to compete for the past two years despite disputes over its participation.Boththe 2024 contest in Malmö, Sweden, andthis year’s event in Basel, Switzerland, were marked by pro-Palestine protests around the concert halls.Next year’s Eurovision, the 70th anniversary of the song contest, is due to be held in the Austrian capital, Vienna, in May.Its hosting broadcaster ORF earlier this week expressed optimism that the event would go ahead even in the case of boycotts and resulting loss of broadcasters’ contributions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Eurostar, majority-owned by the French state-owned SNCF, maintains that the stops are unviable, but new competing train operators are hoping to enter the market.In a speech in Ashford on Friday, the rail minister, Lord Peter Hendy, is expected to say he has encouraged train firms to work with the region’s councils and businesses to “explore solutions” for Kent, adding: “I firmly believe that competition offers the best prospect of international services returning to Kent stations, and welcome the recent announcements that several new entrants are exploring the possibility of serving Ashford, Ebbsfleet and Stratford International stations.”He will say he has made written representations to the independent regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), “to make clear our support for competition and the benefits this brings, including the potential for services to be reinstated at Kent stations”.View image in fullscreenLord Peter Hendy, the rail minister, has said the government ‘strongly welcomes’ the idea of competitors at unused international stations.Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AlamyThe ORR isdue to adjudicate next monthon whether other firms will be given access to a critical London train depot for international services, Temple Mills, currently occupied solely by Eurostar, whichmaintains there is no space, given its own expansion plans.In a letter to the regulator, Hendy said the government “strongly welcomes” the fact that potential competitors could go to the unused international stations, concluding: “The government believes these are important considerations for ORR in determining the various access applications.”Potential competitors includeRichard Branson’s Virgin Group, the British startup Gemini Trains and a partnership between the Italian state rail operator, FS Italiane, and the Spanish company Evolyn.Campaigners are focused particularly on reopening Ashford International, which is nearest the Channel tunnel and was part of the Kent economy which owed significant development to new high-speed rail links.Helena Dollimore, MP for nearby Hastings and Rye, has campaigned in and out of parliament for the restoration of the station. She estimates it would cost about £2m-£3.5m to reopen the station with border controls, including new EES (Entry/Exit System) kiosks.She said: “I used to go to Ashford when I was little to get the train across the Channel. We really miss that link with our neighbours – but for our constituents it is also jobs, business, and opportunities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The British taxpayer spent £80m on it – it’s a no-brainer to get it up and running again because of the benefits it would bring: more jobs, more visitors more tourism. It’s crazy they have lost that closest European link.”For Kent residents travelling to London for Eurostar, reopening Ashford International would reduce return train journey times to Paris and Brussels by at least two or three hours respectively. A report by the Good Growth Foundation claims it could deliver up to £2.7bn in economic growth over five years, and bring in half a million more visitors per year to the region.A Eurostar spokesperson said: “Our Kent stations will remain closed throughout 2025 and will be reviewed in 2026. We understand that this may be frustrating, and we want to stress that we are closely monitoring the situation.”Only 4% of passengers used Ashford or Ebbsfleet in 2019, with about 50 passengers from Ashford on peak services, according to Eurostar.Explore more on these topicsRail transportEurostarTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

He was later released. The reasons for his arrest are unknown.The Metropolitan police were contacted for comment.Separately, in August, the Guardian successfully defended a libel action brought by Clarke over an investigation in which he was accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women.Mrs Justice Steyn rejected Clarke’s claims and ruled the newspaper had succeeded in both its defences, of truth and public interest.The 49-year-old had claimed the allegations in the Guardian’s investigation were false and that he had been the victim of an unlawful conspiracy.In her ruling at the high court in London, Steyn said she accepted some of Clarke’s evidence, “but overall I find that he was not a credible or reliable witness”.His “general pattern” was “of only being prepared to admit that which was established by documentary evidence (which he had carefully studied), and even then only to the minimum extent shown”.Steyn said there had been no conspiracy to lie, and the conspiracy claim did not have a “proper foundation”.The Guardian relied on testimony from almost 30 people, 26 of whom spoke in court about their experiences of working with the actor.Many said they had been directly affected by Clarke, while others said they had witnessed inappropriate behaviour.The writer and producer of the Kidulthood trilogy had sued Guardian News & Media (GNM) over seven articles and a podcast published between April 2021 and March 2022 in which more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.London-born Clarke rose to fame as Mickey Smith during the Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant eras of Doctor Who, between 2005 and 2010. He also appeared in films such as Star Trek Into Darkness and SAS: Rise of the Black Swan.As an actor, writer and director, he became a powerful figure in the British film industry after making the series Kidulthood, Adulthood and Brotherhood and starring in the police drama Bulletproof.In 2009, he won the rising star prize at the Bafta film awards, and in 2021 was given Bafta’s outstanding British contribution to cinema honour. The award and his Bafta membership were suspended when the Guardian’s allegations were published in 2021.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Girls were less likely to enjoy being at school while the boys made less effort with their school work.Only half of low-income white children said they worked hard at school, compared with about 70% of disadvantaged pupils of south Asian ethnicity.Ethnicity not key factor in England school exclusions, study findsRead moreThe study measured pupils’ levels of engagement in questionnaires taken by children at more than 120 schools, which tested response to statements such as “I don’t feel bored at school” and “What I learn at school will help me in the future”.Prof John Jerrim ofUniversity College London’s social research institute, who conducted the study, said the results revealed a difficult problem for policymakers at a time when improving education for white working class children was high on the political agenda.“What you do see is that even on entry to secondary school, white working-class pupils tend to have lower levels of various measures of school engagement than other groups, both more advantaged groups and pupils of different ethnicity,” Jerrim said.“It’s different across boys and girls. Girls struggle more with certain aspects such as peer relationships and enjoyment of school, whereas among white working-class boys, it’s more around valuing school and effort.“One of the questions we asked is about self-reported effort and that’s probably the most interesting part where white working-class pupils stick out. If you ask them ‘how much effort are you putting into school?’, they really stand out from other groups in a bad way, and it’s because they are not properly engaged.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

US B61-12 nuclear bombs now stored at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk would be made available for use by the British jets in the event of a major war.Four years ago the UK said it would lift the cap on the number of warheads it could stockpile by 40% to 260 for its existing nuclear deterrent, the submarine-launched Trident system. It was the first time the UK had said it would increase its nuclear capability since the end of the cold war.Sophie Bolt, the CND general secretary, accused the government of “yet another breach of international law” and of “escalating nuclear dangers in the world”. She called on MPs to discuss the UK’s nuclear intentions, arguing that the F-35A purchase plan had been announced “without parliamentary debate or scrutiny”.The Ministry of Defence said the investment in 12 new F-35A aircraft would improve the UK’s national security. “The UK remains committed to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons and upholds all our obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty,” a spokesperson said.Other countries are also rearming and redeploying nuclear weapons as tensions rise. The US moved B61-12 bombs to Lakenheathin July, while Russia has said it hasmoved nuclear missiles to Belarus. China is increasing its arsenal by 100 warheads a year and plans to reach 1,500 by 2035, according to theStockholm Peace Research Institute.The nuclear non-proliferation treaty came into force in 1970 with article six a core component and has been signed by the world’s largest nuclear powers – the US, Russia, China and France. A handful of countries with nuclear programmes – Israel, India, Pakistan – never signed up, and North Korea pulled out in 2003.Explore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsDefence policyInternational lawMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

The formerArsenalplayer was injured in an Isthmian League match at Wingate & Finchley, leading to its abandonment after 13 minutes.Chichester said in a statement: “After sustaining a significant brain injury last Saturday, Billy Vigar was put in an induced coma. On Tuesday he needed an operation to aid any chances of recovery. Although this helped, the injury proved to much for him and he passed away on Thursday morning.”The seventh-tier club, referencing an update provided on Monday regarding Vigar’s condition, also said: “The responses to the original update show how much Billy was thought of and loved within the sport.

TheFrench president, Emmanuel Macron, says it is also compatible with the plan for Palestine set out in the New York declaration endorsed by the UN general assembly this week.View image in fullscreenMacron and Trump meeting at the UN general assembly on Tuesday.Photograph: Alexander Drago/ReutersBut how can there be such a convergence between the two plans – one American and one backed by the UN – and is this just another temporary Trump-induced mirage?The optimistic take is that it is possible Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former British prime minister Tony Blairhave finally exerted their influence inside the White House, enabling a new way of thinking about the day after war ends in Gaza. According to one version of this vision,Blair himself would head a body called the Gaza International Transitional Authorityfor as long as five years. It would seek a UN mandate to be Gaza’s “supreme political and legal authority”.Putting aside consideration of any role for Blair, the Trump and UN-backed plans do have similarities that could make a convergence possible. For example, neither plan calls for the mass displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. The “Trump Riviera” –code for forced or voluntary expulsions– is not supported by Blair, and is anathema to Egypt and Jordan.Neither plan gives Hamas a role in the future governance of Palestine. Both insist on the decommissioning of Hamas weapons, but not its proscription as an organisation. The Palestinian Authority, Hamas’s non-Islamist rival based in Ramallah, has long said Hamas and other armed factions must lay down their arms.“We do not want an armed state,”PA’s president, Mahmoud Abbas, told the UN general assembly on Thursday.It is also true that both plans presume there can be no further Israeli annexations in the West Bank, and – at least according to Macron –Trump agreed to this during their meeting alongside Arab leaderson Tuesday.Much might rest on the definition of annexation. Completely ruling this out in the West Bank would be a political disaster for the Israeli settler movement, but that is what the United Arab Emirates is demanding, and Trump will have to insist on this if he is to have Arab state buy-in and investment.Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, said the discussion was not about annexing Palestinian-owned land, adding: “What can be discussed – but hasn’t yet been decided – is implementing Israeli law on the Israeli communities located there and not under the PA.” That appears to be a plan for Israel to seize control of the zone known as Area C.If Trump rules that out, as Macron and Blair hope,Benjamin Netanyahuwould have to accept.An interactive map showing areas administered by the Palestinian Authority, Israel, and those with shared security controlsBut after that, differences between the plans soon start to emerge.The New York declaration, forged through months of French diplomacy, proposes a technocratic administration for only a year in the initial transition, but then puts the PA at the centre of a new unified government covering Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.Yet the USbanned Abbas from even travelling to New York, so how could Washington accede to the PA ever being put in charge of a new, unified Palestinian state?The answer lies in the many benchmarks the PA would have to meet in the Trump plan before it would eventually take control. One diplomat said the proposal gives Israel many opportunities to apply its veto and slow the transition to Palestinian self-governance. One version of the Trump/Blair plan is for a transition where the administration of Gaza and the West Bank would be kept separate – something the PA opposes.We are sailing to Gaza. Here’s why | David AdlerRead moreSimilarly, the New York declaration gives the UN relief works agency, Unrwa, a central role in reconstruction – but the US and Israel have been bent on the destruction of the organisation on the baseless claim it is a terrorist front.There has been talk of the PA taking on Unrwa’s role, and reducing the emphasis on the Palestinian right to return. But since October 2023, Israel has been applying financial pressure on the PA by withholding the tax revenue it is due.So: how could Trump ever endorse a role for an organisation Israel is seeking to bankrupt? The answer is the reform of the PA, a phrase that has rung through the halls of diplomacy for more than 20 years, but never been achieved.0:51Israeli protesters march to Gaza border calling for war to end – videoThe constituent elements of the reform programme are well known: elections for a new president, a new parliament, and a commitment that all candidates must accept the Palestine Liberation Organisation’s charter, including Israel’s right to exist, a means also of excluding candidates that support Hamas. Other elements include an end of payments to political prisoners, and changes to the school curriculum.These are all huge asks of an organisation that has not held parliamentary elections since 2006.Abbas is already facing opposition to his plan to hold elections for the national council, the body that oversees the PLO, for the first time since 1964. His critics claim he is excluding those that have led the resistance to Israel in the past two years. It is a precursor of an argument that will rage inside Palestinian politics for many months.The reality is that no one can say what kind of Palestinian political leadership could emerge from the wasteland of Gaza and the burnt refugee camps of the West Bank. That is why Trump favours a transitional technocratic body that consults the PA.The final piece of the jigsaw is an international stabilisation force, something both the Trump and UN plans envisage. It would initially be stationed on the Egyptian-Israeli border, and enter the Strip in coordination with the Israeli and American sides. This would entail a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and the handover of Hamas weaponry.Training for a Palestinian security force would begin in Egypt, Jordan and a number of Islamic countries, with these officers reporting directly to the PA.Netanyahu has long insisted there will be no Palestinian state, and aspects of the Blair plan do not have the characteristics of self-governance. But the Israeli prime minister has failed to set out any vision of what happens after war ends in Gaza. The moment when he must say what he will accept is fast approaching.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaUnited NationsDonald TrumpBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Here we look at what the science says aboutvapingand its potential impact on teeth and oral health.Is smoking bad for teeth?A hefty proportion of vapers are former smokers or smoke as well as vape, so the first port of call is the impact of smoking. Humans started smoking long before modern science and there is a wealth of robust evidence on its health effects. The message is clear: smoking is extremely damaging to oral health.Beyond the bad breath, brown stains and loss of taste, tar and toxins in tobacco smoke increase the risk of gum disease. In severe cases, this can cause teeth to fall out. The disease can be harder to spot in smokers though, because nicotine reduces blood flow in the gums. This makes them less likely to bleed, which is one of the early warning signs of disease. Smokers may also struggle to overcome gum disease because of the continued onslaught of smoke and the effect smoking has on the immune system.Smoking causes more than a dozen types of cancer throughout the body and more than half of mouth cancers are linked to the habit.What about vaping?The impact of vaping on teeth and oral health is still being thrashed out. Far fewer studies have looked at the issue and many that have are flawed. A common problem is that studies fail to ensure vapers are not smoking cigarettes as well.“The absolute effects of vapes and their impact on oral health are unknown,” a spokesperson for the British Dental Association said. But they added that recent, limited evidence did raise concerns over oral dryness, irritation and gum disease caused by vapes.What do the studies say?Researchers at Newcastle University published amajor reviewthis year into the impact of vaping on periodontal health, meaning the gums, ligaments and bone that supports our teeth.Two markers of long-term disease are bone loss and pockets in the gum tissue around teeth, but there was no evidence these were any worse in vapers than in non-smokers or former smokers. The vapers did have slightly worse gum disease, “but it was pretty marginal”, said Dr Richard Holliday, a senior lecturer and honorary consultant in restorative dentistry at Newcastle.What about tooth decay?Again, the evidence is tentative, but there are some concerns. Inone recent study, US researchers analysed patient records for more than 13,000 people who attended dental clinics between 2019 and 2022. “Patients who vaped did show an increased risk of developing dental caries when compared to non-smoking and non-vaping patients,” Dr Karina Irusa, the study’s first author, told the Guardian.The Newcastle team also found higher levels of plaque in vapers compared with non-smokers or former smokers, which would be in keeping with a greater risk of dental caries. But more studies are needed to investigate whether vaping itself is to blame for tooth decay. There’s evidence thatnicotine users eat more sugar, so vapers may have bad teeth for reasons other than their nicotine habit.How might vaping cause tooth decay?A common claim is that sugar in flavoured vapes drives tooth decay, but manufacturers tend to use artificial sweeteners instead of sugar. This is because sugar burns at vape-operating temperatures, so using them would produce a burnt flavour and clog up the heating coil.If vaping does drive tooth decay, Holliday suspects that having a dry mouth, which vapers often mention, is part of the problem. “Saliva is a wonderful thing to protect your teeth. When you reduce that, tooth decay can happen more rapidly and gum disease can happen more rapidly, too,” he said.Saliva helps to keep teeth clean and it also contains calcium and phosphate that help withstand acid attacks from bacteria, and from drinks such as fruit juices, which are the key drivers of tooth decay.How vapes cause a dry mouth isn’t entirely clear, but vape liquids are the prime culprits. They are mostly propylene glycol and vegetable glycerol, which are hygroscopic, meaning they absorb and hold on to water.What about cancer?People who vape do not inhale anything like the number and variety of carcinogens in cigarette smoke. For this reason, the risk appears low. But it is an area scientists are watching, because vapers are still regularly inhaling chemicals into their bodies and the long-term effects on the delicate tissue in the lungs and elsewhere are not yet known.Is vaping safe for young people?England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, summed it up like this: “If you smoke, vaping is much safer; if you don’t smoke, don’t vape.” According to Holliday, that is sound advice. “If you’re a young person, don’t vape,” he said. “You are putting something into a complicated ecosystem, so there will be risks from vaping long term. But compared to smoking, they’ll be minuscule.”Explore more on these topicsVapingHealthSmokingDentistsMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite the show’s overly expository dialogue, Clarkston gradually gives way to an intimate story about trying to make the best of the hand you’ve been dealt.Heartstopper’s Joe Locke plays Jake, who wants his life to matter. A forcefully chipper and naive liberal arts graduate, he’s dreamed of heading west to follow the footsteps of his very distant relative, the pioneer William Clark, whose imperialist history is acknowledged if not fully wrestled with. But grounded by his Huntington’s disease, Jake has only made it as far as the nondescript city the explorer is named for. Taking night shifts at Costco, he clatters into the life of Chris (Ruaridh Mollica), whose tough, largely closeted exterior hides immense vulnerability.Mollica effortlessly breathes life into this hard-shelled character who doesn’t know how to talk to a man romantically and has never seen the ocean other than in photographs. Emerging from the night shift, his days are shadowed by his troubled mum, Trisha (played with immaculate control by Sophie Melville), an addict who manipulatively wrings discomfort from Jake’s misplaced efforts to help.View image in fullscreenImmaculate control … Sophie Melville as Trisha in Clarkston.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe script is often heavy-handed, with a backstory handed to us on a plate and little left unsaid. The staging presents limitations with necessarily perfunctory direction in the warehouse scenes, as cart-loads of cardboard boxes and cheese balls are stacked on Milla Clarke’s set. Strangely, some of the audience sit on stage with the actors, their presence adding little but trip hazards.Loneliness pervades Jack Serio’s production as each character loses what they’ve been working so hard to hold on to. But there are glimmers of hope in their nudged jokes, second attempts and the way they sit with each other at their worst moments, unsure what to say but knowing there is purpose in being there, to see what no one else has been allowed to see before.AtTrafalgar theatre, London, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndreviewsShareReuse this content"

With its name and location, painter Glenn Brown cheekily suggests that this personal museum of the art he collects, plus his own creations, is on a par with London’s famous gallery of rococo paintings and ancien regime clocks. The joke works best on your phone map where you can see how close they are.The current exhibition Hoi Polloi is curated by Brown and supposedly looks at representations of “the ordinary man” in art. It’s a satirical nudge at claims to social worthiness by public galleries for there is zero purpose or theme here, just a mixing and merging of the curious and eclectic in fascinating juxtapositions over four floors of a luxuriously restored building that even has a gothic cellar reminiscent of the one in the Sir John Soane’s Museum. Here you can be spooked by one of Gillian Wearing’s lifelike masks.View image in fullscreenLike festering wallpaper … Brown’s When the Satellite Sings.Photograph: ® The Brown CollectionSince this is Brown’s self-funded enterprise and entry is free, he has only himself to please. Part of the cheek of The Brown Collection is its implication that he is a national treasure who needs no introduction. That is, of course, untrue. Brown, who is from Northumberland, made his name selling paintings – ones that openly recreated and remade other artists’ works – to Charles Saatchi in the 1990s. He was nominated for the Turner prize and there was chatter about plagiarism, but his style has long since evolved into a subtle, technically brilliant obsession with the nature of brushstrokes themselves: what he is or isn’t imitating no longer seems relevant. He makes putting oil on canvas look like an exquisitely refined, utterly perverse pursuit.Brown’s own paintings are the biggest, brightest things here and their weirdness will have you gawping. His new painting The Hoi Polloi is a baroque portrait of someone of indeterminate gender with a blue face, huge ruby lips, and a fantastically creamy, riverine flow of orange curly locks. His point appears to be that no one is ordinary. But ascribing meaning to his imaginatively deranged art is a mug’s game.What fuels this art is art itself and in this erudite, ecstatic private museum art speaks to art across time. Brown has a penchant for the mannered, the odd, the lovely-ugly. This includes an engraving from 1586 by Hendrick Goltzius of a huge near-naked man on a small fat horse, the Roman hero Titus Manlius Torquatus. It is a florid, late Renaissance exercise in subjective excess. Nearby is Brown’s own 2024 painting When the Satellite Sings, where a lifesize nude male sits in a rustic setting, his skin a mass of decorative red and gold flourishes like festering wallpaper. This nude room also includes a row of insidious erotic phantasms by the German surrealist Hans Bellmer – four drawings and a painting, each an intense shot of psychic mayhem with tangled limbs and bulbous buttocks a go-go.Other artists are resurrected from the byways of art history. Austin Osman Spare, born in 1886, was a belated art nouveau symbolist who was rediscovered by the surrealists and is rediscovered again by Brown. Spare looks back at you piercingly from an occult void in his 1911 Self-Portrait. In a later work Man from the Meat Market with Bow-Tie and Top Hat, he relentlessly reveals each threatening fleshy nuance. There are also four portraits by the Scottish painter Anna Zinkeisen, including a nurse with a peculiar shadow across her face.View image in fullscreenPeculiar … Anna Zinkeisen’s Portrait of a Nurse.Photograph: ® The Brown CollectionBrown proves that artists can make the best curators and the most uninhibited collectors. His collection is packed with energy, surprise and fun, but there’s a fragility to it – some of the art would not be worth a second look if it wasn’t so playfully mixed. Only one painting is truly timeless: the Infant Christ, gazing at you out of the dark, by the 18th-century Venetian genius of the rococo, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. You can just make out the face of Joseph staring weirdly at heaven as Jesus perches on his shoulder.Brown himself is the show’s star and its problem. Is he actually a good artist? I’m still not sure. His paintings are, literally, all surface, all bizarre skin and hair, not inner selves. It’s a conscious provocation. Hoi Polloi includes his 2000 work The Real Thing, a pastiche of the late Frank Auerbach in which Auerbach’s massively thick paint is turned into a flat, glassy imitation of his brushy passion. Auerbach was trying to get at real pain and real life. Brown, as his title implies, thinks art can only be about art.By insisting on the emptiness and ultimate sterility of his own work, Brown may be condemning it to impermanence. But it does dazzle and his museum is gloriously eccentric, like something a fin de siècle visionary might have concocted to Illustrate the theory of art for art’s sake. Add a cafe, and this could become a beloved London institution – even when its creator is half forgotten.Hoi Polloi is atthe Brown Collection, London, until 8 August 2026Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingDrawingSculptureExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s a reason why toast remains a favourite breakfast option,second only to cereal.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And yet you probably give no more thought to your toaster than yourkettle. However, unlike the kettle, there is greater room for error when it comes to toasting bread. No one ever discarded their over-boiled water on to the compost heap, but many burnt slices of toast have ended up with the peelings.Not only should a good-quality toaster suit your bread of choice – whether that’s thick, rustic slices, bagels, crumpets or basic white bread – the best toasters can also save time, money and waste.At a glanceBest toaster overall:De’Longhi Ballerina Seta four-slice toaster£59 at John LewisBest budget toaster:Russell Hobbs Brontë 2S toaster£49.99 at AmazonBest premium four-slice toaster:Dualit NewGen Classic four-slice toaster£220 at John LewisThe best two-slice toaster:Bosch Compact toaster Styline Black£69.99 at Knees Home & ElectricalBest wide-slot toaster:Sage the SmartToastfour-slice toaster BTA845UK£159.99 at AmazonWhy you should trust meAlthough I am a porridge person during the week, at the weekend there’s nothing I like better than toast, bagels, English muffins and all the other good things that pop out of my toaster. So I relished the opportunity to test toasters, even if it meant sparking a one-woman bread shortage at my local Lidl. I’ve tested plenty of toasters during my 15 years as a professional product tester. I’ve tried everything, from those that gently rise to greet you with steaming golden slices to models that attempt new world records in distance pinged across the room. Consider this article my toast to toast.How I testedView image in fullscreenBasic sliced white and toastie bread, bagels and crumpets were all used to test each toaster’s performance.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianThink back to when you bought your last toaster and the acrid smell of its first use as the coating burned off the element. Multiply that by 13, and you’ll have an idea of the fug that filled my kitchen before testing these toasters. The fumes made my eyes water, and set off my smoke alarm. Fanning the fumes out of my front door, I had to shout at confused neighbours that it was “just all the toasters”, and that nothing was on fire.To make it as equal a contest as possible, I tested each toaster from cold with two slices of basic white bread (12 x 11cm) for up to three minutes on its level three – which is often the middle setting (manually popping up if necessary). While still hot, I then toasted another two slices to see how consistently the bread toasted when the toaster was used concurrently. If toast began to blacken, it was ejected before that occurred, and the time spent toasting was recorded.Using the same parameters, I then toasted bagels, noting the width of slots and ease of retrieval, followed by taller “toastie” bread (13 x 10.5cm), comparing the height of the slots to the slices and measuring the consistency of browning to the top.For crumpets, I chose level four on each toaster for up to four minutes, and noted whether I needed tongs to retrieve them afterwards (once the toaster was safely switched off, of course). I also used defrost settings to toast frozen bread straight from the freezer, noting if there was any difference in colour compared with fresh bread using the same browning level.View image in fullscreenCrumbs! Our tester got through several loaves of bread.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianFor each of these tests, I scored the toaster out of five, using the total score to determine its selection here. Two of the toasters had bun warmers: I tested these to see how well heat penetrated items on the rack, but the results were not factored into the overall score.I tested 13 toasters. Those I tried but haven’t included are: theDaewoo Sage Green Cascade two-slice toaster, which is best for smaller items as its 11cm slots meant even the tops of standard slices remained pale;Swan’s Windsor two-slice textured toaster, which, although affordable, toasted slowly and made retrieving bread difficult; and theBreville Edge silver four-slice toaster, a long-slot toaster that tended to blacken slices unevenly, while leaving tops pale.Those that I’ve recommended have been chosen for their consistency and ease of use. Value for money has also been considered, as well as build quality. All samples tested have been returned to their supplier or donated to charity.The best toasters in 2025View image in fullscreen‘The high heat worked well for crumpets’: the Russell Hobbs Brontë 2S toaster.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest toaster overall:De’Longhi Ballerina Seta four-slice toasterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£59 at John Lewis£59.99 at De’LonghiSeriously gorgeous, and available in a choice of five subtle shades (with matching plug and flex), you may wonder if the Ballerina Seta toaster is all style without substance. Fortunately, it isn’t: it has everything you need to make breakfast go smoothly, including a handy reheat if your toast has gone cold, consistent browning performance, and a high lift for plucking out small items, even crumpets.Why we love itNo matter what you like toasting, the versatile Ballerina Seta is sure to do a great job. Standard bread fitted all the way in, and toastie slices only peeped out slightly. While it wasn’t a perfect fit, the tall toast it produced was some of the best I tried – with rising heat, there was only a tiny sliver of pale at the top. It also performed brilliantly with frozen bread, turning out golden, evenly toasted slices.It’s a shame that …there might be two pairs of slots, but there’s only one set of controls.Height/width of slots:14cm x 3cm (HW)Dimensions:32 x 30.2 x 20.7cm (WDH)Slices:4Additional features:reheat, defrostBest budget toaster:Russell Hobbs Brontë 2S toasterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£49.99 at John Lewis£49.99 at AmazonEasy on the eye and with a charming moniker to boot, the Brontë 2S’s fluted exterior is sure to appeal to those who like attractive design without blowing the budget. There’s no compromise on useful features either, with reheat and defrost options, a lift and look feature so you can check on progress without cancelling toasting, and a high lift for retrieving smaller items.Why we love itIf you don’t like to wait for toast, the Brontë 2S is probably a good fit: it carbonised the first two slices, proving how fast and hot it could be. I gave the next two slices just under two minutes and was rewarded with toast perfection. The high heat worked well for crumpets, but singed the edges of a bagel: you will have to keep a close eye on it to get the best results, or start at level one and work your way up.It’s a shame that …the slots aren’t deep enough for tall bread – about an inch of toastie bread stuck out of the top, while standard slices didn’t toast right at the top.Height/width of slots:12.8 x 3cm (HW)Dimensions:27 x 19 x 18cm (WDH)JLsays H18 x W19 x D27cmSlices:2Additional features:defrost, reheatBest premium four-slice toaster:Dualit NewGen Classic four-slice toasterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£220 at John LewisHandmade in the UK and fully repairable, Dualit’s NewGen works a little differently from the toasters you might be used to. Not only can you select how many of its four slots you heat (so that you don’t waste energy on those you’re not using), but it also uses a mechanical rotary timer that ticks down to when toast is ready. A manual eject lever allows you to lift slices easily to check on progress.Why we love itThis model scored the same as the De’Longhi above and offers everything you could ask for in a toaster, but it’s pricey. The timer gives you a good idea of how long is left on the cycle, and it toasted fairly evenly and consistently. For bagels, it performed of all, with good browning on the inside, while smaller items were retrieved easily. It also scored highly for durability: there are few things that can go wrong with it, and if they do, every part can be replaced.It’s a shame that …it’s the most expensive toaster here, but if you’re serious about toast, this is the one to choose.Height/width of slots:13.2 x 3cm (HW)Dimensions:36 x 22 x 21cm (WDH)Slices:4Additional features:bagel, defrostThe best two-slice toaster:Bosch Compact toaster Styline BlackView image in fullscreen£69.99 at Knees Home & Electrical£69.99 at Marks ElectricalBosch’s Styline toaster offers a dizzying nine toasting levels, giving a finer degree of control over your perfect slice. And for those who enjoy freshly warmed bakery treats, there’s a gentle heat setting to use alongside an integral rack – not just a clever space-saver but brilliant for those who tend to mislay accessories.Why we love itThe Styline put in a consistently good performance with everything tested, resulting in evenly toasted slices and golden crumpets. And while toastie slices didn’t fit all the way in, rising heat meant they browned towards the top. I also really liked the low heatfor bun warming – although it doesn’t heat thicker items quickly, so you’ll need to flip them over a few times.It’s a shame that …defrost doesn’t quite deliver: compared with the slices toasted from fresh, the frozen bread had one pale half, with the other unevenly browned.Height / width of slots:H14.6 x W3.5cmDimensions:31.3 x 17 x 18.4cm (WDH)Slices:2Additional features:integrated bun rack, warming, defrostBest wide-slot toaster:Sage the Smart Toast four-slice toaster BTA845UKView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£179.99 at Lakeland£159.99 at AmazonWhether it’s homemade bread or a rustic slice, the extra-wide slots on Sage’s the Smart Toast have you covered: each one is about 4cm wide. And the design has done away with levers. Instead, bread is lowered with the push of a button before rising once done. There are several features for the aficionado too, including 30 seconds extra via the A Bit More button, a dedicated crumpet button and a light that ticks down as it toasts.Why we love itSage’s toaster turned out near-perfect standard toast, even from frozen, without a hint of blackening. It performed equally well with toastie bread, but a lack of depth meant the slices poked out slightly at the top. I also liked the slow rise to prevent toast pinging across the kitchen. I was less impressed with the crumpet button, however; it’s meant to work for bagels too, but it scorched them quickly.It’s a shame that …the slots might be wide, but they’re not as deep as some, which could be limiting.Height/width of slots:13.5 x 3.5cm (HW)Dimensions:28 x 26 x 19cm (WDH)Slices:4Additional features:A Bit More, Quick Look, crumpet, frozenskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

That said, once hot, the consistency slides: the second pair of slices I made were darker than the first, despite being on the same setting for the same amount of time. The bagel function worked well, leaving the exterior soft and the inside perfectly toasted. However, toastie bread was disappointing, leaving the top pale.It didn’t make the final cut because …no high-lift means it can be tricky to retrieve smaller items without tongs.Height/width of slots:13.5 x 3cm (HW);dimensions:31 (32.5 including the ball lever) x 19.5 x 19.8cm (WDH);slices:2;additional features:defrost, reheat, bagelLakeland Rapid toasterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£39.99 at Lakeland£31.99 at AmazonBest for:small but busy householdsWhile there’s not usually much waiting around for toast, on some mornings every minute counts. This is where the Lakeland Rapid toaster can be useful. It’s fast: having carbonised the first two slices in two minutes, when I tried again from cold it delivered toast in 1min 20secs, needing only a few seconds less for its consecutive pair. However, it does have a tendency to scorch edges and corners, especially on frozen bread and thicker items, and there’s not enough depth for toastie slices. That said, I liked its wide slots and high lift.It didn’t make the final cut because …the downside of speedy toasting is that bread can burn quickly too.Height/width of slots:13.5 x 2.9cm (HW);dimensions:17.5 x 30 x 20cm (WDH);slices:2;additional features:defrost, reheatZwilling Enfinigy four-short-slots toasterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£148 at Harts Of Stur£149 at ZwillingBest for:the easily distractedA toaster that promises never to burn your toast is an attractive premise. However, the reality of the Zwilling Enfinigy is that it’s fairly slow to brown: three minutes on level three yielded a pale, barely toasted result. Tops of slices also tended to be pale, more so for the toastie bread. I did like the Enfinigy’s gradual lift though, and felt that if the appeal of no burns outweighs the waiting around, it could still be a good investment.It didn’t make the final cut because …after four minutes on level four, crumpets weren’t golden brown and still fairly doughy rather than crisp.Height/width of slots:13 x 3cm (HW);dimensions:28.8 x 29.2 x 20.6cm (WDH);slices:4;additional features:defrost, reheat; bagelWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenConsider the size of your household when deciding on a two- or four-slice toaster.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianWhat key features should I look out for?While they’re not all strictly necessary, there are plenty of features that will make your toaster more versatile and convenient to use. A must for me is the high-lift lever, allowing you to retrieve bagels and other small items without burning your fingers or reaching for the tongs. Another handy one is “lift and look”, so you can check on toasting progress without cancelling the cycle.For busy mornings, toasters with a reheat setting mean no more cold slices at breakfast, while defrost settings add gentle heating to the beginning of the cycle to thaw your bread before toasting. And for those who like homemade bread or toastie slices, toasters with extra-wide or long slots should be able to accommodate different types of bread with ease.Other features I consider as nice-to-haves include the ability to add on a little extra time – for more browning without starting a new cycle – and bagel or crumpet options that usually toast the top or cut side without the same intense heat as the base.Two-slice toasters v four-slice toastersThe best deciding factors between a two- or a four-slice toaster are the size of your household and how often you enjoy a slice of toast. For those who eat toast frequently, or are catering for a crowd, a four-slice toaster is ideal, offering the highest capacity, and sometimes more handy features than a two-slice counterpart. However, if toast is an occasional treat, or you live in a solo household, a two-slice toaster will take up less space on your countertop and usually be more affordable.What do the numbers mean on my toaster?For most, the numbers refer to intensity, ie how brown the toast will be, with the lowest digits corresponding to lightly toasted slices and the higher ones to dark brown toastiness or items that need more heat, such as crumpets.These “capacitor-based toasters” feature a circuit that turns off once its capacitor (an energy-storing electrical component) charges up to a certain voltage. However, there’s little consistency between manufacturers and models. Less common are timer-based toasters, where the numbers refer to how many minutes the bread will be toasted.How to clean your toasterAlways unplug your toaster before cleaning. The majority have crumb trays that slide out to be emptied, so be sure to do this once a week if it’s in regular use. Hold your toaster over a bin, slide out the tray and empty it, using a small brush to dislodge debris. Next, hold the toaster upside down and give it a shake – this should remove more crumbs. Wash the tray with washing-up liquid and water, rinse and dry thoroughly before replacing. Finally, wipe down the outside with a damp, slightly soapy microfibre cloth, paying attention to dials and handles. If you find any crumbs in these parts, use your small brush to remove them. Dry with a towel.How to recycle your toasterIf your toaster is no longer working, there are several ways you can recycle it. These include at your local recycling centre, at stores that offer theRetailer Take-back scheme, kerbside recycling bins and drop-off points. Use the postcode checker atRecycle Your Electricalsto find options near you.

The anticipation of resistance in my chest and arms, followed by an emptiness, a blank, an absence. For a moment I lay facedown on the bouncy black floor of the gym. I let out something between a laugh and a sob. And then I rolled over on to my back. After a moment or two, I realized it was the only way I could stand up. My arms had nothing to offer.It had been about three months since my surgery. I had succeeded in my ambition of getting back to CrossFit. But something more than my breasts were missing.Yes, I know the stereotypes about CrossFit – how people who do it are cultish meatheads – and I guess that is why I tend to apologize when I tell people about my CrossFit habit, before I begin to evangelize.

I am someone who lived the first half of my life believing that the primary purpose of my body was to serve as a necessary vehicle for my brain. The secondary purpose, of course, was aesthetic. I grew up in the 90s, and I was an indoorsy person. I edited the school newspaper and played the cello. When I played field hockey, my dad made me wear a pair of safety goggles from his laboratory.I went to a public high school where the girls’ soccer team won the New York state championships several times. A big deal. I was not on the team – of course I wasn’t – but I sometimes had to play dodgeball against the girls who were. They were incredible. I remember at least one occasion when the match was so unbalanced that the gym teacher called a time out in order to bring my ragtag crew of teen intellectuals into a huddle and whisper:Girls, you’ve got to start cheating.I did dabble in exercise in my 20s and 30s, but my focus was on being thin, or something like it. From time to time I would join a gym and go three to four times before cancelling my membership. It never seemed worth the money. At my most active, I commuted by bike. For some years I had a yoga phase, and I enjoyed that, until it ended with a neck injury from a misaligned handstand.At my previous athletic peak, in the year after the 2016 election, I spent a wild amount of money on biweekly training with a very high-level boxing coach, as if that would prepare me to face the apocalypse. My shoulders developed a beefy look that I did not like. I did the math on how much I had spent ($7,000) and realized I could have also used it on the most luxurious vacation of my life, and felt some regret.Then: pregnancy, pilates, Covid, pregnancy, Zoom pilates. By 40 I didn’t hate exercise any more, but I didn’t prioritize it. I could go for weeks or even months without it.When I turned 41, my doctor reminded me that, yes, I should be working out. I was 41, after all. My cholesterol was a wee bit high.I sighed, and reluctantly decided to go to the gym. I needed one close enough that it felt impossible to ignore, as something deep within me objects to commuting just to work out. Too much effort. It needs to be right in front of me or I simply will not attend.On Google Maps, the nearest dot turned out to be a CrossFit one. I thought, “OK, I’ll try that.” Friends had told me about jumping on boxes – or was it flapping around with heavy ropes? I did not know. If the gym near my home had been a fencing one, or a rollerskating arena, perhaps I would be writing a different story.CrossFit, if you are not familiar, mixes strength training, cardio and gymnastics. It promises to physically prepare you for anything in life that comes your way. When I first heard that I imagined myself running away from a tiger over rough terrain. That, to me, was the vibe.The world so often regards our breasts as accessories, bolt-ons to our bodiesClasses are characteristically designed to be a little brutal, to push the athlete to the edge. There is a lot of emphasis on community, too. Never before in my exercise life had I done more than a cursory nod at another person who was also sweating in my presence, so the prospect of interacting with strangers was a little alarming. Would they make fun of me? My husband and I signed up together for the intro classes and a three-month membership. We went about once a week. Sometimes it was fun; sometimes it left us sore enough to dread the stairs for a day or two. But we kept going.And then I got my cancer diagnosis.“It’s like having a mole removed” is something one of the surgeons said during one of my many pre-operative consultations. I’m sure I raised my eyebrows, but I sort of understood the point. Compared with other -ectomies, on a purely anatomical level, a mastectomy is a surface-level procedure, one that does not require cutting past layers and levels of viscera to reach a problematic body part (unlike, say, my former appendix).And yet. A mastectomy is also a big deal. Mention was made of nerves that may be affected, of severance and regrowth. Allusions were made to the effect the loss of my breasts might have on my sex life, or my self-esteem, the way that my clothes fit. Mostly the focus was on how lucky I was: I had breast cancer, sure, that was unlucky, but an amputation of the breasts themselves would be sufficient. I would lose very few lymph nodes, I would not need radiation or chemotherapy infusions. I would get implants.Some days, I felt as if I was getting away with something. All I needed to do was let a surgeon get away with my breasts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was strange to enter the building in a zip-up sweatshirt with the knowledge that the fit would be completely different when I left.After the surgery, a kind physical therapist came in and showed me some exercises to do to ensure that my arms continued to be mobile: reaching up against a wall, that sort of thing. And that was it. For the remainder of my post-operative care, I received no referrals to physical therapy. I showed someone that I could raise my arms above my head without a problem and that was all. I thought I should be back to normal. But then I tried to do that push-up, and realized I was not.What’s the damage, really? I askedDr Anne Peled, a surgeon who is board-certified in plastic, reconstructive and breast oncologic surgery. “With a typical mastectomy,” she said, “many of the nerves that give sensation to the breast skin are injured, which can cause both numbness as well as chronic pain in the nerves called neuromas. Depending on the extent of injury, the numbness can extend from the collarbone to the upper abdomen.”I was not affected by chronic pain. But the numbness lasted a long time, as did tingling in my hands, especially when I woke up in the morning. For many mastectomy patients, lymphedema is also a problem: the arm gets swollen, which can impact mobility and also potentially cause other complications such as infections, Dr Peled said. And then there is cording, when fluid and scar tissue form palpable cords under the arm, which can also lead to pain and mobility problems.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’The world so often regards our breasts as accessories, bolt-ons to our bodies that Voguewill occasionally describe as “in” or “out”, depending on the season. A mastectomy reveals that it is not so simple. You can’t just whip them off and move on. Or even move like you used to.The laziness that made me start going to CrossFit is one of the most serendipitous things that has happened in my life. I just never would have gone for the first time after my surgery. I could not have started something new. I would have been terrified to walk into that unfamiliar space in that scarred body. I only went because I knew what it was like there. I knew that no one would judge me while I flailed on the floor in an unsuccessful push-up. I kept going because I knew that I would be celebrated when the push-ups got a little bit better.It’s not unusual. Dr Peled noted that there is strong evidence for the value of strength training in breast cancer recovery: “There are some good studies that show that strength training decreases the chance of getting lymphedema and can help with treatment,” she said, “so I recommend training [or] consultation with a physical therapist to all of my patients who have had lymph node surgery or radiation.”The thing that I like most about CrossFit is that I have never felt as if I am trying to compete against anyone else in the gym. That was an incorrect assumption, perhaps based on those childhood physical education classes. It may be my gym in particular, the community that has been nurtured there, but I have never feared comparison or judgment. I have actually – I can’t believe I’m saying this – made friends. Maybe that is why the membership of the gym ranges in age from teenagers to people in their 70s. Everyone is on the same team, competing against themselves. On the day that I finally did a successful push-up again, 18 months after my initial surgery, I felt like a champion. People fist bumped me – and not even in an ironic way.My friend’s cancer turned mammograms from a routine into something ominousRead moreI have Lynch syndrome, a genetic condition that means I will get cancer again in my lifetime, almost certainly. Every year I have a cascade of preventive tests and procedures. It’s kind of terrible, but it’s also just a fact of my life. It’s what it takes for me to be here, in this body I was born in.I cannot control when and if I will get cancer again. But I can play an active role in how fit I will be if it happens. That’s the event I’m training for. Each time I lift a barbell or swing a kettlebell, I think, “Well, here I am at CrossFit. I’m still alive.” And then I keep moving.Jean Hannah Edelstein is the author ofBreasts: A Relatively Brief Relationship, published in the US by Mobius HachetteExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyBreast cancerWomen (Life and style)FitnessWomen's healthCancerWomen (Society)featuresShareReuse this content"

Theassassinationof rightwing pundit Charlie Kirk exploded already fiery political tensions, with the Trump administration and its base embarking on a campaign of retribution the likes of which haven’t been seen since the McCarthy era, and stating, without sufficient evidence, that Kirk’s murder was the result of a wide-ranging leftist plot. Scores of people in the public and private sectors have been punished for commenting on the situation, most notably late-night hostJimmy Kimmel, whose show was briefly pulled off air after the chair of the Federal Communications Commission,Brendan Carr, put parent company Disney under pressure to do so.Suffice to say, the situation is far too dire to worry about where a cartoon sitcom fits into it all, but South Park is a special case. The first episode of season 27 revolved around the politically motivatedcancellationofStephen Colbert, another late-night talkshow host critical ofDonald Trump, while the second directly lampooned Kirk.Donald Trump is having a lovechild with Satan: South Park sets up future chaosRead moreMany on the right have declared South Park morally complicit in Kirk’s murder, despite the fact that Kirk himselfcelebratedthe parody (going so far as to use its caricature of him as his X profile picture). Repeats of that episode were pulled from Comedy Central, although it remains available to stream on Paramount+. Then, a week to the day after Kirk’s death, it was announced that the new episode of South Park would be postponed. This sparked speculation of censorship, although showrunners Matt Stone and Trey Parker roundly denied this, claiming it was simply a matter of a blown deadline (the result of their famously tight schedule).View image in fullscreenBrendan Carr is at risk of ‘losing his freedom of speech’.Illustration: Comedy CentralWhile that seems like an all too convenient excuse, Parker and Stone have never backed down from controversy before. Then again, said controversy has never been this furious before, nor hit so close to home for them. The big question ahead of the newest episode was: what wouldSouth Parkhave to say about all this?The answer is … not much.The latest instalment, provocatively titled Conflict of Interest, makes no mention of Kirk, although it does tackle the aftermath in a roundabout way. In one of the two main storylines, Trump, upset over the impending birth of his unholy lovechild with Satan, sets a series of convoluted traps to force an abortion, only for Carr to continually wander into them. By the end of the episode, Carr, badly injured and hosting a brain parasite as a result of toxoplasmosis from being buried in a mountain of cat poo, is at risk of “losing his freedom of speech”.View image in fullscreenTrump keeps trying to get Satan to have an abortion, but Brendan Carr won’t let it happen.Illustration: Paramount+Despite avoiding one of the touchiest subjects of the day, South Park steered headlong into another, finally addressing the genocide in Palestine by way of prediction market apps.

And if this week’s South Park didn’t quite meet the moment head-on, neither did it back down.

Photograph: Bob Parent/Getty ImagesIn the early years, American Jewish support for Israel was a fraught issue. The turning point was the six-­day war of 1967, which solidified a strength of feeling that has only recently begun to fractureByMark MazowerThu 25 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTShareEven before it existed,Israelwas on American minds. Colonial preachers called their new land Canaan; Herman Melville saw Americans as “the peculiar, chosen people, the Israel of our time”. In the Second Great Awakening of the late 18th and early 19th century, American Protestants became obsessed with the Holy Land, and it was perhaps in response that one Jewish preacher had called in as early as 1818 for Jews to establish themselves in Ottoman Syria. Christian Zionism flourished, remaining a powerful force in American politics to this day. But Zionism in the modern sense was largely a product of the mass migration from the Russian Empire, and even in the interwar years­ pro-­Zionist movements in America were still outranked socially by the officially “non-Zionist” American Jewish Committee (AJC), which represented the leadership of the most assimilated section of the Jewish population whose arrival predated the “Russians”. Their attitudes were reflected in the 1898 resolution of the American Reform movement, which declared itself “unalterably opposed to political Zionism” on the grounds that “the Jews are not a nation, but a religious community”.Into the 1930s, the AJC opposed the setting up of an international quasi-parliamentary Jewish organisation lest it imply that Jews owed an allegiance to one another that ranked above their allegiance to the political institutions of their own homeland. When the creation of the World Jewish Congress was mooted, the ΑJC objected to the view that “the Jewish people” was, or could ever be regarded as, “a united national organism”. The wartime AJC president, Judge Joseph Proskauer, regarded Zionist propaganda for a homeland in Palestine as “a Jewish catastrophe”, and insisted that “from every point of view of safety for Jews in America there has got to be an open, vocal Jewish dissent from nationalism and political Zionism”.The abandonment of this position and the wholesale American Jewish shift in the direction of Zionism only really took place during and after the second world war. In 1942, against the opposition of both the wartime American Council forJudaism, an anti-­Zionist voice, and the American Jewish Committee, several groups convened to demand the postwar establishment of a “Jewish commonwealth” in Palestine.The threat posed by antisemitism was taken very seriously by all sides, but they came down in different places as to how a Jewish state would affect it. The Zionists believed a Jewish national home would end the problem by providing a sanctuary to which all Jews would naturally gravitate. For anti-Zionists, antisemitism was a problem of racial prejudice and incomplete democratisation that was best fought in solidarity with other minorities in labour movements and unions and could not be solved by turning another­ people, the Palestinian­ Arabs, into a homeless minority in turn. The chief worry of the American Jewish Committee was that American antisemitism would undermine Jews’ acceptance in the United States, and so it remained committed to the ­long-term ideal of political emancipation worldwide. “We refuse to accept the thesis that Jewish emancipation is a failure because it has been repealed in many countries under Nazi pressure,” ran an internal wartime analysis.But with the establishment of Israel in 1948, hailed across the board by American Jews as an epochal event anti-Zionism as a political position was weakened, and the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism shrank to virtual irrelevance.Of the few figures who stood out against the tide, perhaps the most notable was William Zukerman, a journalist who had been reporting on international Jewish affairs since the 1920s.Arguing that since 1948 the terms ­anti-­Zionist and Zionist had lost their meanings, Zukerman described himself as “pro-Israel” but “anti-nationalist”.He criticised what he called “the wave of Messianic nationalism which the HitlerHolocausthas released” among American Jews. In embracing the ethnic chauvinism that had swept over the world since the late 1930s, he argued that the Jews risked adopting a cruelty that was already changing “the entire character of the people”. Israel had turned Jews into “conquerors” whose indifference to the plight of the Arab refugees betrayed Judaism’s tradition of sympathy for the oppressed. For Zukerman, the Israeli leadership’s deliberate efforts to identify the country with Jews abroad served merely to increase the danger of antisemitism faced by the latter since it introduced “new diplomatic and political reasons in addition to the old social, economic and psychological ones”.Zukerman’s articles were much discussed by American Jews at the time and are attracting new interest today. Nor was he alone: other Jewish leaders expressed similar concerns. But such a stance carried costs, and he was denounced as a “self-hating Jew” and an antisemite. What he termed a “perverted chauvinistic reasoning” meant that his opinions were treated “as almost the equivalent of treason”. He wrote: “To criticise any policy of Israel, whether it is the rendering homeless of a million native Arabs, the treatment of the Arab minority as­ second-class citizens or the transformation of the new state into a racial theocracy, is denounced not only as anti-­Israel but as ­antisemitic.”One senses the shock he felt at the term being applied in this way to someone like him, who had done as much as anyone to chart the rise of antisemitism in interwar Europe. We are here at the very beginning of what one might call a kind of Zionist usage of the term that was only conceivable once Israel itself had come into existence. Recent research has revealed that Israeli diplomats were concerned enough about Zukerman’s influence to mount a ­behind-­the-scenes campaign against him, enlisting American Zionist organisations and eventually pressuring the proprietors of Jewish newspapers to drop him. As a result, his articles ceased to be widely available and when he died in 1961 his Jewish ­Newsletter, which he had kept going for 14 years, folded.More ­consequential, because of its powerful position in American Jewish public life, was the transformation of the avowedly “non-Zionist” AJC, whose political sympathies by the late 1940s were adjusting to the establishment of Israel. Alongside the work it was doing to reconstruct Jewish life in Europe, the AJC was also supportive of Jewish refugees making their way to Palestine. But it disliked the Zionists’ braggadocio, and its anxieties about American Jewish vulnerability to the “dual loyalty” accusation were acute, above all in a time of cold war tensions, spy scares and mistrust of foreigners.The AJC was constantly worried about the Israelis as well; in fact it was far from assuming the cheerleading role of recent times. It is worth bearing in mind that in 1950 there were four times as many Jews in the United States as in­ Israel, and almost twice as many in New York City­ alone. A tussle for power between the community notables of American Jewry, on the one hand, and the Jewish state and its leaders, on the other, was all but preordained.View image in fullscreenAmerican journalist Edward R Murrow interviews David Ben-Gurion in May 1956.Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/Getty ImagesThe Israeli prime minister, David­ Ben-­Gurion, was the new political factor. He had very little time after 1948 for the organised American Zionist movement, which he believed lacked any further raison d’être once Israel had come into being. He assumed American Zionists worthy of the name would want to move to Israel, and he questioned their ­fibre – on occasions in ­public­ – when, to his dismay, this did not happen. For­ Ben-Gurion, as for Zukerman, who agreed at least on this, the underlying issue was a simple one: if the creation of Israel spelled the end of anti-­Zionism, understood as a movement opposed to a Jewish state coming into existence, did it not also by the same logic spell the end of Zionism as well?Although not especially attuned to American sensitivities, Ben-Gurion understood that winning over American Jewry really meant wooing the “non-Zionists” of the AJC, whose leader, Jacob Blaustein, enjoyed influence in Truman’s White House. But this was complicated by ­Ben-­Gurion’s repeated calls for American Jews to settle in Israel, something that infuriated Blaustein. Driven by his fear that Israel lacked a large enough population,­ Ben-­Gurion saw the United States as a badly needed reservoir of superior “human material” (preferable in many ways to the tattered and traumatised survivors coming in from wartime Europe).“Ben Gurion urges US parents to send their children to Israel for permanent settlement” was the headline reporting a speech he gave in Israel in 1949. “We appeal to the parents to help us bring their children here,” he had said, before pouring fuel on the flames by adding: “Even if they decline to help, we will bring the youth to Israel.” The AJC leadership were so angry that they warned Ben-­Gurion they would protest publicly if he did not refrain. He needed, they insisted, to revise his assumptions. American Jews were not in exile; America, not Israel, was their home, and their families, not Israeli politicians, were responsible for Jewish children. They wanted this message spelled out lest it make them liable to the accusation that their American patriotism was lacking.Tensions grew so bad that in the summer of 1950, Blaustein visited Israel at the prime minister’s invitation to sort out their disagreements. It was an extraordinary meeting. Ben-­Gurion’s remarks afterward were conciliatory; Blaustein’s were longer, tougher and emphatic. Speaking almost as the senior partner in the relationship, he emphasised “American Jewry” as an equal to Israel itself, willing to support it but nonetheless with its own interests. He stressed the need for liberal democracy to take root in the new country and offered the assistance of American Jews “within the framework of their American citizenship”. But he warned that goodwill was “a two-­way street”.Both men got what they wanted, but perhaps one got more. Blaustein clarified that American Jewry were not in exile but Ben-Gurion did not actually disavow the ideal of aliyah (Jewish emigration to Israel); on the contrary, even though American emigration to Israel in the 1950s averaged fewer than 400 people a year, Ben-­Gurion kept up his calls for Jews to come and settle. It was a constant theme in the campus visits he made to the United States in 1960.For similar reasons, the Israeli premier also insisted that Zionist organisations abroad had an absolute obligation “under all circumstances and conditions” to “aid the Jewish state”. This statement was made during the show trials in eastern Europe, and was hardly helpful for the Jewish communities in those countries defending themselves against Communist accusations of dual loyalty; the AJC was once again furious. Nor was it happy that Israeli officials had begun the practice, ­not regarded in those days as quite as normal as it is today, of discussing antisemitic incidents abroad directly with governments over the heads of local Jewish communities, as though it were in fact their primary protector. Eventually Blaustein accused ­Ben-­Gurion of contradicting the assurances he had given him at their meeting in 1950. To demand the allegiance of every Zionist to help Israel, whether or not their own government wished it, was “an unheard‑­of request for allegiance to a foreign power”.View image in fullscreenJacob Blaustein.Photograph: colaimages/AlamyYet the Ben-­Gurion government continued to assert that it had the authority “to speak and act for Jews everywhere”. Its 1952 legislation that settled the fate of the old international Zionist organisations begins with the statement: “The State of Israel regards itself as the creation of the entire Jewish people.” The AJC had argued for the inclusion of a crucial clause: “The State of Israel, representing only its own inhabitants, regards itself as the creation of the entire Jewish people.” But to Blaustein’s fury, this clause did not appear in the version passed by the Knesset. Ben-Gurion was not especially apologetic: he told the angry Americans that Israel was like any other state, and therefore had no need to define whom it represented.Both men understood what was really at stake and knew who had come out on top. Ben-Gurion caused uproar once again when he told the 25th Zionist Congress that Jews living in the comfort of the west were violating the faith itself and that Judaism “faces the kiss of death, a slow and imperceptible decline into the abyss of assimilation”. Once more the AJC complained; once more to little avail.In the early years of Israel’s existence, as this to‑­ing and ­fro-­ing suggests, the new state did not generate the kind of widespread support among American Jews that we associate with it today. The scholar Ben Halpern had shown in 1959 that a general sentiment of support for, and identification with, Israel did not mean that most American Jews necessarily saw their own fates as bound up with its welfare in the way they would come to do later. In 1966, Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, among the most acute commentators on the American Jewish scene, even chided American rabbis for their coolness toward Israel. “No one can today make a major career within American Jewry through Zionist political activity,” he wrote. The dual allegiance inhibition remained strong; the assimilationist ideal remained powerful and discouraged public assertions of American Jewish connection to Israel.It was the six-­day war in 1967 that was perhaps the real turning point, immeasurably boosting Israel’s image in the United States and thereby transforming the relationship between Israel and American Jewry. After it, the last of the sharp ideological conflicts and disagreements that had been evident through the second world war gave way to a mutual embrace, emotional as much as political.­Zionism – ­in a new and attenuated sense of being generally supportive of Israel and feeling some special kinship with it – increasingly unified the American Jewish mainstream. In the words of the Israeli historian Evyatar Friesel, “not only was Zionism ‘Americanised’, American Jewry became ‘Zionised’”. It is hard now to recapture the radical nature of this shift, not least because it was something of a paradox. As the commentator Henry Feingold noted: “The American Jewish identity, which Zionists predicted was destined to fade … was actually strengthened by the establishment of the Jewish state.”How passionately the six-­day war made ordinary American Jews feel about­ Israel – ­and by extension about their own­ lives –­ emerges in interviews given by the Jewish residents of a midwestern suburb to the brilliant sociologist Marshall Sklare. Working for the American Jewish Committee’s Division of Scientific Research, Sklare had first visited the place he called “Lakeville” in the 1950s; after thesix-day war he returned. (Lakeville was likely the Chicago suburb of Highland Park on Lake Michigan.)The people Sklare spoke with said they had been swept up in the intensity of the moment more than with any other event they could remember. All had felt unambiguously ­pro-­Israel and sure which side was right. They had also felt no strain between their loyalties to America and what they felt for Israel, or more precisely, in Sklare’s words: “They strove not to perceive any such strain.” They had all given money as a way of helping, and Sklare was struck by the fact that “strange as it may seem”, and despite the lack of any evidence for the belief, “even today [they] connect their own actions with the Israeli victory”.View image in fullscreenIsraeli tanks advance during the six-day war, June 1967.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesMost said they had been pleasantly relieved that non-­Jews too had supported the Israeli side, and they believed American Jews had won a new respect in American eyes because of the Israeli victory. To Sklare’s surprise, none of them had visited Israel over the previous decade, even though flights had become cheaper, and more surprisingly still, only one of them had any plans to. As for the idea of making aliyah and settling there, that was a nonstarter: Life was good in “Lakeville”.At bottom, their sense of intense commitment to Israel, Sklare concluded, was less about Israel itself (which most of them knew little about) than it was about the history of the 1930s, and could only be understood in psychological terms.For Sklare, the memory of the Holocaust and the significance American Jews attached to it was central. In his view, the six-day war had reawakened the thought that the Holocaust could be repeated; and accompanying that, the reflection that if it happened again, American Jews would once more escape unscathed just as they had done during the second world war, through no special virtue of their own but by mere chance. If their good fortune the first time around seemed hardly justified, they could at least act now in such a fashion as to suggest that their exemption had led to “some good purpose … Thus our support for Israel is intimately connected with our desire to preserve a feeling of our worth as human beings.”Sklare argued that Israel’s creation and existence had restored what he called “a sense of meaning” for American Jews after the second world war. At least for the inhabitants of Lakeville, it could seem that “something new, clean and good was born” out of the genocide. Thus, were Israel to be annihilated, the final victory would – in some metaphysical sense – belong to Hitler, and American Jewry would be faced with a “complete loss of meaning” and “total anomie”. Sklare’s analysis suggested that it was because the destruction of Israel would threaten the psychic existence of American Jewry itself that people felt so strongly that the country had to be supported. At the same time, he suggests, its victory ensured the even tenor of American Jewish life could continue largely undisturbed.It is perhaps in this largely forgotten pamphlet that we encounter the most searching and thoughtful exploration of the roots of American Jewry’s impassioned engagement with Israel in the moment of its emergence – before “standing with Israel” was taken for granted and before it became regarded as a normal and self-evident dimension of communal life, an aspect so essential to being Jewish that any deviation would itself seem remarkable.American public backing for Israel in the 1967 ­six-­day war revealed the existence of an essentially supportive national political environment that has only begun to fracture in recent years. American Jewry itself, never a monolith, came together in support as never before. “Israel became the focus of American Jewry,” writes one scholar. Giving to the United Jewish Appeal rose from $65m in 1966 to $240m the next year and to $511m by 1974. This was the real beginning of pro-Israel political advocacy in the United States, though it was as yet on a small scale compared with today.As American Jewish rallies revealed how popular the cause had become, the AJC abandoned what was left of its residual “non-Zionism”. When AJC leaders flew to Israel to urge peace on the prime minister, he asked them not to get involved in the question of territorial concessions. Unstinting backing was now expected, and with only sporadic exceptions it has been given ever since. In the AJC’s annual report for 1966–­67, “Israel” had come far down the list, below the struggle for civil rights and against discrimination and antisemitism; in ­1967-68 it had moved to the top. And there it stayed.In my youth, Judaism and Zionism felt synonymous. Now the American Jewish consensus has collapsedRead moreYet in one critical respect the times remained very different from ours. There were already voices, many of them Jewish, warning that the country’s military triumphs and territorial conquests might yet yield only a Pyrrhic victory. But condemnation of Israel was not yet so regularly connected to the issue of antisemitism. In the 1950s, antisemitism was still associated in the minds of most American Jews with nazism and ideas of white supremacy and racial prejudice – what was left of a world “that had seemingly been destroyed with Hitler’s armies”, in the words of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), but that had not been completely eradicated.A conference to discuss antisemitism that the ADL held in New York in 1962 offers an intriguing snapshot of how the subject was understood in the decades before it automatically came to be linked with the Middle East. Participants focused chiefly on rightwing extremism (which they saw as on the wane), Christian fundamentalism and surviving patterns of social and professional discrimination. A sociology professor talked about stereotypes and the difficulty of really understanding the phenomenon theoretically. There was discussion of continued Jewish exclusion from resorts and private clubs, of the malleability of youth, and of fostering the ability to “agree to disagree”. There was surprisingly little discussion of the civil rights movement or the fight to end segregation, however, and two matters that would today be inseparable from any treatment of the subject simply never came up. One was the Holocaust; the other was Israel. In the space of a generation, things were to change radically.Adapted from On Antisemitism: A Word in History by Mark Mazower, published by Allen Lane.

Let’s be honest: as Labour in government, we’ve sometimes struggled with both. We’ve found it hard to tell the real story about what is wrong with Britain and how we are going to fix it. For too long we’ve allowed Nigel Farage toset the terms of the debate, and far too often our responses have seemed tactical, not principled. By tacking one way and then the other, we have failed to provide a clear sense of whose side we are on and why.As a result, we risk losing support by taking progressive voters for granted while failing to articulate a clear and compelling argument to those flirting with Farage that sets out why they would be wrong to put their faith in him.Taking onReform UKis the battle of our political age, but we shouldn’t end up arguing on their terms, using their language. We need to wrest back control of the political megaphone that Farage brandishes and use it to amplify a Labour message based on the values we cherish – and that the British people share. AsLabour’s deputy leaderI would take the fight to Farage in a way that would energise our movement and expose the mendacity his populist rhetoric disguises.This week, the Reform leader announced he woulddeport millions of peoplewho live here legally, rounding up law-abiding residents with settled status who work hard, pay their taxes and help make our country great. It was the most outrageous political announcement of my lifetime, raising the prospect of US-style immigration raids on homes and workplaces. The parents we meet outside the school gates, the neighbours we chat to on the street and the colleagues we share a drink with after work could be tracked down, arrested and disappeared. It is a disgraceful scheme cooked up by a man who is the love child of Margaret Thatcher and Enoch Powell. No amount of posing with pint in hand and fag in mouth can mask the malice, division and hatred that drives it.We need to call out Farage for what he is, strongly and unashamedly. When the US president lies about about Londonwanting to “go to sharia law”under mayor Sadiq Khan, we have to call it out. When billionaires like Elon Musk encourage violencein our communities, we have to face up and fight. There can be no triangulation in the face of the hard right.We need to rediscover the intellectual self-confidence to take the fight to Farage and set out the solutions the country needs to tackle the deep-seated problems holding Britain back.Like all populists, Farage advocates simple solutions to complex problems. He tells voters that immigration is the root cause of deep societal challenges, including underfunded public services and stagnating living standards. The truth is they are caused bydeep inequalitiesthat lie at the heart of our economic system that have been exacerbated by 14 years of chaoticConservative rule.From Thatcherism to Cameron-era austerity, the Covid pandemic and the energy crisis, the majority of people in this country feel the economy has been run for the benefit of someone else rather than them. The wealthiest are cushioned from economic turmoil by asset inflation, while the less fortunate battle job insecurity, falling pay, rising rent, andsoaring food and energy bills. Inequality between classes, communities and regions has worsened over the last few decades.This is as true for the young person living in a city paying an extortionate rent as it is for the older couple living near a run-down town centre, the shopkeeper in suburbia struggling to make ends meet or the undervalued care worker who has to take the bus to work in the early hours of the morning.We need to be far clearer that we are on their side as a government whose only objective is to serve ordinary, hardworking people of all ages, ethnicities and backgrounds.Labour has already achieved a huge amount. We are introducingnew workplace rights, have raised theminimum wage, brought railwaysback into public ownership, and created thousands of newGP and hospital appointments. But these policies need to be set out as part of a Labour narrative that explains how we are rewiring the country so it works for everyone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Football can helpRead more“It’s something that wasn’t a surprise, but I’m glad we’re able to show it,” Women in Football’s CEO, Yvonne Harrison, says. “It was a trend that was visible to us last year but the sample size wasn’t big enough to be able to use it. The fact is that women of colour are disproportionately affected in terms of opportunities, perceptions and in terms of the obstacles that they face.“I’m pleased that we’re able to highlight that because anecdotally we knew it to be true and we see it, particularly where we’re talking about women from underrepresented communities in leadership positions.”Perhaps most damning is that levels of optimism about the future of the industry are substantially reduced for women from underrepresented ethnic origins. Despite the challenges presented to women working in the industry, 77% of women are optimistic about the prospects for women in it. Meanwhile, 55% said the football sector is one where women can excel, but for women of underrepresented ethnic origins this dropped to 29%.“We are very intentionally aware of our membership base and working to engage more people from different communities and collaborating with other organisations who are working with different communities already,” Harrison says. “The saddest thing of all for me is the optimism statistics because four in five women, despite all of the evidence that we’ve got, are still optimistic, but actually that drops to less than a third for people from an underrepresented ethnic background.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Jess Carter withdrew from social media during Euro 2025 after suffering racial abuse.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Richard Sellers/Apl/Sportsphoto“Then it’s the same for the aspiration piece, where women feel like they can excel: just under 30% of women from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds compared with 55% of women feeling like they can excel in this industry isn’t good enough. Women in Sport produced some specific research around the ‘dream gap’ for young black girls and that talks to this as well.”Separate from workplace sexism, women from underrepresented ethnic origins are also at the sharp end of discrimination and abuse, with 76% of women saying the level of discrimination they experienced online had stayed the same or increased, compared with 81% of women from underrepresented ethnic origins, while 56% of women cited unconscious bias as one of the biggest challenges of working in the industry compared with 75.6% for women of underrepresented ethnic origins.The rise in online abuse has been highlighted in recent weeks, with the Tottenham forward Jessica Nazspeaking about the racist abuseshe has been subjected to online and the journalist Alison Bender posting about rape threats she has received. England’sJess Carter withdrew from social mediaduring Euro 2025 after suffering racial abuse.“It’s disgusting and we see it for players, but also coaches, administrators, broadcasters, journalists,” Harrison says. “We almost absorb them as ‘it is what it is’. The fact that more women are having the courage to just put it out into the world is helpful to the cause to go: ‘You know what, this is happening all the time and it’s not OK.’ But that comes at a risk and a cost to those women because no doubt their inboxes are filled with a load more. Then if you’re a woman of colour it’s going to come at you two times more. If you’re somebody from the LGBTQ+ community, it’s going to come at you more, too.

Another key finding was that 86% of women believe they have to work harder than their male counterparts to achieve the same recognition and benefits. Only 69% of men surveyed agreed with them.“That is an interesting perception gap,” says Harrison. “Men’s perceptions of women’s experiences in the game are quite different. So what comes out of the survey is that men have a much more optimistic view about what it’s like for women and the reality is quite different and that’s why having this data is so important because it’s an opportunity to objectively help educate and provide knowledge.

The pairing has been controversial in Norway: Märtha Louise stepped down from her official duties before marrying Verrett, the couple have a history of promotingpseudoscientific beliefs, and Verrett – who is black – has long been the target of racist abuse. It is on this last point that Verrett used the programme to deliver a stinging critique of his in-laws, King Harald and Queen Sonja.“Most people who are white are trained to listen to white people and not to people of colour,” he says in the film. “Her father, her mom, her brother … they didn’t even know what racism was. They would look at me like I was crazy when I would say there’s racism.”It makes for dramatic television. But the portrayal of the king and queen as naive, out of touch and even prejudiced is not just misleading, it distorts what they represent inNorway. In fact,for families like mine, the royal couple became a rare unifying force in a society still learning what diversity meant.International viewers might see this as an echo of Britain’s Windsors, glamorous, scandal-ridden, polarising figures who dominate headlines – whereas the Norwegian royals may come across as quieter, less visible, and largely uncontroversial. In reality, Harald and Sonja have been moral anchors in a country that only began receiving significant immigration from Asia and Africa in the 1970s. They wield no political power, yet their authority carries weight. For many Norwegians with immigrant backgrounds – myself included – the royal couple have been among the few who have consistently spoken of us as belonging.That is why Verrett’s accusations have provoked fury and widespread rebuttals. This groundswell of support was not engineered by the palace: citizens spontaneously rallied behind their king and queen.View image in fullscreenThe marriage of Durek Verrett and Märtha Louise, in Rebel Royals.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixSome of the loudest voices have come from minority communities. On aprime-time debate showdays after the Netflix documentary premiered, queer activists and representatives from religious groups, disabled communities, anti-racist networks and women’s organisations lined up to testify to the couple’s inclusivity.The examples are not hard to find. In 2016 theking declared: “Norwegians have come from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Poland, Sweden, Somalia and Syria.” For tens of thousands of us, that single line cut through the online hate telling us we would never be “real Norwegians”. Inclusion and diversity have not been symbolic gestures, but the king’s life’s work. In his New Year’s Eve speech in 2007 the king addressed racism directly: “We are constantly reminded that humanity and mutual respect cannot be taken for granted. Xenophobia, everyday racism and violence are part of the news picture. Tolerance can be enshrined in law – but prejudice against those who think differently has its roots in the human mind. It is there that the battle must be won.”Sonja, who was not born a royal and fought for nine years to be allowed to marry Harald, has channelled her own experience of exclusion into decades of advocacy for women and minorities. In a small, homogeneous country, these gestures have mattered.None of this means Norway is free of racism. Its recent politics underscores the tension: in the last election, an anti-immigration party made surprising gains, indicating how fragile social cohesion feels in a time of heightened polarisation. Verrett’s personal experiences of prejudice deserve acknowledgment. But to brand the monarchs as ignorant or racist does more harm than good. If every criticism is recast as racism, the term itself is emptied of power – leaving those most affected less protected.Verrett’s own controversies also matter. In Norway, he has been criticised less for his skin colour than for his actions:selling amuletshe claimed could protect against Covid, or suggestingchildhood cancer is caused by unhappiness. His self-promotion jars with Nordic norms of modesty. Conflating cultural disapproval with racial bias only deepens mistrust.The lesson is larger than Norway. Public figures invoking racism carry responsibility: their words can clarify, but they can also obscure. If we want the fight against discrimination to succeed, we must name real prejudice when we see it – and also recognise genuine allies, even when imperfect.For all their privilege, King Harald and Queen Sonja have opened doors, literally and figuratively, to those once shut out. They deserve better than caricature. And Norway – like every democracy – deserves a conversation about race that confronts hard truths without collapsing into distortion.Shazia Majid is a columnist at the Norwegian newspaper VGDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Warning signs are already thereLarry ElliottThe longer the period between crises, the greater the complacency. That complacency is pushing share prices ever-higherThu 25 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 12.49 EDTShareUS job creation has stalled and, despite the curbs on migration,unemployment is rising. Tariffs are pushing up the cost of imports. And Donald Trump is at war with the governor of his own central bankand wants him out.But traders on Wall Street are not bothered by the fact that inflation is above the target or that growth is slowing. Share prices are testing new record levels on an almost daily basis. Jerome Powell, the man Trump wants to be rid of, says stocksare “fairly highly valued”, which is an understatement if ever there was one. By historical standards, stocks are extremely highly valued. There is trouble – perhaps big trouble – ahead.Recessions happen rarely and the same goes for financial crashes. Both are predicted more often than they materialise. Leaving to one side the exceptional circumstances of the 2020 pandemic, it has been 17 years since there was a prolonged fall in share prices. Memories of the slump that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers17 years ago this month have dimmed. Traders in their 20s and 30s have little or no experience of what a genuine financial market panic feels like.That’s the first warning sign. The longer the period between crises, the greater the complacency, the sense that the good times will go on for ever. Those who note that all previous booms have ended in painful busts are ignored. The old lie – it’s different this time – is trotted out.The belief that the party will continue has pushed share prices ever-higher in New York and London, even though the reasons for the optimism are tenuous. In the UK, the economy is barely growing while inflation isrunning at almost doublethe Bank of England’s 2% target. As was the case last year, constant speculation about tax rises to be announced in the budget is hitting consumer and business confidence.The record-breaking run of share prices on Wall Street is the result of a bet that artificial intelligence will raise the economy’s growth rate. That may happen, but it will be years before the impact is felt. The same was said of the IT boom that propelled share prices to dizzying heights in the late 1990s. It wasn’t different that time either.No two market crashes are alike. The current state of affairs feels different from 2008, when the crash was caused by the overexposure of banks to the US housing market, and turbocharged by the widespread use of new financial instruments that were supposed to reduce risk but did the opposite. If there are parallels, they are with the recession-triggered stock market setbacks of the 1970s and early 1980s, when downturns were deliberately engineered to combat high inflation.All of which makes the power struggle between Trump and Powell pivotal. Despite what the president might say, the performance of the US economy is mediocre at best, although the weaknesses have been disguised by the fact that the better-off have been doing just fine. The top 10% of earnersaccount for almost halfof consumer spending – the highest level since the late 1980s.View image in fullscreenTraders in Chicago on 16 September 2008, the day after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.Photograph: M Spencer Green/APThe bias towards the rich is nothing new but creates its own risks. Exposure to the stock market has never been higher, with 30% of the wealth of Americans accounted for by shares. Since share ownership is concentrated among the better-off, theUS economyis relying on the Wall Street boom continuing, and for the rich to carry on spending their gains.Americans trying to get by on low and middle incomes are not so fortunate. Since the end of the pandemic, they have seen their real incomes pretty much flatline. As one Wall Street analyst, Mark Zandi, put it, the fate of the US economy lies in the hands of the well-to-do. “As long as they keep spending, the economy should avoid recession, but if they turn more cautious, for whatever reason, the economy has a big problem.”One obvious reason for the rich to turn more cautious would be a fall in share prices. If that happened, their wealth would take a hit and they would spend less. Growth would slow. Add in the negative impact of tariffs and there would be a genuine threat of recession next year. In those circumstances, Powell and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve would be expected to support share prices by cutting interest rates. Indeed, it is Wall Street’s certainty that the US central bank willbow to Trump’s pressureto do so that is preventing share prices from falling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As Dario Perkins of the research firm TS Lombardputs it, just as trade unions were the custodians of full employment immediately after the second world war, so central banks were the custodians of neoliberalism. While ostensibly independent, they made sure that capital triumphed in the fight against labour – and carried on winning. In both the global financial crisis of 2008 and the pandemic, central banks took aggressive action to put a floor under share prices.So Powell may well deliver, but he may not. The Fed has twin targets: to keep inflation at 2% over time and to support employment. Inflation is running at just under 3% so there is now a choice: keep interest rates higher than the markets expect in order to tame inflation, or ditch the inflation target to justify interest rate cuts.Either way, the prospects are not good. If the Fed resists the pressure for cheaper borrowing, it increases the chances of the US economy falling into recession. If it bows to the pressure, it will keep the stock market bubble inflated – for now at least – but at the risk of higher inflation. This could well trigger a backlash from the bond markets, which in effect set the interest rates for mortgages and servicing the US national debt,currently 124% of GDP.It is always easier to be wise after the event and identify the causes of stock market crashes with the benefit of hindsight. There should be no such problem this time. In the months to come, we shall see whether the bull market can survive the president’s attempt to set US interest rates from the White House.

It shouldn’t be.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS economyOpinionUS economic growth and recessionFederal ReserveStock marketsFinancial crisisEconomicsBankingcommentShareReuse this content"

I cried, I resisted. The pain was doubled because even at that age I was already drawn to reading about rights and freedoms. My suffering came from knowing that my rights were being violated, along with my adolescence and childhood.But soon I had to accept the situation after hair was ripped from my head, my face smashed to the ground and threats of being pulled out of school. Any attempt to refuse this groom in front of him or his family, I was told, would end in my death.I remember the nights before meeting him: my mother threatened to strangle me in my sleep, while my father described in detail how he would take me to the relatives’ village and throw me into a well.I was left alone to endure beatings, psychological pressure – and the daily chorus of being a shameI begged my aunts, who themselves had been married off young and against their will. They refused to intervene, perhaps out of fear of reopening their own wounds. I was left alone to endure beatings, psychological pressure and the daily chorus of being a shame for wanting to break my father’s word.Yet was my father himself not a disgrace to humanity, to mercy, for ignoring his child’s tears?I began to blame my body, which already looked like that of a 20-year-old. In another country, such a body might have been encouraged in sport or modelling. Here, it was seen as something to be covered up through forced marriage.I hated my period, because it qualified me for this marriage; its pain became a greater pain. I hated my future husband. I hated the dress, the songs – and I hated myself.On the day of the marriage, I remember the girl in the beauty salon who struggled to apply makeup to my childish face, my tears turning it into a puddle, until she cried with me.For most women this is a day of joyful tears. For me, it became a stain.‘The end of women and children’s rights’: outrage as Iraqi law allows child marriageRead moreI was a doll in the middle of songs and laughter – laughter that was not mine, words of celebration that did not belong to me. I sat beside him, part of my growing chest exposed by the dress his mother had chosen. Everything was chosen for me; I chose nothing. That day exists only as a blur.Each time he tried to slip the ring on my finger, I pulled away. Relatives thought I was being shy. In truth, I felt disgusted.I barely spoke to him. My hatred was so intense I imagined plunging the cake knife into his heart. How could he want to marry a child, even if her body looked fully grown?In the early days I avoided him, focusing on exams and schoolwork. But his gifts, his attention and his kindness – against the backdrop of my family’s violence and pressure – gradually weakened the sharp edge of my hatred.I became confused. Do I hate you, or love you?I ran out of ways to keep hating him and avoiding him. Sickness, exams, headaches – I even forced myself to vomit to stay in bed.Then, a month later, my father beat me more violently than ever before – snapping a cane across my back, then reaching for a hammer, a wrench, anything within his grasp. All because I had used the phone at the wrong time.I remember how my husband touched the wounds on my hands, how he refused to believe the story that I had fallen down the stairs, how I cried in front of him and he did not press me for details.My father beat me more violently than ever – snapping a cane across my back, then reaching for a hammerMaybe this man, who would not allow me to go to university and wanted me to wear theabayaandniqab, would still be more merciful than my father?He was kinder, and my family encouraged me to stay with him alone, hoping I would warm to him. He was affectionate and generous.But I could not tell – did I love him, or the affection he gave me?When he left, I hated him. When my family turned cruel, I loved him. It was too much confusion for a girl my age.One day, as he was helping me with a school subject close to his speciality, he suddenly kissed me. My body reacted with both a gentle shiver and a tickle of pleasure, and then with anger that burst out in a scream.I did not want my first kiss to be with him. Even now, I feel it was stolen from me. He stole from me the choice of who would kiss me first – even if that man would later betray me or leave me. I wanted the right to choose.At the time, my scream was interpreted as shyness, as having crossed a “taboo”. According to how we were raised, a man was not supposed to touch his wife before the wedding night [inIraqthe public wedding party takes place at a later date after the marriage].After that kiss, he began to tame me in ways I only understood years later. With every complaint I had about school, family or dreams he silenced me with a longer kiss, awakening places in my body I had not discovered.I felt disgusted by my body, by myself … a spiral of guiltHe turned study time or rare outings into moments of sexual play. He began to teach me what marriage and intimacy meant.When I refused his touch, he sulked and blamed me for his desire, making me feel responsible for satisfying him. “You are my wife,” he would say, placing on me the burden of relieving his lust.Later I learned this was emotional manipulation – whether intentional or not – of a teenager experiencing her sexuality for the first time.I don’t know if he was a womaniser, but he knew how to make me surrender – out of fear of losing him and a craving for the sweetness he offered.I grew afraid of disappointing him. I don’t know how I reached that point after just two years with him. I felt ashamed, especially when I did not want the kisses, the touches, the fantasies. And yet often I longed for him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I forgot my dreams and began to accept the life awaiting me, because perhaps it was less violent.Because of disputes between his family and mine, we separated after three and a half years. I did not fight it; I was in survival mode.The shock was that I felt relief. What I had mistaken for love vanished in seconds. I admit I missed him for a year, but then came only guilt for giving him parts of my body.Why had I not resisted? The question haunted me.A child should not feel shame. But shame kept me silentMy memories became a flood of intimate moments, each filled with shame. I had been raised to believe that a woman’s body was tainted if touched by a man who was not her husband.For years this distorted my view of men and relationships. Love became tied exclusively to sex. Even when I liked someone, I never told them about this relationship, afraid they would see me as “defiled” or demand explanations for feelings I could not name.I began to feel disgusted by my body, by myself. I entered a spiral of guilt.But was I truly guilty? Why did I blame a 14-year-old child instead of the 30-year-old man? Why did I not blame the family that left a girl alone with a man full of desire?I blamed myself even for saying “I love you” to him, a phrase that had been false and delusional.View image in fullscreenA protester outside parliament in Baghdad last year during a debate on making child marriage easier under Iraqi law. The placard says ‘No to the marriage contract’.Photograph: AFP/GettyBut was it really love? Or was it non-consensual all along?I felt too ashamed to tell this story to anyone even after I became, to some extent, an independent woman after many family struggles. What helped me most was financial independence, which opened different doors to freedom.A friend always told me: “A child should not feel shame.” But shame kept me silent, even with three different therapists. As my knowledge of rights and freedoms grew, so did my guilt. Why had I not fought for my freedom?But this all changed after I spoke to a therapist. She did not blame or judge me. When I tried to hold back my tears, she allowed me to cry.Countless other children will be robbed of choice and pushed into unequal relationshipsI went through a long process of guilt and shame, of learning to accept that I had not been at fault, that I had been a victim. Now, I am a survivor.What I went through was not love. It was a form of early forced marriage that dragged me into emotional and psychological confusion I was not ready for. I was a child. Every swing between hate and desire, fear and survival, was only the echo of childhood trauma.I clung to the man imposed on me, not because I truly loved him, but because he seemed, in the harshest moments, more merciful than my own family, who beat me and threatened me with death.I learned to see him as a protector, when in truth he was part of the circle of control over me. Psychology calls this “trauma bonding”. My first kiss was not love, but the theft of choice. My first touch was not desire, but the result of emotional blackmail that placed blame on me each time I refused.‘No escape’ for Afghan girls forced out of education and into early marriageRead moreOver the years my body swung between pleasure and shame, as if I were responsible for his lust, as if my fault was not screaming louder or running farther.But now I know the fault was not mine. It was not the fault of a 14-year-old who did not know how to protect herself. It was the fault of an adult man who exploited my vulnerability, of a family, a society, and a law that abandoned me.Every day I remind myself that what I lived through was not love, but violence that stripped me of childhood and choice. The lingering confusion between “I love you” and “I hate you” is nothing but the scar of a deep wound from a time when I was forced to carry what no child’s heart or body should bear.Today I feel the need to tell this story. My experience was not an isolated incident, but an early glimpse of whatIraq’s new law legalising marriage from the age of ninemay mean. It opens the door for my story to repeat itself with countless other girls – children who will be robbed of choice and pushed into unequal relationships under the cover of law.Passing such a law means nothing butlegitimising violence and entrenching control over the bodies of women and girls, turning childhood into a marriage contract instead of a time for safety and growth.* Her name has been changed to protect her identityThe story was read by Hala Abdullah, fromJummar MediaExplore more on these topicsForced marriageRights and freedomIraqMiddle East and north AfricaChildrenWomen's rights and gender equalityMarriageFamilycommentShareReuse this content"

Despite the chaos, they are willing Your Party to get off the groundThu 25 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 11.13 EDTShareDoes Britain need another leftwing party? If you’re not on the left – or if you are, but consider yourself a realist – then the answer may seem obvious. This is a conservative country, you probably believe, in its underlying political assumptions, electoral system and media biases. Any party that doesn’t fit these is put under intolerable pressure. It always splinters, shrinks and collapses, sooner or later.If even the Labour party, in which radical leftwingers are only ever a minority, is still fundamentally unacceptable to many voters and powerful interests – as the right’s constant outrage at Keir Starmer’s occasionally egalitarian government demonstrates – then what chance does a less established, more disruptive party than Labour have? Over the past half century in particular, ever since Margaret Thatchersuccessfully undermined socialism’s legitimacyas a mainstream belief system, the space for leftwing politics has sharply contracted in this country. Britain has become one of the world’s least left-tolerant democracies.A string of socialist parties have been formed, from Respect to Left Unity to the Socialist Labour party, their expectations sometimes sky high, but then rapidly scaled down. Factionalism, personality clashes and ideological differences – often worsened by the claustrophobia of doing politics in siege conditions – have further doomed these parties to frustrated termination, or the humiliation of lingering on, but on a tiny scale. To many people across the political spectrum, the British radical left is best known as the butt ofjokes about self-sabotage, delusions and impotence. Tellingly, fewer such jokes are made about the radical right. FromRobert Jenrickto Reform UK, the realisation of its dreams seems less amusingly far away.Over the past two turbulent months, Zarah Sultana and Jeremy Corbyn’snew partyhas sometimes seemed to be following these depressingly familiar patterns. Despite the decades of experience of those involved in previous leftwing projects, wearily familiar mistakes have been made:public rows, a lack of robust party structures, protracted internal stalemates and sudden, counterproductive outbursts by leading figures. One strategist who has been helping build the party for more than a year says they now feel “misery and rage”, and have stepped away.Yet, to feel nothing but despair (or delight) at the problems of Your Party is to look at British politics in an orthodox and narrow way. The less common but necessary question to ask about the struggles of such projects is whether they are stunting not just the left but our politics more generally – at a time when it desperatelyneeds to change.Britain, it is widely thought, is in a period of social and economic crisis as bad as those of the 1930s and 1970s. But, unlike then, much of the public is politically disengaged. Election turnouts are lower, politicians are seen as more similar to each other, and political cynicism and avoidance reign. Even to talk about politics in a public place, such as a pub, can lead to strangers grumpily asking you to talk about something else. As the perceptive political and cultural theoristMark Fisherused to say, Britain has a depressed economy but boom-time politics: complacently repetitive, ideologically limited – a holdover from the relatively comfortable and depoliticised early 21st century.The three most popular parties – Reform,Labourand the Tories – are ever tougher on crime and immigrants, and deferential to big business. All three prioritise the same socially conservative voters. All three believe that economic growth can be driven by deregulation and the City of London, as though the 2008 financial crisis never happened.The lack of an effective leftwing party since then – with the brief exception of the best days ofCorbyn’s Labour leadershipin 2017 and 2018 – is one of the main reasons our politics is so stuck and angry. Without a party that seriously addresses this country’s socially corrosive inequality, the exploitative and dysfunctional character of the privatised utilities and wider British capitalism, and the racist myths that dominate the debate about immigration and multiculturalism, mainstream politics will continue to move rightwards without solving, and often inflaming, the problems it claims to be addressing.The Lib Dems present their anti-authoritarian, centrist politics as a way out of this cycle. But a party that also says farmland should be “exempt from inheritance tax”, despite the wealth of many landowners and the funding crisis in public services, clearly has limits as a challenger to the status quo.The Greens, under their new leftwing leader,Zack Polanski, look better suited to that role. He attacks elites and defends the vulnerable with more aggression than his party has previously, and it is attracting activists and thinkers who used to be aligned with Corbynism, such as James Meadway and Michael Chessum. Helped by Your Party’s turmoil, Green membership hasgrown to almost 80,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s what they could learn from Farage and Polanski | Zoe WilliamsRead moreAnd yet,10 timesthat many signed up on the Your Party website this summer. Many leftists are still making up their minds about which party, if any, might satisfy their hopes. As the former Your Party strategist tells me, “Conditions are even more favourable for a new party now than last autumn” when serious work on the project began. “Labour is even lower in the polls.”In recent days, Sultana and Corbyn have madeconciliatory public statements. Your Party remains in a contradictory state: tense, ready to explode into conflict again, yet also a half-formed party of rare potential. Corbynsaid on Tuesday, “I’m getting … massive numbers of messages saying: ‘When’s the [founding] conference? Get on with it, I want to go out campaigning and I want candidates and I want to see you in the local elections [next May].’”With few energising political movements around, it’s possible that the conference, now scheduled for 29 and 30 November, or public rallies featuring Corbyn and Sultana – both speakers with big followings – could make the in-fighting of the past two months fade away. With the electorate restless and fragmented, Your Party could win local and parliamentary contests, and establish itself as a leftwing party with leverage, as sometimes exists in continental Europe: a participant in coalition governments, or at least a party that forces centrist rivals to the left.Yet some Your Party activists fear its credibility has been too damaged and its promise of a bottom-up, non-factional politics too diluted for the project to succeed as originally hoped. “A shadow of what it could have been”, as one organiser puts it. If he’s right, many in mainstream politics will celebrate.But he hasn’t stopped working for the party quite yet.

Now, ordinary people are taking humanitarian matters into their own hands – and putting their lives on the lineThu 25 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 06.01 EDTShareRight now – as presidential planes touch down in New York City for the UN general assembly – a fleet of civilian vessels is sailing to Gaza: the largest convoy in history to traverse the Mediterranean Sea with a mission to establish a humanitarian corridor to reach the starving people of Palestine.I am a member of that mission. Since the first batch of boats departed from Barcelona, I have been assigned to Family, the lead vessel of the fleet: a humble motor-cruiser carrying doctors and lawyers, journalists and parliamentarians, students and sea rescue workers from 10 countries across the world.All together, this “Global Sumud Flotilla” carries hundreds of participants from more than 40 national delegations, united by their shared conviction that something must be done to halt the destruction of Gaza – and that if governments refuse to do it, then ordinary people will.With or without a ceasefire, humanitarian aid must enter Gaza. We managed it in previous wars | Moazzam MalikRead moreLast week, legal experts from an independent UN commission declared thatIsraelhas committed genocide in the Gaza Strip. “It is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the criteria set forth in the Genocide Convention,” they concluded.For the participants of this flotilla – as for so many millions of people across the world – the UN declaration comes as no surprise. In the two years since the attacks of 7 October, we have scrolled through countless images of senseless slaughter and felt powerless to stop it.That power, according to international law, resides in the states that represent us. Last year, the UN general assembly overwhelmingly adopted Resolution ES‑10/24, which established the obligations of all member-states to takeimmediate action to defend the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people.Yet one year later – days after the deadline established by that Resolution – those same member-states continue to arm, aid, and abet the state of Israel in its expanding campaign of destruction, eviction, and annexation of the occupiedPalestinian territories.That is why so many millions of ordinary people are taking to the streets, from New York to London and beyond: to exhort their representatives to listen to the conscience of their constituents and respond to Gaza’s humanitarian crisis with the urgency it requires.That movement is growing. This week, ports, trains and highways across Italy were shut down with a single message of solidarity:Blocchiamo Tutto,we will block everything until the government ofGiorgia Melonibreaks commercial, military and diplomatic ties with the state of Israel.The sustained inaction of the international community has also forced us to take action at sea. We are not the first ones to do so. Since 2008, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition has deployed scores of civilian vessels carrying tons of humanitarian aid to Gaza.In some cases – such as the Mavi Marmara –Israel has respondedwith lethal force, raiding the boat and killing nine activists on board; a 10th died from injuries in the hours that followed. In others – such as the more recent Madleen –Israel hasridiculed the effortas a mere “selfie cruise” to indulge the celebrity of its participants.Our present voyage, however, is unprecedented – a fleet of 40 boats, larger than the sum of all previous missions. Such a large-scale humanitarian effort has forced the state of Israel to choose between these two incompatible narratives: are we simply pleasure cruising across the Mediterranean? Or do we represent an imminent threat to their national security?In recent days, the decision by the government ofBenjamin Netanyahuhas been made clear. Our convoy is now described as the “Hamas Flotilla”, with the state of Israel insinuating that the flotilla maintains links to “organized terror” and threatening to “stop” our flotilla by any means necessary – a clear and flagrant violation of international humanitarian law.Attacks on aid workers are outrageous. This violence needs more attention and it has to stop | Andrew Colvin and Jagan ChapagainRead moreI can see the fear on the faces of my fellow boatmates. Each day, we conduct drills to practice non-violent protocols in case of our interception. And each night, we take shifts monitoring the skies for drones that fly overhead with increasing frequency as our journey progresses.These protocols are not mere performance. Back in the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said, drones targeted our vessels in two successive midnight attacks, deploying explosive devices onto the decks of the Familyand the Almarespectively. In the investigation that followed, Tunisian authorities described the attacks as “premeditated aggression” against the flotilla.But the defamatory narrative of a “Hamas Flotilla” – motivated by antisemitism, rather than humanism; directed by “terrorists”, rather than ordinary citizens – also risks running into the absurd.Here on the Family,I am joined by Ada Colau, former mayor of Barcelona and mother of two young children. I am joined by Bianca Webb-Pullman, a practicing family medic who traveled all the way from Australia. And I am joined by Adèle Haenel, a French actor who enjoys beating me in chess whenever we have a free moment on board.My personal identity presents a particular problem for this narrative. Coming from a Jewish family in the United States, I joined the humanitarian mission for the same reason that so many Jews in the US are speaking out about the assault on Gaza: to reclaim my identity – my heritage, our traditions, its symbols – from the nation-state that seeks to monopolize them.Governments across the world are beginning to speak out about the threats issued against our flotilla. Last week, 16 states – including Spain and Slovenia, Brazil and Mexico – issued a joint statement warning: “Any violation of international law and human rights of the participants in the Flotilla, including attacks against the vessels in international waters or illegal detention, will lead to accountability.”From the flotilla, we have welcomed this important recognition of our humanitarian intentions and rights under international law – while wondering why so many governments with citizens on board, such as France and the United States, refused to sign it.Starmer finally said it: ‘We recognise Palestine.’ But Gaza desperately needs action – where is that? | Nesrine MalikRead moreYet the statement confuses means for ends. This flotilla is but a means to establish a nautical humanitarian corridor, where the state of Israel has blocked aid entry points on land. Any state that is serious about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza should not simply offer protection to our civilian fleet, but join us, deploying vessels at the scale that corresponds to the severity of Gaza’s present suffering.Donald Trumphas made a mockery of international law with the establishment of the so-called “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation”, which – far from delivering on its stated mission – has deployed cruel, inhumane and often lethal methods for the distribution of paltry aid.But it should not fall on the shoulders of ordinary people to rescue international law from ruin. Only states – gathered together now at theUnited Nations– can apply the necessary measures to halt the destruction of Gaza and protect the lives and livelihoods of its people.For now, we are preparing to complete our mission in the coming days. At the time of writing, it is not too late for states to step up and join our mission, sailing alongside us through the Mediterranean Sea. But even in their absence, we will sail on, undeterred the threats issued against us. Gaza cannot wait.David Adler is co-general coordinator of Progressive InternationalExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelUnited NationscommentShareReuse this content"

It forms part of Moscow’s broader pattern of probing and provocationThu 25 Sep 2025 13.43 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe sheer volume of headlines tells its own tale. Russian dronesover PolandandRomania. Russian fighter jetsin Estonian airspace. Russian aircraftbuzzing a German naval frigatein the Baltic Sea. Unidentified drones overCopenhagenand Oslo airports. Most recently, in the early hours of Thursday, further drones appearingat other Danish airports.In just over a fortnight, European states havereported a striking spate of incursionsinto their airspace. Russia has repeatedlydenied responsibilityand questions remain over individual events: so far, Denmark hassaid only that a “professional actor”was at work in the airport incidents and that it can’t rule out Russia. But overall, there is a pattern which fits clearly into Moscow’s longer record of provocations and often implausible deniability – and which amounts to a notable escalation.Such operations maydistract from Russia’s slow progresson the battlefield in Ukraine. More obviously, they look like a test of both military responses and political will. On the first count, there is work to be done, judging from the reaction to the 19 drones in Polish airspace. On the second, Russia is testing whether Europe will hold its nerve in supporting Ukraine – and perhaps others in future – when faced with nuisance or worse. Drones come cheap, yet forced Denmark to suspend flights from its largest airport for four hours, and Poland tospend millionsscrambling jets.Most obviously, these incursions are also testing US intentions. Donald Trump suggested this week that Ukrainecould win back its lost territoryand that Nato countriesshould shoot down Russian aircraft entering their airspace. Yet that looks less like a reorientation of US policy than,in the words of one Nato official, “his hot take of the hour”. It is surely no coincidence that these events followed the red-carpet welcome that Mr Trump awarded Vladimir Putin in Alaska. An emboldened Russia is confident that the USintends to further disengage from European security, rather than to bolster support.Nato members met this week at Estonia’s request, but there are marked differences between their positions as well asshared alarm. Though shooting down a Russian plane would not be unprecedented – Turkeydid it in 2015– there is a division between those who believe it would deter Moscow and those who fear it would escalate the dangers.These incursions should not treated as a narrowly military affair, but seen within Russia’s multi-domain strategy. The broader picture of security risks covers civilian infrastructure, too, and may involve non-state agents either enlisted or enabled by Moscow. Incidents may be less attention-grabbing yet potentially more significant.The past year has seen repeateddamage to undersea communications cablesin the Baltic Sea, with suspicion of Moscow’s involvement. Norway’s spy chief said recently that Russian hackers hadtaken control of a damthis spring, releasing water for four hours before their interference was noticed. Ken McCallum, head of MI5, warned last October that Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, was “on a sustained mission to generate mayhem on British and European streets: we’ve seen arson, sabotage and more”. He stressed that businesses, as well as the state, must address their vulnerabilities. The difficulties of establishing a unified response to the last fortnight’s events are a reminder that a comprehensive and coherent response to these broader issues will be essential, and even more challenging.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This needs to continueThu 25 Sep 2025 13.43 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 21.30 EDTShareThe idea that the next head of state might be an elected one is as remote from British experience as a visit to the far side of the moon. But it is hardly an unthinkable proposition, and you do not have to travel as far as the moon to see such a process taking place in a smooth and dignified manner. In fact, you only have to travel toIreland.Next month, Ireland will elect a successor to President Michael D Higgins, who has served two seven-year terms as the occupant ofÁras an Uachtaráin(in bygone days the Viceregal Lodge) in Dublin’s Phoenix Park. Mr Higgins has done the largely ceremonial job with charm, toughness and imagination. He has been good for Ireland, and good for British-Irish relations at a difficult time. In 2014, he made thefirst state visitto Britain by an Irish president. He is not a large man, but he leaves big shoes to fill.When the presidential nomination process opened this month there was much talk of celebrity candidates, including Michael Flatley,Bob Geldof, Pádraig Harrington, Conor McGregor and the TV meteorologist Joanna Donnelly. But the rules, which require nominations from Dáil members or local authorities, give such candidates little chance of collecting enough support. Predictably, when nominations closed this week, it turned out that the final choice will be between three political nominees, as it has often been in the past. The danger is that the field is too narrow to facilitate the kind of future-focused conversation that any country, including Ireland, needs at such a time.Ireland’s next president will therefore be the winner ofa contest on 24 Octoberbetween Jim Gavin, backed by the country’s largest party, Fianna Fáil, Heather Humphreys from its government coalition partner, Fine Gael, and the independent Dáil member Catherine Connolly, who is backed by Sinn Féin and by a group of smaller parties, including Labour and the Social Democrats. Early polling has put Ms Humphreys very narrowly in front, but there is almost a month still to go, and the campaign has barely started.In the 20th century, when Fianna Fáil still dominated Irish politics, its candidate normally won. That ended in 1990, when Labour’sMary Robinsonbecame Ireland’s first female president, as well as the first not from Fianna Fáil. Ms Robinson modernised the role in her seven years as head of state, helping project a changed image of Ireland on the world stage. Her successor, Mary McAleese, the first president to have been born in Northern Ireland, carried this further for two terms, which included the Belfast/Good Friday agreement and the visit to Ireland bythe late Queen. Mr Higgins has trod the same path that his two female predecessors cleared.Ireland has much to thank them all for. They have all made major soft-power contributions to good relations between Britain and Ireland, too, particularly in the volatile times around the peace process and afterBrexit. Yet those tensions are not yet over.A radical shake-up in British politics, especially if it makes the Belfast agreement more difficult to operate because of any UK withdrawal from the European human rights convention, would revive them. Moves towards aunification referendum, though currently distant, would pose a large challenge of a different kind. Ireland’s new president will have to help guide the country into the 2030s. The path through those years is not looking easy. The outcome of this contest will matter.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We support the position of leading autism organisations – Ambitious about Autism, Autism Alliance, Autistica and the National Autistic Society –which have rightly highlightedthat the evidence for such a link is extremely weak, based on poorly conducted studies, and contradicted by high-quality research.But beyond the question of evidence, we are deeply concerned by the language used. When powerful figures describe autism as a tragedy or something to fear, it reinforces damaging stereotypes. It risks making autistic people feel that their existence is a problem, rather than recognising them as valued members of our communities who bring talent, perspective and diversity.As a charity that supports disabled people with complex needs, including many autistic people, Sense believes it is vital that leaders, organisations and the media speak responsibly. Words matter. They shape attitudes, influence policy and can either open doors to inclusion or build barriers of stigma and exclusion.Autistic people and their families deserve respect and acceptance – not blame or shame. We call on those in positions of influence to choose their words carefully.James Watson-O’NeillChief executive, SenseAutismis not “a condition denoting communication and social difficulties, along with repetitive behaviours”, as your article says – it is a condition that covers an incredibly wide spectrum, which includes feeling things and reacting differently to them compared with non-autistic people.Autistic peoplemayfind socialising tiring, theymaybecome overwhelmed in loud or busy places, theymayhave intense interests, theymayprefer order and routine. And they may not.I have an autistic child and she is sociable, bright, academically able and empathetic – she doesn’t have communication or social difficulties and no sign of repetitive behaviours.Pigeonholing autistic people is deeply damaging, reducing complex human beings with unique talents and diverse perspectives to narrow stereotypes that distort how they are perceived and understood.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This is what happened when I tried to enter Israel, 20 September). But were those principles “inclusive, pluralistic, open and democratic” for the Palestinians? The Lebanese author Elias Khoury’s novel Gate of the Sunweaves a web of the stories of Palestinian peasants from northern Israel driven from their houses, villages and land in 1948 and prevented from returning. For however inclusive and open the Zionist project which became Israel may have been, it gave the Palestinians no place. Seventy-seven years on, we are still living with that fact, and until it is recognised and addressed peace will not come.Dr Hilary KilpatrickLausanne, SwitzerlandI read Peter Prinsley’s account of being denied entry to Israel on his recent visit, and his description of the apartheid state’s descent into a form of crass, unthinking authoritarianism reminded me of something much closer to home. Prinsley doesn’t make the link, but I was put firmly in mind of the Starmer government’s proscription ofPalestine Action.

It might be the time for someone to remind him that the “hell” is the result of wars in the Middle East, a war in Afghanistan and conflicts in north and east Africa. Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, Eritrea and Afghanistan are some of the countries where the US initiated, funded or clandestinely participated in fomenting mayhem and disaster. And may still be doing so.How different this action might have been if those countries had overland routes to the US. Instead, it wreaked havoc because it was sitting comfortably 5,000 watery miles away, far from death and destruction. No overland route and no narrow waters for small boats.Now its president points his finger atEuropeand shakes his head in disbelief at the almost unsolvable conundrum we face, which was almost single-handedly created by the US. He and his predecessors are the architects of these disasters. Only someone cerebrally challenged would fail to recognise that and take steps to put it right.Michael NewmanShefford, BedfordshireIn his address to the United Nations general assembly, Donald Trumpportrayedclimate agreements as a “globalist concept” that forces successful nations to “inflict pain on themselves.” This framing is deeply misleading. The real “pain” comes fromfailingto act: fires, floods, food shortages and widespreadeconomic disruptionare not abstract risks, but lived realities that willworsenwithout emissions reductions.International agreements, far from being acts of self-punishment, are acts of solidarity and recognition of common responsibility. Industrialised nations, which built their prosperity on fossil fuels, have both the capacity and the obligation to lead the transition. Far from a burden, this shift is an opportunity – clean energy industries already create millions of jobs while preserving habitability for future generations.Rejecting cooperation because it is “globalist” ignores the reality that the atmosphere has no borders.

Guardian readers deserve better than Phillip Inman’s tedious and hateful boomer-bashing (Boomers think their wealth came from wise choices – this myth needs busting, 20 September). This summer we’ve had his tax plans (tax boomers more), his suggestions for dealing with the housing crisis (kick boomers out of their homes), his idea forboomer “national service”built around volunteering, and now his attacks on older people’s occupational pensions. Goodness, Phillip, you really can’t let this obsession with boomers go, can you?Economic inequalities – and with them social and health inequalities – are getting worse, and while Inman tells us with monotonous regularity that “it’s the boomers wot dun it”, it is in fact a little more complicated. Generation is a far less important factor than gender, race, disability and, above all, class, and if we don’t start looking at intra-generational inequalities we are going nowhere – not least because wealthy parents raise wealthy children, and support them financially to a value about26 times more than poorer parentsin the same generation, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Millennials are already tipped to become thewealthiest generation in history, far outstripping the baby boomers, but, crucially, it won’t be all of them, and that is why looking at economic inequality through the single lens of generation is not “myth-busting”, it is myth-making.Now that the summer silly season is over, please could we have some proper economic analysis from someone who takes inequalities seriously.Rosa AndersonLondonPhillip Inman’s article trades in ageist stereotyping rather than serious analysis. No evidence is offered to show that boomers as a group actually believe their wealth stems from uniquely “wise choices”. Attitudes to prosperity and inequality vary far more by politics and education than by year of birth, yet the article paints an entire generation with a single brush.It is true that many in the postwar cohort benefited from advantages unavailable today: affordable housing, secure pensions and generous tax reliefs. But if intergenerational fairness is to be addressed seriously, it should be debated in terms of policy, not reduced to caricatures of older people as smug and self-deluded.Peter MatherOrpington, LondonIn yet another attack on people of my generation, Phillip Inman professes to know what baby boomers think. I would like to know where he gets his evidence for this. He attacks us as selfish, conservative voters who are destroying the hopes and ambitions of the following generations. Not the boomers I know, nor those who wrote the many letters published after his last attack on us. The vast majority of us have children ourselves and are fully aware of the reality of what they face and help them where we can. Can we have him attacking the real enemies – property developers, buy-to-let, and, most of all, the neoliberalism of the last 45 years?Moira SykesManchesterExplore more on these topicsOlder peopleEconomic policyEconomicsPensionsPropertyInequalitylettersShareReuse this content"

Instead, this was simply such a much-needed antidote to the micromanagement that now dulls the buildup to a biennial joust between a continent and a country. Golfers who ordinarily have plenty to say and who revel in the rarity of team combat find themselves delivering anodyne soundbites. Bradley’s blunder was such an endearing reminder of days gone by, when the Ryder Cup was more open to rogue elements. The whiff of cordite was never far away.The Ryder Cup needs a little more fizz. That may well be provided by a volatile New York crowd, the arrival of a US president who polarises opinion and stars such asRory McIlroy or Bryson DeChambeauwho should not be backwards in coming forwards when the proper stuff starts. The shadow boxing is now over. What is so striking and impressive is that golfers who bump into each other on Floridian school runs somehow manage to summon the spirit of a great rivalry for one week out of every 104.DeChambeau calls on Trump to inspire US team to Ryder Cup glory at BethpageRead moreMore pertinent, the Ryder Cup requires even the occasional away win. This is the weekend for Europe to seize that opportunity, with Luke Donald’s class of 2025 the best-placed team since 2012 to hand the US a bloody nose in their own backyard. ThatEuropean win in Medinahwas dubbed a miracle. In 2016 and 2021, just as in 2008, Europe were trounced. Home wins in 2014, at Gleneagles, 2018, in Paris and 2023,in Rome, were similarly comprehensive. The Ryder Cup has grown – perhaps too much – as an event and corporate attraction. For it to remain competitively valid, home teams cannot prevail time and again.View image in fullscreenKeegan Bradley’s opening ceremony blooper was an endearing reminder of days gone by.Photograph: Vaughn Ridley/Sportsfile/Getty Images“It has been pretty one-sided either way,” said McIlroy. “So whatever team, whether that’s Europe or America that is the one to break that duck, I think honestly is going to go down as one of the best teams in Ryder Cup history.“Luke said it in his opening [ceremony] remarks but we are playing for history and we’re playing for the players that came before us and the people that basically laid the foundations for what the European Ryder Cup team is.“We are also playing for the guys that are going to come behind us, as well, the young boys that are dreaming of becoming European Ryder Cup players. We want to try to leave a legacy for them as well. We have a wonderful opportunity this week but we also understand it’s going to be very difficult.”McIlroy’s status has only been enhancedby his triumph at Augusta Nationalin April. Donald is calling upon only the sixth man in history to complete a career grand slam. The European team supposedly exist without hierarchy but McIlroy’s approach here, with arms round teammates throughout the Ryder Cup lead-in, is of a true leader. Europe are so lucky to have him. “He’s gone from obviously being an incredibly good player to a great Ryder Cup player to now being, I would say, the cornerstone that Europe needs,” said Jon Rahm of McIlroy. “It’s special to have him around. He’s a heck of a superstar. My respect for his game only grows the more time I spend with him.”The consistency Donald sought from the team that prevailed in Rome has been delivered. There was a scouting trip to Bethpage last week. The level of detail and preparation attached to this European side gives cause to ponder when they might ever win on the road if Sunday does not deliver the legacy McIlroy dreams of.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Questions hover, though, above other members of the US team. Four are rookies, which in theory is less of an issue at home but could be significant if the backdrop is febrile. DeChambeau could be terrific or terrible, Xander Schauffele has been out of sorts all year and Collin Morikawa wobbles more than a 3am drunk. The unlikely star of this US teamcould well be JJ Spaun. Bradley’s contingent have been irked by questioning about the move to pay them to perform here, which is a live and legitimate issue despite protestations to the contrary.Bethpage, once regarded as an X-rated venue, has been tamed by heavy rain. Soft greens combined with a lack of truly punishing rough offers scope for excitement. There are half a dozen par fours where players will require only a wedge for approach shots if tackling them boldly.

A familiar combination of self-destruction and the poor defending endemic under Russell Martin deepened Ibrox’s gloom. Reduced to 10 after Mohamed Diomande’s reckless first-half challenge, insult was added by Genk’s goal being scored by a former Celtic striker in Oh Hyeon-gyu.Martin has talked of “results coming through difficulty” but could not have chosen to manage a club where poor results will cause more difficulty. Ibrox was undersold, just 38,000 present, though in attendance was Andrew Cavenagh, the chairman gladhanding fans before kick-off. The American co-owner’s scheduled visit to Glasgow has allowed him to experience what fans have been served during the new ownership’s choice of manager. “I’ll find out in about 15 minutes,” said Martin, asked if he had yet received Cavenagh’s verdict. “I look forward to seeing him.”Aston Villa 1-0 Bologna, Rangers 0-1 Genk, and more: Europa League – liveRead moreIf Martin is aware of his unpopularity, he remains unbowed. “The only thing that’ll impact that is winning matches. Inside the building they’ve been amazing, and we just need to focus on that.”TheEuropa Leaguehas returned European glory nights to Govan in recent years and has significant importance. If falling so far behind Celtic – and Hearts – damns Martin, Rangers’ return to the competition proved drab and underwhelming. Rangers have been scoreless in four from five matches, a poor combination with such lax defending. “If we don’t get an early goal, it’s difficult,” said defender John Souttar. “I understand the fans’ frustrations, we’re the exact same.”Against clear evidence, Martin continues to preach positivity. “I don’t think we’re far,” he said. “We’ll learn and grow from tonight with 10 men for so long.”View image in fullscreenMohamed Diomande of Rangers (left) is shown a red card shortly before half-time.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAGenk, no crack Belgian side like Brugge, Rangers’ Champions League qualifier tormentor, had seen out their win handily enough, Oh missing several chances, including a penalty.The busy Slovenian referee, Matej Jug, also ruled the Rangers captain James Tavernier had pushed Joris Kayembe before the latter handled the ball. Diomande’s red card was less debatable, studs wildly raking Zakaria El Ouahdi. A third red card of Martin’s short reign highlights discipline as another area of concern. Diomande’s exit brought Ibrox to a muttering hush, though boos filled the air when Jug returned to the video screen to rule Tavernier had clipped Yaimar Medina for Genk’s penalty.When Jack Butland saved Oh’s poor penalty just before half-time, home fans at last rocked the rafters. At the break Mikey Moore was withdrawn for another summer signing in Oliver Antman. Rangers began the second half with intention, Thelo Aasgaard slicing a half-chance wide but Butland still remained the busier keeper. He could only watch as an unmarked Oh diverted wide, inches out. Oh was not to be denied, slipping Jarne Steuckers’ pass beyond Butland, unprotected by an offside trap that more resembled an invitation to the Korean.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“We should do better with the ball and look after it better,” said Martin. “But it’s about habits.

But sources inside national federations said events appeared to be coming to a head and thatUefaand its president, Aleksander Ceferin, were increasingly expected to take action.There have been an increasing number of interventions away from the game. On Tuesday, a group of senior diplomats called on Uefa and Fifa to enact a ban after the publication of a report by the United Nations independent international commission of inquiry thatfound Israel was committing genocidein Gaza. Last week, the campaign group Game Over Israel took over a billboard in New York’s Times Square to call for federations to boycott any matches with the country.It is understood that voices within the game have also been speaking up in private, including those from the club world.Italy is one of the countries under pressure to act. TheAzzurri, along with Norway, are due to face Israel in the next round of qualifiers, with their match scheduled for 14 October in Udine. Italy is fresh from a24-hour general strikein protest against Israel’s behaviour in Gaza.Gabriele Gravina, the president of the Italian football federation, who sits on the Uefa exco, said this week that any boycott “would only favour Israel, who could in theory be boosted in their qualifying path to the tournament”. He also said he “denounced” the suffering in Gaza and that “there is nobody who could be indifferent to this feeling of suffering and pain”.Any decision to suspend the Israel Football Association would be taken in a simple majority vote by the 19 members of Uefa’s exco. Insiders suggest if it were proposed, the vote would have a strong chance of passing with as few as three or four abstentions or votes against. It could, however, have considerable political consequences.The United States government, for example, has warned it would stand against any such decision, with the country co-hosting theWorld Cupnext summer. “We will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel’s national soccer team from the World Cup,” a spokesperson for the US Department of State told Sky News.Any suspension would mean Uefa removing a participant from a Fifa-organised competition. Fifa, under its president, Gianni Infantino, has developed astrong relationship with the Trump administration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though the reporting has been of a crisis, had they even a mediocre goalkeeper, they would have lost toneither Arsenalnor Grimsby, and it’s also fair to note that, with three of their first five games coming against Mikel Arteta’s side, Manchester City and Chelsea, they were dealt a difficult start. But Ruben Amorim must now start accumulating victories, with a nasty away trip a decent test. Since Brentford were promoted to the Premier League, United have lost two of four games at the Gtech, were outplayed in the one draw and, even in the game they won, were physically dominated for 45 minutes. However, their summer acquisitions have turned a team of uncommon weakness and slowness into one able to compete in duels, win headers and threaten in behind. That should mean United’s class tells in contests such as this – except no side is better at finding ways to lose matches they should win.Daniel HarrisBrentford vManchester United, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)View image in fullscreenBryan Mbeumo will be in the running for a start against his old club.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images2Guéhi out to stop Reds after blocked moveThe only unbeaten teams left this season meet at Selhurst Park. While Liverpool have a 100% record, Crystal Palace’s form has been notable for their sturdy defence. Oliver Glasner’s side have conceded just two goals in five games, with clean sheets against Chelsea, Aston Villa and Sunderland. Key to this setup is their captain, Marc Guéhi, who came very close to signing for Liverpool on transfer deadline day. The England centre-back wasunderstood to be extremely unhappyafter Palace blocked the move despite a £35m fee being agreed. Guéhi will now attempt to thwart the team he thought he was joining and who have scored in each of their last 39 league matches – a club record.Billy MundayCrystal Palace v Liverpool, Saturday 3pm3Injuries and form give George an openingTyrique George scored one of Chelsea’s most important goals last season, reigniting their push for Champions League qualification by bagging the equaliser in theircrucial late win at Fulhamin April. Yet while Enzo Maresca has often talked up the teenage attacker, George looked set to leave Stamford Bridge in the summer. A move to Fulham was on the cards on deadline day, only for it to collapse at the last minute and give the 19-year-old a second chance of making it at Chelsea. Competition, of course, is fierce. But with Cole Palmer struggling with a groin injury, Liam Delap out for months and Alejandro Garnacho and Jamie Gittens adjusting to Maresca’s demands, there could be an opportunity for George from the start when Chelsea host Brighton. It would be a deserved reward for hisexcellent goal at Lincolnin the Carabao Cup on Tuesday.Jacob SteinbergChelsea v Brighton, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenTyrique George was on the mark at Lincoln in midweek.Photograph: Darren Walsh/CFC/Getty Images4Could Darlow oust Perri as Leeds No 1?After sacking Jesse Marsch in February 2023 Leeds were desperate to recruit Andoni Iraola but the coach, then at Rayo Vallecano, proved resistant and ended up joining Bournemouth instead. Elland Road regulars now have a chance to witness the tactical choreography they missed out on as Iraola’s high flyers head to West Yorkshire but Daniel Farke will hope to prove that he was not such a shabby choice. Afterlast week’s win at Wolvesthe Leeds manager’s confidence is high but, with his first-choice goalkeeper, Lucas Perri, still injured, he could do with another strong performance from Karl Darlow. The former Newcastle keeper has played so well in the past two games, against Wolves and Fulham, that Farke may yet have a decision to make once his summer signing from Lyon is fit again. If Darlow’s long kicking seems superior to Perri’s, his shot-stopping and judgment of crosses have also been excellent. Meanwhile Illan Meslier, for so long the first pick, is transfer-listed and third in Farke’s goalkeeping pecking order.Louise TaylorLeedsvBournemouth, Saturday 3pm5City have chance to build momentumBefore Liverpool’s visit on 9 November Manchester City’s league fixtures are Burnley (home), Brentford (away), Everton (home), Aston Villa (away) and Bournemouth (home): a chance against modest opposition to accrue points and momentum. City have won 17 out of Pep Guardiola’s 18 previous meetings with Saturday’s opponents, Burnley, and Scott Parker will send his men out with trepidation. Phil Foden is flying with both goals and assists, which means City are heavy favourites to tally their third league win of the season, particularly as they have scored 12 goals to Burnley’s one in their last three meetings.Jamie JacksonManchester City vBurnley, Saturday 3pm6Rigg can refresh Sunderland’s threatSunderland have made a terrific start to life back in thePremier League, thanks largely to the excellent work of their recruitment team and a whole lot of money. But though they sit seventh in the table, they are struggling to score – a problem that needs resolving if they are to stay up. Régis Le Bris has opted for a midfield three of Granit Xhaka, Noah Sadiki and Habib Diarra, but with the last of these sidelined until December, Chris Rigg – a teenage star of Sunderland’s promotion campaign and a local boy to boot, but mainly on the bench for the first four league games – has a chance to establish himself in the top division. Last time out, against Villa, Rigg was sacrificed after Reinildo’s red card, but he can expect to start again at the City Ground, where his subtlety could be crucial against a defence still adjusting to the demands of a new manager.DHskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Simons has often been pinpointed as someone to play left-wing, rather than roam into the centre. The word from Dutch football is the former PSV player is no winger and unlikely to be as effective when forced to man the flanks. His finishing at the Amex was not the best, though one shot forced his compatriot Bart Verbruggen into a good save. He did, though, pin back Brighton and reduce their counterattackingthreat. James Maddison is likely to miss the entire campaign. Thomas Frank is optimistic Dejan Kulusevski can return “before the end of this year” but is “not putting a month on it”. That hands Simons a chance to claim a free role as his own. Rodrigo Bentancur was initially given that job at Brighton, tucking in as Destiny Udogie overlapped, but he is more comfortable playing deeper.John BrewinTottenham v Wolves, Saturday, 8pm8What does Monchi’s exit mean for Emery?A reshuffle behind the scenes is usually an ominous sign, but Unai Emery remains in a position of strength despiteMonchi’s exitas president of football operations. Villa have appointed Roberto Olabe as Monchi’s successor to oversee recruitment and no sweeping changes are anticipated. Olabe, a former Real Sociedad sporting director, like Emery, hails from the Basque Country, and Villa will hope this is the start of a fresh synergy. It was Olabe who appointed Emery as Almería manager almost two decades ago and, two years ago, he was thought to be Villa’s first choice to take on the role Monchi later assumed. Villa have heightened expectations and all parties expect the visit of Fulham to result in a much-needed first league victory of the season, afterThursday’s Europa League win. “Nothing has changed, only the man,” Emery said this week, though how Villa would welcome a different outcome on Sunday.Ben FisherAston Villa v Fulham, Sunday 2pm9Arsenal and Arteta must beware TonaliSandro Tonali will almost certainly return to Newcastle’s starting XI against Arsenal after being rested for Wednesday night’s 4-1Carabao Cup canter against Bradford. Ever since Eddie Howe relocated the Italy midfielder into a slightly deeper role almost a year ago Tonali has frequently proved Newcastle’s outstanding individual. Mikel Arteta regards Joelinton’s physicality and abrasion as a thorn in his team’s side but Tonali is arguably the midfielder most capable of damaging the visitors. The only concern on Tyneside is that, after this season, there will be two years remaining on his contract. It is understood that David Hopkinson, Newcastle’s chief executive, is keen to furnish Tonali with a new deal but that is pending until a new sporting director is appointed. While Ross Wilson remains the favourite to fill that vacancy, extracting him from Nottingham Forest will be far from straightforward. Arteta, meanwhile, will want to atone for painful past defeats by a Newcastle team who are now still adjusting to life without Alexander Isak.LTNewcastlevArsenal, Sunday 4.30pmView image in fullscreenSandro Tonali in Champions League goalscoring action against Barcelona.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images10Moyes could act as Potter’s executionerThe irony will not be lost on West Ham or David Moyes should Everton consign the Hammers to a sixth defeat in seven matches and signal the end of Graham Potter’s uninspiring managerial reign. Many at West Ham were desperate to see the back of the Scot despite him winning the club’sfirst trophy in 43 yearsbut they could soon be on to their third manager of 2025 with results nosediving under his successors. Potter, meanwhile, was considered a potential replacement for Sean Dyche by Everton’s owners, although never offered the job. Potter has failed to rectify his team’s inability to defend set pieces, with seven goals conceded from corners already this season. If there is any consolation for Potter, Everton have not scored from one this term. Having talked up the importance of the Carabao Cup to Everton after 30 years without a trophy, Moyes duly made seven unnecessary changes for the dismal exit at Wolves in midweek. West Ham managers past and present require a reaction at Hill Dickinson Stadium.Andy HunterEverton v West Ham, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool56152Arsenal58103Tottenham Hotspur57104AFC Bournemouth51105Crystal Palace5496Chelsea5587Sunderland5288Fulham5189Man City54710Everton51711Man Utd5-2712Leeds5-3713Newcastle50614Brighton5-2515Nottm Forest5-4516Burnley5-3417Brentford5-4418Aston Villa5-4319West Ham5-8320Wolverhampton5-90Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendEvertonWest Ham UnitedNewcastle UnitedArsenalAston VillaFulhamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In stark contrast, his Red Roses finalists “have managed it”, he says as the head coach looks forward to Saturday’s showpiece at a sold-out Twickenham. Mitchell was one of Eddie Jones’s assistants when they lost to South Africa in Japan after beating New Zealand in the semi-final.‘We are in a new age of women’s rugby’: Abbie Ward on motherhood and World Cup redemptionRead more“I still look back on 2019 and the semi-final was a huge performance and I think we sometimes as coaches don’t recognise the emotional tank plus the physical tank that is emptied in such occasions,” said Mitchell. “We possibly in 2019 didn’t deal with the emotional tank, refill it well enough.“The way we have prepared this week is we have made sure we [were off for] a couple of days after the semi-final performance [against France] to be able to come in and get focused on the plan we need to execute on the weekend. What has been really good about this tournament is to ­create the normal and easy because it is at home.“Once you get into the ­tournament it doesn’t allow for that, the ­normal and easy comes through ­opportunities and pockets of where you can get home. I think we have done that well, which has allowed the girls and staff to come back in to get after their next week.”England’s matchday 23 for the final is unchangedfrom the team that beat Francelast Saturday. Mitchell added that the most difficult part of ­coaching has come with managing players across a squad. “We have just been fortunate for the girls to buy into the three roles. It is the hardest ­challenge in any team, the non-playing members, to get them to understand how they can make the team stronger.View image in fullscreenEngland have selected an unchanged team following their semi-final win against France.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“We have done a lot of work in that area, I don’t think you get it right all the time, I am not saying we get it right. I really just don’t know what the solution is but we have been able to make it work for ourselves to this point.”England are on a 32-game winning run but the coach does not believe fans have seen the best of them yet. “There’s definitely more in this team,” Mitchell said. “We always ask more of ourselves. We probably don’t even know what that ceiling is, it’s probably wrong of us to set a limit. So these girls are driven, they want to get better.“The difference this time you’ve got one and two in the world in the final, which is so good for the game. And it’ll require an 80-­minute ­performance which we will have to earn.”The captain, Zoe Aldcroft, was involved in the last World Cup final,which England lost 34-31to New ­Zealand but this time the Red Roses are not “making it bigger than it already is”. She added: “Just as a group we are so excited to get out there. We have been working on this now for three years and it is our time now, we really feel like that.“We’re so excited to experience it. It’s something that we’ve never experienced but we’ve wanted for so long. I think just the momentum and the impact that we have had on fans throughout the tournament from the start in Sunderland to coming now into Twickenham, it’s just going to be so exciting to see where we have pushed women’s rugby to.

Sale’s victory overGloucesterto kick off the new season was workmanlike, enough to earn a bonus point but left you suspecting that our parents might have been right all along: do not play out on a school night.Tries from Tom Roebuck, Nathan Jibulu, Joe Carpenter and Hyron Andrews gave the Sharks a winning start to the campaign, founded on set-piece power, a route one approach and George Ford’s supreme game management. Not all Prem matches have to be try-fests – we may come to yearn for agricultural contests such as these later in the season – but this season opener will not win many beauty points. It was not the spectacle with which to launch a rebranded competition considering how willing both sides were to put boot to ball.Newcastle’s Red Bull rebrand brings fresh energy to rugby’s troubled outpostRead morePerhaps the organisers might have picked a more stylish fixture to kick things off in midweek. Thursday nights work in France, it ought to work for broadcasters – though TNT Sports is not minded to make it permanent – and it has been introduced as a necessary evil, a means to avoid a scheduling clash with Saturday’s women’s World Cup final.But a crowd of more than 6,000 did not represent too much of a drop-off for the Sharks and there is a willingness among clubs to try new things these days. “I love it, what’s not to love, we’ve got the whole weekend to drink Malbec!” Sale’s director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, said. “If you lose, it’s a long weekend. We’re going into town tomorrow to a sauna, we’ll go in there to get the review done. Then they’ve got the weekend to relax.Commercially, is it feasible, can we get enough people through the gates? It looked pretty busy tonight. The only issue is the turnaround time but whatever brings people through the gates to watch some decent rugby.”Casting your eye over the teamsheets, there was much to like about two sides with contrasting styles locking horns to open a new campaign. Gloucester looked a little light in the front five at first glance but did include Afo Fasogbon, going up against a fellow 21-year-old tighthead prop in Asher Opoku-Fordjour – a tussle no doubt keenly enjoyed by England head coach, Steve Borthwick.View image in fullscreenJack Clement crashes over to give Gloucester the lead at the end of the first half against Sale.Photograph: Steve Taylor/PPAUK/ShutterstockSale enjoyed the better of the scrum contest, but Fasogbon was making himself a nuisance at the breakdown, winning his side two penalties. The trouble was that Gloucester, with a desperately inaccurate lineout, could do little with the ball whenever he had won it back – and it was no surprise that Sale opened the scoring, Tom Roebuck pouncing on a loose ball in the righthand corner. Gloucester for their part felt aggrieved that Ben Curry’s potential knock-on in the buildup was ignored.A Ross Byrne penalty on debut put Gloucester on the board, however, before Jack Clement splashed over to pinch a half-time lead for the visitors. It all came from a scrum penalty, wildly celebrated by Fasogbon, who was replaced at half-time, paying the price for Sale’s set-piece superiority.More scrum dominance for the hosts yielded further promising territory after the break as well as a numerical advantage when Clement was sent to the sin-bin for collapsing a maul and Jibulu was eventually rewarded with a pushover try before Ford nudged the Sharks back ahead with the conversion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Such has been the pace of the Red Bull rebrand that oneNewcastleofficial joked there would be spot fines for anyone who forgets it is no longer the Falcons giving them flight.Energy drinks are in, feathered friends out, but the feelgood factornow coursing through the north-eastpromises more than just a dopamine hit. For the club, who only a few months ago were exploring a loan from their league rivals to stay afloat, and the revamped Prem, there is a feeling that the Red Bull revolution can be seminal.Prem Rugby in talks to stage league match at Chicago Cubs’ Wrigley FieldRead moreNewcastle finished bottom of the table for the past three seasons. In the 2023-24 campaign they lost all 18 matches. They have been operating on a shoestring budget and seen numerous promising homegrown youngsters seek greener pastures elsewhere. But Newcastle have now come full circle, harking back to the Sir John Hall era when they could spend like no one else and won the Premiership title in 1998.The takeover has, among many things, allowed Steve Diamond to go shopping this summer. Such is the nature of rugby’s transfer market that, at such short notice, he has been unable to secure an A-lister, a marquee star to put up in lights at Kingston Park. No equivalent to Robinho joining Manchester City when Abu Dhabi investment arrived in 2008. But make no mistake, this season will be different.“The only reason we’ve recruited the way we have, to be brutally honest, there were no world-class players available in July,” he says. “Our recruitment drive moving forward will be different. What we’ve got to do is get the building blocks in place and then we can get a team together.”Still, Diamond has used his extensive contacts book to forge a squad that will be considerably more competitive than in recent seasons. Liam Williams is the latest eye-catching arrival, joining Christian Wade as one elder statesman in the back division while the 35-year-old Amanaki Mafi will bring some nous to the back-row. Tom Christie and Fergus Lee-Warner are equally shrewd additions, as is the returning hooker George McGuigan, who captains the side against Saracens on Friday night. The game is Newcastle’s first sell-out since 2018.View image in fullscreenA feelgood factor is coursing through Newcastle after the takeover.Photograph: Richard Lee/Shutterstock“We’ll get to November time, that second block of league games, and we’ll be highly competitive,” Diamond says. “It might take a little time to gel, I don’t think we’ll win the Prem this year, but we’ll be competitive and we’ll be up there with the best, behind the scenes, getting our infrastructure right, academy, community departments, all that sort of stuff which is really important. But it would be great for [supporters] to get carried away because they’ve had nothing to jump for for a while.”Prem Rugby 2025-26: complete club-by-club guide to the seasonRead moreMore than those coming through the revolving door, more than the ubiquitous branding at Kingston Park, Red Bull’s investment has brought a degree of security that has been absent in recent times.“The main thing that has changed is intangible really, it’s belief,” says Diamond. “It’s just people coming to work knowing there is some security and the days of wondering what is going to happen have gone. The mental state of people is massive, people have mortgages and kids and now they can come and concentrate on their jobs.”At this stage it does not feel an unfair question to ask, why Newcastle? Why did Red Bull see the worst-performing club in the league as the best to invest in? Put simply, they were for sale, at a reasonable price, but more than that the opportunity for growth in such a big catchment area is significant.View image in fullscreenNewcastle’s takeover has provided much-needed security.Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Getty ImagesNewcastle is a sports-mad city and, as Diamond points out, they have sold more season tickets than in each of the past 20 years. The Prem chief executive, Simon Massie-Taylor, is said to have played a key role in negotiations, having worked with Red Bull during his time at the Rugby Football Union and he simply could not countenance another club going to the wall after losing Worcester, Wasps and London Irish in recent years. It is a feather in the cap that Red Bulldeclined the opportunity to invest in R360.With such a period of turbulence so close in the rearview mirror it is unsurprising that Red Bull’s investment has been welcomed throughout the league. “Any worldwide, well-known company that chooses to invest in the Prem has got to be welcome, because it opens the door for any other club,” said Exeter’s Rob Baxter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He says: “Any competition, good competition, is a gift. Up north as well, it’ll make that local derby a lot more intense. It’s already really physical.“It has been down to [the Sale owners] Simon and Michelle [Orange] and Ged [Mason] to fund rugby in the north, but now there’s someone else to help them out.”View image in fullscreenNewcastle have finished bottom of the table for the past three seasons.Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Getty ImagesMassie-Taylor has pointed out that whereas Red Bull is unique as a brand with a pre-existing wide sporting portfolio, the next step is to attract financial investors into the sport. Still, Red Bull aligns withthe Prem’s goal to modernise, to showcase the extreme physicality within the sport and to appeal to a younger generation.The early signs are good in that sense with Newcastle targeting university freshers for the match against Saracens while the league’s broadcaster, TNT Sports, sees the potential for other companies to follow suit.“We have all seen the type of work Red Bull does around the world,” says Scott Young, executive vice-president of Warner Bros Discovery Sports Europe, TNT’s parent company. “Their connection with sport is very genuine and they are a very active partner when they get involved.“What is great for everybody is they have looked at the Prem, at Newcastle, and thought that is aligned to our brand and think they can be part of the megaphone that gets Newcastle’s story out.“I don’t think it should be lost that someone like Red Bull had a look at the Prem and one of the teams and thought: ‘That’s for us’.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastleRugby unionPrem RugbyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In between he coached England twice and was sacked by England twice, a situation he admitted begrudging over half a bottle of red wine before concluding that the game owed him nothing and going again.Hameed’s fourth hundred of the year, which took Nottinghamshire to within dusting distance of the title, was a typical combination of beguiling strokeplay and resolute defence. He was the backbone of Nottinghamshire’s innings, as he has been all season – the most run-heavy of his career, behind only Surrey’s Dom Sibley.To those who have followed Hameed’s journey from teenage wunderkind with Lancashire and England, to a young man who could not buy a run at Old Trafford, the move to Trent Bridge and then his elevation to the captaincy, Thursday was the happy ending to a favourite fairytale. He might not have been the obvious choice as a leader, but Moores and Mick Newell, the director of cricket at Trent Bridge, saw something in the batsman from Bolton, the “baby Boycott” discarded by England after 10 Tests.After a first year of learning the ropes, he has excelled. His teammate Brett Hutton told the BBC: “He’s calm and he loves the game and the team. He wears his heart on his sleeve and he’s always 100% on it. He trusts the rest of the boys to do their job.”View image in fullscreenNottinghamshire’s Haseeb Hameed on his way to a crucial century, his fourth of the season, against Warwickshire.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesHowever, the campaign has been a team and squad victory. Nine batters hit centuries and seven bowlers pocketed five-wicket hauls. Unlike 2024, players stayed fit and they hit the jackpot with their overseas players – fast bowlers Fergus O’Neill and Mohammad Abbas and Verreynne, the big-hitting wicketkeeper.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have lost one game, suddenly coming off the rails against Durham one mid-May afternoon at Chester-le-Street, but survived the Kookaburra rounds, keeping Surrey in sight. Of their six wins, none was more important thanthe thrilling 20-run knuckle-gnawer against Surreyat the Oval last week, spearheaded by a rampaging Josh Tongue.That victory gave Notts a 14-point buffer and left them in charge of their own destiny and whileSurrey’s first day at Southampton turned into a shambles, Notts kept their course.“When you win a Championship, you don’t know it is going to be your year,” said a smiling Moores. “We beat Durham here, Josh Tongue got four wickets in 12 balls, you win two or three more and suddenly we’re at this game when pressure is different. For the first time we were favourites, you’re holding the ball, you can’t drop it.”And they didn’t.Explore more on these topicsNottinghamshireCounty ChampionshipCounty Championship Division OneCricketPeter MooresfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But without a strong strong supporting case he is struggling to entertain … and winOliver ConnollyThu 25 Sep 2025 08.21 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 11.59 EDTSharePatrick Mahomes has never been here before. Lose to the Ravens on Sunday, and hisKansas City Chiefswill sink to 1-3, falling further behind the Chargers in the AFC West, a division Kansas City have owned for nearly a decade.After three weeks of the season, it’s clear: these are not the Chiefs of old. And Mahomes, while still dazzling in moments, is not the irrepressible force he was three years ago.There is a different tenor about the Chiefs these days. At the peak of their championship run, they didn’t just beat opponents, they demoralized them. Their offense was explosive and creative. Putting up 30-plus points felt inevitable. Now, everything is a grind. Anything outside Mahomes freelancing looks like hard work. We’re into year two of the Chiefs being stodgy and methodical. The bombs away style of early Mahomes has made way for a more plodding approach as they look to paper over the cracks of a diminished roster.For just one game Caleb Williams finally gave the long-suffering Bears hopeRead moreMany Chiefs fans won’t care – they will point to the glaring fact that the Chiefsmade the Super Bowl last season, despite the fact that they lacked the fireworks of old. Rivals fans may welcome the struggles. Over the past few seasons, Mahomes and the Chiefs have gone from fun upstarts to villains. As well as theiroff-field failings, they have been overexposed. Their aging tight end iseffectively the face of the league. They’ve been in primetime too long and have beenthe beneficiaryof too many officiating calls. As the Chiefs have won and won and won, they have moved from a compelling sports story into a pop-cultural force.As the team’s cultural footprint has expanded, Mahomes has had to slog through the last two seasons. For most of his career, Mahomes has been different from other Hall of Fame-caliber quarterbacks. He played with a sense of childlike glee, as if he were discovering his own brilliance at the same time we were. There were the jaw-dropping throws, the how-did-he-do-it comebacks,13 seconds,Jet Chip Wasp,fourth-and-nine,the no-look throws, thebehind-the-back throw, winning the Super Bowl on one leg, the unimaginable made possible. Every week, it felt like he was discovering new ways to play the game.In the early Mahomes years, the Chiefs’ offense was thrilling and visceral. At its best – when the aggressive plays, speedy weapons, and up-tempo pace worked in unison – the offense was less about executing football plays and more about waging psychological warfare. There was no way to cover Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill. If opponents could stop the duo, Mahomes would buy time until one of them eventually sprang open. It was a parade of chunk plays.But as defenses have adapted to limit Mahomes’ ability to chuck the ball downfield, the Chiefs have leaned into a more restricted style. They’re happy to hold on to the ball, to piece together drives in five-yard increments. Last season, that was effective enough to make the Super Bowl again. But this year feels different. It looks different, too. Last year was a byproduct of poor roster management. KC bet on Kelce a year too long. Rookie Xavier Worthy took time to onboard in the Hill role. The left tackle spot was a sinkhole that corrupted the entire offensive line. Despite winning 15 games in the regular season, the Chiefs wheezed through 11 one-score games and didn’t total more than 30 points in a single game. The offense was a chore to watch, but they found a way.That was supposed to be a down year. In the offseason, they would regroup, retool and rediscover the old flair. But the same issues that undercut them a year ago are still present: Mahomes has no supporting run game to ease the pressure on him, his top-two wide receivers – Xavier Worthy and Rashee Rice – are out, and Kelce continues to be the fulcrum of the offense at age 35. There is a lack of rhythm and synchronicity. Amuch-promised overhaul to last year’s schemehas yet to materialize.Defenses continue to crowd the middle of the field and dare Mahomes to be patient. Andy Reid’s counterpunch has been uninspired: grind out plays and hope Mahomes saves things late. This year, 65% of Mahomes’ throws have been below 10 yards, up from last year. He is getting rid of the ball a full half-second quicker than his career average, too, to offset his fragile offensive line.It’s the ordinariness that stings. Their defense is still masterminded by the brilliant Steve Spagnuolo but, on offense, the Chiefs sit below the Texans and Steelers in explosive play rate through three weeks. Mahomes’ best moments, those explosions of old, have come not through design but desperation.And Mahomes has been inconsistent, flashes of his genius tempered by basic miscues. Hehasplayed better than the box score would suggest. But he’s also left plenty of meat on the bone.Schlepping through games has at least revealed a new side to Mahomes. He’s in his defiant era. He is mean-mugging defenders after plays andlowering his shoulderin the open field to squeeze out an extra couple of yards. Asking Mahomes to drill a tackler was not worth the risk three years ago. Now, the Chiefs need him to fight for every yard.Winning a game with practice-squad receivers and a nonfunctional run game is, in itself, a testament to Mahomes’ greatness. He is duct-taping together competence; Mahomes leads the team in rushing yards and the league in quarterback scrambles. A late toss from Mahomes to Tyquan Thornton last week got the Chiefs’ season back on track. But slogging to a win against the hapless Giants is hardly the stuff of a true contender.In some ways, this is the natural life cycle of a dynasty. The Brady-Belichick Patriots won the Super Bowl in the 2004 season and didn’t claim another until the 2014 campaign. There were stretches of mediocrity, streaks where even Brady looked overwhelmed by age, coaching turnover, or a depleted supporting cast. But the greats bend reality and reset expectations. A bad year in Foxborough meant 11 wins and a divisional-round loss. Mahomes has spent his career living in that same rarefied air. Every season of his career as a starter has ended in an AFC Championship Game or a Super Bowl.With a salary cap and draft, no one can win every year. It’s to Mahomes’ credit that he was able to drag last year’s team to the Super Bowl. He seemed to be resetting expectations again.Even when the Chiefs look vulnerable, even when things aren’t clicking, they make it to the final game.Mahomes turned 30 last week. He left his 20s as the most decorated quarterback in history by that age: three Super Bowl wins, three Super Bowl MVPs, two league MVPs, six Pro Bowl nods, two first-team All-Pro selections. He has been both a relentless winner and one of the sport’s great innovators. But as he’s turned 30, he’s entered the most trying period of his career. The Chiefs haven’t given him the tools to play at his melodic best, and he’s been forced to effort through games with an uncommon national glare.Soon enough, Rice and Worthy will return from suspension and injury respectively. And the Chiefs could be the Chiefs again – after all, the Patriots’ drought from 2004 to 2014 was followed by another two championships. But right now, they feel joyless, and so does Mahomes. There may be no greater sporting crime than making Mahomes dull.Explore more on these topicsKansas City ChiefsPatrick MahomesNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump said the deal complies with a law that would have forced the shutdown of the app for American users had it not been divested and sold to a US owner.“I spoke with President Xi and he said, ‘Go ahead with it,’” Trump said at a press conference. “This is going to be American-operated all the way.”Under the plan, US investors will take over the majority of TikTok’s operations and take charge of a licensed copy of the app’s powerful recommendation algorithm. American companies are expected to own about 80% of the US version of the spun off company, while ByteDance and Chinese investors will own less than 20%. The new version ofTikTokwill be controlled by a seven-member board of directors made up of cybersecurity and national security experts, six of them Americans, according to the White House.The new US company will be valued at $14bn, according to JD Vance, who also spoke at the press conference, a number far lower than the valuation for ByteDance overall, which isestimated to be around $330bn. By comparison, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, is valued at $1.8tn.The group of American TikTok investors is led by the US software giant Oracle, which will oversee TikTok’s US operations, provide cloud service for user data storage and get a license to take control of the app’s algorithm. White House officials have said ByteDance and Chinese officials will not have access to US user data.Along with Oracle and its co-founder Larry Ellison, Trump said at the press conference that other investors include media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the CEO of Dell computers Michael Dell. “Great investors. The biggest. They don’t get bigger,” Trump said. Vance added that more details about who is involved in the deal will be announced over the next few days.When asked if TikTok would start prioritizing Maga-related content, Trump said, “I always like Maga-related. If I could, I’d make it 100% Maga-related” but indicated that the app would continue recommending a wide variety of content as before, saying: “Every group will be treated fairly”.The deal ends months of legal limbo for one of the US’s most widely used apps, while also giving several US companies a powerful newfound influence within the social media industry. TikTok is used by about180 millionpeople nationwide, and Trump has credited it with helping him win the 2024 presidential election. The deal is also another foray for the Trump administration to exert influence over the tech industry, after it tooka 10% stake in chipmaker Intelearlier this month and has urged companies like Apple and Nvidia to invest hundreds of billions domestically.Trump had earlier indicated that the US government would receive a lucrative fee from the US investors for negotiating the deal with China, sayinglast week: “The United States is getting a tremendous fee-plus – I call it a fee-plus – for just making the deal.”But on Thursday, when asked about this, the president simply said the US would take ordinary taxes from the new company, adding: “We’re gonna make money and we’re going to get a lot of money in taxes.”TikTok once faced bipartisan pushback from lawmakers over concerns about data privacy, and allegations Chinacould use the app to spread propagandaor undermine US democracy. TikTok repeatedly denied those claims, but Congress overwhelmingly voted last year to compel ByteDance to find a US buyer or face a ban in the country.The supreme court unanimouslyupheld the banin January. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order postponing the ban and has since repeatedly delayed its enforcement. The“Saving TikTok” executive orderTrump issued on Thursday says the deal complies with the law passed by Congress, is a “qualified divestiture” and “resolves” national security concerns. The divestiture from ByteDance isn’t expected to be completed for another 120 days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Husain said thatMr Justice Chamberlain, sitting at the high court, was right to raise concerns that Poac would not hear the case until the middle of next year, whereas a judicial review could take place in the autumn. It has been scheduled for 25 to 27 November.In seeking a judicial review, Husain said his client relied on “the unique nature of the case: the proscription of a protest group with widespread popular support; and the severe detriments that would flow from the Poac route on these facts, including: the ongoing and irremediable chilling of speech and assembly in the interim; the delayed determination of a matter relevant to ongoing criminal cases; and the fact that the Poac route offers no remedy to the hundreds of people already arrested for offences related to support for PA [Palestine Action]”.More than 1,600 people have been arrested for allegedly expressing support for Palestine Action since the bancame into force on 5 July, of whom 138 have been charged.Husain said Ammori would be asking the high court for an order – which Poac could not make – quashing the ban, “with the result that any police enforcement in respect of offences under TA [Terrorism Act] 2000 in respect of PA (including arrests, charges and convictions) would be nullities”.Asked by the judges what he thought would happen to people arrested for supporting Palestine Action if Poac de-proscribed the group, Eadie said there was “not a clear and obvious answer”. He suggested that offences for supporting Palestine Action prior to any overturning of the ban could still stand.“Parliament has designed the scheme so that the jurisdiction of Poac is no different to that of the high court so that there can be no suggestion of there being any advantage in proceeding with judicial review proceedings rather than a statutory appeal,” Eadie said.Speaking before the hearing, Ammori called it an “alarming attempt to prevent judicial scrutiny” of the “extreme and unprecedented decision” to proscribe the group.The panel of three judges, led by the lady chief justice, Sue Carr, said they hoped to give a judgment next month.Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionUK security and counter-terrorismCounter-terrorism policyCourt of appealHome OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

They suggest the Amazon forest is remarkably resilient to climate change. My fear is that may count for little, unless we can stop the deforestation itself.”‘A heavy burden’: Belém residents evicted in rush for profits from Cop30 rentalsRead moreThis caution comes asBrazilplans to pave a major road – the BR-319 – through the central Amazon, close to one of the last regions that still has large areas of pristine forest. Bolivia also continues to clear trees at an alarming rate for soy plantations and cattle ranching.The study was conducted by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the UK and beyond, who examined changes in the forest at 188 plots in the Amazon over the past 30 years.They found the mean cross-section of trunks thickened by 3.3% per decade, with the greatest increase found in larger trees. This expansion was attributed to the rising amount of CO2in the atmosphere as a result of the human-caused burning of gas, oil and coal.Big trees such ascastanheiras(Brazil nut trees),sumaúmas(kapoks) andAngelim vermelhocan rise up above 30 metres so they dominate the canopy and lead the competition among plants for the light, water and nutrients needed to photosynthesise CO2.The results highlight how the best-protected areas of the forest remain important allies in the struggle to stabilise the climate, though they alone are far from enough to deal with all of the extra carbon dioxide being pumped into the air globally by cars, factories and power stations.They also show the importance of preventing further deforestation. The areas of the Amazon that have been heavily fragmented by agribusiness and infrastructure – mostly in the south-east –have already shifted from carbon sinks to carbon sources.Big trees are more vulnerable to strong wind, fire and drought if they are isolated or left on the edge of a border between forest and cropland or pasture.Deforestation has killed half a million people in past 20 years, study findsRead moreFor decades, it had been assumed that huge trees – even in dense forest – would die more quickly as temperatures rose, because they were thought to have relatively shallow roots compared with their size. But recent studies show that many have very thin roots that can suck water from much greater depths.It is not yet clear how mortality trends might have been affected by the severe drought of the past few years in much of the Amazon.One of the lead authors of the new paper, Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert from the University of Cambridge, said the big trees were disproportionately important to the functioning of the biome. Although they account for just 1% of the trees in the forest, they were responsible for 50% of the carbon cycling and storage, and probably a similar proportion of the water cycling.“Forests get much drier after big trees die. It alters the structure of the forest and it takes a long time to bounce back because the big trees take a long time to grow,” Esquivel-Muelbert said. “So it is a little bit hopeful that we find them increasing in size and number across the Amazon. There is some resilience there.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisAmazon rainforestBrazilAmericasDeforestationTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

Then came a wildfireRead moreThe Associated Press found some residents didn’t receive emergency alerts until well after homes went up in flames.The report cited critical staffing shortages including a high number of sheriff’s deputy vacancies and an under-resourced Office of Emergency Management. In addition, first responders and incident commanders were unable to consistently share real-time information due to unreliable cellular connectivity, inconsistent field reporting methods, and the use of various unconnected platforms.“While frontline responders acted decisively and, in many cases, heroically, in the face of extraordinary conditions, the events underscored the need for clearer policies, stronger training, integrated tools, and improved public communication,” the report says.It is not intended to investigate or assess blame, county officials said in a news release.“This isn’t about pointing fingers. It’s about learning lessons, improving safety, and restoring public trust,” said supervisor Kathryn Barger, whose district includes Altadena. “Survivors of the Eaton fire deserve answers – and today’s report is an important step toward delivering them.”The Office of Emergency Management began putting together its staffing plan for predicted heavy winds on 3 January, four days before the Palisades and Eaton fires ignited. But an experienced OEM staffer had been sent out of town for a training event. That meant several, less knowledgeable staffers were in key positions, according to the report.They were also working with some new emergency notification software provided by an existing vendor: the county signed the expanded contract with emergency alert company Genasys in November, just before the holidays. Only four staff members were trained on Genasys when the fires hit, according to the report.The review also found that the process to communicate an evacuation decision to the public was slow, convoluted and involved multiple leadership roles across county-level departments.In the case of the Palisades fire, the Los Angeles county fire department and sheriff’s department identified areas that required evacuation. They then communicated those areas to a member of the county’s Office of Emergency Management at the Incident Command center. This person then made a phone call or sent a text message to another OEM staffer located in the emergency operations center, who then updated the system put in place by the third-party vendor and triggered an alert to the public.During the January inferno, according to the report, this process took between 20 and 30 minutes. The report’s authors note this represented an improvement, though, over the old system that took between 30 and 60 minutes for the public to receive notice of an evacuation.Still, the report notes, many of the county’s methods to alert the public require opting in.“If residents are not aware of or do not sign up for these services, such as Alert Los Angeles County, Genasys Protect, and WatchDuty, they will not benefit from the alerts and notifications sent from these systems,” the report states.Some of the evacuation alerts required residents to click a separate link to get complete information, hindering messaging, the report found. The communication system used for alerts did not provide complete information about the fire’s progression, such as the names and locations of evacuation zones or the general areas of evacuations. Power outages and cell tower issues further hindered evacuation notices, and the timing of the evacuation notices simply could not keep up with the pace of the fire, the report found.US government files $77m suit against Southern California Edison over wildfire damageRead moreThere was also a gap in the county’s policies about who is responsible for letting residents know how they should prepare for extreme weather risks, according to the report. The county did send out a handful of warnings about the incomingSanta Ana wind eventand amplified National Weather Service messaging on social media and in news releases, but there was no official, stand-alone preparedness messaging provided by the county.The Los Angeles county board of supervisors is scheduled to review the 133-page report when it meets next Tuesday.The causes of the two fires are still under investigation.After-action reports and investigations revealed issues with alert systems in otherCaliforniablazes: in the 2017 Tubbs fire, which killed 22 people in Santa Rosa; the 2018 Camp fire, which killed 85 people in Paradise; the Woolsey fire, which started the same day and killed three in Malibu; as well as in Colorado’s 2021 Marshall fire, which destroyed more than 1,000 homes outside Denver; and in Hawaii’s 2023 Lahaina fire, which decimated that historic town and killed 102 people.Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastExtreme weatherWildfiresUS weathernewsShareReuse this content"

It is calling on the water company to produce a high-profile campaign to connect the septic tank properties to the mains.UnitedUtilitiessaid it could not force property owners to sign up to the main network, but that it was involved in community outreach to encourage businesses and individuals to do so.Under section101 (a) of the 1991 Water Industry Act, property owners can request a connection to the public sewer system if an existing private sewerage system – serving two or more premises or a locality – is causing, or is likely to cause, environmental or amenity problems.Matt Staniek, the founder and director of Save Windermere, said only one scheme had been completed in the Windermere catchment in two decades, which connected only 27 properties to the mains.He said: “There should have been far more effort to inform local communities about their right to request a mains connection. When connection studies have been carried out in the past, they should have been acted on.“Any work that doesn’t aim to connect private properties to the mains … is a smokescreen. It’s greenwash that pulls us further away from a sewage-free Windermere.”Treated and untreated sewage discharges from United Utilities facilities represent the principal source of phosphorous pollution into Windermere.The first comprehensive analysisof water quality in England’s largest lake revealed bathing water quality across most of the lake was poor throughout the summer owing to high levels ofsewage pollution.As well as pollution from water company assets, sewage pollution is known to enter the lake from private septic tanks. The water company attributes 30% of phosphorus loading in the lake to non-mains drainage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But it said the government should have responded by stamping it our rather than legitimising it.Morgane Speeckaert, an advocacy and communications officer at the charity, said: “This welfare law was in place for the protection of chickens and if the government was able to so clearly ignore it, or even worse, dilute it, it sets an unsettling precedent. The government quietly weakened the few rules that exist to protect chickens rather than tackle the enforcement problem.“When the UK left theEuropean Union, the public was promised higher animal welfare standards as a benefit – now the opposite is happening. We are delighted that the judge agrees with us and has granted us permission to proceed.”Labour could end badger cull but only with Covid-style testing and vaccines – reportRead moreThe Animal Law Foundation says that handling chickens by the legs causes significant pain and distress, and injuries such as fractures and dislocations. When chickens are inverted they can suffocate, as their internal organs begin to crush their lungs, which are not protected by a diaphragm, the charity says.It claims that the consultation carried out before the law was changed did not meet the requirement of fairness. It says the government had made clear its intention, in effect prejudging the issue, and did not allow proper consideration of various issues, including the welfare detriment to chicken, nor present enforcement as a solution to the issue of the industry not following the law.In July, campaigners criticised Labour forfailing to implement any of its animal welfare pledgesa year after taking office and at the same time changing the law with respect to handling chickens and turkeys – described asthe first weakening of animal welfare regulationssinceBrexit,European Transport Regulation1/2005, which until recently applied in the UK, states: “It shall be prohibited to … lift or drag the animals by head, ears, horns, legs, tail or fleece, or handle them in such a way as to cause them unnecessary pain or suffering.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

However, it said a transition to upright catching may not be feasible in commercial settings, citing cost implications as one reason.A Department for Environment,Foodand Rural Affairs spokesperson said: “All farm animals are protected by comprehensive and robust animal health and welfare legislation, and we’re committed to upholding the highest animal welfare standards.”Explore more on these topicsAnimal welfareLabourAnimalsFarmingFoodEuropean UnionSteve ReedShareReuse this content"

One official said the rise was equivalent to half of what it would cost to scrap the two-child benefit limit, which Burnham has called for.Starmer is understood to be furious at Burnham’s admission, in several interviews, that he would seek to challenge the prime minister for the leadership if there was a path to do so.Cabinet ministers explicitly criticised comments from Burnham in a New Statesman interview published on Wednesday, in which he disagreed with the economic approach of the chancellor, Rachel Reeves. “We’ve got to get beyond this thing of being in hock to the bond markets,” he said.The remarks have incensed those in government. “If you don’t want to be in hock to the bond markets, don’t announce plans that involve billions of borrowing,” one senior source said.The deputy leadership candidate,Bridget Phillipson, said that working people had already suffered from a “reckless approach on the economy” from Truss.Burnham has proposed a slew of policies,and told a Guardian documentarythat the two-child benefit limit was the “worst of Westminster”. This prompted disdain from within government because Burnham abstained on the legislation that introduced the cap.He said he had fought hard at the time to find a way to oppose the bill through an amendment “but the nuances of that debate just got lost”.15:04Raising kids in poverty: The UK’s ‘inhumane’ two child limitBurnham has suggested in other interviews he would favour higher council tax on more expensive properties, investing more in building council housing and a 50% rate of income tax on higher earners, as well as nationalising water and utilities.Starmer and Phillipson both criticised Burnham’s comments on Thursday, and warned ignoring market forces would put the UK at risk of a Truss-style economic meltdown.In an interview with the Guardian, Phillipson said she had “a lot of respect for Andy” but added: “We have to tread with real care around casual language on the bond markets. Working people ended up paying more on their mortgages because of Liz Truss’s actions and what happened there.“So let’s just pause and consider whether it’s really a responsible approach for a party of government to be talking in that kind of language, because working people have suffered once because of a reckless approach on the economy. And it’s through having credibility and a clear plan on the economy that we are able to invest more in public services.”Starmer told broadcasters he would not be drawn on the mayor’s “personal ambition” but said he would take a tough line on the challenge to the fiscal rules. The prime minister said: “It was three years ago this week that Liz Truss showed what happens if you abandon fiscal rules. Now, in her case, she did that for tax cuts, but the same would happen if it was spending.“I’m not prepared to let aLabourgovernment ever inflict that harm on working people … And there’s nothing progressive about borrowing more than we need to. It’s nothing progressive about abandoning fiscal rules.”Burnham – who would need a Westminster seat to challenge for the leadership – is seen by a number of Labour MPs as an opportunity for a change in economic strategy and a more robust challenger to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.He said Labour MPs were privately urging him to run, but said any such move would have to be “more than a personality contest”. He told BBC Radio 5 Live he would not “speak in code”, “toe the line” or “be quiet” about issues important to Greater Manchester.In a separate interview with the Telegraph, Burnham accused Downing Street of creating a “climate of fear” and spreading “alienation and demoralisation” among MPs. He said that while he was not “plotting to get back”, the leadership was “for other people in Westminster to make a decision about”.But it was Burnham’s comments on the economy that prompted the prime minister’s supporters to go on the attack. Steve Reed, the housing secretary, said Starmer had got used to people “taking potshots” at him in opposition before he “picked this party up off the floor and led us to a record-breaking election victory”.Labour MPs and ministers told the Guardian they were annoyed by the leadership speculation, and suggested Burnham was losing support as a result.“Andy’s problem is everybody knows what he’s about and nobody knows what he’s for,” one MP from the 2024 intake said. “It’s gobsmacking from someone who left Westminster when the going was tough, having stood by Corbyn in the shadow cabinet, who is consistently throwing grenades into the parliamentary party from afar for months on end and is now seemingly desperate to get back to Westminster.”A senior Labour source said: “If I could offer Andy a bit of advice, it’s that he’s coming across as a bit desperate.”Another senior Labour aide added: “You just do not mess around with this stuff on the bond markets. Setting out a policy platform like this just makes him look ludicrous. In the last few days he has spent tens of billions of pounds and actually it doesn’t get him any closer to the leadership but it does put the markets on edge ahead of what is already a difficult budget.”Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerBridget PhillipsonLabourEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

This demands urgent, sector-wide reform and accountability.Studentsand staff deserve safe campuses, not excuses.”While 24% of all students said they had experienced sexual harassment, including pestering and sending images, women were nearly three times more likely to experience the harassment than men, with 33% affected compared with 12% of men.Women were also more than twice as likely as men to experience sexual assault or sexual violence, at 19% compared with 7% of men.A similar survey carried out in Australia found that 16% of students had experienced sexual harassment and 4.5% experienced sexual assault while at university.In England, nearly 40% of the harassment took place away from the university environment, but many of those cases involved someone from the university or college, mainly other students although 3% of cases involved academics.Only 13% of students who experienced harassment in the past 12 months had reported it to their university or college. While sexual assault was more frequently reported, younger students aged 21 or under were less likely to do so.Of those who formally reported incidents, only 47% rated the procedure as good, while 39% said it was poorly handled.While older students were less likely to be sexually assaulted or attacked, the survey found that those over the age of 31 were far more likely to be assaulted by a member of staff, including lecturers, sports coaches or other staff.School history lessons minimise the role of women, report findsRead moreUniversities and colleges regulated by the OfS face new requirements to tackle harassment and sexual misconduct. Susan Lapworth, the OfS’s chief executive, said: “All students should expect their time at university or college to be free from sexual harassment or assault. We know that’s not always the case and we’re grateful to each student who told us about their experiences.“Over the last year, universities and colleges have rightly renewed their efforts to tackle these issues – because when incidents do occur they can have a profound, even devastating, impact on students’ ability to thrive and succeed.”Explore more on these topicsStudentsOffice for StudentsHigher educationSexual harassmentWomenUniversitiesEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

To come back to our earlier thing – I just don’t think these things are either/or. I think it’s my deepest wish that I hope people who don’t agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don’t necessarily share the same opinion with.”Watson went on to say she believed that a dialogue over the debate with Rowling was not permitted, adding: “I think the thing I’m most upset about is that a conversation was never made possible.”View image in fullscreenTom Felton, Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Matthew Lewis at the New York premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, 2011.Photograph: Stephen Lovekin/Getty ImagesThe three lead actors in the movie series reunited for the 20th anniversary of the first film in 2021, but Rowling was absent. She serves as executive producer on HBO’s upcoming TV adaptation.Speaking to Shetty, Watson reflected with affection on her years working on Harry Potter, saying that it was sufficiently collegiate as to have given her unrealistic expectations about future jobs.Emma Watson explains long break from acting: ‘I do not miss selling things’Read more“I was coming to those sets with an expectation that I think I had developed on Harry Potter, which was that we were, the people I worked with were going to be my family, and that we were going to be lifelong friends.“I came to work looking for friendship, and that was a very painful experience for me. Outside of Harry Potter and in Hollywood, like, bone-breaking, really painful … because most people don’t come to those environments looking for friendships. They’re looking for, this is my chance, this is my role, this is what I want out of it. I’m focused, this is my job, this is my career. Like, let’s go. And I was not of that mindset. And so I found the rejection really painful.“I think it was so unusual to make a set of films for 12 years and we were a community. Like we, we really were. And so I took that as an expectation into my other workplaces. And I just got my ass kicked. I really did. It, yeah, it broke me.”Although not officially retired from acting, Watson, 35, is currently studying for a postgraduate degree in creative writing at Oxford University. In an interview with Hollywood Authentic earlier this week, she expanded on her hiatus from the profession, saying that while she enjoyed performing, “I do not miss selling things. I found that to be quite soul-destroying. But I do very much miss using my skill-set, and I very much miss the art. I just found I got to do so little of the bit that I actually enjoyed.”Explore more on these topicsFilmEmma WatsonJK RowlingHarry PotternewsShareReuse this content"

This is a point of pride for those who live nearby, and the quote is displayed in the pub opposite the tree.Cowan’s book also recounts an urban legend that a sapling grew by accident when a local family returned from holiday with primrose roots, one of which contained the ash seed.It is the only tree in the street and stands 75ft tall, casting shade on the sandstone tenement houses.Many ash trees across the country have been felled due to the fungal disease ash dieback, which kills them. So far the Argyle Street ash, planted in the Victorian era, has survived the Clydeside blitz, recent redevelopment and the disease.View image in fullscreenThe ‘King of Limbs’ oak tree in Wiltshire, which inspired a Radiohead album title.Photograph: Lee Cooper/Woodland Trust/PAThe tree beat beat the “King of Limbs” oak that inspireda Radiohead album title, and “the Lonely Tree”, which sits on the edge of Llyn Padarn in north Wales.Also in the top five were the Lady Jane Grey oak in Bradgate Park in Leicester, and a majestic cedar with low-sweeping boughs where the Beatles were once photographed at Chiswick House in London.Adam Cormack, the head of campaigning at the Woodland Trust, said: “Trees really matter to people, and this is clear from the response we’ve seen to the Argyle Street ash. Trees inspire us to write stories and create art, whilst connecting us to cultural legacies and a sense of place. We encourage people to notice and enjoy the trees around them, and learn more about how they benefit us – from boosting biodiversity and wellbeing, to mitigating the effects of climate change.”The arborist David Treanor, who has been managing the ash in recent years, nominated the tree, which has been protected by a tree preservation order, thought to be one of the first in Glasgow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

She justified the move on the grounds the offences were of “exceptional gravity” and “likely to undermine citizens’ trust”.The start of Sarkozy’s sentence will be set at a later date. Prosecutors have been given a month to inform him of when he should go to prison. The judge also ordered Sarkozy, France’s rightwing president from 2007 to 2012, to pay a €100,000 (£87,000) fine.His sentence was harsher than many had expected. As he left the courtroom, he expressed his anger in typically pugnacious style, telling reporters: “What happened today … is of extreme gravity in regard to the rule of law, and for the trust one can have in the justice system.“If they absolutely want me to sleep in jail, I will sleep in jail, but with my head held high.”Sarkozy, who had denied all wrongdoing in court, said he would appeal against the verdict. “I am innocent. This justice is a scandal,” he said.View image in fullscreenNicolas Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, at the courthouse in Paris.Photograph: Teresa Suárez/EPA“Those that hate me this much think they will humiliate me. But what they have humiliated today is France, the image of France.”The former president was found guilty of criminal conspiracy but acquitted of corruption, misuse of Libyan public funds and illegal election campaign funding.As he walked out of the court with his wife, the singer and former model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, TV cameras showed her grabbing the red cover of the microphone of investigative reportingwebsite Mediapart, which first started reporting on the Libya allegations, and apparently throwing it on the ground.She later posted on Instagram: “Love is the answer” with the hashtag #Hatewillnotwin.Prosecutors had told the court that Sarkozy and his aides devised a “corruption pact” withGaddafiand the Libyan regime in 2005 to illegally fund Sarkozy’s successful presidential election campaign two years later.The court heard that in return for the money, the Libyan regime requested diplomatic, legal and business favours, and it was understood that Sarkozy would rehabilitateGaddafi’s international image. The autocratic Libyan leader, whose 41-year rule was marked by human rights abuses, had been isolated internationally over his regime’s connection to terrorism, including the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 overLockerbiein Scotland in December 1988.Prosecutors accused members of Sarkozy’s entourage of meeting members of Gaddafi’s regime in Libya in 2005, when Sarkozy was interior minister. Soon after becoming president in 2007, Sarkozy invited the Libyan leader for alengthy state visit to Parisduring which he set up his Bedouin tent in gardens near the Élysée Palace.View image in fullscreenSarkozy welcomes Gaddafi to the Élysée Palace in Paris in December 2007.Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex/ShutterstockIn 2011, Sarkozy put France at the forefront of Nato-led airstrikes against Gaddafi’s troops that helped rebel fighters topple his regime. Gaddafi was captured and killed in October 2011.The allegations of a secret campaign funding pact made this the biggest corruption trial Sarkozy had faced. He had already been convicted in two separate cases and stripped of France’s highest distinction, the Legion of Honour.In the first case, Sarkozy was convicted of corruption and influence peddling over illegal attempts tosecure favoursfrom a judge. He was given a one-year jail term, which he served this year with an electronic tag for three months before being granted conditional release. It was the first time a former French head of state had been forced to wear an electronic tag. Sarkozy had to wear the tag into the Paris criminal court during part of the trial over Libya campaign funding.In a second case, Sarkozy was convicted ofhiding illegal overspendingin the 2012 presidential election that he lost to the Socialist candidate, François Hollande. He has appealed against both convictions.Despite his convictions, Sarkozy continues to meet and be consulted by key figures on the right and in the centre of French politics. He recently met his former protege, the new prime minister,Sébastien Lecornu, who has yet to form a government after the previous administration collapsed in a no-confidence vote this month.After the verdict on Thursday, the rightwing outgoing interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, praised Sarkozy for his “energy and determination”. “I reiterate my full support and friendship to him during this difficult time,” he said.Elsewhere on the political spectrum there was less support. Clémentine Autain, a leftwing MP, wrote on X: “Head held high, dirty hands. The rule of law did not fail.”Other defendants in the trial received mixed verdicts.Claude Guéant, who was the director of Sarkozy’s 2007 presidential campaign before being made his chief of staff and then interior minister, was found guilty of criminal conspiracy and corruption.Brice Hortefeux, another Sarkozy ally who also served as interior minister, was found guilty of criminal conspiracy but acquitted of illegal campaign funding. He and Guéant are likely to appeal against their convictions.Éric Woerth, another former minister who was Sarkozy’s head of campaign financing in 2007 and has since moved to Emmanuel Macron’s centrist party, was acquitted.In a sudden turn of events this week, the Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, who told Mediapart in a filmed interview in 2016 that he had helped to deliver suitcases of cash from Gaddafi to Sarkozy’s entourage, died of a heart attack in Beirut, two days before the verdict.Takieddine had retracted his incriminating statement about transporting suitcases of cash in the Libya case in 2020, prompting accusations that Sarkozy and close allies had paid him off, something they have always denied.

Under the rule, civil police officers would be paid bonuses of between 10% and 150% of their salaries for capturing high-calibre weapons and “neutralizing criminals”.The move’s supporters – many of them allies ofBrazil’s former far-right presidentJair Bolsonaro– argue that an iron fist was the only way to defeat the heavily armed drug factions who rule many of the city’s favelas.Alexandre Knoploch, a lawmaker from Bolsonaro’s Liberal party, compared the policy to the anti-crime crackdown unfolding in El Salvador under its authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, where acontroversial three-year state of emergencyhas seen the murder rate plummet.‘Caught defenseless in the crossfire’: Rio families cope with deaths by police violenceRead more“There is no country in the world which has managed to bring down its high levels of criminality without taking stances such as this,” Knoploch told Rio’s legislative assembly on Tuesday, hailing the law as a way of fighting criminals he called “scum”.“I’m sorry but if these people can’t understand the meaning of civility, they must be neutralized by the police. If you’re carrying a rifle, you have to be neutralized,” Knoploch declared.But activists and security experts poured scorn on the plans which must now be green lit or vetoed by Rio’s rightwing governor, Cláudio Castro, another Bolsonaro ally.“This bonus encourages extrajudicial killings. It is a perverse stimulus to state violence – an invitation to slaughter,” said Antônio Carlos Costa, the founder of anti-violence group Rio de Paz.Henrique Vieira, a federal congressman for Rio, described the legislation as “stupid, bizarre, inhumane, cruel, expensive and inefficient”.Renata Souza, a state congresswoman, said the law would give police “a carte blanche to apply the death penalty in the favelas”.Marcelo Freixo, a veteran human rights activist and leftwing politician, warned the law woulddisproportionately affect young Black men from the favelas. “Police deserve to be paid more – but not for killing people,” he said.Legal experts told the Rio newspaper Extra the “neutralization” policy was unconstitutional in a country which did not allow the death penalty.Carlos Minc, a state congressman who helped abolish the “wild west” law in the 90s, recalled how research had found that 64% of the 1,200 people killed “in combat” during that period died from shots to their backs, ears and to the back of their necks. “They were executions,” he told reporters, calling the resurrected law a step backwards into a violent past.In 2021, Rio’s civil police was blamed for the worst day of violence in the city’s history when28 people were shot deadduring an operation in a favela considered one of the main strongholds of the Red Command faction.Explore more on these topicsRio de JaneiroBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Flights were halted for several hours at Aalborg airport, which also serves as a military base, and Billund, Denmark’s second biggest airport, closed its airspace for nearly an hour.Airports in Esbjerg, Sønderborg and Skrydstrup – home to some of the Danish military’s fighter jets -were also affected. Copenhagen airport was forced to close on Monday night as a result of the presence of three drones.Von der Leyen backed plans earlier this month for drone defences, but details have until now been scant. The commission’s spokesperson on defence, Thomas Regnier, said the meeting would be a chance to discuss capabilities while stressing the challenges.“One thing that we will have to do is detect these incoming drones. This is not super-easy to do. We’re not talking about big fighter jets and planes coming in. No, we are talking about the latest technology developments. These drones have to be detected, and then, second track [will be to decide] what will we do to fight back against these drones,” he said.Ministers from Denmark, the three Baltic states, Finland, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria are expected to take part in the meeting. The commission has indicated that a drone wall could be funded by theEU’s €150bn (£131bn) Security Action for Europe loans scheme.Denmark’s defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, told a press conference: “There can be no doubt that everything points to this being the work of a professional actor when we are talking about such a systematic operation in so many locations at virtually the same time. This is what I would define as a hybrid attack using different types of drones.“This is an arms race against time because technology is constantly evolving.”The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said she had spoken to theNatosecretary general, Mark Rutte, about “the serious situation related to drones over Danish airports”.Map of affected airportsAmong the theories being investigated in relation to the Copenhagen airport incursion is that the drones were launched from the sea. Police said they were looking at a number of vessels of interest. They did not name any, but online ship trackers show that two Russian ships were in the area at the time. The Danish broadcaster TV2 suggested they could have been appropriately positioned for Wednesday’s incidents.The Russian embassy in Copenhagen rejected any speculation that Moscow had been involved in the incidents as absurd, and described the disruptions as a “staged provocation” to escalate tensions.Police in Denmark and Sweden said they were investigating a number of reports of drone sightings, including over Danish oilfields and Stockholm. Danish ministers have said Copenhagen is “not ruling out anything in terms of who is behind this”.Poulsen said Denmark was considering activating Nato’s article 4 for the first time in Danish history, but a decision had not yet been made. “In addition to article 4, there are other things that can be done through Nato,” he said.Rutte said Nato was taking the situation “very seriously”. “Nato allies and Denmark are working together on how we can ensure the safety and security of our critical infrastructure,” he said.View image in fullscreenFlights were halted for several hours at Aalborg airport.Photograph: Bo Amstrup/ReutersThe government has faced criticism in recent days for not shooting down the drones. Poulsen said the Danish armed forces had “a number of capabilities”, but that they would like to have more.The justice minister, Peter Hummelgaard, said the country would seek additional ways to neutralise drones, including proposing legislation to allow infrastructure owners to shoot them down.The drone flights follow similar incursions in Poland and Romania and the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets, incidents that have raised tensions in light of Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine.“The threat from hybrid attacks is here to stay,” said Hummelgaard, describing recent events as “deeply worrying incidents across Europe”.Is Copenhagen drone incursion further evidence of Russian interest in allied airspace?Read morePoulsen said the drones may have been launched in the “immediate area” of Denmark. “I can’t describe where they came from, but not over a long distance. It’s happening here locally,” he said.Military drone experts said it would technically be possible to have flown the drones from far away avoiding detection – especially if using 5G – using a method known as groundhugging, or they could have been launched from nearby, controlled by a pilot who could be anywhere in the world.The director of the Danish military drone producer Hecto Drone, Andreas Kold Siggaard, said jamming the signal would not make a difference in stopping an advanced drone. “Jamming is not an option. There is not much you can do other than shoot them down or using some kind of kinetic impact, drone-on-drone combat basically,” he said.Danish police said the sightings on Wednesday night followed a similar pattern to the ones that shut down Copenhagen airport on Monday.According to North Jutland police, “more than one drone” was seen near Aalborg airport flying with lights on. The first was seen at about 9.44pm local time and drones were still in the airspace after midnight.Frederiksen has described the drone incursion that shut Copenhagen airport for several hours on Monday as the “most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date”.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkAir transportDrones (non-military)RussiaNatoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

At the time of writing, Golden, by the cartoon’s chief protagonists Huntr/x, is enjoying its seventh week at No 1: a couple of weeks back, songs from the film would have occupied seven places in the Top 10 had chart rules not limited artists to three appearances in the Top 40.View image in fullscreenOlivia Dean: The Art of Loving.The most striking challenge to its supremacy has been mounted by London singer-songwriter Olivia Dean. Her single Man I Need has been dug in at No 2 for the last month and has been joined in the Top 10 by its predecessor,Nice to Each Other, and her collaboration with Sam Fender,Rein Me In. Further down the Top 20, her old single Dive is enjoying an unexpected new lease of life. Were it not for a made-up K-pop band, one suspects we’d be talking about Dean’s ongoing success as the pop phenomenon of the moment, and not just in the UK: Man I Need is the fifth most played song in the world on Spotify at the time of writing.Dean’s 2023 debut album,Messy, attracted respectful but mixed reviews and did respectable, rather than remarkable, business. It spawned a hit single inDive, but seemed very much standard-issue stuff – tasteful neo-soul replete with vintage horn arrangements, ballads accompanied by lo-fi, slightly out-of-tune piano, tracks that opened with the sound of crackly old vinyl. Its author did the type of things that tasteful British neo-soul artists do: appearing on Jools Holland’s Hootenanny belting out You Can’t Hurry Love, covering The Christmas Song as part of a seasonal Amazon campaign, turning up on the soundtrack for the new Bridget Jones film alongside Jamie Cullum and George Ezra. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with any of that, but nor did any of it suggest that Dean was the kind of artist built to contest the dominance of a $100m (£74m) smash-hit animation, the soundtrack of which has topped the charts in 16 countries.Olivia Dean: Man I Need – videoSo how has it happened? High-profile support slots on Sam Fender and Sabrina Carpenter’s stadium shows early in the summer probably helped broaden her audience, but the real answer seems to lie on The Art of Loving. While you wouldn’t describe it as a complete reinvention, it certainly constitutes a noticeable rethink. It expunges most of the cliches of Dean’s debut album – or rather quarantines them on a track called Close Up – and instead looks for inspiration to music that emanated from recording studios in 70s LA. The Art of Loving dabbles in both Rumours-adjacent soft rock – you’re never far from a sun-dappled electric piano line or a breezy acoustic guitar; Baby Steps offers up slick, yacht rock-y funk – and, on So Easy (To Fall in Love), Carpenters-style MOR pop that would once have been considered entirely beyond the pale.It’s a sound that’s familiar without feeling hackneyed or self-consciously retro: Something Inbetween is powered by a muffled rhythm that sounds like someone playing a techstep drum’n’bass track with a duvet over the speakers; lurking in the depths of Nice to Each Other there’s a wash of shoegaze-y guitar noise and gusts of ambient synth drone. Airy and inviting, it suits Dean’s sweetly understated vocals – mercifully lacking affectation, either of the post-Winehouse “jazzy” variety or the weird, consonant-mangling “indie voice” that’s supposed to connote intimacy in 21st-century pop – and adds a cinematic gloss to her lyrics. Dean is big on diaristic detail as she navigates ex-related angst and tentative new relationships: “I don’t know where the switches are, or where you keep your cutlery.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Every chorus has been polished until it catches the light (Baby Steps offers a particularly gleaming example), while one suspects that an enormous amount of effort has been expended on making the melodies of Nice to Each Other and I’ve Seen It sound as effortlessly charming as they do.So the album breezes past. It’s exceptionally well made but feels entirely natural; it’s mainstream commercial pop, but laudably devoid of obvious cliches. If Dean’s debut seemed like an artist trying to find their place in the landscape by ticking relevant boxes, The Art of Loving seems like someone finding their own voice. The sight of Olivia Dean battling a cartoon K-pop band in the charts’ upper echelons is proof that pop in 2025 is a business you can’t really predict, but still, The Art of Loving’s success seems a foregone conclusion.This week Alexis listened toMakaya McCraven – Los GatosChicago jazz drummer-cum-sonic collagist scores an ace by looping a section of a 2015 live improvisation – featuring Tortoise’s Jeff Parker – into a hypnotic reverie.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, with a rerelease imminent, the original synth-folk sound of Kuljit Bhamra and his mother Mohinder is finally getting its dueAmmar KaliaThu 25 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTShare‘Punjabi Disco is the holy grail of British Asian music,” DJ and label boss Raghav Mani says. “It’s a miracle this record exists. For decades it has been lost to the world, but now we can hear it in all its glory – the album that birthed the British Asian dancefloor.”Recorded in London in 1982, the nine-track album combines producer Kuljit Bhamra’s searing synthesiser melodies and hammering drum machine rhythms with the Punjabi-language folk singing of his classically trained mother, Mohinder Kaur Bhamra. Part early acid house experiment, part north Indian tradition and part disco-funk, the record was a futuristic outlier: the south Asian fusion sounds of bhangra were only just beginning; the mainstream crossover music of the Asian underground was more than a decade away; and the British Asian diaspora were largely relegated to meeting at weddings and community events, rather than at the disco.Limited to only 500 copies, Punjabi Disco disappeared from circulation almost as quickly as it was released, leaving Mohinder to go back to singing at Sikh weddings and Kuljit to producing bhangra records by groups such as Heera. In the decades since, rare copies have materialised online for thousands of dollars but it has otherwise vanished into obscurity. That was until Mani stumbled on a new lead.View image in fullscreenKey player … Kuljit Bhamra in his home music room in 1982.Photograph: Courtesy of Kuljit Bhamra“When you’re a record collector you can develop this jaded feeling that you’ve seen and heard everything,” he says. “Except, in 2022 my friend Massimo called me and was so excited about this new discovery that he had to play it to me over the phone. Even down the line, I could tell it was something singular and indefinable in its sound. He said it was called Punjabi Disco and he had just bought the last copy in existence, directly from Kuljit.”Mani and his business partner Filip Nikolic immediately decided to see if Kuljit was willing to release a reissue on their archival label Naya Beat. “It was a three-year process, from first hearing the record to Kuljit finding the original master tapes in his house and digitising them before they completely degraded,” Mani says. “During that time, we discovered that not only is it an incredible-sounding album that more people need to hear but it also has a crazy story behind its making.”Allow Bandcamp content?This article includes content provided byBandcamp.

She was the first woman in her community to sing at local Sikh gurdwara events and progressed to performing at wedding receptions. Her family provided instrumental backing, including Kuljit who accompanied on tabla from the age of six.As the 1970s approached, though, Mohinder began to be uncomfortable about the gender segregation she witnessed in the crowd. “South Asians weren’t living in England in large numbers and they faced a lot of racism, so there weren’t many places for them to gather,” she says. “One of the few spaces they could enjoy themselves were wedding receptions, but every time we would get up to sing, the women would typically be in another room and only the men were allowed to dance. I felt it wasn’t fair and so I started to invite them in.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

If we could get him moving, I knew we were on to something,” Kuljit laughs. “By the time Saturday Night Fever came out in 1978, disco mania was happening and I could see people in the crowd even more eager to dance. I decided we should write our own music to reflect that.”Armed with Roland’s first synthesiser, the SH-1000, 22-year-old Kuljit began recording demos on reel-to-reel tape that he would share with his mother at the kitchen table every evening. She wrote her own lyrics to the beats, finding an aptitude for penning yearning romance narratives. Soon Kuljit had enough material for the record. He booked a local studio, which happened to be run by Roxy Music’s bass player Rik Kenton and, along with his mother, 11-year-old brother Ambi on the drum machine and bass-playing friend Trevor Michael Georges, they laid down the tracks. “It was a joy to record as everything just clicked,” Kuljit says. “I always treated my mother’s voice as an instrument, like a flute or keyboard, so the sound of the record was really cohesive while also feeling totally new. We thought people would love it.”View image in fullscreenMohinder's own handwritten lyrics of her song Disco Wich Aaa, the title track of Punjabi Disco.Photograph: Courtesy of Kuljit BhamraYet, months after being told by executives at EMI India that the record would be released, the family stumbled upon a cassette with the title Punjabi Disco being sold in a Southall record shop, featuring a different singer and new songs. Kuljit saw it as a direct theft of their idea. “We were devastated,” he says. “We managed to argue our case and got a distribution deal but they only pressed 500 copies that we barely saw. I actually ended up biking copies of the few records they gave us to local cornershops to see if they might shift some there!”It wasn’t until Kuljit was approached by Mani that he went looking for the master tapes again and even discovered a new unreleased track, the rollicking disco-funk number Dohai Ni Dohai, which wouldn’t fit on to the original 12-inch pressing. “It was all made to get people dancing and the tragedy is that we never got to play it live after it was recorded,” Kuljit says. “Since it’s now been remastered and remixed, a new generation can finally enjoy it for its original purpose, while my mum can get her dues for being such a radical.”“It’s incredibly brave for first- and second-generation migrants to make an album like this that breaks all conventions, especially in the context of the era’s racism and sexism,” Mani adds. “Mohinder is very traditional in many ways and an expert Punjabi folk singer but she’s also an advocate for women’s rights – she doesn’t fit into an easy category and neither does her music.”Now 89, Mohinder is no longer performing but she is happy to hear herself once more. “I was young and my voice sounds good,” she laughs. “I’m proud of what my boys achieved and I hope people can enjoy and move to this music again.”Punjabi Disco is out on31 OctoberonNaya Beat Records.Explore more on these topicsMusicDance musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Knight has never made a better show than thisJack SealeThu 25 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 11.56 EDTShareYou may judge a show’s success by the number of imitators that follow: to see how much TV commissioners envied the popularity ofSlow Horses, look at the recent uptick in wry dramas about spies and/or shambling outcasts who work in a grotty basement but get the job done. Another show with that status is Peaky Blinders, writerSteven Knight’s swaggering epic about a (real) Birmingham crime gang between the wars.What’s unusual about the post-Blinders shows is that the author of the towering original has tended to write the pretenders to the throne himself: Knight sought to develop the formula earlier this year withA Thousand Blows, a series about a different historical crime gang, and with his new Netflix show House of Guinness, he seems to be mining the same seam. The family here is not a crime family: we are in Dublin in 1868, where Guinness is so ubiquitous that the unimaginably wealthy Guinness family run the city. But managing the factory that dominates the landscape is the fearsome Sean Rafferty (James Norton), an arch schemer whose currency is violence. He introduces himself by issuing a rallying call to the company workers, exhorting them to crush an anti-Guinness street protest then leading the way himself, gleefully swinging a hunk of hard factory iron.Later on in episode one, when the Guinness cooperage is torched by malcontents, Rafferty walks into the blaze, impervious in a swishing long coat and with a clattering 21st-century rock soundtrack behind him, to sort it out. He is the steaming punk in a world where corruption outstrips the rule of law, where punches land with a merciless crunch, where chains clank, hessian chafes and pressure gauges are forever twitching into the red. The domineering patriarch of the Guinness dynasty, Benjamin, has just died, and none of his four adult children seem equipped to take over. This could be Rafferty’s moment.Watch more than one episode of House of Guinness, however, and a realisation soon arrives: Rafferty may be an unstoppable force, but our focus slowly centres on the Guinness kids. This isn’tPeaky Blinders, the Irish prequel. It’s 19th-century Dublin’s answer to Succession. The big fella has died before it starts, but we still have three sons and a daughter whose lives have been ruined by the extreme blessings Dad’s evil genius has given them. As in Succession, or The Crown at its best, the show is alive to the fact that tragedy plus privilege still equals tragedy; it makes us feel the pain of the pampered, or at least be fascinated by it, even if we’re a step removed from it.View image in fullscreenHis open secret could destroy him at any minute … Anthony Boyle as Arthur in House of Guinness.Photograph: Ben Blackall/NetflixAnd what characters the Guinness quartet are, confidently drawn and wisely performed, powering a fine drama about people with flaws they can’t overcome, delusions of qualities they don’t possess, and weaknesses their foes will inevitably exploit. Arthur (Anthony Boyle) seems selfish enough to realise his dream of adding political power to his inherited financial might, but his superiority complex has made him impetuous and too quick to anger, and he is cursed by the times into which he has been born: his homosexuality is an open secret that could destroy him at any minute. A better bet for the business, then, might be little bro Edward (Louis Partridge), but his pragmatism masks an idealism that might not survive contact with the cold realities of commercialism.View image in fullscreenEmily Fairn in a remarkably Guinness-like cloak as Anne.Photograph: NetflixObserving the filial power struggle is sister Anne, who is woefully overlooked by the family and slightly underserved by the drama, but who still provides House of Guinness with additional smarts and heart, thanks to a terrific turn by Emily Fairn, following up an unforgettable debut as lost soul Casey inThe Responder. Then there is Benjamin Jr (Fionn O’Shea), who has succumbed to gambling and booze when we meet him – the only brother who has stopped pretending to be something he is not.As the shouting, fighting and drawing-room tensions escalate, and as sex proves to be as much of a hindrance to clear thinking as money (the casting of Norton, pheromones fairly radiating from the screen, is a big help there), House of Guinness matures into a romp that you can hardly resist, especially when it makes such good use of its time and place. We are less than two decades on from the potato famine, and Ireland’s yearning for freedom is reaching breaking point: both are woven sensitively into the saga, making it an even richer study of the toxic rich – and making House of Guinness, for Steven Knight, a career peak.House of Guinness is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewPeaky BlindersIrelandreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s hard to look away from any show where evil grownups get their comeuppance …Lucy ManganThu 25 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 02.01 EDTShareOh happy day, when we were divided from America, as that insightful old veggie burger George Bernard Shaw had it, only by a common language. These days, there’s rather a lot more to contend with. One that may still be swimming under your radar – or perhaps just obscured by the massive orange flares going off every 30 seconds – is the multibillion dollar “troubled teen industry”. From sea to shining sea, the US is filled with privately run “therapeutic” institutions that promise to rehabilitate “difficult” teenagers and turn them into civilised members of society. They are often transported there by “teen escort services”, who come for the unsuspecting adolescents in the middle of the night and remove them against their – though not their parents’ – will from the family home. “But that’s tantamount to kidnap!” you may think, in your silly British way. And that is why they fought to become independent of us and our lily-livers all those years ago.That is the background against which Mae Martin, standup comedian and writer of the immaculate comedy,Feel Good, has created the eight part mystery drama Wayward. (Martin is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. Their character in Wayward, a cop called Alex Dempsey, is a trans man. Martin’s mesmeric presence, comic timing and occasional air of possession by a baffled duckling endure).View image in fullscreenHas the air of being possessed by a baffled duckling … Mae Martin as Alex Dempsey in Wayward.Photograph: Michael Gibson/NetflixWayward is set in 2003 – partly, I suspect, to avoid the many problems the setup would face if these teens had access to smartphones, and partly to add to the excellently eerie vibe. There is nothing stranger than the recent past. Alex and his pregnant wife, Laura (Sarah Gadon), move to Tall Pines, Vermont – the latter’s bucolic home town – for a fresh start, after the former was involved in a bad shooting on the job. I don’t know how often it works out in real life for Americans who return to their bucolic home towns for a fresh start, but in television the percentage must be in the low single figures. So it proves for our sweet young couple.The town is host to the Tall Pines Academy, a centre run by the deeply odd, bordering on sinister, Evelyn Wade, utterly magnificently played byToni Collette, who manages to combine terrifying understatement with a Grand Guignol air that is absolutely compelling. She gives a coherence to the whole show that the writing does not entirely earn. But to believe in Evelyn is to believe in everything, and you have to believe in Evelyn. It’s like your resistance has been kidnapped.When Alex becomes involved with the fate of a runaway from the academy, his investigations into the boy, as well as the townsfolk’s unquestioning acceptance of the academy’s power, fuel darker and darker suspicions. Theses suspicions are compounded by the discovery that Laura was once a pupil/inmate at the academy and that Evelyn seems to still exert an unwholesome amount of influence over her.A concurrent plotline follows two teenage best friends from Toronto – the bereaved, drug-dabbling Leila (Alyvia Alyn Lind) and the more stable Abbie (Sydney Topliffe), whose main form of rebellion seems to be being friends with Leila. It is enough for her strict parents to have her kidnapped/taken away to the academy. Leila mounts a rescue attempt and is duly incarcerated there too. The place is full of cultish argot, rituals and group counselling classes that resemble struggle sessions more than any kind of healing practice. Physical and psychological abuse is overt and hints of sexual abuse are everywhere. The hold Evelyn has over her charges – and the staff, all recruited from earlier student cohorts – borders on the unholy. Though, ultimately, Wayward is asking us to consider the power of malevolent manipulation on vulnerable people rather than seeking to delve into the occult.Wayward is stylish and hugely watchable – it’s hard for one’s inner adolescent to look away from a punchy eight-parter where so many comeuppances are delivered to horrible grownups. But it tries to do so many things that it doesn’t quite succeed in any. You can feel it trying to interrogate the troubled teen industry, the parents that use it and the profiteers that run it. It also tries to explore the nature of modern youth and the new uncharted areas that kids are required to navigate alone. Plus, it’s trying to deliver a satisfying mystery plot, infuse it with the comedy that comes as naturally to Martin as breathing and put in some emotional payoffs to stop the whole thing becoming a cartoon version of Twin Peaks. Less could have been more, but the warmth and intelligence that Martin as an actor and writer (along with others, in the latter case) brings to the endeavour means it cannot help but endear itself to the viewer. Three stars become four, and no regrets.Wayward is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewToni CollettereviewsShareReuse this content"

Sane Inside Insanity goes deep into the early days of Rocky, upstairs at the Royal Court theatre, and goes on to detail the evolution of the cult, and how the film came to be, including various pieces of sharp practice and incompetent dealing on the parts of a few different people.Constructed from recordings of stage shows, old photographs, archival footage and talking heads, this unofficial documentary is competing with an official version produced by O’Brien’s son (Strange Journey: The Story of Rocky Horror), with both being released to celebratethe film adaptation’s 50th anniversary. As well as cast members like Little Nell and Barry Bostwick, the talking heads here include original-stage-version actors, fans, and producers, one of whom really nails why Rocky is such a delight: “Rocky was an accident. You can’t try to have an accident.” This gets to the heart of why this particular phenomenon is special and why so many imitators and projects conceived with the intention of being “cult entertainment” are doomed to fail –including the 2016 reboot/remakefor US TV, which is dissected with all the disdain it deserves.This is a scrappy, entertaining and detailed look at a piece of work whose success seems inexplicable to anyone who hasn’t fallen under its spell. To its credit, this doc gets into that, too – the way that Rocky shouldn’t work, really, with one talking head even conceding, of the film: “It’s a shitty fucking movie.” But for all its clear-eyed analysis, Andreas Zerr’s film is ultimately a celebration of the mind flips, no-good kids and pelvic thrusts that really drive you insane, made for fans, by a fan.Sane Inside Insanity: The Phenomenon of Rocky Horror is on digital platforms from 25 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsRocky Horror ShowreviewsShareReuse this content"

But huge characters join in to tell a wild, droll tale with the ultimate endingHannah J DaviesThu 25 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 05.02 EDTShareDressed in a khaki jumpsuit, his face red in a way that suggests recent tears, Owen Hanson describes his life behind bars. On his first day in prison, another inmate gave him a weapon – a “bonecrusher” – and told him to keep it on him at all times. “I’m some fucking surfer kid from Redondo Beach and you’re telling me I have to go to war?!” Hanson says, shakily.This is one of many moments in the first episode of Cocaine Quarterback that makes me deeply sceptical. The three-part docuseries – released under the Prime Video Sports umbrella – tells the story of a college footballer from California turned drug kingpin, but part one feels more like The Owen Hanson Story, as presented by Owen Hanson. Central to the tale is his father’s alcoholism, his parents’ divorce, and his first, faltering forays into pill-smuggling, when he rolled up a bag of steroids in Tijuana and stuffed it down the back of his underwear (“not inside the hole,” he elucidates, “[but] in the crack”). The steroids were for his own use. But soon he would be hawking them to his fellow footballers at the University of Southern California, a place conjured up here via exuberant archive footage of players flinging themselves through the air and marching bands. Before long, Hanson was dealing harder drugs – and working with one of the world’s most dangerous organised crime groups, Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel. He had, says Alex Cody Foster – the co-author of his memoir – “the hustle mindset”. More than once it is said that he could have been the CEO of a Fortune 500 company had he put his mind to it.View image in fullscreen‘No more Uggs,mijo’ …Cocaine Quarterback.Photograph: Courtesy of PrimeGladly, Cocaine Quarterback turns out to be more than just an elegy to Hanson’s business acumen. It shares much of its tonal DNA with McMillions, the wry documentary about the McDonald’s Monopoly fraud, also produced by Mark Wahlberg’s Unrealistic Ideas (director Jody McVeigh-Schultz was an editor on that series). As McMillions leaned on larger-than-life characters to tell its tale, so too does Cocaine Quarterback, and the result often feels more mockumentary than documentary. The visuals, too, are frequently droll: reconstructions show dishwashers loaded with cash rather than plates, and phone screens feature pithy messages from the cartel to Hanson. When he gets himself into a pickle in Australia and attempts to send gold bullion back to the US inside furry boots, a text pops up from his bosses: “No more Uggs,mijo.” Elsewhere, MTV Cribs-style images flash up when we learn about the time Hanson gutted his family home (it was, he says, “a dump”), transforming it into a greige mansion complete with $2,000 bottles of tequila on every surface.The main narrative driver here is Hanson’s enduring beef with a professional gambler named Robin Hood 702, who loses the money Hanson says he was supposed to be laundering for him on behalf of the cartel. Robin Hood, AKA Robert Cipriani, denies that this was ever the deal. In any case, he did take $2.5m to a casino, and left with nothing – inadvertently tipping off police and kickstarting a feud with Hanson, who describes him, charmingly, as a “cockroach”, a “maggot” and a “degenerate”. To say that Cipriani comes across as smug and flippant would be an understatement, but Hanson knew how to rile him up. Cue an eccentric private investigator who not only desecrated Cipriani’s mother’s grave, but also Photoshopped a mask-wearing, shovel-holding Hanson into a picture of said grave for extra menace.If Hanson is initially imbued with far too much glamour, the scuzzier reality of his life of crime slowly unfurls over the three episodes. As Nick Mullaly of the New South Wales police says, Hanson was “very ruthless”. Kate McClymont from the Sydney Morning Herald prefers the term “stupid idiot” when it comes to him and his money-laundering associates, who are found to have been brazenly discussing their illegal activities on the phone, not knowing that law enforcement were listening in. After lying in a police interview, Andrew McManus – a music promoter who brought the likes of Lenny Kravitz and Fleetwood Mac to Australia – declared himself “a fucking Academy Award winner!”The end result is a series that’s more entertaining than it has any right to be, and one that lurches firmly back into cautionary tale territory as we learn more about how Hanson was eventually caught (he was sentenced to 21 years in prison in 2017). Really, the whole thing has a lot less to do with sport than it initially claims to; while many of Hanson’s friends ended up in the NFL, he was nowhere near going pro. But as an entry point to a zany true crime tale, it really is a touchdown.Cocaine Quarterback is on Prime Video now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Emilia del Valle’s surname comes from her Chilean father, an aristocrat who seduced her mother when she was a novice nun and left before their child was born. Emilia owes her fiercely independent spirit to her liberal-minded stepfather Francisco Claro, whom she calls Papo, who encourages his stepdaughter to think for herself.In her late teens, Emilia writes a series of successful pulp fiction novels under the male pen name Brandon J Price. By the age of 23, she is a columnist at San Francisco’s Daily Examiner; still writing as a man, she longs to do more serious work. Eventually, she is commissioned to travel to Chile, where the father she has never met lives, to cover the war. She is accompanied by a seasoned war reporter, Eric Whelan, with whom she begins a relationship, though the pair part company as they each go in search of their own stories.Told from Emilia’s perspective, the novel is narrated by the Dominican actor Coral Peña, her reading underscoring our heroine’s single-mindedness in overcoming the strictures imposed on 19th-century women. That the romantic subplot doesn’t follow the usual trajectory is shown in the appearance of another narrator, Johnathan McClain, who reads a single chapter written from the perspective of Whelan.

This rewarding collection features his larger-scale chamber worksAndrew ClementsThu 25 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 12.03 EDTShareThe sleeve notes for this ambitiously extensive collection ofLouis Spohr’slarger-scale string chamber music hails him as: “The most significant German composer between Beethoven and Schumann.” Two hundred years on, that seems a dubious claim – historically, Weber surely proved more influential – but there’s no doubt that in his lifetime, as a violin virtuoso and conductor as well as a composer, Spohr (1784-1859) was a celebrated figure across Europe. As a composer, he was certainly prodigious; he wrote in virtually every genre, and alongside his 11 operas, nine symphonies and about 30 concertos, of which at least 19 are for violin, there were copious songs and chamber music, including 34 string quartets.View image in fullscreenWDR SO Cologne: The Romantic Room, Chamber Works by Spohr.Photograph: PentatoneThe selection made by the ensemble of string players from the Cologne orchestra does not include any of those quartets, but concentrates on works requiring larger forces. Two of the six discs are taken up with Spohr’s four double string quartets, three more with six of his seven string quintets (scored for the Mozartean lineup with two violas); the seventh quintet is included on the final disc, alongside a string sextet, and a potpourri on themes of Mozart.This is a formidable amount of music, all of it very decently played and almost all of it virtually entirely unknown these days. Spohr, who is often regarded as a transitional figure between the classical and Romantic eras, took Mozart as his stylistic starting point, though in the double string quartets especially there are moments that seem closer to Beethoven. And by the time he composed his final string quintets in the 1840s, composers such as Mendelssohn and Schumann had already taken music into the new Romantic world. But there’s no doubt that this set has its own rewards, and for the musically curious, offers plenty to discover.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

He muttered ominous things about the Venice wobble and the Venice curse. I went anyway and I have to say he had a point. It was autumn and there was something deeply uncanny about the city: fog-bound canals, labyrinthine alleyways, a general sense of decay. If my minibreak had belonged to a literary genre, it wouldn’t have been romance so much as cosmic horror.Fiction, of course, should have prepared me. Couples have been coming unstuck in Venice since Othello and Desdemona. There are the Baxters in Daphne du Maurier’s short story Don’t Look Now, the basis for Nicolas Roeg’s unforgettably creepy film; Mary and Colin in The Comfort of Strangers by Ian McEwan – the city’s not named in the novel, but it’s clearly the setting. And while the love affair in Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice exists only in Von Aschenbach’s mind, the city is still his undoing. To Von Aschenbach and the others, we can now add the name of the unfortunate Evelyn Dolman, the protagonist ofJohn Banville’s new novel, Venetian Vespers. Evelyn is a hack writer from England who has recently married an American heiress called Laura Rensselaer. Their plans to honeymoon in Venice have been delayed by the unexpected death of Laura’s father, the industrialist T Willard Rensselaer. In the wintry early months of 1900, they finally arrive and take up residence in the sinister Palazzo Dioscuri, a stone’s throw from St Mark’s. Dioscuri means the Twins – Castor and Pollux – and it will be a pair of twins who set in motion Evelyn’s inexorable but unforeseeable downfall.From the outset, Evelyn, who narrates the novel, warns us to expect something disquieting. Part of the initial fun is trying to figure out where we are heading. There are elements of Henry James in the story’s setup – the period, the social background of its principal characters – but Banville has set his course for something darker. The bloody history of the Palazzo Dioscuri and its denizens – patrician owner, taciturn servant, saucy serving wench – suggest we’re in gothic territory, and the book is constantly teasing us with other possibilities. A cameo of a hooded woman in St Mark’s nods towards Du Maurier; a recent plague recalls Von Aschenbach. There are surreal twists, hints of madness and the supernatural; unsettling sexual encounters.There are elements of Henry James in the story’s setup, but Banville has set his course for something darkerOver an illustrious literary career, Banville has been compared to James, Proust and Beckett. The received wisdom about his novels is that he’s a master of sentences, mood and allusion, but not much interested in plot. That’s not the case here. Evelyn Dolman resembles some of Banville’s other narrators in his unreliability and his love of winding syntax, but the story he tells is expertly put together. The events of the novel are compressed into a matter of days. Each vividly evoked moment leads on to the next with a deepening sense of intrigue. While the prose is dense, the action behind it is so clearly conceived that you feel as though you’re watching it unfold before you. The geography of the city, the layout of the Palazzo Dioscuri, the passing of time – it’s all conveyed with a cinematic intensity.Banville milks the brooding atmosphere of the wintry city and while telling us explicitly that we’re headed towards a troubling denouement, he keeps us uncertain about what form it will ultimately take. I didn’t guess the ending – and I won’t spoil it for you – but it comes together very satisfyingly.I mentioned that, like other Banville narrators, Evelyn is not only tricky, he has an orotund prose style. Not for him the simple declarative sentence; he likes a hypotactic Jamesian pile-up of adjectives and adverbs, with careful qualifications and a sprinkling of abstract nouns. To an extent, I get that Evelyn’s style is his character: splenetic, self-regarding, full of complaint. His monologue, packed with repetition and the formulations of a hack writer, is also a disguise that conceals him from us and from himself. It’s clear also that we’re not meant to like him. But in another way, I don’t get it at all.As I grow older, I watch the reading of so-called literary novels becoming a niche interest. The reasons for this are many and complicated, but I’m constantly looking for books that will win back wavering or lapsed readers, and so I find myself frustrated by this novel’s aesthetic choices. When you have a story and a setting this strong and resonant, it feels perverse to fence it off from an audience with prose that is deliberately prolix and redundant. At times, the pastiche is skilful and contributes to the sense of the period, but at others you get this: “However, this was one of the instances, rare in that time of intense upset and bereavement, that I put my foot down, with a firmness that came as a surprise, not to say a shock, to all concerned in the matter, including, I suspect, myself.”I would put that sentence out of its misery after “down”. It’s far from a solitary example. Evelyn’s periphrasis and repetitions verge on the obsessive: “I would never master the geography of this impossible city, which seemed to have been designed with great and subtle care specifically to deceive and distress innocent wayfarers such as myself.” The enhancements ofgreatandsubtle,deceiveanddistressare grating and legalistic. I guess Evelyn is used to being paid by the word, but it makes him an exhausting companion. He also writes about everything with a neurotic intensity. “My brain seemed as a purblind, underground creature clawing its way clumsily upwards towards the light.” The pomposity of this contributes to a strong sense that Banville regards his hero with mockery and indifference. It’s hard, therefore, for the reader to care about him.As it stands, Venetian Vespers is a memorable and disturbing read; the frustration I felt is that, written with more economy, it could have been a gasp-inducing stiletto of a book.Venetian Vespers by John Banville is published by Faber.

Throughout the development of FC 26, EAmet with a panel of influencers and community representativesto directly drive design decisions. The result is a football experience split into two. Offline it’s a sim, where ratings and fatigue come to the fore. Online, it’s purely an esport – fast, and furious, with shots and goals prioritised over William Saliba-calibre defending.Offline, it’s a refreshing call. In career mode, for instance, matches are as sedately paced as they’ve been from any FC or Fifa in recent memory. Tactics matter. Stats differentials such as ball control, and vision, matter. Even weather effects such as wind and the state of the pitch matter, with the ball sticking and/or skidding on wet turf. Patient build-up play is welcomed, and it’s possible to unpick a defence without 17 flicks of the skill stick. There’s a cerebral feel long absent from this series.View image in fullscreenOn target … EA Sports FC 26.Photograph: Electronic ArtsIndeed, after some stagnant years, manager mode feels like the purists’ way to play. The new career carousel means results affect job stability, with bosses being sacked or poached by other clubs. For the first time, that leads to CPU-controlled teams adopting their incoming gaffer’s tactics, lending welcome variety. Added to that are random events such as training injuries, or one-off headaches – in my West Ham career, Kyle Walker-Peters and El Hadji Malick Diouf were ruled out of an away game at Arsenal due to “dodgy food”. Legacy issues, such as soulless cut-scenes, remain, but it’s a worthy alternative to the always controversial Ultimate Team.Meanwhile, Ultimate Team – or FUT – has long been criticised as little more than a gambling mode, where the people who pay most to open the game’s Panini-like packs of random players, will almost always come out on top. This time, there has been a raft of fan-pleasing changes, such as levelling up goalkeepers using the Evolution mechanic, and the return of all-silver tournaments (online competitions that only let you use silver-ranked players). It’s possible to build a strong side without spending a penny: after one week, my squad already boasts Toni Kroos, Lionel Messi and Rúben Dias. However, those cash-dropping temptations of random packs remain, and will continue to be the series’ most divisive feature.Gameplay within Ultimate Team adopts those “competitive” online settings, and aligns with longstanding community feedback. Prepare for basketball-style goal-fests full of tricks and shots on target. New goalkeeper AI and animations help keep the score down, but it’s still incredibly tough to defend. The lack of fatigue is especially challenging. In previous editions, keeping a fast attacker quiet for 70 minutes would mean he or she being subbed, rewarding your stellar defensive skills. Now they can run at maximum speed deep into injury time, nullifying strong backline play. Again, this is what the player base wanted, but it dilutes any sense of realism.This frantic gameplay is more effective and enjoyable in returning five-a-side mode Rush. Myriad quality of life improvements make this as addictive as its distant predecessor, Fifa Street. Teething problems such as players rubber-banding their controller to ostensibly leave you a teammate short are addressed. Keepers make smart saves, and the default perspective intelligently tracks your player while still maintaining full view of the pitch. Here the lack of defensive capabilities are less egregious, and at present it’s the most enjoyable way to experience FUT.FC 26 remains a strong package, despite its deliberate choice to abandon authenticity in the online space. There are still numerous gamers out there who crave realism, even in competitive matches. Yet while this represents a step backwards for real football, it’s unquestionably a stride forwards in the field of fan service. This is not the sim Pro Evo purists have longed for – but as an esports collaborative between the developer and its community, Fifa’s third follow-up achieves the majority of its aims.EA Sports FC 26 is released on 26 September,Explore more on these topicsGamesSports gamesPlayStation 5Xbox OneXbox series S/XNintendo Switch 2Nintendo SwitchreviewsShareReuse this content"

Even the sun is suffocated by the volatile energy of supercell thunderstorms, harbingers of chaos capable of discharging hailstones the size of grapefruits and expanding to 80km wide and 20,000 metres high. PhotographerCamille Seamanbecame a storm chaser in 2008 and spent several years capturing these titanic tempests on camera. “Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor,” Trinculo warned in The Tempest. Seaman’s spectacular images are certainly Shakespearean in their sublime magnitude, an awesome warning that kicks off the Prix Pictet’s 2025 show.Seaman’s series, The Big Cloud, interprets the theme – storm – literally, but others among the 12 shortlisted artists take it in different directions, from nuclear bombsites to copulating plankton. Several projects focus on American stories, shifting attention to the decisive role global powers play in the current geopolitical crisis and the disastrous consequences for landscapes and people.Alfredo Jaar’s elegy to the dying Great Salt Lake in Utah takes you on a poetic journey to the vanishing environment, its destruction accelerated by excessive water extraction, polluting the surrounding air, destroying habitats and wreaking havoc on the local economy.Hannah Modigh’s Hurricane Seasonis an attempt to trace the psychological impact of the threat of annual hurricanes on communities in southern Louisiana, finding parallels between the weather conditions and the state’s long history of poverty, violence and racism.View image in fullscreenPoetic journey … Alfredo Jaar’s The End.Photograph: Alfredo JarrWith the tension of a slasher film, Modigh’s sultry scenes follow dislocated figures in porches, trailers – makeshift shelters for a temporary existence, lived subject to nature’s whims. Three shirtless, tattooed men, oblivious to the camera, plot around a table in a squalid cabin late at night. A Ku Klux Klan figure is painted on the wall. In another image, a woman sits on a porch piled with rubbish and surrounded by a swarm of cats, as she stares back at us with a dead-eyed, threatening look. Is this the calm before the storm? Human hate is as terrifying and unpredictable as nature’s wrath.The cause and effect of the US’s macho culture is also woven into the work ofBalazs Gardi, who found himself on the Capitol on 6 January 2021, in the eye of a storm that would shake long-held principles of American democracy. Captioned by the minute in which they were taken, these pictures have a harried, breathless pace, as Gardi navigated teargas, flag-waving Maga insurrectionists and armoured riot police, the blunt sounds of clashing helmets and batons mirrored in metal bars that barricade the photographs on the wall. Gardi deftly uses black-and-white to signal that macho culture and fear-mongering by demagogic politicians can unleash uncontrollable forces anytime, anywhere.An undulating structure, cascading like a wave through the centre of the room, holdsRoberto Huarcaya’s 30-metre work. Huarcaya had been setting up a roll of photosensitive paper under a fallen palm tree in the rainforest when a storm broke. His work was struck by lightning. The piece bears traces of what Huarcaya planned to capture, angrily slashed and torn by nature’s savagery into an enigmatic work of abstraction that rivals aDansaekhwapainting. Huarcaya leaves us to contemplate what else might be possible if we let go of our hubristic attachment to human creativity and let nature intervene.View image in fullscreenGrandiose … Tom Fecht’s Lucifer’s Vortex.Photograph: Tom Fecht/Courtesy Tom Fecht and LaffanourTom Fecht’s grandiose, painterly pictures propose a similar relinquishing to nature’s majesty. The enormous scale of Fecht’s prints utterly transforms the work from something that could look AI-generated to dynamic vortexes with rippling densities of colour, an exercise in why photographs need to be shown in high-quality exhibitions like this. Fecht – a former engineer who has taught scientific imaging – photographed the rare phenomenon of cold-water plankton bioluminescence in the Atlantic Ocean. Using a special rig, Fecht took pictures 30 metres above the swirling stormy sea, battling high winds to capture these plankton, endangered by the ocean’s rising temperatures – as they glow while reproducing under a full moon, emitting an electrical discharge, almost invisible to the naked eye.Finally,Belal Khaled’s Hands Tell Storieswere photographed in Gaza where the storm of war prevails. After the Palestinian photographer’s home was destroyed, he lived in a tent outside Nasser hospital. For 185 days he took pictures of hands – hands desperately reaching for food and water, bandages where hands should be, the lifeless hands of the deceased. Destinies in our hands. No words may be found for these pictures, only actions.Prix Prictet: Storm opens at V&A South Kensington, London, 26 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsArt and designPhotographyNatural disastersClimate crisisreviewsShareReuse this content"

With conductor, director, and both leads all making their ENO debuts, the feel is fresh and fun in a production set in a contemporary world but with moments of magic – plus white mice, a pumpkin, a ghost and even a glass slipper, even if Rossini’s version of the story involves matching bracelets.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAt the time of its premiere in Rome in 1817, you were not allowed to show bare ankles on stageView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenRossini’s version has matching bracelets instead of a glass slipper (but the latter does make an appearance in this production)Conductor Yi-Chen Lin explains: “At the time of its premiere in Rome in 1817, you were not allowed to show bare ankles on stage.” So, to avoid falling foul of the censors, the glass slipper was swapped for matching bracelets. Nor is there a fairy godmother – instead there’s Alidoro, the Prince’s tutor; while Don Magnifico, Cinderella’s stepfather, is the selfish and neglectful parent who mistreats his stepdaughter. Her late mother is present in the house, as a ghost, as well as children in playful mice costumes who oversee the action and mastermind the scene changes.View image in fullscreenDon Ramiro (Prince Charming) played by tenor Aaron Godfrey-Mayes, surrounded by the all-male chorus“Our production is set in the here and now – more or less. But we’ve created some story strands that allow period things or elements of mystery to come in. And there’s nods to the classic Cinderella story as well as the Disney version,” says director Julia Burbach.Our Cinderella has more dignity, as well as wit and resilienceView image in fullscreenStepsisters Clorinda (Isabelle Peters) and Tisbe (Grace Durham)And the stepsisters? Here they’re neither ugly nor even particularly wicked. “The way we play it, their dad is not only neglecting Cenerentola but them too,” says Burbach. “The sisters are needy. They want to be seen, to be validated. They are interested in superficial values and their personal taste is a little bitextra, but we can understand why that might have happened!” Cinderella, too, is not quite the passive and fragile heroine of most versions of the tale. “I like how in our production Julia gives her more dignity, as well as wit and resilience,” says Deepa Johnny, who sings Angelina (AKA Cinderella/Cenerentola) . “It’s a fresher take on the character.”View image in fullscreenSimon Bailey (facing), who plays the stepfather Don MagnificoAnd if you’re looking for men in drag – a feature of most versions of the ballet and every panto take on the fairytale – there’s that too, courtesy of the ENO chorus. “Rossini’s opera features a male-only chorus,” says Burbach. “Essentially what they sing is always about nagging the prince – ‘choose a princess, you’ve got to get married, time is passing, what are you doing?’” she says. “I thought, OK, so who would that be in a contemporary realistic context? We’ve got to find a solution for that. And so rather than having a bunch of men in suits we made them an ancestral line of royalty through the centuries, which makes sense of the text and of course allows us to have fun and bring in some period costumes, with the chorus dressed as kings – and queens – through the ages.”View image in fullscreen“I wanted the chorus to be important and have individual roles,” she adds. “The chorus are such a vital part of ENO’s story.”View image in fullscreenENO has endured a turbulent few years with major funding cuts, staff losses and the threat of closure of its London base. This season is a reduced one but features 12 productions and concerts across London and Greater Manchester; this is the first of five brand new productions. The last time ENO performed La Cenerentola was more than 40 years ago. As with all of their productions, this will be sung in English, in a new translation by Christopher Cowell. Many of the singers have sung the opera before in its original Italian: getting their heads – and mouths – around the English, with different vowel sounds and shapes, brings lots of challenges.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenYou have to sing Rossini with absolute effortlessness, as if it’s just flowing out of youView image in fullscreenDirector Julia BurbachView image in fullscreen“The translation is very clever,” says Simon Bailey, who sings Don Magnifico, the stepfather. “There’s lots of bits in the original Italian which are quite boring – and which Chris has improved!” For instance there’s one passage where I tell Cenerentola to go to her room and dust (“Va’ in camera, va’ in camera / La polvere a spazzar”) which is repeated several times. In our English version it’s become “Go fetch a broom and sweep the room / then mop the floor and paint the door / take out the bin and buy some gin / don’t stand there in a trance when I say dance, you dance. You’ve scores of household chores, don’t stand there in a trance.”View image in fullscreenIt’s the first time Yi-Chen Lin has conducted the work in English – as well as the first time she has worked in the UK. She’s from Vienna and first conducted Rossini in the composer’s birthplace, Pesaro. “I have a particular affinity for Rossini’s music,” she says. “I love its lightness and wit and the magic that happens every time you play his music – even if it’s just an overture in a concert – you will see the musicians and the audience smiling!”View image in fullscreenConductor Yi-Chen Lin“He is a genius of melodic invention,” she adds. “And there are moments of heart-stopping beauty.” Deepa Johnny loves the joy that “flows through the music”. “Rossini is my bread and butter,” she laughs. “He’s definitely one of the more technically challenging composers to sing – there has to be absolute precision in every single coloratura, you have to sing with complete effortlessness, as if it’s just flowing out of you.”View image in fullscreenShe finds it easy to connect with the vocalism and gymnastics, she says - “I used to train in Carnatic music, Indian classical singing, which has a lot of very fast-moving notes in ragas. So I feel like my throat is just used to moving very fast!”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAaron Godfrey-Mayes is the production’s Prince Charming. “It’s hard to live up to that title, but I’m doing my best!” Like Deepa, this is his debut at ENO. “I’m the first classical singer in my family, my brother’s actually a heavy metal musician so we couldn’t be more different! But they’re all delighted. And yes they’ll be coming here to watch me.”View image in fullscreenAs a director, says Burbach, there’s a dance you have to do, “between the very rigorous, meticulous planning that – you can’t imagine – goes on for months and months, and then in the moment you also need to be very flexible and adaptable, and always readjust and also allow for challenges to be overcome in different ways.“But this is the joy of live theatre and of being in a room and working with other people.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen“It’s an old story,” says Godfrey-Mayes, “but it’s really one about coming of age and so poignant and relatable.” “This kind of comedy is a wonderful thing,” says Burbach. “It’s a little bit of a satire and it’s a little bit over the top, but at the same time, its kernel is about the sort of problems that everybody has. How to deal with your insecurities, how to be comfortable in your skin. Basically, who am I and who do I want to be?”View image in fullscreenCinderella (La Cenerentola) is at the London Coliseum from Saturday to 14 OctoberExplore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayClassical musicOperaPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The play voices its intent in one of many meta-theatrical messages: “Tonight the Artful Dodgers have taken over the Olivier.”It is a bold, brash takeover with striking optics and energised performances. But just as the Artful Dodger seems like a misplaced reference within Euripidean tragedy, so the script often sounds off-key: unfocused, tonally untextured, its knockabout comedy smothering the emotional core of the play.View image in fullscreenA barbarian-like band … Clare Perkins (Vida) and the company of Bacchae at the National Theatre.Photograph: Marc BrennerTaleghani’s version brings to the fore the fear and suspicion of “foreignness” that creates a backdrop of anxiety in the original text. Dionysos (Ukweli Roach) is denied his godly status by King Pentheus (James McArdle) and is out for revenge, along with a chorus of entranced, outsider women who turn from hunted to hunters. They still live in the mountains here but are labelled “terrorists” by the king.This barbarian-like band, with a wardrobe reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean, is led by Vida (Clare Perkins) and each of the Bacchae are given names and histories. It is a good idea to render a generic female chorus distinct, but these women end up as cliched types, their biographies listed in single line summaries and salient features comically overplayed (one is a hard-nut Scot, another touchy-feely). Dionysos looks like a rapper in a gold hoodie who might have walked off theblingy West End set of Hercules. Poor, prophesying Tireseus (Simon Startin) is an old-school ancient stranded here, as if from a different play.View image in fullscreenPolish … James McArdle as Pentheus in Bacchae.Photograph: Marc BrennerCharacters rap in verse with sentences suffixed by “fam”, “cuz” and “bitches” in a mix of regional accents includingMLE. It seems inspired by the Jamie Lloyd school of storytelling (Taleghani starred in hisscintillating rap version of Cyrano). The raps burst with verve and a speed of ideas but lack the sharpness, poetry and emotional power to make the satire soar. The humour is hit-and-miss, characters broad and clownish. There is a pun in the name of the king’s attendant, Clitus (Sam Jenkins-Shaw), and Dionysos calls himself a “cunning linguist”. Pentheus is a shouty king who transforms after disguising himself in a dress, to infiltrate the Bacchae, and speaks of the burdens of masculinity before flipping back to tyrant.This is an accessible, entertaining, new-gen Bacchae but the joshing treatment is frustrating because so much in the original play chimes for our times: the new political puritanism, the unleashed rage of women too long suppressed, and the terrible effects of vengeance and war.The mother-son story between Pentheus and Agave (Sharon Small) never wields its emotional power. Perhaps the comedy undermines it, or maybe its dramatic focus is lost among so many plot-lines. What is the point of a character called Bubull (Reuben Johnson), who Dionysos meets while disguised and imprisoned by the king? He brings a backstory that simply hangs.Rubasingham’s direction is nevertheless as polished as ever and the show has pace, with thrilling lighting by Oliver Fenwick, creating filmic effects on Robert Jones’s set of marble Athenian steps and various moving parts. Kate Prince’s movement is a highlight and it is in the interludes of dance, along with DJ Walde’s musical compositions and Ben and Max Ringham’s sound design, that the show feels at its most elemental.So, while Rubasingham’s high-risk venture does not pay off as a whole, something new, different and daring has entered this old space, and that is no bad thing.At theOlivier theatre, National Theatre, London, until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsNational TheatreTheatreIndhu RubasinghamEuripidesreviewsShareReuse this content"

In between last week’s Lysistrata and next week’s Pygmalion is The Lodger, in a version combining Marie Belloc Lowndes’ 1913 novel with Alfred Hitchcock’s 1927 film and adding its own mysteries.Shadow puppetry is used throughout, evoking luridly illustrated penny dreadfuls and silent cinema, with homages to Hitchcock’s title cards. A killer known as the Avenger is at large: the victims are fair-haired women, their murders on Tuesdays. At oneLondonboarding house – No 13, natch – a lodger (Charlie Woodward) comes under suspicion, a detective (Gabriel Lumsden) gets to work and golden-curled Daisy (Keziah Hayes) is caught between them under the gaze of a maid (Rachel Bardwell).Actor-adapter-director Jack Robertson’s production, with compelling piano composition by Sarah Spencer, has exaggerated silent-film performances from actors in black and white costumes who mouth their words. Benedict Hastings and Sadie Pepperrell’s puppetry, often for action or crowd scenes, is accompanied by dialogue off stage. The two techniques dovetail well in what is primarily a comedy with some ingenious touches. Its only real chill is ironically a diversion from the master of suspense’s film.View image in fullscreenShadow play … The Lodger.Photograph: Miranda MazzarellaHitchcock’s lodger was played by Ivor Novello with haunted eyes and a wraith-like delicacy. The character, who here retains a giveaway surname he has in the novel, is played more benevolently by Woodward. The production satirises the age’s misogyny and lust for sensation yet jarringly never grounds the violence in any sense of reality. Unlike in the film, there is no threat in the lodger’s attempt to touch Daisy’s curls nor the detective’s possessiveness.Hitchcock pulled off dazzling shots like Novello frantically pacing in his room, his soles seen from below as if the ceiling was transparent. On a fringe budget, a more achievable parallel effect to the film is actors framing their own closeups or the wispy fog lit by Brett Kasza. In the design by Rebecca Ward, a candle and vintage lamp set the mood while Daisy’s cloche hat and Clara Bow lipstick evoke the era.

The blockbuster show has brought together a who’s who of 80s art, with major pieces from Andy Warhol,Jean-Michel Basquiat, Francesco Clemente, Jeff Koons, Keith Haring, Cindy Sherman, and many others.The goal for Downtown/Uptown is quite simple: to showcase the decade’s best art for new generations. “I was thinking about what art was pivotal to the moment,” said Brett Gorvy, show co-curator. “And also what over time has become pivotal. We’ve been lucky to be able to access the greatest paintings of so many of these artists.”According to Gorvy, the 80s were typified by the central role of celebrity in the art world, as well as being a decade marked by the Aids epidemic and the ascendancy of a hyper-capitalistic mentality. Gordon Gekko’s refrain “greed is good” rang out everywhere, especially the art world, as artists’ journeys from rags to riches were frequently marked by frenzy and extravagance.View image in fullscreenAndy Warhol - Reel Basquiat (1984)Photograph: Courtesy Lonian Gallery II, LLC / Oriol Tarridas“Artists are literally taking things out of dumpsters and creating art, so it seemed like the opposite of Wall Street,” said Gorvy. “But what happens to many of these artists is that money came very quickly. Ultimately there were drugs and excess.”The show taps legendary art dealer Mary Boone, herself a major figure in the 80s art world, to co-curate, offering an unparalleled expertise into the minds of the artists – one piece by Basquiat demonstrates Boone’s intimate role, a punching bag onto which he has written her name in block letters below his iconic crown. “It’s been amazing working with Mary Boone, who was the queen of Soho,” Gorvy said. “She has been this incredible collaborator – ultimately her connections with the artists allowed me to piggyback onto that and have a show that is both historical and that feels very relevant.”Downtown/Uptown opens with a showcase of Warhol’s silkscreen portraits, including ones of show luminaries Clemente, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Basquiat, as well as a very fitting one of dollar signs. “Warhol is a very important figure in the show, because he’s the lynchpin for all this activity,” Gorvy said. “He was a mentor, and his Factory was a place where you could congregate as an artist. There’s the notion that these are young kids basically being presented by Warhol as the superstars. He essentially created the celebrity aspect.”Beyond the all-encompassing effects of money and celebrity, the Aids epidemic also permeated the 80s art world – this aspect of Downtown/Uptown comes into focus in Ross Bleckner’s 27764, which represents a tally of those lost to the disease at the time the work was created in 1987. Done in a muddy off-white and consisting of innumerable strokes, the work is somber and deeply affecting – it’s a jumping off point for the deeper, mournful looks into HIV that Bleckner would make throughout the 90s. “It looks almost like legions of wounds on the canvas,” said Gorvy. “And then, right in the middle, is this number, in this like gothic script.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Lévy Gorvy DayanIn addition to being ravaged by Aids, the art world of the ‘80s was also ravaged by the plague of sexism, a fact that anonymous art collective the Guerrilla Girls managed to declare with an inventiveness and sarcasm that turned heads. Downtown/Uptown pays the collective due respect by showing some of their wittiest posters One such poster notes how the Guggenheim, Met, MoMA, and Whitney collectively featured just a single female artist in a one-person exhibition in 1984. Another wryly collects the “advantages of being a woman artist”, which include “not being stuck in a tenured teaching position” and “having the opportunity to choose between career and motherhood”.Gorvy acknowledged that Downtown/Uptown is very unbalanced when it comes to representing female artists, noting that this fact is sadly reflective of the realities of the ‘80s art world. “What’s striking about this show is the very strong male voice,” Gorvy said. “That notion of female artists finding their own sort of room to grow was not something that existed in the painting world of the 80s. The galleries of the time were not necessarily choosing female artists to promote. I think we have seven female artists in the show, which proportionately is probably pretty accurate.”View image in fullscreenCindy Sherman - Untitled #86 (1981)Photograph: Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth Courtesy Fischl Gornik Family FoundationAccording to Gorvy, the part of 80s artistry that most permeates the art world of today is the focus on figuration, which originally came back into style after a 70s dominated by a harsh and chilly minimalism. “The primacy of figuration today is something where the birth of that was in the 80s,” Gorvy said. “It was very much a reaction against minimalism and the cold mentality of artists not having a hand.”Downtown/Uptown also offers a fascinating opportunity to see how the major works of the 80s have sorted out. It would seem almost impossible to do an 80s show without paying due respect to Andres Serrano’s Piss Christ – which almost singlehandedly launched the culture wars over the arts that would last well into the 90s – yet when Gorvy namechecks those artists who have truly endured, the figure who tops his list is Basquiat.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Lévy Gorvy Dayan“With an artist like Basquiat, the authenticity of his work is of bringing the history of the street, of graffiti into the gallery,” Gorvy said. “It has a vitality that just touches you. There’s a reason why Basquiat is one of the top artist today commercially. He’s, well beyond anyone else in the show, the most expensive artist who we have in the exhibition, and he has a relevancy both in terms of younger artists and of the collectors.”Gorvy shared that while working on Downtown/Updown he frequently thought of his 20-year-old daughter, musing on what someone of her generation would want to know about the world of 80s art. “I was thinking of why the 80s should speak to this generation,” he said. He sees relevancy in the fashion and music of Gen Z, an opening that will hopefully make for curiosity. “We’re hopefully introducing these artists to a new audience, showing a full spectrum of artists so that young people can understand it in a very holistic way. In my mind it goes back to the notion of my daughter and asking, ‘How do you pass the baton of something that’s very special?’”Downtown/Uptown: New York in the Eighties is on display at Lévy Gorvy Dayan in New York until 13 DecemberExplore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsDesignAndy WarholJean-Michel BasquiatfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.”It accusesthe pledge circulated by Film Workers for Palestineand signed by stars including Emma Stone, Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman and Mark Ruffalo of being not “an act of conscience” but rather “a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art. To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective and a form of collective punishment.”Israel’s culture minister threatens national film awards after Palestinian story takes top prizeRead moreThe open letter makes the point that much of the Israeli film and TV industry are “often the loudest critics of government policy” – and frequently penalised by them for this. Last week, the winner of Israel’s own academy awards, The Sea – about a Palestinian boy who risks death to go to the beach in Tel Aviv – was submitted as the country’s entry to the Oscars. This led to the Israeli sports and culture minister vowing to cut funding from the awards.“When artists boycott fellow artists based solely on their country of origin, it is blatant discrimination and a betrayal of our role as storytellers,” added Messing in a statement.The initial pledge was published on 8 September and was signed by some 1,200 professionals – rising overnight to 4,000 and now standing at around 5,000 – who vowed not to work with Israeli film institutions they say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”.Israeli film industry calls boycott pledge ‘deeply troubling’Read more“As film-makers, actors, film industry workers and institutions, we recognise the power of cinema to shape perceptions,”the pledgereads. “In this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror.”In the immediate wake of the pledge, many in the Israeli industry expressed considerable disquiet about the boycott, with representatives from the country’s producing, directing, screenwriting and documentary divisions saying the move was misguided and would only “deepen the darkness”.The following week, studio Paramount also condemned the boycott in a statement which read: “Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace. The global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world. We need more engagement and communication – not less.”The full open letterTo our fellow artists and the global film community,We know the power of film. We know the power of story. That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.The pledge circulated under the banner of “Film Workers for Palestine” is not an act of conscience. It is a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art.To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective, and a form of collective punishment.Israel’s film industry includes groundbreaking, celebratory, and critical projects about Palestinians and Jews, which many of you have lauded and celebrated. Israel’s film community is restless, argumentative, and independent, where directors challenge ministers and many of the very festivals you target, consistentlyprogramdissent.Israel’s entertainment industry is a vibrant hub of collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian artists and creatives, who work together every single day to tell complex stories that entertain and inform both communities and the world. Israeli film institutions are not government entities. They are often the loudest critics of government policy.The pledge uses nebulous terms like“implicating” and“complicity.” Who will decide which Israeli film-makers and film institutions are“complicit”? A McCarthyist committee with blacklists? Or is“complicity” just a pretextto boycott all Israelis and Zionists– 95% of the world’s Jewish population–no matter what they create or believe?History warns us. Censorship has been used to silence film-makers before: Nazi Germany’s propaganda machine, Soviet censorship, and even Hollywood’s own blacklists. Every time it was dressed up as virtue. And every time it was oppression. Every time, its targets expanded.We know that many of you have good intentions and believe you are standing for peace. But your names are being weaponised and tied to lies and discrimination. This pledge erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimises falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame.If you want peace, call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages. Support film-makers who create dialogue across communities. Stand against Hamas.Let art speak the whole truth.We call on all our colleagues in the entertainment industry to reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace.Explore more on these topicsFilmIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Originally embarking on a career as an actor, he studied at the Actors Studio and became a contract player for Columbia Pictures, winning small roles in films such as Psych Out, Drive, He Said and The Last Movie, and TV shows such as Gidget and The Flying Nun.However he swiftly found his metier in the cinema counterculture of the time. Having been brought in to edit Easy Rider, Jaglom made his directorial debut in 1971 with the offbeat fable A Safe Place, starring Tuesday Weld andJack Nicholson, in which Welles appeared as a magician. Its 1976 follow-up, Tracks, starring Dennis Hopper as a Vietnam veteran, was one of the first American films to deal with the psychological fallout from the conflict. Sitting Ducks, released in 1980, was the closest Jaglom came to a mainstream success, with the comic road movie starring Zack Norman, Jaglom’s brother Michael Emil and Jaglom’s wife Patrice Townsend.Jaglom remained resolutely independent, financing his subsequent movies outside the Hollywood system and mining his own life and family for material. He became known for his actor-centred style, with plots often revolving around film-makers or performers airing their views on life and art. Regularly turning out films every two or three years over the next four decades, Jaglom was a fixture at international film festivals; high points include his 1995 film Last Summer in the Hamptons, in which an artistic family gather at the house they are shortly to sell; Deja Vu, a 1997 romance starring Stephen Dillane and Vanessa Redgrave; and Festival in Cannes, in 2001, about a film-makers trying to raise money at the celebrated French event.In his later work, Jaglom investigated his Jewish heritage, in films such as Just 45 Minutes from Broadway in 2012, which was based on his own play about Yiddish theatre, and his final film in 2017, Train to Zakopané, again based on his own play, about the relationship between a Russian Jewish businessman and a Polish nurse.Commercial success as a film-maker largely eluded Jaglom, but his friendship with Welles resulted in what remains his most widely known contribution to popular culture.Jaglom had taped a series of conversations with Wellesover lunch in the early 1980s, whichthe latter had planned to use for an autobiography; after Welles’s death in 1985 the tapes were in storage until their rediscovery and publication in 2013 as My Lunches With Orson.Jaglom was married twice, to Patrice Townsend (between 1979 and 1983)​ and Victoria Foyt (between 1991 and 2013), both of whom worked on a number of his films.Explore more on these topicsFilmOrson WellesDrama filmsComedy filmsJack NicholsonComedynewsShareReuse this content"

He remembers the movies that defined him – and working with ‘malevolent’ Michael Winner on The SentinelThu 25 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 11.13 EDTShareChris Sarandon is doing great, thanks. The veteran actor looks extremely well for his 83 years, over Zoom from his home office in Connecticut, exuding warmth and geniality. More than once in our conversation – filled with digressions, anecdotes and impersonations – he talks about how he doesn’t take anything for granted.“I occasionally do autograph conventions at Comic Cons,” he says. “And I was standing and talking to [fellow actor] Giancarlo Esposito. He said, ‘Well, how you doing?’ I said, ‘Giancarlo, look around you. There are thousands of people here just to see us and tell us they love us.’ If I said anything other than ‘I’m great’, just grab the nearest inanimate object and smack me with it.”Sarandon is long retired from acting, he says, but “I have a beautiful home, and I live in … not splendour, but I have a huge garden. That’s my profession now: podcaster and gardener.”More on the podcast later; Sarandon’s renown as an actor is built on a handful of classic movies, plus, as he’ll readily admit, a slew of middling to mediocre ones – not to mention a famous ex-wife who shares his surname. He had a golden run in the mid-80s and early 90s: teen horror Fright Night in 1985; fairytale classicThe Princess Bridein 1987; and killer doll horror Child’s Play in 1989; and in 1993, providing the speaking voice for Jack Skellington in Tim Burton’s animated favourite The Nightmare Before Christmas.View image in fullscreenChris Sarandon in Fright Night, 1985.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/AlamyThese are the roles that bring him, and his fans, to the autograph conventions. The shelves behind him are filled with memorabilia, some official, much of it fan-made. “A gentleman last weekend, in Houston, Texas, walked up to me with his teenage daughter and his wife, and they handed me a little diorama that they had been up most of the night making with all their favourite characters of mine,” he says. “There were tiny little posters of all the movies around the background. I’m thrilled. I’ll put it up right behind me.”Sarandon’s breakthrough was in a very different kind of classic movie, though: Sydney Lumet’s heist thrillerDog Day Afternoon, released 50 years ago in 1975 and based on a real-life incident just three years earlier – a Vietnam vet named John Wojtowicz (who becomes Sonny Wortzik in the movie, played by Al Pacino) held up a Brooklyn bank in what turned into a 14-hour hostage siege, which attracted a circus of police, media and onlookers – not all of them unsympathetic. Wojtowicz was married with two children but was reportedly raiding the bank to get money to pay for his lover’s gender reassignment.That was the magic of Dog Day Afternoon. We saw Sonny and Leon as human beingsSarandon played the fictionalised lover, Leon Shermer, who is brought by police to the siege scene from a psychiatric hospital (after a suicide attempt) to try to talk Pacino down. Shermer makes a memorable impression: clutching the hospital robe, hair all a mess, vulnerable yet needy, having an almost mundane lovers’ tiff with Pacino over the phone from across the street. The performance earned Sarandon a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.View image in fullscreenAs Leon Shermer in Dog Day Afternoon.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyDog Day Afternoon was one of the first Hollywood portrayals of gay and transgender characters, and to its credit, it treats their sexualities and gender identities as almost incidental. “That was the magic,” says Sarandon. “We saw these people as human beings, rather than: it’s about a gay couple, or a trans somebody. That certainly was what made it sensational for the public, but as far as we were concerned, what was important was where these two guys came from in their relationship.”Sarandon did his homework. For research, he cooked dinner one night in his apartment for four “drag queens – people who dress in drag and live their lives as women” who a gay actor friend had introduced him to. “We sat around on the floor with our spaghetti, talking. Essentially, I was interested in their backstories.” One of them told him (he adopts a southern accent): “I went to see King Kong, and I looked up atFay Wrayand said, ‘I want to beher,’” he recalls. Another, he realised, he wasn’t seeing as a male in drag but as “a very attractive young woman, to the point where I was flirting with her. That was a real lesson in the dynamic of both the physiological and the emotional dimension of what happens to somebody when, like my character Leon says in the movie, ‘I felt like I was a woman trapped in a man’s body.’”Ironically, for years after Dog Day Afternoon, Sarandon would get hit on by gay men at parties, he says. “But in a very aggressive way, because I was perceived as being ‘femme’. It didn’t disturb me in any way other than, ‘Oh my God, men can be pigs, regardless.’”View image in fullscreen‘I almost quit the business after The Sentinel’ … Sarandon.Photograph: Amir Hamja/The GuardianHe would never be cast in such a role today, he acknowledges, “and rightfully so. It should be somebody who’s more authentically aligned with the character, but I’m very proud of it.” He deplores the waytrans rights have become a political footballin the US. “I proudly wear my Pride bracelet,” he says, holding up his wrist to the camera, “because this, to me is … it’s such a travesty.”Becoming an actor seems to have been almost straightforward for Sarandon. He was born and grew up in a coal mining town in West Virginia, the son of Greek immigrants. His father came to the US in his 20s with nothing; his mother came from a Greek community in Florida. They ran a restaurant serving American cuisine, but spoke Greek at home. Later in life, he adds, his father left his mother and returned to Greece. She then moved to Los Angeles and became a nanny for Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner, then a companion to Rita Hayworth.Susan and I had unreasonable expectations about what life could be likeA college teacher persuaded him to try acting, and despite his initial reluctance, it became his ticket out of West Virginia – first, to the Catholic University of America, in Washington DC, where he did a master’s in theatre studies, and met his first wife, Susan. Then, via regional theatre, to New York, after a director suggested he audition for an agency. “I needed a scene partner, and so Susan read scenes with me, and we sang a couple of songs, I played the guitar, and they signed us both on the spot. Susan was still in college at this point.”They married in 1967. He was 24 and she was 20. By the time Dog Day Afternoon came out, though, they had already separated. “We were both really young,” he explains. “I think we had, as everyone does, unreasonable expectations about what life could be like, and nor did we haveanyidea of what would happen to both of us in terms of our careers and our personal lives.” The separation was not acrimonious, he says. “In fact, we used the same lawyer for our divorce, but her life and my life just diverged.”After they divorced in 1979, Susan had relationships with Louis Malle, David Bowie and Tim Robbins, among others. Chris married model Lisa Ann Cooper in 1980, and they had two daughters and a son before divorcing in 1989. He now lives with his third wife, actor Joanna Gleason, whom he married in 1994.View image in fullscreenIn Lipstick, 1976.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyAfter Dog Day Afternoon, Sarandon had options: he was young, good-looking and Oscar-nominated – prime romantic lead material, you might have thought. But he didn’t go down that route. “Those are always the most boring roles,always,” he says. He much prefers the bad guys. “They do nasty things, and the audience can go, ‘Ooh, I wish I could do that.’” He may have taken it too far with his next role: in the 1976 movie Lipstick, he played Mariel Hemingway’s music teacher, who one day rapes her older sister, played by Hemingway’s real-life model sister Margaux. Lipstick was not a success (it killed Margaux’s acting career but launched Mariel’s). Its protracted rape scene, in particular, was criticised for being exploitative and voyeuristic. “But it was meant to be uncomfortable,” Sarandon says.His next film fared little better: sub-Exorcist horror The Sentinel, directed by Michael Winner. “Michael Winner,” he groans. “Don’t get me started. I almost quit the business after that movie.” Sarandon found the British director to be unpleasant, even “malevolent” on set, he says. And again, the product was a flop. “That was one of those decisions when one thinks, ‘Oh, my name’s above the title and I’m being offered a ridiculous amount of money. And why not play a leading man?’ So what if, halfway through the movie, my face cracks and I’ve become a demon? Or whatever the plot was – I’ve repressed it at this point.”View image in fullscreenWith Christopher Guest in The Princess Bride, 1987.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/AlamyThe horror genre became his friend in the 80s, though: he found the right balance between bad guy and nice guy. In Fright Night, he is the vampire next door and every teenage boy’s nightmare: a sophisticated older man who seduces his girlfriend. But the movie is at heart a witty homage to classic horror cinema (writer director Tom Holland went on to cast him in Child’s Play). It was a similar story with The Princess Bride, a smart, affectionate spin on the classic fairytale fantasy, with Sarandon as the almost likable evil Prince Humperdinck.He has particularly fond memories of Bride: improvising puns with Christopher Guest; introducing his young daughters to the legendaryAndré the Giant(they ran away in terror. André said to him: “Either they run towards me or they run away from me”); director Rob Reiner and the cast singing doo-wop tunes on the set. Shooting in Sheffield, “the food was not great, so we did a lot of barbecuing. We would go into Rob’s room and sit around and play games, eat burgers and have a great time.”View image in fullscreen‘Chris took me to black-and-white movies and introduced me to literature and basically saved my life, actually, with his kindness’ … Chris and Susan Sarandon in Los Angeles in 1975.Photograph: Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection/Getty ImagesThe Princess Bride was not an instant hit but it went viral in a pre-internet kind of way. “A woman once walked up to me, held up a battered VHS and said, ‘I used to carry this around in my purse, so that whenever I’d go to visit a friend, I’d pull it out and say, have you seen this?’ She was an evangelist for the Princess Bride.” He also remembers the attorney general of Utah telling him that “every home in Utah owns a copy of The Princess Bride”.What’s the appeal? “It’s not offensive in any way. There’s no sex in it, there’s very little violence, and its moral lesson is acceptable to just about everybody.

After The Nightmare Before Christmas, his career seemed to drop off, with guest roles in TV series (he’s playeda lotof doctors), stage roles, minor movie roles, smaller independent films. “I call them mortgage movies,” he says. “I did a bunch of them, some of which I believed in, some I didn’t. Gotta work, gotta pay the rent.”Sarandon went through “a major financial reversal” in the late 80s. “I invested money with a guy who defrauded me. I bought into a number of brownstone buildings in Manhattan when I was doing well, and the guy ended up being a fraud, and because I had signed all of the mortgages with this guy, I became as liable as he was, not criminally, but financially. So I lost everything. I’d been saving money all through my career for my old age, and I had to liquidate it.”It was the worst time of his life, he says. He was broke, his marriage to Cooper was falling apart. Soon after, he landed a role in a Broadway musical that turned out to be a disaster: Nick & Nora, based on Dashiell Hammett’s The Thin Man, which was “just killed by the critics”. It closed after nine performances. One good thing came out of it, though: he met Gleason, who was also in the cast. Soon after, both penniless, they moved to Los Angeles, started working again and got married. “That was the beginning of my third life,” he says. “And now here I am.”View image in fullscreen‘That’s my profession now: podcaster and gardener’ … Sarandon at home.Photograph: Amir Hamja/The GuardianDuring the Covid lockdown he decided to start a food podcast,Cooking By Heart, in which he interviews guests about their lives and culinary memories. The roster has included chefs, writers and actors, includingCary Elwes, Stockard Channing,Rosanna ArquetteandBrad Dourif. One day, he got a message on his Instagram from Susan. “She said, ‘Hi, your podcast looks great. Let’s do one.’” So she came to Connecticut and recorded an episode on stage with him. It was the first time they had seen each other in “maybe 15, 20 years” he says. “It really wasn’t so much an interview as it was, ‘Let’s talk about what’s been going on in our lives.’”Al Pacino on Dog Day Afternoon at 50: ‘It plays more today than it even did then’Read moreIn the podcast, Susan is very kind about him: “When I met Chris, I thought, and correctly so, that he knew everything, because he took me to black-and-white movies and introduced me to literature and basically saved my life, actually, with his kindness.” Reconnecting with her was heartening, he says. “We’re in the last quarter of our lives, and we’ve gotten back together in terms of our friendship. Now we’re close friends again.”The acting has pretty much dried up – “I get offered stuff occasionally, most of which I turn down because it’s not very interesting” – but he’s fine with that, he says. “Honestly, I don’t have the fire in my belly any more. There was a time early in my career where I was on fire, and I was thrilled to be doing what I was doing. I set out to have a career, I didn’t set out to be famous, and so my goals were fulfilled, really, sort of midway through.”After that he was happy to be a “multidisciplinary” kind of actor. “I did it for a long time, and I was able to support myself – except for that disastrous three or four years when things were bleak. But I came out of it, and I did fine. I’m a lucky guy.”Explore more on these topicsFilmSusan SarandonPodcastingPodcastsThe Princess BrideinterviewsShareReuse this content"

You decide: who’s gone potty?Find out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 25 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 07.28 EDTShareThe prosecution: MarleneDaniis 24 – if she makes a mess, she needs to clean it up herself. Let this be a learning experienceFor our 10-day summer holiday, I booked and paid for an Airbnb villa in Malta. In total it cost €1,100 for our family of four: me, my husband, Derek, and our two kids, Dani, 24, and Jamie, 19. Dani came for four days and the rest of us stayed for the entirety.We had a nice time, but Dani and Jamie left their part of the villa in a complete mess, and I only found out after we’d left. Dani had her own wing, which I didn’t check, and after we got home I received a message from the host. They sent pictures of her room, with rubbish bags and crumbs all over the counter and a broken vase. She hadn’t told us about the vase; I only found out from the host.There was a £100 cleaning fee included in the booking, but they said that only covers basics like washing bed linen and cleaning the floors. It doesn’t cover damage, so I was charged an extra £50 for the broken vase.Dani says I should have disputed it, but I just wanted to get it sorted. I told her that actions have consequences, and asked her to pay the extra fee for the breakage. She did, but now says we should dispute the charge through Airbnb.We paid for the holiday, so they should show us some gratitude. I’m not going to shoulder the cost of their mistakesDani said she broke the vase by accident, which I believe of course. But at 24, she’s not a child any more. If you make a mess, you clean up after yourself. Jamie also got a telling off for leaving his room in a mess, but he didn’t break anything.Dani is a working girl, so asking her to pay isn’t too big a deal. That’s what being an adult means: you contribute fairly, and you take responsibility when you mess up. I shouldn’t have to check on my grown-up children when we go away. We paid for the holiday so they should show us some gratitude. I’m not going to shoulder the cost of their mistakes.I think this is about more than money – it’s about respect and responsibility. I organised this trip to bring us together as a family, but instead I’ve ended up being embarrassed by the host’s complaint and stuck with an extra bill.The defence: DaniWe’ve already paid a cleaning fee, why should we face extra charges? Airbnb should refund usI stayed in Malta for four nights and really enjoyed our family holiday. But I don’t think I should have paid for the broken vase, and now I am trying to get my money back. Mum doesn’t agree.I didn’t read through the villa policy when I arrived, as I came late, but if I had, I would have taken more care. I left some rubbish in bags in the room and knocked over the vase on the second day. I tried to dispose of it. I didn’t know the villa would be so strict.Plus, the villa already had a £100 cleaning fee built in, as most Airbnb properties do. That’s what it’s for: rubbish, crumbs, dishes and accidents. No Airbnb is handed back spotless. The idea that I need to pay more on top of that is ridiculous because that’s normal holiday stuff.I am grateful to Mum and Dad for taking me on holiday, but they do seem to get quite anxious about stuff like thisI did just pay Mum when she asked, as Dad told me to “keep the peace”. But now I would like it refunded via the platform, whereas Mum thinks we should leave it. I’m stubborn and want to challenge it to prove I’m right. We are at a stalemate.I am grateful to Mum and Dad for taking me on holiday, but they do seem to get quite anxious about stuff like this. They want to just sweep everything under the rug, whereas I’d dispute the charge until Airbnb pays up.What really frustrates me is that Mum is turning this into some sort of life lesson. I’m not saying I shouldn’t contribute – I will happily pay for the time I stayed there – but I don’t think I should be charged extra fees, or be lectured for being irresponsible. I left the villa in a normal state, but now have to pay more than we expected – and Mum is lording it over me. It feels as if she is using money to punish me.At 24, I’m trying to balance rent, bills and work stress. Mum can afford this trip far more easily than I can, and she invited me and my brother. I wasn’t told that there would be a bill. It feels as if I’m being taught a lesson after we’ve come home, and I don’t know what it’s really about.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Just because you’ve paid a cleaning fee, it doesn’t entitle you to leave the place in a tip – that’s disrespectful. She should have owned up to the broken vase when checking out. Hiding it was childish.Zoe, 33Dani left the villa in a state, trashed her room, broke someone else’s belongings, and now doesn’t like the consequences. It may have been an accident, but why should Airbnb be expected to refund when we are all responsible for our actions? This all comes down to respecting others.George, 42You break something, you pay for it. It being an accident has no bearing on the outcome, and a cleaning fee doesn’t include breakages. Dani should suck it up and admit she’s wrong, and stop embarrassing her mum for the sake of proving her point.Yoanna, 32I broke a coffee pot at the cottage we stayed in this summer. I felt awful about it and paid for it to be replaced, as that seemed like the right thing to do. Maybe it is a generational thing, or is Dani more upset by the rebuke than the bill?Keith 64What planet is Dani living on? How can she not expect to have to pay for something she has broken? This is someone else’s home, and someone else’s vase.

Here’s what worked for some lucky couplesLeah HarperThu 25 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 01.42 EDTShareUsing dating apps to find love is commonplace these days – and yet, for many singles, it has become a double-edged sword. The perks of having a never-ending supply of potential matches at your fingertips are obvious – but the appeal of connecting and meeting with strangers is time-limited. It can be especially frustrating to feel as if you’re stuck at the swiping stage.In 2023, US jeweller Shane Company found that the average American will spendabout eight months using dating apps– swiping on around 3,960 profiles – before finding a partner. But for chronic daters, those numbers will probably sound optimistic; speaking to friends and colleagues, it’s not uncommon to spend years “on the apps” without significant romantic success. The “download-delete-repeat” cycle can be disheartening and dating-app fatigue is growing;last year’s Online Nation report from Ofcomshowed that app use had declined significantly, with a drop of nearly 16% in the use of the 10 most popular dating apps. No wonderMeta this week announced that it is bringing an AI assistant to Facebook Dating, as well as Meet Cute, a new “surprise match” feature designed to help users “avoid swipe fatigue”.But it doesn’t have to be this way.According to Pew Research Center, around 10% of heterosexual people and 24% of LGBTQ+ people do meet their long-term partner through a dating site or app – and some seem to do it without dedicating huge amounts of time to fruitless swiping. Is it simply a case of the stars swiftly aligning – or is there a secret to their success?Liz, 28, from Nottingham, downloaded Bumble on a Wednesday and matched with her now-husband the same day. They had their first date on the Friday, and have been together for eight years. Her advice for not getting stuck on the apps? Delete them.View image in fullscreenDeleting the app can be a better way to get to know one another …Photograph: Posed by models. Emir Memedovski/Getty Images“If you meet someone you have a connection with, delete the apps and give that person your full attention – you aren’t on a dating show!” she says. “After the first date, I knew I really liked him, and I thought: ‘I need to focus on one person at a time.’ You can always go back to the apps later if it doesn’t work out.”She also found that not everyone she had swiped right on – to indicate that she was interested – would look at the app every day: “So you get this delayed response with matches. I found the constant pings on my phone really distracting – too many people, too many conversations.”It can be tempting to keep your options open, and speaking to multiple matches is generally deemed acceptable in the early stages of dating. But Liz and her partner deleted Bumble within a week of meeting and found that prioritising one person was a better way to get to know one another.Another way to avoid the so-called paradox of choice is to intentionally narrow your dating pool. Joseph, 42, from Liverpool, is an advocate for finding your niche: he met his partner after just a couple of months of using vegan and vegetarian dating appGrazer. They got engaged 10 months later, and have now been married for six years. They also have two (vegan) children together.If you meet someone you have a connection with, delete the apps and give them your full attention – you aren’t on a dating show“It filtered out what I knew I didn’t want,” he says. “It was more just knowing that everyone was on the same wavelength; that took a lot of the stress away. No awkward conversation about being vegan, and no tough arguments in five years’ time about whether we’re going to raise our children vegan or not. There weren’t a lot of people on Grazer, especially in Liverpool, because it was quite new, but it was quality over quantity.”It’s important to know what you’re looking for, says couples therapist and dating coachShan Merchant, “whether that’s someone who likes exercise, or enjoys being in nature or likes creativity”. Her advice is to use a mainstream app that has a lot of people signed up, “and also go for more of a specialist app, so you’re not limiting your focus too much”.Of course, a good way to find someone whose interests and values align with your own is to be completely honest when creating your profile, whichever app you choose.“My strategy was that I almost wanted to put people off, so that I would only end up meeting with people who were genuinely interested,” says Hannah, 39, from Leeds, who has now been with her partner for seven years. She was on Bumble for around a month before they met, and had been on dates with just two other people from the app.“I had a theory about being tactical with my photos,” says Hannah. “I wanted them to be reflective of me in real life. My first photo was one where I had my hair done and my makeup on and I thought I looked good, but immediately my second photo was me in the garden, no makeup, just a casual day. Loads of men have all their photos of them doing sport – I don’t have anything against sport, but you sort of think, is that all they do? A lack of variety of photos was definitely something that made me swipe past people – you want to know what the rest of their life looks like.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Michelle Thompson/The GuardianWhile many of the people I spoke to cited the fact that they took dating seriously as the key to their app-based success, Hannah believes that, for her, it was almost the opposite. She’d recently moved back to the north of England after 10 years in London; it was more that she wanted to meet new people and explore the local area.“I think that mindset made a big difference – I wasn’t going with a checklist,” she says. “It helped me meet someone good.” It’s important, she adds, “to try to ignore preconceptions and be open about who you meet”.Loads of men have photos of them doing sport. I don’t have anything against sport, but you think: is that all they do?While theories about how you can “manifest” the perfect partner have gained traction in recent years, Merchant suggests there are other, more practical, ways in which your frame of mind can affect your search for love.“Keep your energy up and only use apps when you’re feeling good – if you’re feeling tired or stressed, or hungover or low, I wouldn’t recommend going on a dating app, because that’s going to be the filter through which you see people,” she says. “A lot of people struggle to keep a positive attitude when dating – but I think that’s the biggest thing when it comes to dating app success.”For Nicholas, 69, from Chichester, it was the pandemic that prompted him to be more proactive about dating – something he believes was intrinsic to his positive experience. He connected with his partner within a week of signing up to the now defunct Guardian Soulmates; they’ve been in a relationship for more than five years, living together since February 2022.“I was apprehensive but knew I had to bite the bullet,” he says. “Have a conversation with yourself as to whether you actually want to make it happen, or whether you want an excuse as to why it hasn’t happened. Show why you would be a good companion. Be willing to go beyond your comfort zone. If you’ve put a profile up, you’ve got to be looking and responding to people.”Even if not every interaction goes well, “you’re getting practice in how the dynamics work,” says Nicholas. He suggestsRomeo, also known as PlanetRomeo, as a good alternative for LGBTQ+ people looking for relationships rather than hookups.Liz also sees how, for some people, dating apps themselves can become part of the problem, rather than the solution. “I love my friends dearly, but I’ve watched them on the apps be like: ‘I’ve really enjoyed getting all these Likes but I’m never going to message a single one of them.’ There’s a sense that, because the other person is just a digital image on a screen, their feelings don’t matter.” If you’re genuinely keen to meet someone, her advice is to remember that profiles are real people: “Don’t mislead anyone, ghost them or stand them up.”View image in fullscreenThoughtful gifts can be an ice-breaker …Photograph: Posed by models. Janina Steinmetz/Getty ImagesTinder may have gaineda particularly bad reputation for such practicesin recent years, but Dan, 45, from the Netherlands, connected with his now-wife about two weeks after installing the app. They’ve been in a relationship for 10 years and have a son together. For him, the key was making sure he stood out.“I’ve heard people often say I come across as incredibly boring from a distance,” he says. “Suffice to say, I’m never going to seduce anyone with my gorgeous looks or flamboyant style. I’m not rich or influential either. The good thing about dating apps was that they allowed me to immediately start a conversation, which plays to my strong points.” When messaging someone, he would always try to ask a question or make a joke about something on their profile, to show that he had read it. “It didn’t always work, but sometimes it did.”Once on a date, Dan was similarly keen to make an impression, and brought small, thoughtful gifts, to act as ice-breakers. “On the first date with my wife, I brought her a giftwrapped bar of mint chocolate, after she’d mentioned she hated that flavour,” he says. “Just after unwrapping, while she was clearly trying to decide whether to be offended or pretend to be grateful, I mischievously handed her another chocolate bar – this time her favourite flavour.” Again, it showed that he had been paying attention.I was rejected for wearing clothes that weren’t sufficiently hip, which was a good call: if that’s important to you, I’m not your man“Don’t be afraid of rejection,” he advises. “I was rejected for wearing clothes that weren’t sufficiently hip, which was a good call on that woman’s part: if that’s important to you, I’m not your man. I was rejected for ordering a non-alcoholic drink on another first date. Again, a good call: I’d never be the booze buddy she hoped for. And I’m sure I’ve been rejected many times by women with a different sense of humour to me – for which I’m thankful, because it gave me a chance to keep looking until I found someone who, after 10 years, still chuckles at my dad jokes.”Fear of rejection can certainly play a big role in why so many singles use dating apps intermittently and with caution – which can often prolong their search. “A lot of people aren’t willing to be rejected,” says Merchant, “and when you’re on a dating app, you get rejected a lot, but you’re also rejecting a lot.” People take rejection personally, she says, and then they give up. “I feel sad when people do that because I know that if they remain positive, eventually, everyone meets someone – that’s what I see.”As is so often the case, the secret to dating app success may be a side order of serendipity. “I personally think that there’s a lot of luck involved,” says Merchant. “Make sure you spend time with people who talk positively about dating – people get very jaded but it’s important not to expose yourself to that. If you feel yourself getting burnt out, come off the apps and come back when your energy is stronger.”Even those who seem to have been struck by Cupid’s bow almost instantaneously agree that taking a break can be beneficial. “You can get into a rut of seeing the same faces,” says Joseph. “If you take a step back and give it a few months, you’ll see new people and work out what you’re actually after, rather than chasing something just for the sake of it.Some people featured in this article responded to acommunity callout.

These tastings usually take place on a week night, so I tend to opt for three easy-drinking favourites. A kabinett riesling? Check. A fruity côtes du Rhône? Check. Then I spied a lambrusco. I love starting the evening with a joyous glass of something fizzy but, to my surprise, many members of the audience remarked how they didn’t have the best memories of lambrusco.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I suppose I’m showing my age here, because all I know of lambrusco is the delicious, bone-dry examples that pop up at chic chef residencies and firmly at the top of wine lists in brilliant Italian restaurants. Most of my audience, however, recalled it rather less fondly: as a super-sweet drink that seems to have wedged itself irreversibly into the brain of anyone who was alive and drinking in the 1970s and 80s.If super-sweet is your thing, have at it, but it’s my great pleasure to inform the rest of you that there’s so much more to discover. Lambrusco comes from the region of Emilia-Romagna, where there are eight related lambrusco varieties that produce a range of styles – dry, off-dry, red, pink, white – so there’s something to fit every palate.Indeed, while I was in Edinburgh, I had a good lunch atSotto, an enoteca and trattoria that opened last year, where I was pleased to see a bottle of lambrusco on the menu. It’s a wine that owner and sommelier James Clark says has an important part to play on his list: “Lambrusco challenges people’s preconceptions: you can bring a table of people from my parents’ generation a glass of something dry, floral and elegant that is unrecognisable from what they thought lambrusco is.”And what of food pairings? “It can comfortably sit alongside a range of foods,” Clark says. “It’s great with cured meats and fried antipasti, say, and even spicy food. We often have agnocchi frittowith culatello [a type of cured pork] on the menu, and I cannot think of a better pairing for that than a glass of lambrusco.”Lambrusco is also my go-to pizza wine. The dish and the drink share a conviviality, and the red fruit meets the freshness of good tomato sauce. If you’ve got a friend whose quarter/midlife crisis has come in the shape of a hi-tech pizza oven, give them an excuse to fire it up and bring over a bottle of red fizz.Four lambruscos to surprise your palateNivola Lambrusco£13 (or £12 on ‘“mix-six”) Majestic, 10.5%.

We were talking on the phone as she made her way to work in London and I waited for a bus in Rome. As Rosie asked me the question, the bus numbers and estimated times on the electric indicator scrambled before going blank. Despite being a full-time food writer working on a book that involves the repeated testing of 120 recipes, I couldn’t, at that moment, think of a single helpful recipe. I started rambling about chicken thighs, at which my sister, wisely, ended the call with a breezy: “Well, if anything comes to mind, let me know.” A minute later, the indicator flashed back on and the 792 arrived.In late September, still limping into a routine after the summer and interminable Italian school holidays, I also need my indicator resetting. As the bus took me home, I started making a list of week-in, week-out recipes to live by at this time of year, good and good-value recipes that are flexible and accommodating for just a few or many. I wrote it out for my sister, and it struck me that it might be useful for you, too.First up, a hero recipe and real crowd-pleaser:lentils braised with onion, celery, carrot and herbs– lentil ragu, if you like. Make a double quantity so you have enough for several meals. It can be mixed with pasta or rice; fish, or small rounds of baked goat’s cheese can be substituted for sausage; or you can make it a vegetarian bake topped with mashed potato.Thomasina Miers’s chilli con carnecan be approached in much the same way as the lentils, or turned into a moussaka-type bake by topping it with bechamel (Honey & Co havea vegetarian version). Sausage ragu is also a friendly recipe, with pasta, naturally, or dolloped on polenta.View image in fullscreenRachel Roddy’s baked chicken thighs with tomatoes, served with a green bean, lettuce and parmesan salad.Photograph: Rachel Roddy/The GuardianAnother great panful isminestrone, which can be fortified with pasta or rice, or topped with croutons. Make a double quantity, but also spin it out by adding another tin or two of white beans, or reheating with ripped bread – minestrone, of course, is better the next day.Carrot and lentil soup, served with bread and cheese, is another crowd favourite and such good value – it feeds eight people for about three quid. Also good value isa massive pan of tomato sauce, which will last several days and can be used for pasta, poached fish, poached meatballs or simply paired withsausage meat.Turning to the oven,Neapolitan mashed potato cake(gattò di patate) is a brilliant weekly dish. Essentially an enriched mashed potato sandwich, it can have a filling of mozzarella and salami or peas, a mix of peas and bechamel, or anything you fancy. Do make a large one as it reheats beautifully, and serve it alongside a big green salad or chopped vegetable coleslaw.And the produce of summer is still on hand to enjoy.Roman-style tomatoes stuffed with rice and herbsgo down well with almost everyone, as do fantastically quickchickpea pancakes– make the batter in the morning so you are ready to go.Chicken thighs with tomatoeshas to be one of the fastest preps ever – 30 seconds to put in a tray with a bit of olive oil and salt, then bake, week in, week out.My week in foodView image in fullscreenCaptain crunch … crisps of many flavours.Photograph: Carol Yepes/Getty ImagesSalt of the earth| Scallop, black vinegar, saffron, seaweed, French salad and fried crab are just a few of the crisp flavours Ruth Alexander encounters ina recent episode of The Food Chaintracing the story of our favourite snack.

She describes Howard as a novelist who reminds us what the novel is for – opening eyes and hearts. I did doubt Mantel’s assessment for a couple of pages, wondering if I could bear to hang out with such privileged, claustrophobic, apparently miserable people. But, before I knew it, I was pulled in deep by Howard’s exquisite, witty, astutely observant writing, the cold orange souffle and the very characters I thought I hated. It is also a story told brilliantly, backwards.TV dinner|My son and TikTok had introduced me to the joy of cornflakes as a coating for chicken fillets – flour first, then beaten egg and then the cereal.

She went on to say that she also attaches the “coat-on” expression to any dish she gets going as soon as she walks through the door (and before she takes off her coat and has a pee), so thinks of me when she makes coat-on lentils, coat-on rice and leeks, coat-on tomato sauce, coat-on couscous with roast vegetables. As much as I wanted to keep the compliment to myself and not share it, I did remind her that I had borrowed the expression from Nigella Lawson and her bookHow to Eat, to which the woman replied: “What a generous food writer you are.” I thanked her back, complimented her on her blue jacket, then bounced all the way to the cash desk to pay for the dishcloths and potato peeler, and then all along Oxford Street.If I ever see that woman again, I need to tell her that, since our meeting, I have also been attaching the prefix “coat-on” to various dishes and actions, not least boiling the kettle to jumpstart the water for coat-on spaghetti. Coincidentally, it is 20 years since I moved to Rome; 19 and a half years since Vincenzo and I first argued about how to cook pasta (him telling me I used too little water and salt, and took too much time; me telling him he was supercilious and boring); and 10 years since Ifirst wrote about spaghetti for this column. Some things have changed, others have not (salt), and I now have a medium-sized repertoire of coat-on spaghettis.The first of these speedy, coat-on favourites is spaghetti with a quick tomato, garlic and chilli sauce. It is described by a Neapolitan friend as a mix between a quick tomato sauce (AKAsciuesciue,pronounced “shway shway” and meaning “hurry hurry’’) and that store-cupboard saviour spaghetti with garlic, chilli and olive oil (aglio, olio e peperoncino,or AOP). Like spaghetti AOP, spaghetti with quick tomato, garlic and chilli sauce is not so much a sauce but a flavourful and fast coating for the thin strings of pasta. It is also a condiment in which the olive oil plays a fundamental role, so use the best you have, and don’t skimp.I have suggested slicing the garlic, but if you want a milder flavour, crush the cloves so they break but remain whole. If you prefer a more intense flavour, chop the cloves, while, for the most intense flavour of all, squash the cloves with the side of a knife until they reduce to a paste.The second coat-on recipe is a store-cupboard version of the Sicilian dishpasta con le sarde(pasta with sardines and wild fennel), which also showcases the power (culinary, biblical, or both) of tinned sardines: a small tin or two packs an intensely flavoured punch and goes a long way. If you can find fennel fronds or dill, great, otherwise parsley works well as the green herbal element. Again, what you are making here is not so much a sauce as a tasty condiment that coats the strands of spaghetti.Spaghetti with quick tomato, garlic and chilli sauceTinned plum tomatoes help the “hurry”, of course, while fresh tomatoes require a little more time and peeling, otherwise, the skins curl into hard bits when the flesh is mashed to a soft pulp. Use your best-tasting olive oil – and don’t skimp: it istheessential ingredient.Prep5 minCook10 minServes4Salt450g spaghetti6-8 tbspolive oil2garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced3 whole, peeled plum tomatoes, tinned or fresh and peeled1 tspred chill flakes1 handfulbasil leavesBring a pan of water to a boil, add some salt, then cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions, until al dente.Meanwhile, in a large frying pan, gently warm the olive oil and garlic, so the garlic becomes soft and fragrant, then add the tomatoes, chilli and a pinch of salt, and fry gently, mashing the tomatoes with the back of a fork or potato masher, so the flesh breaks down into a rustic sauce – this will take about four minutes on a lively heat. (If the sauce is ready before the pasta, pull the pan off the heat, then return it just before adding the spaghetti.)Once the spaghetti is al dente, use a forked spoon or spider sieve to lift it directly into the tomato pan, complete with the residual cooking water clinging to it, then toss very vigorously, ripping in the basil leaves as you do so. Serve at once.Spaghetti with tinned sardines, anchovy, capers, chilli and lemonView image in fullscreenRachel Roddy’s spaghetti with tinned sardines, anchovy, capers, chilli and lemon.Try to find sardines packed in olive oil, in which case you can reduce the amount of olive oil listed below.

Here’s how to avoid the most common traps and get those keys in your pocketSarah PhillipsThu 25 Sep 2025 06.37 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 06.38 EDTShareFinding a place to live in the UK can be difficult; there are all kinds of pitfalls, including chains breaking, bidding wars, worrying surveys, difficult neighbours, unrealistic pricing, dodgy boilers and rentals getting snapped up before you can even go and see them. How can you beat the herd and make that dream home yours? Here, estate agents share their tips on securing the perfect property.Get your finances ready“It still shocks me that, pretty much daily, I get viewing requests from buyers who haven’t had a conversation with anyone about their finances,” saysKiel Holder, an independent estate agent in Reading. “On paper, you might think, with money sitting in the bank, ‘Of course I’ll get a mortgage’ – but it might be that one phone bill you failed to pay four years ago reduces the amount of money that lenders offer you.” Holder recommends consulting an independent financial adviser – rather than just going for whatever your bank can offer, as this tends to mean you get a better deal – and having a mortgage in principle ready.You need to be equally prepared when it comes to rentals, says Nathan Barrow, lettings director atStow Brothersin east London. The market is “very competitive” and “demand still outweighs supply”. He recommends one month’s rent upfront and then about five weeks’ rent as a damage deposit. “You will also need supporting documents to show your financial stability,” such as payslips, tax returns and bank statements.Think long termIf you are buying a property, it is helpful to have a five-year plan, saysGareth Yates, an estate agent in Manchester. “Are children on the horizon? Are there any job changes coming up? How secure does life look at the minute? You really need to know what 2030 is going to look like for you. It’s not economical to move regularly.”It is also important to be clear about what your non-negotiables are. This is essential before you start viewing, says Holder: “If you’ve got two cars, then a driveway or parking may well be essential. If you’ve got children, it might be that school catchments are important.” This will prevent being “tempted by the beautiful chocolate-box cottage that doesn’t match what you actually need. You will be putting it back on the market in a year or two, and stamp duty is quite expensive.”Go beyond the websites“Once upon a time, it was all about setting alerts on Rightmove and Zoopla,” says Holder. “But if there is an opportunity to register directly with an estate agent, you absolutely want to do that as well, because that will be the first place any new property appears – directly on the agent’s website or social media.”“Everybody is addicted to Rightmove,” says Holly Price, founder ofPrice Independent Estate Agentsin York, but she notes that there are many other ways to find a home. “I know of agents that have sold just from a TikTok video.” Price suggests researching the best local independent estate agents to follow on social media and sending them a message to say you are looking.Get to know the agentsView image in fullscreenYour new best friend.Photograph: Posed by models; Maskot/Getty Images“Try to build a rapport with an agent,” says Holder. “We always work with what we call our ‘top buyers’ or ‘top tenants’. They will be people who are the most memorable, who have got their finances in order, have a good grasp of reality, and know what they are looking for.As an agent, when that home comes up, you know who to call straight away. If someone comes across as challenging or problematic, you’re going to have reservations about working with them over the next three to six months, and you’re going to question if they are going to make it through.”Does he mind people who are constantly on the phone, badgering him for updates? “I quite like those people,” says Holder. “It tells me that they’re motivated.”Be prepared to drop everything to get to a viewing“It becomes a full-time job,” says Yates. “Understand that every weekend, every evening, will be taken up with viewing houses. You’ve got to make sure you’re flexible. If your only viewing availability is 5pm on a Saturday, you’re going to miss out on so many properties.”The lettings market is all about speed, he adds. “Make sure you have all your information to hand, so if you like that property, you can walk into the office straight after the viewing, fill in the tenancy agreement, give them all the information they need, and get your referencing done the same day. Don’t spend too long thinking about it.” And give agents as much notice as possible if you can’t make a viewing, he says: “People who don’t turn up without notice rarely get another look in.”Bring a checklist of potential problemsView image in fullscreenNice view – but are the window frames in good shape?Photograph: Posed by models; Thomas Barwick/Getty Images“Look at the radiators and windows,” says Yates. “They’re a good indicator of how well looked after the property is. Is there mould around the windows? Do the windows open? Are there thin radiators that are not going to be very energy-efficient? The other thing to look for is where things have been covered up by paint: if there’s a freshly painted area and the rest of the wall hasn’t been painted, chances are there’s something going on behind it, like damp.”Holder adds to the list of things to look out for: “Are windows double-glazed? Are you close to a busy road? If so, you might want them double- or triple-glazed. If you’re looking at any new-builds, take a tape measure and get familiar with bed sizes, because a lot ofnew-builds will feature slightly smaller furniture, which makes the property look bigger – and when you go to move in, you can’t even fit the bed in, let alone the wardrobes. What are you close to in terms of infrastructure? If you’re looking at a home because you want access to a motorway, visit the area during rush hour. How easy is it to get to where you need to go? Because you might have viewed it on a Saturday afternoon when there are fewer cars on the road.”Find out who will be managing a rental, says Barrow, and “if there are things that you would like addressing, be very clear with the agent. Sometimes tenants fear that if they state anything as part of their offer, that might make them look less favourable. But I think the more open communications are, the better.”But be flexibleSometimes it can pay to be open-minded, especially where cleanliness is concerned, says Price: “If a property isn’t clean or tidy, it can really put buyers off, but you’ve got to think that you’re not buyingtheirhome, you’re buyingyournext home.” She recommends not spending too much time marvelling at nice furniture, but checking the boiler instead.Always see a property twice“We can spend longer choosing an outfit than we do choosing a home,” says Price. Find out ahead of time how long your viewing will be, make the most of that time, and ask to go back for a second viewing if necessary. This is more applicable when buying rather than renting, since rental properties may be quickly snapped up.“I know estate agents don’t like it,” says Yates, “but I would go once in the morning and once in the evening. You get an idea of where the sun travels.” Holder suggests looking at a property with the seasons in mind: “Is the sun beating through the windows all day? Or do you get respite? How warm will it get in summer? If it is a new-build flat, it is probably going to be quite toasty.” Likewise, “if you’re viewing a home in winter, is it warm? Is the heating on? Does it feel like the heating has been on for hours? Try and gauge it,” he says.As the cost of building works has gone up, Price recommends booking a second viewing and taking along a builder, an architect or even a knowledgeable relative to give an honest assessment of what is involved. “Parents always say no,” she says, laughing.Be a bit nosy about the neighboursView image in fullscreenYou’re not just moving in to a property – you’re moving in to a neighbourhood.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianYates does not advise knocking on neighbours’ doors, but he does suggest turning up early and seeing what is happening in the street. “I always say 8pm on a Friday is a great time to pull up on a road and just see: is it loud? Is there lots of lairiness going on? It will give you a good indication.”Let the agent know what you think“Make sure you leave feedback on every viewing,” says Yates. “It shows that you’re willing to give up some of your time because the estate agent wants to get feedback for their vendor, and not everyone does that.”“Whatever the reason a home isn’t right, constructive feedback helps the agent understand your needs better,” adds Holder. “There may be something coming up which the agent knows about, but nobody else does at that point, and that feedback has just put you in the hot seat without you even knowing.”Don’t offer too lowIf you plan to offer below the asking price, says Holder, “make sure you’ve done the research to justify your decision. Lowball offers without reason may cost you your credibility and significantly reduce the chances of getting a call first when ‘the one’ comes up.”Manchester is a bit of a mixed market at the moment, says Yates. “Some properties are still going over the asking price, but the general rule is that offers are coming in anywhere between 3-4% below the asking price.”Barrow says that some renters will offer over what is advertised to try to secure a property, but the newrenters’ rights billwill address this, along with no-fault evictions, unfair rent rises and access to pets.Write a heartfelt noteView image in fullscreenIt’s a business transaction, but feelings matter, too.Photograph: Posed by models; MoMo Productions/Getty ImagesIt is quite common for potential buyers – or tenants – to include details of their personal situation alongside an offer to try to get the edge on the deal. “The cringeworthy notes can be the most powerful,” says Holder. “Speak from the heart. It doesn’t matter how corny it might sound; it’s about what that home means to you and how you feel you’ll grow into it. I’ve had sales before where that letter has made the difference. Some sellers might just laugh at them and go, ‘Who’s paying the most money?’ Others will say, ‘Actually, that’s a really nice sentiment, and even though that offer is £5,000 less, that’s made us really want to go with them, because it’s given us additional security and peace of mind that they’re committed.’ You can’t really lose doing it.”It can also be well worth putting a note through doors asking if people might be prepared to sell, says Holder. “Sometimes it’s a trigger point for a seller who’s maybe sat on the fence – they take that as a sign.”Accept that chains are unavoidable“Suck it up,” says Yates. “People who avoid properties in chains are putting themselves out of most of the marketplace.” The biggest chain that Holder ever worked on had 13 links. “It’s not ideal, but don’t be put off by a big chain if it’s your dream home,” he says.Get a good team in placeIf you’re buying a property, “make sure that you appoint a competent and capable conveyancer,” says Holder. “A really good one is worth their weight in gold. The cheapest option is rarely the right option.”Buying or renting a house? Why you should ask for a sleepover firstRead more“Get a solicitor that has been either recommended or is highly rated,” says Price. “A local solicitor, not an online one or someone a couple of cities away. And don’t be afraid to chase the agent, even though you shouldn’t have to. Ring up and say: what’s going on? That’s how you prevent fall-throughs: communication.”Be prepared for the worstIt’s a sad truth that almostone in three sales in the UK fall through. “It normally comes down to one of two things: mortgage or survey,” says Yates. “Occasionally you will get a vendor pull out because their life situation changes. But normally it is when a survey comes in saying there is £20,000 worth of work to be done and the vendor refuses to reduce.” If you don’t get something, it is always worth putting a letter through the vendor’s door telling them how sad you are, “so that if the sale does fall through, you’re the first name that they think of”, says Yates.Remember, everything happens for a reasonIf you miss out or a deal falls through, it can be gut-wrenching. “Don’t be too sad,” says Holder. “You’ll find your dream home when it’s ready to find you. I see it time and time again: sales fall through, buyers are devastated, but the house they end up in is so much better for them.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe expertsHomesPropertyRenting propertyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is, perhaps, not the obvious choice for a fun fashion trend.But MiucciaPradahas always loved uniform, and she refuses to cede her favourite fashion territory to the dark side. “I am always trying to build a new kind of elegance,” she said after the Prada show in Milan, a collaboration with her co-designer Raf Simons. “In a uniform you are protected, you are neutral, it allows you to think.”For women, uniforms offer “authority and agency”, she said. “A woman can feel amazing and chic and luxurious in a uniform, just as much as in a dress.”View image in fullscreenMuiccia Prada says she sees beauty in uniform after seeing her father dressed for work as a watchman.Photograph: ShutterstockView image in fullscreenA grey boxy jumpsuit is elevated by satin opera gloves and accessories.Photograph: ShutterstockThe show began with a boxy short sleeve shirt with buttoned pockets – the kind that usually comes with insignia or name badges, instead of Prada’s triangle logo. There were V-neck sweaters, and trousers with ironed-in pleats. But there was a frivolous side to the collection too. The utilitarian was spiked with splashes of glamour: a taffeta puffball skirt worn under a rainmac, satin opera gloves to liven up those sensible shirts.“My dad was a nightwatchman, and I always saw him in uniform,” Simons said backstage. “He was the sweetest man, a caring family man. So for me, uniform has a nice feeling, it is not about war, or the army. The world is so hardcore now, but there is still so much beauty. We have to find a way through.”Perhaps in a sign of our diametrically opposed appetite for escapism, the 18th century is also very hot right now. After pannier-hipped skirts inspired by Marie Antoinette were the curveball trend of London fashion week,Max Maralooked to an earlier Versailles style icon, Madame de Pompadour, and the paintings of Fragonard and Gainsborough, for inspiration.View image in fullscreenMax Mara’s collection is inspired by Madame de Pompadour.Photograph: Pietro D’Aprano/Getty ImagesMax Maramakes clothes for professional women who have risen high enough on the career ladder to afford them. Madame de Pompadour is a more appropriate Max Mara muse than Marie Antoinette, designer Ian Griffiths said backstage, because she was a commoner who “rose to the top on her own merits, and became one of the most important political and cultural figures of her day”.Rococo froth does not cut it in the modern workplace, so Griffiths left the pastel gowns on the moodboard, and took “details from the edges of her dresses” on to the catwalk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Floral prints were transposed into shades of grey.“My job is making clothes that make women feel powerful, and fussy clothes don’t do that. Clothes that are fussy and hard to wear detract from your power,” Griffiths said.Max Mara is best known for coats, but this collection will go on sale next summer, so Griffiths lent into hot-weather tailoring – pencil skirts to wear with bare legs, jacket-and-short suits, and waistcoats – and added bands of plain black elastic, “to keep it snappy and crisp. And also because I’m British, and British style always has an element of fetish in there somewhere, however formal it is.”ThisMilan fashion weekis dedicated to the memory of Giorgio Armani, and is building toward a Sunday evening finale when a black tie dress code has been requested at the reveal of the late designer’s last collection.Thursday’s collection for Armani’s lower-priced label, Emporio Armani, was the first catwalk show since his death.

Down some steps off the harbour arm, don’t miss Red Erratic by Dorothy Cross, a waterside block of red Syrian marble carved with human feet. Stop off atHerbert’sfor an ice-cream, where artist Emeka Ogboh has designed a lolly that tastes like lemon cheesecake and can be dipped (sherbet dip-dab-style) into a slightly salty-spicy coating that looks like sand. Ogboh’s choral sound installation Ode to the Channel is a few minutes’ walk away past Sunny Sands beach. Here you can sit on the steps with your ice-cream and listen to the music and the waves.To 19 October,creativefolkestone.org.ukNewquay, CornwallView image in fullscreenElle Koziupa’s fisher muralA series of new murals are appearing on walls around Newquay.

To its left, the deep red of rundown bedsits near the promenade. To its right, the plush green streets of Poulton Le Fylde, where £1m mansions overlook a well-tended golf club.That is to say, Little Layton is one of the nicer parts of Blackpool. Yet it is one of 169 places across the UKawarded up to £20m over 10 yearsas part of a £5bn government programme to spruce up parks, pubs and public buildings.Starmer gambles on ‘levelling up’-style initiative to tackle Reform threatRead moreThe fund, nicknamed “levelling up 2.0”, is hoped by Labour to help them tackle the threat of Nigel Farage’sReform UK, whose popularity is growing in many of the places allocated money on Thursday.For many in Little Layton, however, a bit of money to jazz up the high street would not necessarily sway their voting habits.“They don’t care if there’s a new lamp-post or a flower basket,” said Jakki Garner, 61, a former English teacher who teaches cooking at Forward Project, a community scheme in Layton. “Parents can’t buy shoes for their children or winter coats because they’re spending all their money on food. This feels like a sticking-plaster initiative.”View image in fullscreenCommunity workers Jane Proctor, Mark Walmsley and Jakki Garner in Layton Methodist church.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianMark Walmsley, 45, the chair of the Layton Together community project, welcomed the money and hopes it could be used open a youth club long planned for the area. “It’s a good idea – if the decisions are made locally,” he said. “That’s the key.”The scheme, announced on Thursday, will see communities handed powers to seize boarded-up shops and buy beloved local assets like libraries and cinemas. It was, said the prime minister, a plan for choosing “unity over division” and “backing the true patriots” at local level.Out on Little Layton’s well-kept high street, there was little sign of a place in decay. There were few, if any, vacant properties and none boarded up. “There’s no derelict shops,” said Walmsley.View image in fullscreenVolunteers preparing for the weekly Big Food Project session in Layton Methodist churchPhotograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianA village of just more than 7,000 people, Little Layton has one of the highest rates of working professionals in Blackpool and a far lower crime rate. Many agree it is a pleasant place to live, with a trendy micropub and regular community events, including a free monthly film night that attracts nearly 100 people, depending on the film. “The high street is actually quite thriving,” said Kath Pritchard, 72, a trustee at Forward Project.It feels far removed from the hardship a mile nearer the coast, home to some of the worst living conditions in Britain. Little Layton is seaside suburbia by comparison – yet people are still struggling.On Thursday lunchtime, a queue of about 50 people snaked outside the door of Layton Methodist church. They were there not to pray but to eat. Each week, Blackpool’s Big Food Project opens the church hall to people who pay between £5 and £16 for a hamper of groceries and toiletries that would cost far more in a supermarket. Some leave with platform trolleys piled with £60 worth of goods, for which they pay £16.View image in fullscreenSarah Bell volunteering at the Big Food Project in Layton Methodist church.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianSarah Bell, 46, a volunteer at the food project, said the new £2m a year funding for Layton “ain’t gonna touch the sides” of people’s challenges. “[Starmer’s] thrown money to make things look good to cover up the cracks … I hate to say it but it feels like we’re getting more and more like a third-world country. It’s heartbreaking.”Catching up over a coffee, Jane Southworth, 61, and her friend Susan Allen, 68, felt it was about time Layton got some money. There is a perception that the village loses out to the more deprived parts of Blackpool and the seafront, given the town depends on tourists.Allen and Southworth are politically homeless, having voted all of their lives forLabourand the Conservatives respectively. Allen, a retired caterer, said she was now leaning towards Reform UK. “Labour? It would have to change drastically,” she said.View image in fullscreenSusan Allen, left, and Jane Southworth at the cafe in Layton Methodist church.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianSouthworth, a former hotelier, said: “Nothing they did to brighten somewhere up would sway me. It’s the core politics. They’re just as bad as one another.”Down the street, Lisa Campbell, 55, a civil service worker, said she would like to see money injected into the local Kingscote Park, which is maintained mainly thanks to volunteers.No money, however, will stop her putting a tick in the turquoise box of Reform UK. “I just think Keir Starmer’s very weak,” she said. “With Nigel Farage, he’s got a clear vision. It would take a lot for me to change and certainly not an injection of cash that should be invested anyway.”Explore more on these topicsBlackpoolLabourReform UKEnglandPovertyCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She justified the move on the grounds the offences were of “exceptional gravity” and “likely to undermine citizens’ trust”.The start of Sarkozy’s sentence will be set at a later date. Prosecutors have been given a month to inform him of when he should go to prison. The judge also ordered Sarkozy, France’s rightwing president from 2007 to 2012, to pay a €100,000 (£87,000) fine.His sentence was harsher than many had expected. As he left the courtroom, he expressed his anger in typically pugnacious style, telling reporters: “What happened today … is of extreme gravity in regard to the rule of law, and for the trust one can have in the justice system.“If they absolutely want me to sleep in jail, I will sleep in jail, but with my head held high.”Sarkozy, who had denied all wrongdoing in court, said he would appeal against the verdict. “I am innocent. This justice is a scandal,” he said.View image in fullscreenNicolas Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, at the courthouse in Paris.Photograph: Teresa Suárez/EPA“Those that hate me this much think they will humiliate me. But what they have humiliated today is France, the image of France.”The former president was found guilty of criminal conspiracy but acquitted of corruption, misuse of Libyan public funds and illegal election campaign funding.As he walked out of the court with his wife, the singer and former model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, TV cameras showed her grabbing the red cover of the microphone of investigative reportingwebsite Mediapart, which first started reporting on the Libya allegations, and apparently throwing it on the ground.She later posted on Instagram: “Love is the answer” with the hashtag #Hatewillnotwin.Prosecutors had told the court that Sarkozy and his aides devised a “corruption pact” withGaddafiand the Libyan regime in 2005 to illegally fund Sarkozy’s successful presidential election campaign two years later.The court heard that in return for the money, the Libyan regime requested diplomatic, legal and business favours, and it was understood that Sarkozy would rehabilitateGaddafi’s international image. The autocratic Libyan leader, whose 41-year rule was marked by human rights abuses, had been isolated internationally over his regime’s connection to terrorism, including the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 overLockerbiein Scotland in December 1988.Prosecutors accused members of Sarkozy’s entourage of meeting members of Gaddafi’s regime in Libya in 2005, when Sarkozy was interior minister. Soon after becoming president in 2007, Sarkozy invited the Libyan leader for alengthy state visit to Parisduring which he set up his Bedouin tent in gardens near the Élysée Palace.View image in fullscreenSarkozy welcomes Gaddafi to the Élysée Palace in Paris in December 2007.Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex/ShutterstockIn 2011, Sarkozy put France at the forefront of Nato-led airstrikes against Gaddafi’s troops that helped rebel fighters topple his regime. Gaddafi was captured and killed in October 2011.The allegations of a secret campaign funding pact made this the biggest corruption trial Sarkozy had faced. He had already been convicted in two separate cases and stripped of France’s highest distinction, the Legion of Honour.In the first case, Sarkozy was convicted of corruption and influence peddling over illegal attempts tosecure favoursfrom a judge. He was given a one-year jail term, which he served this year with an electronic tag for three months before being granted conditional release. It was the first time a former French head of state had been forced to wear an electronic tag. Sarkozy had to wear the tag into the Paris criminal court during part of the trial over Libya campaign funding.In a second case, Sarkozy was convicted ofhiding illegal overspendingin the 2012 presidential election that he lost to the Socialist candidate, François Hollande. He has appealed against both convictions.Despite his convictions, Sarkozy continues to meet and be consulted by key figures on the right and in the centre of French politics. He recently met his former protege, the new prime minister,Sébastien Lecornu, who has yet to form a government after the previous administration collapsed in a no-confidence vote this month.After the verdict on Thursday, the rightwing outgoing interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, praised Sarkozy for his “energy and determination”. “I reiterate my full support and friendship to him during this difficult time,” he said.Elsewhere on the political spectrum there was less support. Clémentine Autain, a leftwing MP, wrote on X: “Head held high, dirty hands. The rule of law did not fail.”Other defendants in the trial received mixed verdicts.Claude Guéant, who was the director of Sarkozy’s 2007 presidential campaign before being made his chief of staff and then interior minister, was found guilty of criminal conspiracy and corruption.Brice Hortefeux, another Sarkozy ally who also served as interior minister, was found guilty of criminal conspiracy but acquitted of illegal campaign funding. He and Guéant are likely to appeal against their convictions.Éric Woerth, another former minister who was Sarkozy’s head of campaign financing in 2007 and has since moved to Emmanuel Macron’s centrist party, was acquitted.In a sudden turn of events this week, the Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, who told Mediapart in a filmed interview in 2016 that he had helped to deliver suitcases of cash from Gaddafi to Sarkozy’s entourage, died of a heart attack in Beirut, two days before the verdict.Takieddine had retracted his incriminating statement about transporting suitcases of cash in the Libya case in 2020, prompting accusations that Sarkozy and close allies had paid him off, something they have always denied. Shortly afterwards, Takieddine contradicted his own retraction.A separate legal case has been opened into Takieddine’s retraction. Sarkozy, his wife and several others have been placed under formal investigation on suspicion of putting pressure on a witness. They all deny any wrongdoing.Explore more on these topicsNicolas SarkozyFranceEuropeLibyaMuammar GaddafiAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They suggest the Amazon forest is remarkably resilient to climate change. My fear is that may count for little, unless we can stop the deforestation itself.”‘A heavy burden’: Belém residents evicted in rush for profits from Cop30 rentalsRead moreThis caution comes asBrazilplans to pave a major road – the BR-319 – through the central Amazon, close to one of the last regions that still has large areas of pristine forest. Bolivia also continues to clear trees at an alarming rate for soy plantations and cattle ranching.The study was conducted by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the UK and beyond, who examined changes in the forest at 188 plots in the Amazon over the past 30 years.They found the mean cross-section of trunks thickened by 3.3% per decade, with the greatest increase found in larger trees. This expansion was attributed to the rising amount of CO2in the atmosphere as a result of the human-caused burning of gas, oil and coal.Big trees such ascastanheiras(Brazil nut trees),sumaúmas(kapoks) andAngelim vermelhocan rise up above 30 metres so they dominate the canopy and lead the competition among plants for the light, water and nutrients needed to photosynthesise CO2.The results highlight how the best-protected areas of the forest remain important allies in the struggle to stabilise the climate, though they alone are far from enough to deal with all of the extra carbon dioxide being pumped into the air globally by cars, factories and power stations.They also show the importance of preventing further deforestation. The areas of the Amazon that have been heavily fragmented by agribusiness and infrastructure – mostly in the south-east –have already shifted from carbon sinks to carbon sources.Big trees are more vulnerable to strong wind, fire and drought if they are isolated or left on the edge of a border between forest and cropland or pasture.Deforestation has killed half a million people in past 20 years, study findsRead moreFor decades, it had been assumed that huge trees – even in dense forest – would die more quickly as temperatures rose, because they were thought to have relatively shallow roots compared with their size. But recent studies show that many have very thin roots that can suck water from much greater depths.It is not yet clear how mortality trends might have been affected by the severe drought of the past few years in much of the Amazon.One of the lead authors of the new paper, Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert from the University of Cambridge, said the big trees were disproportionately important to the functioning of the biome. Although they account for just 1% of the trees in the forest, they were responsible for 50% of the carbon cycling and storage, and probably a similar proportion of the water cycling.“Forests get much drier after big trees die. It alters the structure of the forest and it takes a long time to bounce back because the big trees take a long time to grow,” Esquivel-Muelbert said. “So it is a little bit hopeful that we find them increasing in size and number across the Amazon. There is some resilience there.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisAmazon rainforestBrazilAmericasDeforestationTrees and forestsnewsShareReuse this content"

Nothing more, nothing less,” he said, adding he offered to personally demonstrate for mayors how to slow traffic. “I will stand in an area where you want to calm the traffic, and I’ll show you how to calm the traffic instantly. It’s not that they don’t know how to do it. They don’t want to do it because it’s a cash grab.”Ford, whose government passed regulations in 2019 that allowed cities to install the cameras, said the proliferation of the speed-control tool was “out of control”, claiming that only 37 of the province’s 444 municipalities still support the cameras. He pledged to launch a new fund for cities to install road safety measures.The premier pointed to one camera on Toronto’s west end that has generated more than C$7m in fines for drivers after generating more than 63,000 tickets. The camera, in a 40km/h zone, was installed in 2022 after a speeding motorist killed an elderly couple in a five-vehicle crash. It has been vandalized seven times in the past 10 months.Ford’s announcement is the latest in a string of policies intended to appeal to suburban commuters in the province, and prompted immediate criticism from police and local groups.The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police said speed cameras have “been proven to reduce speeding, change driver behaviour and make our roads safer for everyone – drivers, cyclists, pedestrians and especially children and other vulnerable road users”.Bikes v cars: backlash after Ontario premier threatens to tear up cycling lanes in TorontoRead moreFord brushed off a recent study led by researchers at the Hospital for Sick Children and Toronto Metropolitan University, which that found automated speed enforcement cameras reduced the proportion of speeding vehicles in downtown school zones by 45%.Olivia Chow, the mayor of Toronto, warned it would be “mistake” to remove the cameras.In a letter sent on Thursday to the city’s infrastructure and environment committee, Chow pointed to a recent fatality of a 15-year-old struck by a speeding driver, telling councillors the city “must do everything we can to eliminate these tragedies”.Chow and Ford have sparred previously, after the premierpledged to remove major bike lanesin the city. That attempt was blocked by a judge over the summer – a decision Ford said his government would appeal after the judge “overstepped” .Chow suggested drivers should not be fined more than once by the same camera within a seven-day period and called for larger and more visible signage near cameras to ensure drivers were aware of enforcement zones.“Speed kills,” she said earlier this week. “Torontonians, especially those most vulnerable like children, need to be safe. And we know speed cameras work. They reduce speed.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaRoad transportAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Under the rule, civil police officers would be paid bonuses of between 10% and 150% of their salaries for capturing high-calibre weapons and “neutralizing criminals”.The move’s supporters – many of them allies ofBrazil’s former far-right presidentJair Bolsonaro– argue that an iron fist was the only way to defeat the heavily armed drug factions who rule many of the city’s favelas.Alexandre Knoploch, a lawmaker from Bolsonaro’s Liberal party, compared the policy to the anti-crime crackdown unfolding in El Salvador under its authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, where acontroversial three-year state of emergencyhas seen the murder rate plummet.‘Caught defenseless in the crossfire’: Rio families cope with deaths by police violenceRead more“There is no country in the world which has managed to bring down its high levels of criminality without taking stances such as this,” Knoploch told Rio’s legislative assembly on Tuesday, hailing the law as a way of fighting criminals he called “scum”.“I’m sorry but if these people can’t understand the meaning of civility, they must be neutralized by the police. If you’re carrying a rifle, you have to be neutralized,” Knoploch declared.But activists and security experts poured scorn on the plans which must now be green lit or vetoed by Rio’s rightwing governor, Cláudio Castro, another Bolsonaro ally.“This bonus encourages extrajudicial killings. It is a perverse stimulus to state violence – an invitation to slaughter,” said Antônio Carlos Costa, the founder of anti-violence group Rio de Paz.Henrique Vieira, a federal congressman for Rio, described the legislation as “stupid, bizarre, inhumane, cruel, expensive and inefficient”.Renata Souza, a state congresswoman, said the law would give police “a carte blanche to apply the death penalty in the favelas”.Marcelo Freixo, a veteran human rights activist and leftwing politician, warned the law woulddisproportionately affect young Black men from the favelas. “Police deserve to be paid more – but not for killing people,” he said.Legal experts told the Rio newspaper Extra the “neutralization” policy was unconstitutional in a country which did not allow the death penalty.Carlos Minc, a state congressman who helped abolish the “wild west” law in the 90s, recalled how research had found that 64% of the 1,200 people killed “in combat” during that period died from shots to their backs, ears and to the back of their necks. “They were executions,” he told reporters, calling the resurrected law a step backwards into a violent past.In 2021, Rio’s civil police was blamed for the worst day of violence in the city’s history when28 people were shot deadduring an operation in a favela considered one of the main strongholds of the Red Command faction.Explore more on these topicsRio de JaneiroBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump said the deal complies with a law that would have forced the shutdown of the app for American users had it not been divested and sold to a US owner.“I spoke with President Xi and he said, ‘Go ahead with it,’” Trump said at a press conference. “This is going to be American-operated all the way.”Under the plan, US investors will take over the majority of TikTok’s operations and take charge of a licensed copy of the app’s powerful recommendation algorithm. American companies are expected to own about 80% of the US version of the spun off company, while ByteDance and Chinese investors will own less than 20%. The new version ofTikTokwill be controlled by a seven-member board of directors made up of cybersecurity and national security experts, six of them Americans, according to the White House.The new US company will be valued at $14bn, according to JD Vance, who also spoke at the press conference, a number far lower than the valuation for ByteDance overall, which isestimated to be around $330bn. By comparison, Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, is valued at $1.8tn.The group of American TikTok investors is led by the US software giant Oracle, which will oversee TikTok’s US operations, provide cloud service for user data storage and get a license to take control of the app’s algorithm. White House officials have said ByteDance and Chinese officials will not have access to US user data.Along with Oracle and its co-founder Larry Ellison, Trump said at the press conference that other investors include media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the CEO of Dell computers Michael Dell. “Great investors. The biggest. They don’t get bigger,” Trump said. Vance added that more details about who is involved in the deal will be announced over the next few days.When asked if TikTok would start prioritizing Maga-related content, Trump said, “I always like Maga-related. If I could, I’d make it 100% Maga-related” but indicated that the app would continue recommending a wide variety of content as before, saying: “Every group will be treated fairly”.The deal ends months of legal limbo for one of the US’s most widely used apps, while also giving several US companies a powerful newfound influence within the social media industry. TikTok is used by about180 millionpeople nationwide, and Trump has credited it with helping him win the 2024 presidential election. The deal is also another foray for the Trump administration to exert influence over the tech industry, after it tooka 10% stake in chipmaker Intelearlier this month and has urged companies like Apple and Nvidia to invest hundreds of billions domestically.Trump had earlier indicated that the US government would receive a lucrative fee from the US investors for negotiating the deal with China, sayinglast week: “The United States is getting a tremendous fee-plus – I call it a fee-plus – for just making the deal.”But on Thursday, when asked about this, the president simply said the US would take ordinary taxes from the new company, adding: “We’re gonna make money and we’re going to get a lot of money in taxes.”TikTok once faced bipartisan pushback from lawmakers over concerns about data privacy, and allegations Chinacould use the app to spread propagandaor undermine US democracy. TikTok repeatedly denied those claims, but Congress overwhelmingly voted last year to compel ByteDance to find a US buyer or face a ban in the country.The supreme court unanimouslyupheld the banin January. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order postponing the ban and has since repeatedly delayed its enforcement. The“Saving TikTok” executive orderTrump issued on Thursday says the deal complies with the law passed by Congress, is a “qualified divestiture” and “resolves” national security concerns. The divestiture from ByteDance isn’t expected to be completed for another 120 days.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its plans ripple around the world, whether that’s in changing the demand for fossil fuels or affecting the impacts on the planet from global heating.On Thursday, Australia woke to the news that China’s president, Xi Jinping, had told the United Nations that for the first time his country was setting a target to cut – in absolute terms – its greenhouse gas emissions.In a video address, Xi said China’s emissions would fall by 7% to 10% from their peak. When that peak happens he didn’t say, butsome analysts thinkit may have already passed.China’s plans to cut emissions too weak to stave off global catastrophe, say expertsRead moreAnthony Albanese had a lukewarm response to Xi’s announcement, saying it was “good that there is progress being made”, but “of course [Australia] would like there to be more”.China’s emissions are about 29% of the global total – more than twice that of the United States, the world’s second-biggest emitter.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter“If we see emissions peak and fall in China, then we will see them fall everywhere,” says Dr Wesley Morgan, a Climate Council councillor and researcher at the institute for climate risk and response at the University of New South Wales.Whatever China does will make a substantial difference to the impacts of the climate crisis felt around the world, including Australia.What’s at stake for Australia was clearly articulated by the release last week of Australia’s first national climate risk assessment, which laid out theshocking toll on the economy, on communities and on habitats and wildlifeas global temperatures rise.Political figures and commentators who want to see Australia slow down on cutting emissions have pointed to China’s lack of a target as justification for their position. Those arguments will be harder to make now.While China’s new target is not in line with limiting global heating to 1.5C, Morgan says, nor are most other national 2035 targets that have been announced – including Australia’s.Underpromising and overdeliveringMany climate analysts haveexpressed disappointment at what was seen as the timid nature of China’s target, but many also noted China had underpromised and overdelivered on its previous target.Dr Jorrit Gosens, an expert on China’s energy transition at the Australian National University, says: “The 7% to 10% reduction by 2035 is disappointing, because it is less than what we need. But 7% to 10% in political terms is quite an achievement.”China is also the biggest manufacturer and deployer of technologies to slow global heating, from wind turbines and solar panels to electric vehicles and batteries.Xi also set other 2035 goals: solar and wind capacity would increase by six times the levels in 2020 to reach 3,600 gigawatts, and the share of non-fossil fuels providing the country’s energy would rise above 30%.But Gosens says both these targets will be easily reached. China has been adding between 300GW and 400GW of solar and wind a year for the past two years.Getting to a total of 3,600GW by 2035 would require a rate of only about 180GW a year, he says.“It is so entirely likely that it will be overachieved that it’s almost pointless to set that target,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe low target is likely aimed at international audiences, Gosens says. “China wants to avoid criticism for missing a target and instead get lauded for overachieving.”Slowing demand for Australian fossil fuelsAny ambition from China to reduce its fossil fuel use is going to be keenly watched by the fossil fuel industry. The country is the world’s biggest importer of both steel-making coal and coal for burning in power stations and is a significant importer of LNG.“Declining fossil gas demand from China will also impact China’s LNG demand. And China is Australia’s largest LNG customer,” says Josh Runciman, Australian gas analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.He says: “China’s domestic gas is its cheapest and LNG will likely be the first supply source that falls away. We’re likely to see a similar trend for Australian coal.”While China continues to build coal-fired power plants, Gosens said in the first half of 2025 there had been a cut in coal power consumption of about 100 terrawatt hours.For context, that reduction is roughly the equivalent of turning off all the coal plants in Australia’s national electricity market for 11 months.Gosens says China has installed about three-quarters of all the solar and wind power on the planet.“That means China is doing three times more [renewable energy installations] than the rest of the world put together.”Bill Hare, the founder of research organisation Climate Analytics, says China will be able to meet its new target with policies that are already in place, “so it won’t drive down emissions”.“Australia is a major exporter of fossil fuels to China,” he says. “About 34% to 35% of LNG exports go to China and about 11% to 12% of our coal exports. So Australia is fuelling China’s ongoing overreliance on fossil fuels.“Australian government policy visibly favours ongoing exports of these fossil fuels to China, whereas it could be doing a lot more to facilitate China’s rapid exit from these fuels – and that is in all of our interests.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsChinaClimate crisisEmissions tradingAsia PacificGreenhouse gas emissionsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Huang Chu-jung, a former assistant to a New Taipei city councillor, received the lengthiest sentence of 10 years. He was also found guilty of money laundering and fined 1m New Taiwan dollars (£25,000) and is separately facing charges of “developing a criminal organisation” forChina.The court heard that Huang had sent information to Chinese intelligence agents via encrypted software. He also instructed Chiu Shih-yuan, the former deputy head of the DPP’s Taiwan Institute of Democracy, a training school for politicians and staffers, to seek information from Joseph Wu, the former foreign minister and presidential adviser. Chiu was sentenced to six years and two months behind bars. Huang denied wrongdoing while Chiu pleaded guilty.Prosecutors had sought lengthier sentences for the four men and are considering whether to appeal.Taiwan, a self-governing island that is claimed by Beijing, is highly alert to threats from Chinese espionage. Lai has taken a more aggressive approach than his predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, to people with perceived pro-China sympathies. In March helabelled Chinaas a “foreign hostile force” and strengthened national security measures, including controversial proposals to restore a military court system.In recent months Taiwan hascracked downon people who illegally hold Chinese identity documents.Lai says that such measures, which have been criticised for muffling free expression, are necessary to combat “grey zone” infiltrations of Taiwan’s military, government and society.Taiwan has never been ruled by the Chinese Communist party (CCP) but Beijing insists that it is part of its territory. It has vowed to “re-unify” Taiwan with China and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve that.However, Beijing is also thought to be using cognitive warfare tactics, as well as espionage and disinformation campaigns, to soften Taiwanese resistance to Chinese rule. Some voices in China say that this could make it possible to bring Taiwan under Chinese rule without military conflict.Most people in Taiwan oppose the idea of being ruled by the CCP.Additional research by Lillian Yang and Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaEspionageAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

But the significance of those milestones will be quickly lost in the party’s attempts to rebuild after two bruising elections that have cast doubt over the future of one of the world’s most successful political machines.Two of the five candidates vying to replace Shigeru ishiba – whoannounced his resignationearlier this month – as the next president of the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) have emerged as clear favourites in what analysts are describing as a last-ditch attempt to unify a party battered by amajor funding scandaland thecost-of-living crisis.‘Japanese first’: the mini-Trump on the rise as population crisis bitesRead moreWith just over a week to go before LDP lawmakers and rank-and-file party members cast their votes, Shinjiro Koizumi appears to be on course to become Japan’s youngest postwar prime minister. His elevation to the top job would no longer be a certainty now that the LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeito have lost their majority in both houses of parliament. But he would likely be approved since the LDP is the largest party in the powerful lower house.The 44-year-old son ofmaverick former prime minister Junichiro Koizumiis popular with party members and has won praise for his attempts to address thesoaring rice pricesin his current role as agriculture minister.His main rival, Sanae Takaichi, is a prominent voice on the right of the LDP – a critic of China with strong ideological links to the former prime minister and foreign policy hawk, Shinzo Abe, who wasassassinatedin 2022.View image in fullscreenCandidates for the LDP presidential election campaign in Tokyo.Photograph: AFLO/ShutterstockBut a victory for 64-year-old Takaichi, who has voiced admiration for Margaret Thatcher in her quest to build a “strong and prosperous” Japan, could bring more uncertainty, particularly on the international stage.Her brand of ultra-conservative politics could create problems for Japan’s relationship with its neighbours. She has played down Japan’s responsibility for its conduct during the second world war and has made regular pilgrimages toYasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo that honours Japan’s war-dead, including several class-A war criminals.This week she opened her speech in a debate among the leadership candidates by railing against badly behaved inbound tourists and said “economic migrants” who claim refugee status should be sent home.Migration, now a key election battleground amid aboom in tourismand arecord number of foreign residents, has become a focus of the LDP campaign as it attempts to fend off a challenge fromSanseito, a minor populist party that performed well in July’s upper house elections on a “Japanese first” anti-immigration platform.Despite his youth, Koizumi – who as environment minister said the fight against the climate crisis could be “sexy and fun” – is seen as a safer pair of hands. The US-educated hereditary politician, who is married to a former TV presenter and counts surfing among his hobbies, has presented himself as the candidate best placed to revive the LDP’s fortunes, and has won the backing of influential figures in the party.The LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeitolost their lower house majoritya year ago and weredealt a similar blowin upper house elections this summer, leaving the outgoingIshibain charge of an unstable minority government.View image in fullscreenShinjiro Koizumi and Sanae Takaichi campaign in Tokyo.Photograph: AFLO/ShutterstockHis successor will have to move quickly to address public anger over a “money politics” scandal, in which dozens of LDP lawmakers were found to have siphoned unreported profits from the sale of tickets to party gatherings into slush funds.While he has previously supported allowing women to becomereigning empressesand for married couples to useseparate surnames, Koizumi has played down his progressive instincts during the campaign, and echoed Takaichi’s concerns over migration.“The reality is that illegal employment of foreigners, friction with local residents, and deteriorating public safety are causing anxiety among local residents,” he said this week.Tobias Harris, the founder of Japan Foresight, said Koizumi had “moderated some of his more progressive positions on social issues in a bid to appeal to more conservative lawmakers and in general is emphasising the importance of unity and humility for leading the LDP out of its political crisis”.Harris added that there was “a sense that both the parliamentary party and the grassroots party feel alarmed enough about the LDP’s future to gamble on elevating Koizumi … this appears to be Koizumi’s race to lose”.The new leader will be elected by 295 LDP lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members, whose ballots will be converted into an additional 295 votes.If none of the five candidates – all of whom ran unsuccessfully against Ishiba last year – wins more than half of the votes, the top two will immediately enter a runoff, a process that will give MPs’ votes greater weight.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificMigrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

ABS figures released on Wednesday showed consumer price growth accelerated to 3% in the year to August, extending a swift rise from 1.9% in June.That’s at the top of theReserve Bank of Australia’s(RBA) 2% to 3% target range, and moving in the wrong direction after charting a steady path lower since the peaks of 2022.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailNobody wanted to say “mission accomplished” on inflation – certainly not Chalmers. But he, like most of us, was surely thinking it.But how worried should we be? Is the inflation dragon stirring again, just as the green shoots are starting to emerge from the scorched earth it left behind?There are reasons to relax. The “headline” inflation figure is being buffeted by one-offs – not least the surge in power prices compared to a year ago as electricity bill subsidies expire.The monthly inflation numbers also offer only a partial picture.The RBA’s chief economist, Sarah Hunter, told a parliamentary committee on Monday that the monthly consumer price figures were unreliable and that the central bank had expected the end of electricity subsidies would push the headline number back to 3% in early 2026.Australia, along with other OECD countries, is mired in mediocrity – and the RBA seems intent on keeping us there | Greg JerichoRead moreEconomists, however, have been shaken by this week’s data. Barrenjoey’s head of economic forecasting, Johnathan McMenamin, reckons Wednesday’s release represents “one of the worst-case scenarios for the inflation data”.Like other analysts, McMenamin points to persistently strong price increases in services, like hairdressing, eating out, takeaway and household services.Construction costs are also coming back and rent inflation has stopped slowing.“This inflation bumpiness tells us maybe the speed limit of the economy is lower than we thought,” McMenamin says – by which he means it doesn’t take much of a lift in activity to stir up inflation again.To be clear: nobody istalking about a rate hike. More persistent inflation means that instead of a rate cut in November, we may not get a reduction until closer to mid-2026.“We’ve really pushed out the expectation for rate cuts until later in the first half of next year, potentially in May,” McMenamin says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After jobseekers receive five demerits in the mutual obligation system, they enter what is called the “penalty zone”, where they risk having their payment completely cancelled.Kelly’s jobseeker payments were cut off during a hospital stay for psychosis. It’s far from an isolated caseRead morePayment cancellations have been paused since July last year after the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations, which runs the system, saidit had unlawfully cancelled the paymentsof 964 people.But the Economic Justice Australia chief executive, Kate Allingham, said the organisation had used public payment cancellation data and recent legal cases to determine that the number is a lot higher.“We pulled this together and put it to the department to ask them whether or not we were correct, and we were,” Allingham said.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“The system is being applied unlawfully at worst, and it’s defective administration at best. It’s thousands and thousands of people who are having really serious consequences because there are errors in the automated processes.”EJA believes about 20% of the people affected could be eligible for some form of remediation and, while it is not considering a class action currently, it is “looking at options for litigation”.Legally, payments are not allowed to be cancelled for 28 days after someone has missed a mutual obligation and providers are under no obligation to check why a person has not engaged. The cancellations, which may have affected people on jobseeker, youth allowance, parenting payment or disability support pension, happened before 28 days.In 2021, “Jane”, who asked that her real name not be used, had just enrolled in the government’s New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS), which helped unemployed Australians start their own business.Participants in the NEIS did not have to attend job provider meetings but Jane was enrolled with employment provider Wise, which then suspended and cancelled her payment after she did not show up for a meeting.“I started receiving random calls, text messages from Wise employment,” she said.“They just started harassing me throughout the year while I was in this small business program, and I complained to Centrelink over and over and over again.”Jane, who is now 45 and lives in public housing in Melbourne, had been told in writing that because she was doing the NEIS she did not have to engage. She repeatedly contacted Centrelink about it but Wise continued to contact her. Then, in late 2020, her payment was suspended and was cancelled before 28 days had elapsed.She had about $800 in the bank, which she lived off for several months.“I didn’t pay my power bills, I didn’t pay my rent, I just couldn’t afford to pay it,” she said.“I would survive on just very simple food, like bread and cereal, and I would have flour, so I would make muffins.”After she ran out of money, Sarah applied for jobseeker and tried to take her case to the tribunal but gave up because it was too much.“I was actively trying to fight what had happened. I was trying to seek advice,” she said.Australia’s mutual obligation system is broken. Can apologies and reviews save it from suspension?Read moreA spokesperson for the Antipoverty Centre, Kristin O’Connell, said the problem extends beyond cancellations to payment suspensions, which are triggered by a provider.“What is fundamental to this is that while some of these processes can progress automatically, every single one of these things involves an unlawful decision by a human being at the beginning of the process,” O’Connell said.Every month, payments for tens of thousands of recipients are still being suspended, government data shows. Between January and April this year, there were 157,680 payment suspensions.O’Connell said the government should immediately pause payment suspension while the commonwealth ombudsman finishes its current investigation into the legality of the system.“And the next most urgent thing that they need to do is to generously compensate every single person who has been affected by an unlawful decision,” she said.“Because it is not just about people not receiving the income they needed to live on for the period of time that they lost their payment, it is about the extraordinary distress and harm and the consequences in people’s lives.”Both the department and the employment minister, Amanda Rishworth, were contacted and asked how long they had been aware of the EJA report and how accurate the analysis was. Both refused to answer.In a statement, Rishworth said the department had “assured” her that when the issues were detected they “quickly paused them”.“Our government understands the importance of ensuring that systems and processes operate effectively, particularly when they interact with vulnerable people,” she said.Explore more on these topicsCentrelinkWelfarenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s been a long time since someone on the right has captured the narrative the way he has. We’ve heard for a long time about his leadership potential. I think we’re seeing him really grow into himself.”Another supporter, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: “At some point someone needs to have a backbone and do what’s right and not what’s popular. Hastie is filling that void.”Liberal sources are downplaying any immediate threat to Ley with a majority of the party room, including the bulk of conservative MPs, unwilling to entertain the distraction of a leadership contest so early in the term.But Hastie’s interventions have fast-tracked consideration of the alternative.It is not just an alternative leader for the party, but an alternative brand of rightwing politics anchored in flag-waving patriotism, faith, family and a fight for what its proponents see as “western civilisation” itself.The most high-profile exponent of which is Abbott.View image in fullscreenThen prime minister Tony Abbott (L) with Andrew Hastie in 2015. After entering parliament, Hastie joined Abbott in fighting against same-sex marriage and helping to kill the national energy guaranteepolicy.Photograph: Richard Wainwright/AAPMultiple Liberals aligned with Ley, who spoke to Guardian Australia on the condition of anonymity, strongly suspect Abbott and the rightwing campaign outfit Advance are influencing, if not orchestrating, Hastie’s disruptive interventions.After entering parliament in 2015, the young religious conservative joined Abbott in fighting againstsame-sex marriageand helping to kill thenational energy guaranteepolicy that hastened Malcolm Turnbull’s demise.Two of Hastie’s new focus areas – dumping net zero and cutting immigration levels – are long-running campaigns of Abbott and Advance, which have enthusiastically promoted the Liberals MP’s interventions.Abbott declined to comment and Advance denied it was “orchestrating” Hastie’s campaign.“Advance will always encourage politicians who align with our supporters and criticise those who don’t. Nothing more, nothing less,” the group’s executive director, Matthew Sheahan, said.One Liberal noted that just like Abbott, Hastie’s political mission was shaped by a global culture war being fought on the political right to preserve supposed threats to “western values”.The two men are advisers to the UK-basedAlliance for Responsibility Citizenship, whose stated mission is to “re-lay the foundations of civilisation”.Hastie pointed to this struggle in a social media post marking the shooting death of the US conservative political activist,Charlie Kirk.He wrote that Kirk’s murder was itself an attack on western civilisation, the result of “many of our intellectual class” not believing in western values.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile Israel, which has won the contest four times since its debut in 1973, has continued to compete for the past two years despite disputes over its participation.Boththe 2024 contest in Malmö, Sweden, andthis year’s event in Basel, Switzerland, were marked by pro-Palestine protests around the concert halls.Next year’s Eurovision, the 70th anniversary of the song contest, is due to be held in the Austrian capital, Vienna, in May.Its hosting broadcaster ORF earlier this week expressed optimism that the event would go ahead even in the case of boycotts and resulting loss of broadcasters’ contributions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is now expected to enter jail within a matter of months.It is a spectacular downfall and a turning point in France’s long-running struggle to deal with graft and criminal allegations against politicians.Sarkozy’s sentence is the first time in modern French history that a former president has been ordered to turn up at the prison gates and serve time inside. Criminal investigations and trials of serving and former French politicians are not new, and voters’ trust in elected officials’ integrity has been in steady decline, but judges in Sarkozy’s trial appeared to want to send a message that politicians will not get an easy ride.As Sarkozy, 70, sat in court flanked by his wife, the singer Carla Bruni Sarkozy, and his three adult sons, judges surprised the public benches by ordering a particularly strict special provision that means Sarkozy will be incarcerated by appointment at a future date no later than 13 February. He has been summoned to a first meeting with the state prosecutor on 13 October to fix a date.1:46'I am innocent': Nicolas Sarkozy given five-year prison sentence after Libya trial – videoThe head judge, Nathalie Gavarino, justified the sentence by saying the facts of the case were of an “exceptional gravity” and “likely to undermine citizens’ trust”.Sarkozy was found guilty of criminal conspiracy over efforts by close aides to procure funds for his successful 2007 presidential bid from Libya during Gaddafi’s time in power. Gaddafi was overthrown and killed in 2011.Sarkozy has always denied wrongdoing in the case. Even though he will appeal against his court conviction, the special provision means his jail sentence will still stand while that appeal process goes ahead. Sarkozy, protesting his innocence, said bitterly outside court that he would probably “have to appear in handcuffs at my appeal”.In 2011, the rightwing Jacques Chirac, then aged 79, became the first former president to beconvicted of corruption, after embezzlement charges in a party funding scandal relating to his time as mayor of Paris. In a historic first, he was given a two-year suspended prison sentence. He did not take part in his trial after doctors determined he suffered from severe memory lapses. But Chirac, a self-styled affable rogue who had one of the longest political careers in Europe, maintained a high level of popularity despite the conviction until his death aged 86.For Sarkozy, things are very different. His political legacy now appears almost impossible to rebuild. “In the popular imagination, criminal conspiracy really suggests mafia-like behaviour,” said Bruno Cautrès, a political scientist. “It’s associated with serious organised crime.”When Sarkozy told reporters outside court that he was innocent, he questioned the justice system and the rule of law, ramping up his rhetoric to suggest his sentence was the fault of “those who hate me”, hinting at some kind of deep-state conspiracy.This comes as the French justice system has sought over the past year to show that it will be firm not just on past presidents but those with future presidential ambitions.After a nine-weektrial, the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen was found guilty in March of theembezzlement of European parliamentary fundsthrough a fake jobs scam of an unprecedented scale and duration. She was banned from running for office for five years with immediate effect, which could prevent her from making a fourth bid for the French presidency in 2027.The fact that her sentence was given with immediate effect was a shock to Le Pen, who protested against it, accusing a “tyranny of judges” of making a “political decision” against her. Her appeal trial begins in January.Nicolas Sarkozy stripped of Legion of Honour over corruption convictionRead moreWhen Sarkozy was sentenced on Thursday, Le Pen was also quick to criticise judges for giving him a sentence that would take swift effect and not be suspended during an appeals process.Sarkozy already has a considerable backstory with the French justice system. Although the allegations of a secret campaign funding pact with the Libyan regime were the biggest corruption trial he had faced, he had already been convicted in two separate cases and stripped of France’s highest distinction, the Legion of Honour.In the first case, Sarkozy was convicted of corruption and influence peddling over illegal attempts tosecure favoursfrom a judge. He was given a one-year jail term, which he served this year with an electronic tag for three months without going to prison, before being granted conditional release – a first for a former head of state.In a second case, Sarkozy was convicted ofhiding illegal overspendingin the 2012 presidential election that he lost to the Socialist candidate, François Hollande. He has appealed against both convictions.Despite those convictions, Sarkozy has until now maintained influence – key figures in French politics have still flocked to meet and consult him. He recently met the new prime ministerSébastien Lecornu, who has yet to form a new government, and over the summer he met the far-right leader Jordan Bardella, president of Le Pen’s National Rally party.Once in jail, Sarkozy, like any other prisoner, will be able to petition for release or a sentence commuted to electronic bracelet. He would like to maintain his political influence and reputation as he appeals. But nothing is less certain.Explore more on these topicsNicolas SarkozyFranceEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

Flights were halted for several hours at Aalborg airport, which also serves as a military base, and Billund, Denmark’s second biggest airport, closed its airspace for nearly an hour.Airports in Esbjerg, Sønderborg and Skrydstrup – home to some of the Danish military’s fighter jets -were also affected. Copenhagen airport was forced to close on Monday night as a result of the presence of three drones.Von der Leyen backed plans earlier this month for drone defences, but details have until now been scant. The commission’s spokesperson on defence, Thomas Regnier, said the meeting would be a chance to discuss capabilities while stressing the challenges.“One thing that we will have to do is detect these incoming drones. This is not super-easy to do. We’re not talking about big fighter jets and planes coming in. No, we are talking about the latest technology developments. These drones have to be detected, and then, second track [will be to decide] what will we do to fight back against these drones,” he said.Ministers from Denmark, the three Baltic states, Finland, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria are expected to take part in the meeting. The commission has indicated that a drone wall could be funded by theEU’s €150bn (£131bn) Security Action for Europe loans scheme.Denmark’s defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, told a press conference: “There can be no doubt that everything points to this being the work of a professional actor when we are talking about such a systematic operation in so many locations at virtually the same time. This is what I would define as a hybrid attack using different types of drones.“This is an arms race against time because technology is constantly evolving.”The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said she had spoken to theNatosecretary general, Mark Rutte, about “the serious situation related to drones over Danish airports”.Map of affected airportsAmong the theories being investigated in relation to the Copenhagen airport incursion is that the drones were launched from the sea. Police said they were looking at a number of vessels of interest. They did not name any, but online ship trackers show that two Russian ships were in the area at the time. The Danish broadcaster TV2 suggested they could have been appropriately positioned for Wednesday’s incidents.The Russian embassy in Copenhagen rejected any speculation that Moscow had been involved in the incidents as absurd, and described the disruptions as a “staged provocation” to escalate tensions.Police in Denmark and Sweden said they were investigating a number of reports of drone sightings, including over Danish oilfields and Stockholm. Danish ministers have said Copenhagen is “not ruling out anything in terms of who is behind this”.Poulsen said Denmark was considering activating Nato’s article 4 for the first time in Danish history, but a decision had not yet been made. “In addition to article 4, there are other things that can be done through Nato,” he said.Rutte said Nato was taking the situation “very seriously”. “Nato allies and Denmark are working together on how we can ensure the safety and security of our critical infrastructure,” he said.View image in fullscreenFlights were halted for several hours at Aalborg airport.Photograph: Bo Amstrup/ReutersThe government has faced criticism in recent days for not shooting down the drones. Poulsen said the Danish armed forces had “a number of capabilities”, but that they would like to have more.The justice minister, Peter Hummelgaard, said the country would seek additional ways to neutralise drones, including proposing legislation to allow infrastructure owners to shoot them down.The drone flights follow similar incursions in Poland and Romania and the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets, incidents that have raised tensions in light of Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine.“The threat from hybrid attacks is here to stay,” said Hummelgaard, describing recent events as “deeply worrying incidents across Europe”.Is Copenhagen drone incursion further evidence of Russian interest in allied airspace?Read morePoulsen said the drones may have been launched in the “immediate area” of Denmark. “I can’t describe where they came from, but not over a long distance. It’s happening here locally,” he said.Military drone experts said it would technically be possible to have flown the drones from far away avoiding detection – especially if using 5G – using a method known as groundhugging, or they could have been launched from nearby, controlled by a pilot who could be anywhere in the world.The director of the Danish military drone producer Hecto Drone, Andreas Kold Siggaard, said jamming the signal would not make a difference in stopping an advanced drone. “Jamming is not an option. There is not much you can do other than shoot them down or using some kind of kinetic impact, drone-on-drone combat basically,” he said.Danish police said the sightings on Wednesday night followed a similar pattern to the ones that shut down Copenhagen airport on Monday.According to North Jutland police, “more than one drone” was seen near Aalborg airport flying with lights on. The first was seen at about 9.44pm local time and drones were still in the airspace after midnight.Frederiksen has described the drone incursion that shut Copenhagen airport for several hours on Monday as the “most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date”.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkAir transportDrones (non-military)RussiaNatoEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The proposal suggests that Gita could at first be based in el-Arish, an Egyptian provincial capital near Gaza’s southern border, and would eventually enter the territory accompanied by a UN-endorsed, largely Arab multinational force. The plan envisions “the eventual unifying of all the Palestinian territory under the PA”.Under the plan, Palestinians would not be made to leave the territory, as had been feared would occur underprevious US proposals to develop it as the “Gaza Riviera”.If approved, Blair would head a secretariat of up to 25 people and chair a seven-person board to oversee an executive body running the territory.But any role for the former Labour leader would inevitably prompt intense controversy. After stepping down as prime minister in 2007, he took onthe role of Middle East envoy until 2015and he enjoys a high standing with many Gulf leaders. But Blair is bitterly resented by many Palestinians – who see him as having impeded their efforts to attain statehood – and more broadly across the region for his role in backing the 2003 US invasion of Iraq.Some western diplomats stressed it was by no means a done deal that Blair would run the interim Palestinian administration, and said it might be in place for only two years.They added the Trump plan for the day after is linked to a ceasefire and full hostage deal.News of the plan emerged just days afterthe UN general assembly endorsed a different plan for a technocratic administration to take charge in Gaza. Under that proposal, known as the New York declaration, the interim administration would operate for just one year, on the clear understanding that it would then hand power to a reformed PA with a revised constitution and after elections for a new president and parliament.The lack of a clear timeline for a transition to PA control under the White House plan is seen as a potential roadblock to its endorsement by Palestinians and Arab leaders. But that lack of specificity, and the presence of Blair, would be seen as a reassurance for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.The White House sees the new plan as a compromise betweenDonald Trump’s own initial proposal for the US and Israel to “take over” Gazaand theNew York declaration endorsed by more than 140 states. Trump’s previous suggestions that the US and Israel could “clean out” Palestinians from Gaza would amount to an ethnic cleansingof the population of about 2 million people. Under the new plan, Palestinians would not be encouraged to leave the territory, according to the reports.A broad version of the US-backed plan was laid out by Trump at a meeting in New York on Wednesday with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani; the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud; ​​King Abdullah II of Jordan; the president of Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto; and Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Trump said the meeting had been successful, adding “we’re close to getting some kind of deal done”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has been trying to reconcile the two proposals.Arab states have said they will only contribute to a UN-mandated international peacekeeping force if there is a clear political timeline to the formation of a Palestinian state, and some may argue that the Blair plan does not set out an irreversible course to statehood, but instead represents a different, more benign occupation than that provided by Israel.Gita would have a board made up of seven to 10 members, who will include “at least one qualified Palestinian representative (potentially from the business or security sector)”, a senior UN official, leading international figures with executive or financial experience, and a “strong representation of Muslim members”.Reporting to an executive secretariat would be a group of five commissioners who will supervise key areas of Gaza governance: humanitarian affairs, reconstruction, legislation and legal affairs, security and PA coordination.Notably, the plan states that the commissioner overseeing humanitarian affairs will be responsible for coordinating with humanitarian agencies, including the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which most Arab states and humanitarian agencies insist must be dismantled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Abbas and the Palestinian Authority only administer the West Bank, and do not have a direct role in negotiations over a ceasefire or postwar planning for Gaza.He said that Gaza was an “integral part of the state of Palestine, and that we are ready to bear full responsibility for governance and security there”.Abbas addressed the gathering by video conference afterhis visa was revoked by the USin the run-up to the 80th session of the UN general assembly.On Thursday evening at the White House, Trump pushed back strongly on any suggestion Israel could annex parts of the West Bank. He said: “I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. Nope. I won’t allow it.

But sources inside national federations said events appeared to be coming to a head and thatUefaand its president, Aleksander Ceferin, were increasingly expected to take action.There have been an increasing number of interventions away from the game. On Tuesday, a group of senior diplomats called on Uefa and Fifa to enact a ban after the publication of a report by the United Nations independent international commission of inquiry thatfound Israel was committing genocidein Gaza. Last week, the campaign group Game Over Israel took over a billboard in New York’s Times Square to call for federations to boycott any matches with the country.It is understood that voices within the game have also been speaking up in private, including those from the club world.Italy is one of the countries under pressure to act. TheAzzurri, along with Norway, are due to face Israel in the next round of qualifiers, with their match scheduled for 14 October in Udine. Italy is fresh from a24-hour general strikein protest against Israel’s behaviour in Gaza.Gabriele Gravina, the president of the Italian football federation, who sits on the Uefa exco, said this week that any boycott “would only favour Israel, who could in theory be boosted in their qualifying path to the tournament”. He also said he “denounced” the suffering in Gaza and that “there is nobody who could be indifferent to this feeling of suffering and pain”.Any decision to suspend the Israel Football Association would be taken in a simple majority vote by the 19 members of Uefa’s exco. Insiders suggest if it were proposed, the vote would have a strong chance of passing with as few as three or four abstentions or votes against. It could, however, have considerable political consequences.The United States government, for example, has warned it would stand against any such decision, with the country co-hosting theWorld Cupnext summer. “We will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel’s national soccer team from the World Cup,” a spokesperson for the US Department of State told Sky News.Any suspension would mean Uefa removing a participant from a Fifa-organised competition. Fifa, under its president, Gianni Infantino, has developed astrong relationship with the Trump administration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Therefore, I believe that Israel should be sanctioned. I hope Uefa will follow the spirit of the statutes.”In cycling, the Canadian sponsor of the Israel-Premier Tech team has called for a name change. Its riders were targeted by protesters at the recent Vuelta a España,causing disruptionto the Grand Tour event.

That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.”It accusesthe pledge circulated by Film Workers for Palestineand signed by stars including Emma Stone, Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman and Mark Ruffalo of being not “an act of conscience” but rather “a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art. To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective and a form of collective punishment.”Israel’s culture minister threatens national film awards after Palestinian story takes top prizeRead moreThe open letter makes the point that much of the Israeli film and TV industry are “often the loudest critics of government policy” – and frequently penalised by them for this. Last week, the winner of Israel’s own academy awards, The Sea – about a Palestinian boy who risks death to go to the beach in Tel Aviv – was submitted as the country’s entry to the Oscars. This led to the Israeli sports and culture minister vowing to cut funding from the awards.“When artists boycott fellow artists based solely on their country of origin, it is blatant discrimination and a betrayal of our role as storytellers,” added Messing in a statement.The initial pledge was published on 8 September and was signed by some 1,200 professionals – rising overnight to 4,000 and now standing at around 5,000 – who vowed not to work with Israeli film institutions they say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”.Israeli film industry calls boycott pledge ‘deeply troubling’Read more“As film-makers, actors, film industry workers and institutions, we recognise the power of cinema to shape perceptions,”the pledgereads. “In this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror.”In the immediate wake of the pledge, many in the Israeli industry expressed considerable disquiet about the boycott, with representatives from the country’s producing, directing, screenwriting and documentary divisions saying the move was misguided and would only “deepen the darkness”.The following week, studio Paramount also condemned the boycott in a statement which read: “Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace. The global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world. We need more engagement and communication – not less.”The full open letterTo our fellow artists and the global film community,We know the power of film. We know the power of story. That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.The pledge circulated under the banner of “Film Workers for Palestine” is not an act of conscience. It is a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art.To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective, and a form of collective punishment.Israel’s film industry includes groundbreaking, celebratory, and critical projects about Palestinians and Jews, which many of you have lauded and celebrated. Israel’s film community is restless, argumentative, and independent, where directors challenge ministers and many of the very festivals you target, consistentlyprogramdissent.Israel’s entertainment industry is a vibrant hub of collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian artists and creatives, who work together every single day to tell complex stories that entertain and inform both communities and the world. Israeli film institutions are not government entities. They are often the loudest critics of government policy.The pledge uses nebulous terms like“implicating” and“complicity.” Who will decide which Israeli film-makers and film institutions are“complicit”? A McCarthyist committee with blacklists? Or is“complicity” just a pretextto boycott all Israelis and Zionists– 95% of the world’s Jewish population–no matter what they create or believe?History warns us. Censorship has been used to silence film-makers before: Nazi Germany’s propaganda machine, Soviet censorship, and even Hollywood’s own blacklists. Every time it was dressed up as virtue. And every time it was oppression. Every time, its targets expanded.We know that many of you have good intentions and believe you are standing for peace. But your names are being weaponised and tied to lies and discrimination. This pledge erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimises falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame.If you want peace, call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages. Support film-makers who create dialogue across communities. Stand against Hamas.Let art speak the whole truth.We call on all our colleagues in the entertainment industry to reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace.Explore more on these topicsFilmIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Girls were less likely to enjoy being at school while the boys made less effort with their school work.Only half of low-income white children said they worked hard at school, compared with about 70% of disadvantaged pupils of south Asian ethnicity.Ethnicity not key factor in England school exclusions, study findsRead moreThe study measured pupils’ levels of engagement in questionnaires taken by children at more than 120 schools, which tested response to statements such as “I don’t feel bored at school” and “What I learn at school will help me in the future”.Prof John Jerrim ofUniversity College London’s social research institute, who conducted the study, said the results revealed a difficult problem for policymakers at a time when improving education for white working class children was high on the political agenda.“What you do see is that even on entry to secondary school, white working-class pupils tend to have lower levels of various measures of school engagement than other groups, both more advantaged groups and pupils of different ethnicity,” Jerrim said.“It’s different across boys and girls. Girls struggle more with certain aspects such as peer relationships and enjoyment of school, whereas among white working-class boys, it’s more around valuing school and effort.“One of the questions we asked is about self-reported effort and that’s probably the most interesting part where white working-class pupils stick out. If you ask them ‘how much effort are you putting into school?’, they really stand out from other groups in a bad way, and it’s because they are not properly engaged.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

US B61-12 nuclear bombs now stored at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk would be made available for use by the British jets in the event of a major war.Four years ago the UK said it would lift the cap on the number of warheads it could stockpile by 40% to 260 for its existing nuclear deterrent, the submarine-launched Trident system. It was the first time the UK had said it would increase its nuclear capability since the end of the cold war.Sophie Bolt, the CND general secretary, accused the government of “yet another breach of international law” and of “escalating nuclear dangers in the world”. She called on MPs to discuss the UK’s nuclear intentions, arguing that the F-35A purchase plan had been announced “without parliamentary debate or scrutiny”.The Ministry of Defence said the investment in 12 new F-35A aircraft would improve the UK’s national security. “The UK remains committed to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons and upholds all our obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty,” a spokesperson said.Other countries are also rearming and redeploying nuclear weapons as tensions rise. The US moved B61-12 bombs to Lakenheathin July, while Russia has said it hasmoved nuclear missiles to Belarus. China is increasing its arsenal by 100 warheads a year and plans to reach 1,500 by 2035, according to theStockholm Peace Research Institute.The nuclear non-proliferation treaty came into force in 1970 with article six a core component and has been signed by the world’s largest nuclear powers – the US, Russia, China and France. A handful of countries with nuclear programmes – Israel, India, Pakistan – never signed up, and North Korea pulled out in 2003.Explore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsDefence policyInternational lawMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

Eurostar, majority-owned by the French state-owned SNCF, maintains that the stops are unviable, but new competing train operators are hoping to enter the market.In a speech in Ashford on Friday, the rail minister, Lord Peter Hendy, is expected to say he has encouraged train firms to work with the region’s councils and businesses to “explore solutions” for Kent, adding: “I firmly believe that competition offers the best prospect of international services returning to Kent stations, and welcome the recent announcements that several new entrants are exploring the possibility of serving Ashford, Ebbsfleet and Stratford International stations.”He will say he has made written representations to the independent regulator, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), “to make clear our support for competition and the benefits this brings, including the potential for services to be reinstated at Kent stations”.View image in fullscreenLord Peter Hendy, the rail minister, has said the government ‘strongly welcomes’ the idea of competitors at unused international stations.Photograph: Piero Cruciatti/AlamyThe ORR isdue to adjudicate next monthon whether other firms will be given access to a critical London train depot for international services, Temple Mills, currently occupied solely by Eurostar, whichmaintains there is no space, given its own expansion plans.In a letter to the regulator, Hendy said the government “strongly welcomes” the fact that potential competitors could go to the unused international stations, concluding: “The government believes these are important considerations for ORR in determining the various access applications.”Potential competitors includeRichard Branson’s Virgin Group, the British startup Gemini Trains and a partnership between the Italian state rail operator, FS Italiane, and the Spanish company Evolyn.Campaigners are focused particularly on reopening Ashford International, which is nearest the Channel tunnel and was part of the Kent economy which owed significant development to new high-speed rail links.Helena Dollimore, MP for nearby Hastings and Rye, has campaigned in and out of parliament for the restoration of the station. She estimates it would cost about £2m-£3.5m to reopen the station with border controls, including new EES (Entry/Exit System) kiosks.She said: “I used to go to Ashford when I was little to get the train across the Channel. We really miss that link with our neighbours – but for our constituents it is also jobs, business, and opportunities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The British taxpayer spent £80m on it – it’s a no-brainer to get it up and running again because of the benefits it would bring: more jobs, more visitors more tourism. It’s crazy they have lost that closest European link.”For Kent residents travelling to London for Eurostar, reopening Ashford International would reduce return train journey times to Paris and Brussels by at least two or three hours respectively. A report by the Good Growth Foundation claims it could deliver up to £2.7bn in economic growth over five years, and bring in half a million more visitors per year to the region.A Eurostar spokesperson said: “Our Kent stations will remain closed throughout 2025 and will be reviewed in 2026. We understand that this may be frustrating, and we want to stress that we are closely monitoring the situation.”Only 4% of passengers used Ashford or Ebbsfleet in 2019, with about 50 passengers from Ashford on peak services, according to Eurostar.Explore more on these topicsRail transportEurostarTransportnewsShareReuse this content"

He dismissed the Conservative party as “basically dead”.During his speech on Friday, he will set out his view that the far right is injecting a “poisonous” discourse into national life, saying: “At its heart – its most poisonous belief – on full display at the protests here in London, just a week or two ago, that there is a coming struggle, a defining struggle, a violent struggle for the nation. For all our nations.“Now – you don’t need to be a historian to know where that kind of poison can lead. You can just feel it. A language that is naked in its attempt to intimidate.”But he will also explain his belief that immigration and borders need to be controlled, saying: “For too many years it’s been too easy for people to come here, slip into the shadow economy and remain here illegally.”Starmer will add: “It is not compassionate leftwing politics to rely on labour that exploits foreign workers and undercuts fair wages. But the simple fact that every nation needs to have control over its borders.”In an article for the Telegraph, Starmer said he believed thatLabourpreviously got it wrong on migration.He also argued that it was legitimate to have concerns about immigration levels, while rejecting Reform’s “toxic” and divisive approach.Starmer said: “There is no doubt that for years leftwing parties, including my own, did shy away from people’s concerns around illegal immigration. It has been too easy for people to enter the country, work in the shadow economy and remain illegally.”The Guardianrevealed in Junethat Downing Street was exploring proposals for a digital ID card to crack down on illegal migration, rogue landlords and exploitative work.The idea came from a Labour Together paper given to the No 10 policy unit proposing a Brit Card, which it claimed could help avoid another Windrush scandal.The thinktank also said it would help reduce vast numbers of visa overstayers, saying half of those whose asylum claims were turned down over the past 14 years were probably still in the UK. It proposed a free, secure digital ID, stored on a person’s smartphone using a planned gov.uk Wallet app, rebranded as the Brit Card app. That could then be verified by employers, immigration, banks and landlords using free software.Under the likely plans, the technology is expected to be built on the government’s existing “One Login” infrastructure, which already allows citizens to access about 50 government services, from applying for a job as a teacher to using a lasting power of attorney.The report’s author and the thinktank’s director of technology, Kirsty Innes, is now a special adviser to Liz Kendall, the technology secretary. When the paper was published, she said: “A progressive society can only work if we have meaningful borders. BritCard would make it far harder to flout the illegal work and illegal rent rules, and far easier to identify and punish exploitative illegal employers and landlords.”The plans were welcomed by the Tony Blair Institute, with its director of government innovation,Alexander Iosad, saying: “Make no mistake, if the government announces a universal digital ID to help improve our public services, it would be one of the most important steps taken by this or any government to make British citizens’ everyday lives easier and build trust.”However, they were opposed by David Davis, the Conservative MP and former cabinet minister, who led the charge against Blair’s ID cards decades ago.Davis said: “No system is immune to failure, and we have seen time and again governments and tech giants fail to protect people’s personal data. If world-leading companies cannot protect our data, I have little faith that Whitehall would be able to do better.”The Liberal Democrats said they could not support “a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives”.The Conservatives did not give a position, but its leader, Kemi Badenoch, said: “There are arguments for and against digital ID, but mandating its use would be a very serious step that requires a proper national debate.“Instead, this is a throwaway conference announcement designed to distract attention from Andy Burnham’s leadership manoeuvrings and the crisis in Downing Street over the prime minister’s chief of staff.”Jim Killock, the executive director of Open Rights Group, highlighted that the digital ID card scheme was not in Labour’s manifesto, arguing that it was “the last thing this government should be embarking on during a cost of living crisis”.“The digital visa schemes that are already in place for migrants are a stark warning of the harms caused by data errors, systems failures and an indifferent, hostile Home Office. People have been unable to travel, lost job offers and even been made homeless because of existing digital ID schemes,” he said.“Labour are at risk of creating a digital surveillance infrastructure that will change everyone’s daily lives and establish a pre-crime state where we constantly have to prove who we are as we go about our daily lives.”David Rennie, a former official at the Home Office’s identity cards programme and now chief trust officer at the startup Orchestrating Identity, said it was “absurd” to suggest a digital identity would stop illegal migration.“Proposing a headline-grabbing ‘government digital identity for all’ as a way of combating illegal migration shows a lack of understanding or learning from the last 20 years,” he said. “Employers already have to prove a prospective employee’s right-to-work in the UK or receive a £45k fine.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerLabourImmigration and asylumPrivacyData and computer securitynewsShareReuse this content"

He was later released. The reasons for his arrest are unknown.The Metropolitan police were contacted for comment.Separately, in August, the Guardian successfully defended a libel action brought by Clarke over an investigation in which he was accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women.Mrs Justice Steyn rejected Clarke’s claims and ruled the newspaper had succeeded in both its defences, of truth and public interest.The 49-year-old had claimed the allegations in the Guardian’s investigation were false and that he had been the victim of an unlawful conspiracy.In her ruling at the high court in London, Steyn said she accepted some of Clarke’s evidence, “but overall I find that he was not a credible or reliable witness”.His “general pattern” was “of only being prepared to admit that which was established by documentary evidence (which he had carefully studied), and even then only to the minimum extent shown”.Steyn said there had been no conspiracy to lie, and the conspiracy claim did not have a “proper foundation”.The Guardian relied on testimony from almost 30 people, 26 of whom spoke in court about their experiences of working with the actor.Many said they had been directly affected by Clarke, while others said they had witnessed inappropriate behaviour.The writer and producer of the Kidulthood trilogy had sued Guardian News & Media (GNM) over seven articles and a podcast published between April 2021 and March 2022 in which more than 20 women accused him of sexual misconduct.London-born Clarke rose to fame as Mickey Smith during the Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant eras of Doctor Who, between 2005 and 2010. He also appeared in films such as Star Trek Into Darkness and SAS: Rise of the Black Swan.As an actor, writer and director, he became a powerful figure in the British film industry after making the series Kidulthood, Adulthood and Brotherhood and starring in the police drama Bulletproof.In 2009, he won the rising star prize at the Bafta film awards, and in 2021 was given Bafta’s outstanding British contribution to cinema honour. The award and his Bafta membership were suspended when the Guardian’s allegations were published in 2021.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The company had previously argued that it had improved its Prime enrolment and cancellation processes and that the FTC’s allegations were out of date.“We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world,” the company said.Amazon shares traded broadly flat in New York after the announcement.The company is facing a separate case brought by the FTC that the company built and maintained anillegal monopoly. The trial, presided over by the same judge as the Prime case, is set to go to trial in 2027.The case was part of a salvo of lawsuits brought around the same time against US tech giants accusing them of abusing their dominance at the expense of smaller competitors. In the ensuing legal proceedings, Google was declared anillegalmonopolybut escaped an outright breakup, the most severe penalty sought by the government.Explore more on these topicsAmazonConsumer affairsE-commerceLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

It cites a law in Delaware, where Disney is incorporated, that says shareholders can receive materials around board discussion “to investigate potential wrongdoing, mismanagement and breach of fiduciary duty by members [of the board]”.Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comments.The company first suspended Kimmel’s show “indefinitely” on 17 September, after the network airedcommentsKimmel made about Charlie Kirk’s killing saying “the Maga gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it”.The next day, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair,Brendan Carr, criticized Kimmel’s comments and said that the regulatory agency would be willing to throw its weight behind making sure the companies airing Kimmel’s show are held accountable.The rise and fall of Disney: how the company found then lost its backboneRead more“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said. “These companies can find ways to change conduct to take action on Kimmel, or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”Soon after, Nexstar Media Group, a major owner of ABC affiliates, announced it wouldpreempt Kimmel’s show, calling Kimmel’s comments “offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse”.

This is not about bad content on the internet, it’s about careless product design. Meta’s conscious product design and implementation choices are selecting, promoting, and bringing inappropriate content, contact and compulsive use to children every day.”The research drew on “test accounts” imitating the behaviour of a teenager, a parent and a malicious adult, which it used to analyse 47 safety tools in March and June 2025.Using a green, yellow and red rating system, it found that 30 tools were in the red category, meaning they could be easily circumvented or evaded with less than three minutes of effort, or had been discontinued. Only eight received the green rating.Findings from the test accounts included that adults were easily able to message teenagers who do not follow them, despite this being supposedly blocked in teen accounts – although the report notes that Meta fixed this after the testing period. It remains the case that minors can initiate conversations with adults on Reels, and that it is difficult to report sexualised or offensive messages, the report found.They also found the “hidden words” feature failed to block offensive language as claimed, with the researchers able to send “you are a whore and you should kill yourself” without any prompts to reconsider, or filtering or warnings provided to the recipient.Meta says this feature only applies to unknown accounts, not followers, which users can block.Algorithms showed inappropriate sexual or violent content, with the “not interested” feature failing to work effectively, and autocomplete suggestions actively recommending search terms and accounts related to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and illegal substances, the researchers established.The researchers also noted that several widely publicised time-management tools intended to curb addictive behaviours appeared to have been discontinued – although Meta said the functionality remained but had since been renamed – and spotted hundreds of reels showing users claiming to be under 13, despite Meta’s claims to block this.The report said Meta “continues to design its Instagram reporting features in ways that will not promote real-world adoption”.In a foreword to the reportco-authored by Ian Russell, the founder of the Molly Rose Foundation, and Maurine Molak, the co-founder of David’s Legacy Foundation and Parents for Safe Online Spaces, both of whose children died by suicide after being bombarded by hateful content online, the parents said Meta’s new safety measures were “woefully ineffective”.As a result, they believe the UK’s Online Safety Act must be strengthened to “compel companies to systematically reduce the harm their platforms cause by compelling their services to be safe by design”.The report further asks that the regulator, Ofcom, become “bolder and more assertive” in enforcing its regulatory scheme.A Meta spokesperson said: “This report repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them today. Teen accounts lead the industry because they provide automatic safety protections and straightforward parental controls.“The reality is teens who were placed into these protections saw less sensitive content, experienced less unwanted contact, and spent less time on Instagram at night. Parents also have robust tools at their fingertips, from limiting usage to monitoring interactions. We’ll continue improving our tools, and we welcome constructive feedback – but this report is not that.”An Ofcom spokesperson said: “We take the views of parents campaigning for children’s online safety very seriously and appreciate the work behind this research.“Our rules are a reset for children online. They demand a safety-first approach in how tech firms design and operate their services in the UK. Make no mistake: sites that don’t comply should expect to face enforcement action.”A government spokesperson said: “Under the Online Safety Act, platforms are now legally required to protect young people from damaging content, including material promoting self-harm or suicide. That means safer algorithms and less toxic feeds. Services that fail to comply can expect tough enforcement from Ofcom. We are determined to hold tech companies to account and keep children safe.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

To do so, Cúrate installed a tank and brought in clean water at the cost of $1,000 a day, racking up $30,000 in water, tank rental and delivery fees.In mid-October, Cúrate – which wona 2022 James Beard Foundation hospitality awardand washonoredas a top wine restaurant from Wine Enthusiast in 2021 – reopened to paying customers. But in order to survive in the post-Helene restaurant market, the restaurant’s owners had to make some changes. The biggest? Closing Cúrate’s sister restaurant, La Bodega, which served lunch.‘It seemed like a ghost town’: LA food vendors on how Trump’s Ice raids affected businessRead more“Post-storm, we needed to shrink the size of our team and shrink the size of our overhead and operating costs pretty quickly to rebuild,” Button said. “We were worried about the impact of tourism and trying to operate two Spanish-themed restaurants downtown.” She opened La Bodega into an event space, which is “easier to manage”, she said.Such recalibrations to survive are emblematic of Asheville’s food scene one year out from Helene, when the city’s existing restaurants have a renewed focus on planning for the future.However, not every restaurant survived. “In spring, it felt like a restaurant was closing once a week,” said Mike McCarty, executive chef of the Lobster Trap. In fact, some of Asheville’s most well-known restaurants closed, including Laughing Seed, one of the region’s oldest vegetarian restaurants; Bouchon, a longtime French restaurant; and Bottle Riot, Vivian and Rhubarb, which were beloved to locals and tourists alike. There were also temporary closures of restaurants flooded by Helene,such as the Bull and Beggar.The executive director of Asheville Independent Restaurants (AIR), Meghan Rogers, noted that Asheville’s restaurant closures are due to a “combination of things”, not simply Helene. Several of the restaurants that shut their doors had owners who were already mulling closures, she said. An Asheville Watchdogreportin June noted the closure of more than 40 businesses, including 15 restaurants, in the downtown area alone.The question restaurateurs are asking themselves now is “if something is on the horizon, how can we better protect our investment?”, said Rogers. For some, she continued, this meant purchasing restaurant-sized generators. But for other restaurants, it meant strategic downsizing of staff and trimming menus. “Overall, [Helene] brought everything back to the basics,” she said.View image in fullscreenThe Laughing Seed Cafe in 2019.Photograph: RidingMetaphor/AlamyWhen Helene knocked out Asheville’s water supply, the local Mellow Mushroom pizzeria had electricity. Beginning the Monday after the storm, co-owner Gerry Mahon said his staff made 1,000 pizzas and gave them away for free for four hours each day. (“The health department said, ‘You can’t sell anything, but since you’re giving it away, we really can’t have any issue with that,’” Mahon said.) Mellow Mushroom offered free pizzas for two weeks and delivered them to rescue teams and residents in areas outside the city.Mahon realized the blows to the Asheville tourism industry would affect his business. “You look up and realize you aren’t going to have a customer base for more than a month,” said Mahon. “That’s more than $300,000 in sales that we lost,” which he called “a bit of an economic hit for us”. Sales have still been down since the hurricane, he said.To survive, Mellow Mushroom cut staff – and its menu. “That was our immediate response, to say, ‘OK, let’s make it where this machine runs more efficiently,’” Mahon said. “If you’re going to lose one in five customers, you naturally benefit by making a menu smaller.” He said the restaurant trimmed 30% of its menu and has decreased the product it inventories by 40%. The smaller menu has received “no complaints at all”, according to Mahon. He surmised that because Mellow Mushroom’s customer base is largely tourists, and they may not even be aware the menu has been pared back.In addition to a slimmed-down offering of food, Mellow Mushroom also employs one-quarter fewer staff. “For as much as I hate to have to save on labor, it was the necessary thing to do,” Mahon said. “We still had to pay our bills.”Other restaurants took a similar tack of downsizing staff. The Market Place, a high-end farm-to-table restaurant also located in downtown Asheville, closed for 70 days following the storm. Chef William Dissen took “a really tempered approach” in reopening after Helene, and cut service from dinner seven days a week and two weekend brunches to dinner only five days a week. “It felt very similar to reopening after Covid: we’re open, [but] that doesn’t mean the crowds are going to come back,” he said.Dissen also relied on advice from others who’ve lived through a similar gut punch to the industry. “I have some friends that live in the New Orleans area,” he said. “[I asked:] ‘What did you do after Katrina?’ They all said: ‘Keep things small, operate your business as small as you can to still try to make a small margin, small profit, and focus on a small menu, small team and cook your heart out.’”Luella’s Bar-B-Que made a similar choice to go leaner with staffing. “We had to trim down out of necessity and we’ve stuck with that model,” said owner Jeff Miller. And Cúrate consolidated both its team and menu, too; it reopened to the public with a downsized menu, although it has returned to its full spate of offerings. Since the closure of its other restaurant La Bodega, Button said her team had since added some of their favorite sandwiches to Cúrate’s menu.Button lost a third of her staff both to layoffs and people moving after the storm, she noted. “These kinds of consolidating decisions that a lot of restaurants are making are important because they’re ensuring the restabilization so we can rebuild and continue with the vibrant food scene that Asheville has,” she said.What’s insurance got to do with it?For many restaurant owners, their Helene experience has been defined by their insurance coverage. Several realized they were not covered for experiencing a loss of business in general, but rather for specific weather-related harm.“All of our businesses are taking a closer look at their insurance policies,” noted Rogers from AIR.McCarty from the Lobster Trap filed a loss-of-business claim with his insurer and was denied. He appealed and was denied again.“The explanation I received was that my business interruption and lack of water service were considered the result of flooding, and therefore my claim was denied,” he explained. “I’m not in a flood zone, being located in downtown, and had no reason to have flood insurance.”Mellow Mushroom’s filed a claim for the $300,000 in sales it lost, Mahon said. However, the restaurant is also on higher ground in downtown Asheville and therefore didn’t have flood coverage. “If that restaurant realistically floods, we better have a friend named Noah,” he joked.Mellow Mushroom ended up diving deep into the intricacies of its policy. Mahon said he was told by his insurance company: “If you can prove to us that the loss of water service in downtown was not caused by a flood, but was caused by a landslide, we could then pay out.” Doing so would have meant proving “the rain caused a landslide that came down and actually knocked out all of the water service from the hillside next to the reservoir,” Mahon said. And he actually gave it a go: “I said, ‘Well, it’s still caused by a flooding event, which is rain.’” Alas, the insurance company came back and said the argument didn’t adhere to the “verbiage … in the policy … Naturally, we were denied that [claim].”Luella’s policy covered its restaurants from wind damage. That came in handy when a gust brought down five 80ft trees from a neighbor’s properties on to the restaurant’s property and downed power lines and transformers.Many “people didn’t know their policies very well, and I was one of those people”, Miller said. “But thankfully, once I really dove into the fine print, [I saw] we’re covered.” Asheville’s widespread lack of electricity and water – which is part of the reason the restaurant was temporarily closed – wouldn’t have been covered on its own. “Utility disruption alone, typically, is not part of those commercial policies. But we had a wind claim,” Miller explained.Miller heard “horror stories” from other restaurant owners who had difficult times working with their insurers, or who have learned their insurance coverage didn’t cover what they needed it to cover. That wasn’t his experience. “It definitely took a lot of phone calls and meetings,” Miller said. Fortunately, “our insurance carrier stepped up to the plate”.Coming back means starting upSeveral restaurant owners who spoke with the Guardian underscored how they want to look to the future and pointed to new eateries that opened since Helene.Rogers said she is aware of “almost 20 that have newly opened or are planning to open”. These include Crusco,startedby the former team from Cucina 24, which closed this year after the sudden death of chef and owner Brian Canipelli; Kenny’s Pizza, which wasopenedby the pizzaiolo at Cucina 24; ButterPunk, a bakery whichopenedin the River Arts District, an area badly damaged by flooding; and Fitz and the Wolfe, a downtown music venueservingsmash burgers.The Market Place’s Dissen wants potential tourists to understand that Asheville’s restaurant scene is open. He’s toured the country over the past year promoting a cookbook, he said, and he’s encountered people who have asked about Asheville: “‘Can you even go there? Do you have power still?’” he said. “People think we’ve been wiped off the map!”On the contrary, he tells them: “‘It’s wide open … Asheville is beautiful. Come visit us.’”Explore more on these topicsNorth CarolinaOur unequal earthHurricane HeleneRestaurantsUS small businessHurricanesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its plans ripple around the world, whether that’s in changing the demand for fossil fuels or affecting the impacts on the planet from global heating.On Thursday, Australia woke to the news that China’s president, Xi Jinping, had told the United Nations that for the first time his country was setting a target to cut – in absolute terms – its greenhouse gas emissions.In a video address, Xi said China’s emissions would fall by 7% to 10% from their peak. When that peak happens he didn’t say, butsome analysts thinkit may have already passed.China’s plans to cut emissions too weak to stave off global catastrophe, say expertsRead moreAnthony Albanese had a lukewarm response to Xi’s announcement, saying it was “good that there is progress being made”, but “of course [Australia] would like there to be more”.China’s emissions are about 29% of the global total – more than twice that of the United States, the world’s second-biggest emitter.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter“If we see emissions peak and fall in China, then we will see them fall everywhere,” says Dr Wesley Morgan, a Climate Council councillor and researcher at the institute for climate risk and response at the University of New South Wales.Whatever China does will make a substantial difference to the impacts of the climate crisis felt around the world, including Australia.What’s at stake for Australia was clearly articulated by the release last week of Australia’s first national climate risk assessment, which laid out theshocking toll on the economy, on communities and on habitats and wildlifeas global temperatures rise.Political figures and commentators who want to see Australia slow down on cutting emissions have pointed to China’s lack of a target as justification for their position. Those arguments will be harder to make now.While China’s new target is not in line with limiting global heating to 1.5C, Morgan says, nor are most other national 2035 targets that have been announced – including Australia’s.Underpromising and overdeliveringMany climate analysts haveexpressed disappointment at what was seen as the timid nature of China’s target, but many also noted China had underpromised and overdelivered on its previous target.Dr Jorrit Gosens, an expert on China’s energy transition at the Australian National University, says: “The 7% to 10% reduction by 2035 is disappointing, because it is less than what we need. But 7% to 10% in political terms is quite an achievement.”China is also the biggest manufacturer and deployer of technologies to slow global heating, from wind turbines and solar panels to electric vehicles and batteries.Xi also set other 2035 goals: solar and wind capacity would increase by six times the levels in 2020 to reach 3,600 gigawatts, and the share of non-fossil fuels providing the country’s energy would rise above 30%.But Gosens says both these targets will be easily reached. China has been adding between 300GW and 400GW of solar and wind a year for the past two years.Getting to a total of 3,600GW by 2035 would require a rate of only about 180GW a year, he says.“It is so entirely likely that it will be overachieved that it’s almost pointless to set that target,” he says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe low target is likely aimed at international audiences, Gosens says. “China wants to avoid criticism for missing a target and instead get lauded for overachieving.”Slowing demand for Australian fossil fuelsAny ambition from China to reduce its fossil fuel use is going to be keenly watched by the fossil fuel industry. The country is the world’s biggest importer of both steel-making coal and coal for burning in power stations and is a significant importer of LNG.“Declining fossil gas demand from China will also impact China’s LNG demand. And China is Australia’s largest LNG customer,” says Josh Runciman, Australian gas analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.He says: “China’s domestic gas is its cheapest and LNG will likely be the first supply source that falls away. We’re likely to see a similar trend for Australian coal.”While China continues to build coal-fired power plants, Gosens said in the first half of 2025 there had been a cut in coal power consumption of about 100 terrawatt hours.For context, that reduction is roughly the equivalent of turning off all the coal plants in Australia’s national electricity market for 11 months.Gosens says China has installed about three-quarters of all the solar and wind power on the planet.“That means China is doing three times more [renewable energy installations] than the rest of the world put together.”Bill Hare, the founder of research organisation Climate Analytics, says China will be able to meet its new target with policies that are already in place, “so it won’t drive down emissions”.“Australia is a major exporter of fossil fuels to China,” he says. “About 34% to 35% of LNG exports go to China and about 11% to 12% of our coal exports. So Australia is fuelling China’s ongoing overreliance on fossil fuels.“Australian government policy visibly favours ongoing exports of these fossil fuels to China, whereas it could be doing a lot more to facilitate China’s rapid exit from these fuels – and that is in all of our interests.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsChinaClimate crisisEmissions tradingAsia PacificGreenhouse gas emissionsanalysisShareReuse this content"

On the eve of the Ryder Cup, the 32-year-old admitted he sees it as his responsibility, and his privilege, to feed off Bethpage Black’s notoriously rowdy galleries and leverage their energy into a weapon.“This week is an amazing opportunity,” he said on a soggy Thursday in Farmingdale. “New York fans are incredible. As rowdy and raucous as they get, they still love the game of golf. I couldn’t be more excited to hopefully get them riled up and excited for what’s to come.”It is a role he believes he is far better prepared for than four years ago at Whistling Straits, when the United States ran roughshod over Europe 19–9 for their most lopsided Ryder Cup victory in history. Back then, he was still navigating the fallout of ahighly public feud with Brooks Koepka. His résumé at that point included a single major win, the 2020 US Open, and a reputation for tinkering and petulance. Now, afterthree years of reinvention– a high-profile jump to LIV Golf, a string of strong major finishes, his outsized success as a YouTuber and almost nuclear charm offensive – DeChambeau insists he is equipped to channel the noise, not be consumed by it. “Four years ago, I wouldn’t have been as open or ready,” he reflected. “The experience helps. Hopefully I can use that to the best of my ability and hit some great shots when it matters most.”Missing the last Ryder Cup in Rome remains a sore point. “It sucked,” he admitted on Thursday. “I wanted to be there. Didn’t play well enough in the majors. Knew what I was up against when I went to LIV … but seeing the guys lose really put a fire in my stomach. I wanted to make the team this time around.” He likened it to another painful absence: being forced out of the Tokyo Olympicsafter contracting Covid, which he called “a pretty big shot to the heart”. Those moments, he said, left him determined to treat a Ryder Cup return as “a passion project”.That determination paid off. Though LIV golfers have fewer routes to qualify, his results in the majors – including the kind of prodigious driving that makes him a tailor-made fit for Bethpage’s 7,352-yard brute – punched his ticket. “Making this team was A1,” he said. “It was the thing I wanted to do most, represent my country.”For a player once caricatured as golf’s mad scientist, more loner than teammate, DeChambeau has relished the camaraderie this time. “The amount of calls I got when I was on the team from players was amazing,” he said. “It made me more passionate and excited to be a part of what we can accomplish this week.”Ryder Cuprookie Ben Griffin, who played practice rounds with him on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, praised his energy and even teased that he managed to outdrive DeChambeau once. “He’s been awesome to have on this team,” Griffin said. “He’s unique, but a huge asset.”Home fans turn up heat on Luke Donald at fiery Ryder Cup opening ceremonyRead moreThat duality – the eccentric technician whobreaks out a protractoron the greens and the unlikely crowd-pleaser who engages in mid-round banter with the galleries – has come to define him. As recently as 2021, his online presence barely existed. He was a polarizing figure in the golf world even before going full heel by defecting to the Saudi-backed LIV tour. He publicly ripped his equipment manufacturer, made brazen proclamations of neutering Augusta and engaged in a petty feud with Koepka, all of which incrementally cost him fan support. Now, with more than 2.4 million YouTube subscribers, he has become a crossover figure who draws kids to the autograph line as readily as he impresses the diehards with ball speed. Teammate Harris English admitted being baffled by the digital world until DeChambeau gave him a crash course at the opening ceremony. “That’s his plan,” English said. “Growing the game as much as possible, relating to kids, bringing them into golf. I think that’s really cool.”Not everyone is convinced. Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee has dismissed DeChambeau as “a captain’s nightmare”, questioning whether his online following – slingshotted into the stratosphere by a viral video of a round with Donald Trump – isauthenticand suggesting he is more focused on content than competition. DeChambeau shrugged it off. “Any time people can throw stuff at me like that, I enjoy it. It spurs conversation. And if it creates more buzz for golf, that’s great.”Trump himself will attend Friday’s opening session, just days after helashed out at European leadersin a UN broadside, becoming the first sitting president to appear at a Ryder Cup. DeChambeau, who remains a darling of the American right, sees that presence asanother lever to stir the crowd. “I hope he will inspire us to victory,” he said. “He’ll be a great force for us to get a lot of people on our side. It’s going to be an electric environment.”That line will divide opinion, as the Ryder Cup often has. For decades, the event has mirrored politics and national moods: the chest-thumpingWar on the Shorein 1991, theBrookline celebrationsof 1999, theconfrontation between Rory McIlroy and Patrick Cantlay’s caddiein Rome two years ago. Bethpage Black, the Long Island track with its history of heckling and hostility, offers another combustible stage. This week, as America continues to reel from political violence at home, it offers a fleeting chance for unity with Republicans and Democrats each yearning for the same red numbers to fill the scoreboard.DeChambeau knows he will be one of its central actors, not only because of his drives but because of his persona. His rivalry with McIlroy has turned into a subplot: McIlroy accusing him of seeking attention, DeChambeau threatening to “chirp” back. Yet he was careful on Thursday to stress respect. “Rivalries are good for the game,” he said. “I have the ultimate respect for Rory. Would I love to go up against him? Yeah. He’s a fierce competitor, a great competitor.”Still, he frames himself less as lightning rod than support system. “Whether it’s emotionally or leadership, it’s more about pumping people up, giving good energy out there,” he said. “Helping people realize why we are playing this week is a top priority for me.”That blend – the entertainer signing autographs till the queues thinned in Thursday’s drizzle, the math prodigy explaining single-length irons, the partisan cheerleader and champion of the Maga movement – makes DeChambeau the rare figure who seems as likely to rile as to inspire. In a competition defined by noise and jingoism, he is ready to meet the moment head-on. “I just want to be part of this team,” he said. “This has been a mission project for me. Hopefully I can provide some fun stuff this week and hopefully we can get that Cup back.”Explore more on these topicsBryson DeChambeauRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Though the reporting has been of a crisis, had they even a mediocre goalkeeper, they would have lost toneither Arsenalnor Grimsby, and it’s also fair to note that, with three of their first five games coming against Mikel Arteta’s side, Manchester City and Chelsea, they were dealt a difficult start. But Ruben Amorim must now start accumulating victories, with a nasty away trip a decent test. Since Brentford were promoted to the Premier League, United have lost two of four games at the Gtech, were outplayed in the one draw and, even in the game they won, were physically dominated for 45 minutes. However, their summer acquisitions have turned a team of uncommon weakness and slowness into one able to compete in duels, win headers and threaten in behind. That should mean United’s class tells in contests such as this – except no side is better at finding ways to lose matches they should win.Daniel HarrisBrentford vManchester United, Saturday 12.30pm (all times BST)View image in fullscreenBryan Mbeumo will be in the running for a start against his old club.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images2Guéhi out to stop Reds after blocked moveThe only unbeaten teams left this season meet at Selhurst Park. While Liverpool have a 100% record, Crystal Palace’s form has been notable for their sturdy defence. Oliver Glasner’s side have conceded just two goals in five games, with clean sheets against Chelsea, Aston Villa and Sunderland. Key to this setup is their captain, Marc Guéhi, who came very close to signing for Liverpool on transfer deadline day. The England centre-back wasunderstood to be extremely unhappyafter Palace blocked the move despite a £35m fee being agreed. Guéhi will now attempt to thwart the team he thought he was joining and who have scored in each of their last 39 league matches – a club record.Billy MundayCrystal Palace v Liverpool, Saturday 3pm3Injuries and form give George an openingTyrique George scored one of Chelsea’s most important goals last season, reigniting their push for Champions League qualification by bagging the equaliser in theircrucial late win at Fulhamin April. Yet while Enzo Maresca has often talked up the teenage attacker, George looked set to leave Stamford Bridge in the summer. A move to Fulham was on the cards on deadline day, only for it to collapse at the last minute and give the 19-year-old a second chance of making it at Chelsea. Competition, of course, is fierce. But with Cole Palmer struggling with a groin injury, Liam Delap out for months and Alejandro Garnacho and Jamie Gittens adjusting to Maresca’s demands, there could be an opportunity for George from the start when Chelsea host Brighton. It would be a deserved reward for hisexcellent goal at Lincolnin the Carabao Cup on Tuesday.Jacob SteinbergChelsea v Brighton, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenTyrique George was on the mark at Lincoln in midweek.Photograph: Darren Walsh/CFC/Getty Images4Could Darlow oust Perri as Leeds No 1?After sacking Jesse Marsch in February 2023 Leeds were desperate to recruit Andoni Iraola but the coach, then at Rayo Vallecano, proved resistant and ended up joining Bournemouth instead. Elland Road regulars now have a chance to witness the tactical choreography they missed out on as Iraola’s high flyers head to West Yorkshire but Daniel Farke will hope to prove that he was not such a shabby choice. Afterlast week’s win at Wolvesthe Leeds manager’s confidence is high but, with his first-choice goalkeeper, Lucas Perri, still injured, he could do with another strong performance from Karl Darlow. The former Newcastle keeper has played so well in the past two games, against Wolves and Fulham, that Farke may yet have a decision to make once his summer signing from Lyon is fit again. If Darlow’s long kicking seems superior to Perri’s, his shot-stopping and judgment of crosses have also been excellent. Meanwhile Illan Meslier, for so long the first pick, is transfer-listed and third in Farke’s goalkeeping pecking order.Louise TaylorLeedsvBournemouth, Saturday 3pm5City have chance to build momentumBefore Liverpool’s visit on 9 November Manchester City’s league fixtures are Burnley (home), Brentford (away), Everton (home), Aston Villa (away) and Bournemouth (home): a chance against modest opposition to accrue points and momentum. City have won 17 out of Pep Guardiola’s 18 previous meetings with Saturday’s opponents, Burnley, and Scott Parker will send his men out with trepidation. Phil Foden is flying with both goals and assists, which means City are heavy favourites to tally their third league win of the season, particularly as they have scored 12 goals to Burnley’s one in their last three meetings.Jamie JacksonManchester City vBurnley, Saturday 3pm6Rigg can refresh Sunderland’s threatSunderland have made a terrific start to life back in thePremier League, thanks largely to the excellent work of their recruitment team and a whole lot of money. But though they sit seventh in the table, they are struggling to score – a problem that needs resolving if they are to stay up. Régis Le Bris has opted for a midfield three of Granit Xhaka, Noah Sadiki and Habib Diarra, but with the last of these sidelined until December, Chris Rigg – a teenage star of Sunderland’s promotion campaign and a local boy to boot, but mainly on the bench for the first four league games – has a chance to establish himself in the top division. Last time out, against Villa, Rigg was sacrificed after Reinildo’s red card, but he can expect to start again at the City Ground, where his subtlety could be crucial against a defence still adjusting to the demands of a new manager.DHskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Simons has often been pinpointed as someone to play left-wing, rather than roam into the centre. The word from Dutch football is the former PSV player is no winger and unlikely to be as effective when forced to man the flanks. His finishing at the Amex was not the best, though one shot forced his compatriot Bart Verbruggen into a good save. He did, though, pin back Brighton and reduce their counterattackingthreat. James Maddison is likely to miss the entire campaign. Thomas Frank is optimistic Dejan Kulusevski can return “before the end of this year” but is “not putting a month on it”. That hands Simons a chance to claim a free role as his own. Rodrigo Bentancur was initially given that job at Brighton, tucking in as Destiny Udogie overlapped, but he is more comfortable playing deeper.John BrewinTottenham v Wolves, Saturday, 8pm8What does Monchi’s exit mean for Emery?A reshuffle behind the scenes is usually an ominous sign, but Unai Emery remains in a position of strength despiteMonchi’s exitas president of football operations. Villa have appointed Roberto Olabe as Monchi’s successor to oversee recruitment and no sweeping changes are anticipated. Olabe, a former Real Sociedad sporting director, like Emery, hails from the Basque Country, and Villa will hope this is the start of a fresh synergy. It was Olabe who appointed Emery as Almería manager almost two decades ago and, two years ago, he was thought to be Villa’s first choice to take on the role Monchi later assumed. Villa have heightened expectations and all parties expect the visit of Fulham to result in a much-needed first league victory of the season, afterThursday’s Europa League win. “Nothing has changed, only the man,” Emery said this week, though how Villa would welcome a different outcome on Sunday.Ben FisherAston Villa v Fulham, Sunday 2pm9Arsenal and Arteta must beware TonaliSandro Tonali will almost certainly return to Newcastle’s starting XI against Arsenal after being rested for Wednesday night’s 4-1Carabao Cup canter against Bradford. Ever since Eddie Howe relocated the Italy midfielder into a slightly deeper role almost a year ago Tonali has frequently proved Newcastle’s outstanding individual. Mikel Arteta regards Joelinton’s physicality and abrasion as a thorn in his team’s side but Tonali is arguably the midfielder most capable of damaging the visitors. The only concern on Tyneside is that, after this season, there will be two years remaining on his contract. It is understood that David Hopkinson, Newcastle’s chief executive, is keen to furnish Tonali with a new deal but that is pending until a new sporting director is appointed. While Ross Wilson remains the favourite to fill that vacancy, extracting him from Nottingham Forest will be far from straightforward. Arteta, meanwhile, will want to atone for painful past defeats by a Newcastle team who are now still adjusting to life without Alexander Isak.LTNewcastlevArsenal, Sunday 4.30pmView image in fullscreenSandro Tonali in Champions League goalscoring action against Barcelona.Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images10Moyes could act as Potter’s executionerThe irony will not be lost on West Ham or David Moyes should Everton consign the Hammers to a sixth defeat in seven matches and signal the end of Graham Potter’s uninspiring managerial reign. Many at West Ham were desperate to see the back of the Scot despite him winning the club’sfirst trophy in 43 yearsbut they could soon be on to their third manager of 2025 with results nosediving under his successors. Potter, meanwhile, was considered a potential replacement for Sean Dyche by Everton’s owners, although never offered the job. Potter has failed to rectify his team’s inability to defend set pieces, with seven goals conceded from corners already this season. If there is any consolation for Potter, Everton have not scored from one this term. Having talked up the importance of the Carabao Cup to Everton after 30 years without a trophy, Moyes duly made seven unnecessary changes for the dismal exit at Wolves in midweek.

But without a strong strong supporting case he is struggling to entertain … and winOliver ConnollyThu 25 Sep 2025 08.21 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 11.59 EDTSharePatrick Mahomes has never been here before. Lose to the Ravens on Sunday, and hisKansas City Chiefswill sink to 1-3, falling further behind the Chargers in the AFC West, a division Kansas City have owned for nearly a decade.After three weeks of the season, it’s clear: these are not the Chiefs of old. And Mahomes, while still dazzling in moments, is not the irrepressible force he was three years ago.There is a different tenor about the Chiefs these days. At the peak of their championship run, they didn’t just beat opponents, they demoralized them. Their offense was explosive and creative. Putting up 30-plus points felt inevitable. Now, everything is a grind. Anything outside Mahomes freelancing looks like hard work. We’re into year two of the Chiefs being stodgy and methodical. The bombs away style of early Mahomes has made way for a more plodding approach as they look to paper over the cracks of a diminished roster.For just one game Caleb Williams finally gave the long-suffering Bears hopeRead moreMany Chiefs fans won’t care – they will point to the glaring fact that the Chiefsmade the Super Bowl last season, despite the fact that they lacked the fireworks of old. Rivals fans may welcome the struggles. Over the past few seasons, Mahomes and the Chiefs have gone from fun upstarts to villains. As well as theiroff-field failings, they have been overexposed. Their aging tight end iseffectively the face of the league. They’ve been in primetime too long and have beenthe beneficiaryof too many officiating calls. As the Chiefs have won and won and won, they have moved from a compelling sports story into a pop-cultural force.As the team’s cultural footprint has expanded, Mahomes has had to slog through the last two seasons. For most of his career, Mahomes has been different from other Hall of Fame-caliber quarterbacks. He played with a sense of childlike glee, as if he were discovering his own brilliance at the same time we were. There were the jaw-dropping throws, the how-did-he-do-it comebacks,13 seconds,Jet Chip Wasp,fourth-and-nine,the no-look throws, thebehind-the-back throw, winning the Super Bowl on one leg, the unimaginable made possible. Every week, it felt like he was discovering new ways to play the game.In the early Mahomes years, the Chiefs’ offense was thrilling and visceral. At its best – when the aggressive plays, speedy weapons, and up-tempo pace worked in unison – the offense was less about executing football plays and more about waging psychological warfare. There was no way to cover Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill. If opponents could stop the duo, Mahomes would buy time until one of them eventually sprang open. It was a parade of chunk plays.But as defenses have adapted to limit Mahomes’ ability to chuck the ball downfield, the Chiefs have leaned into a more restricted style. They’re happy to hold on to the ball, to piece together drives in five-yard increments. Last season, that was effective enough to make the Super Bowl again. But this year feels different. It looks different, too. Last year was a byproduct of poor roster management. KC bet on Kelce a year too long. Rookie Xavier Worthy took time to onboard in the Hill role. The left tackle spot was a sinkhole that corrupted the entire offensive line. Despite winning 15 games in the regular season, the Chiefs wheezed through 11 one-score games and didn’t total more than 30 points in a single game. The offense was a chore to watch, but they found a way.That was supposed to be a down year. In the offseason, they would regroup, retool and rediscover the old flair. But the same issues that undercut them a year ago are still present: Mahomes has no supporting run game to ease the pressure on him, his top-two wide receivers – Xavier Worthy and Rashee Rice – are out, and Kelce continues to be the fulcrum of the offense at age 35. There is a lack of rhythm and synchronicity. Amuch-promised overhaul to last year’s schemehas yet to materialize.Defenses continue to crowd the middle of the field and dare Mahomes to be patient. Andy Reid’s counterpunch has been uninspired: grind out plays and hope Mahomes saves things late. This year, 65% of Mahomes’ throws have been below 10 yards, up from last year. He is getting rid of the ball a full half-second quicker than his career average, too, to offset his fragile offensive line.It’s the ordinariness that stings. Their defense is still masterminded by the brilliant Steve Spagnuolo but, on offense, the Chiefs sit below the Texans and Steelers in explosive play rate through three weeks. Mahomes’ best moments, those explosions of old, have come not through design but desperation.And Mahomes has been inconsistent, flashes of his genius tempered by basic miscues. Hehasplayed better than the box score would suggest. But he’s also left plenty of meat on the bone.Schlepping through games has at least revealed a new side to Mahomes. He’s in his defiant era. He is mean-mugging defenders after plays andlowering his shoulderin the open field to squeeze out an extra couple of yards. Asking Mahomes to drill a tackler was not worth the risk three years ago. Now, the Chiefs need him to fight for every yard.Winning a game with practice-squad receivers and a nonfunctional run game is, in itself, a testament to Mahomes’ greatness. He is duct-taping together competence; Mahomes leads the team in rushing yards and the league in quarterback scrambles. A late toss from Mahomes to Tyquan Thornton last week got the Chiefs’ season back on track. But slogging to a win against the hapless Giants is hardly the stuff of a true contender.In some ways, this is the natural life cycle of a dynasty. The Brady-Belichick Patriots won the Super Bowl in the 2004 season and didn’t claim another until the 2014 campaign. There were stretches of mediocrity, streaks where even Brady looked overwhelmed by age, coaching turnover, or a depleted supporting cast. But the greats bend reality and reset expectations. A bad year in Foxborough meant 11 wins and a divisional-round loss. Mahomes has spent his career living in that same rarefied air. Every season of his career as a starter has ended in an AFC Championship Game or a Super Bowl.With a salary cap and draft, no one can win every year. It’s to Mahomes’ credit that he was able to drag last year’s team to the Super Bowl. He seemed to be resetting expectations again.Even when the Chiefs look vulnerable, even when things aren’t clicking, they make it to the final game.Mahomes turned 30 last week. He left his 20s as the most decorated quarterback in history by that age: three Super Bowl wins, three Super Bowl MVPs, two league MVPs, six Pro Bowl nods, two first-team All-Pro selections. He has been both a relentless winner and one of the sport’s great innovators. But as he’s turned 30, he’s entered the most trying period of his career. The Chiefs haven’t given him the tools to play at his melodic best, and he’s been forced to effort through games with an uncommon national glare.Soon enough, Rice and Worthy will return from suspension and injury respectively. And the Chiefs could be the Chiefs again – after all, the Patriots’ drought from 2004 to 2014 was followed by another two championships. But right now, they feel joyless, and so does Mahomes. There may be no greater sporting crime than making Mahomes dull.Explore more on these topicsKansas City ChiefsPatrick MahomesNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Fifa moved with lightning speed,banningRussia from all competitions four days later. In ajoint statementwith Uefa, Europe’s football governing body, they asserted, “Football is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine.” And yet, little solidarity has been afforded Palestinians. When it comes to Israel, Fifa and Uefa have foot-dragged.Pressure is ramping up on the barons of football to take action. After United Nations experts issued astatementdemanding that Israel be suspended from international football because of the genocide in Gaza,the Times reportsthat Uefa may take up the issue as soon as next week.Israel’s future in Uefa could come to a head before October World Cup qualifiersRead moreFootball is politics by other means. Fifa and Uefa demonstrated as much with their ban on Russia. Fifa’s guiding statutes give it the power to take a similar moral stance against the actions of Israel and to offer “full solidarity” with Palestinians, especially since thePalestine Football Associationis a Fifa member. To sit silent is to signal brazen favoritism. Fifa and Uefa should suspend Israel from competition.Some mayarguethat sports and politics shouldn’t mix. But in a time ofrising authoritarianismacross the globe, includingin the United Statesunder Donald Trump, now is the time for international organizations to stand up for core moral principles. Today, selective ethics are freighted with extra danger: they enable demagoguery.Israel is orchestrating a staggering human tragedy in Gaza. It has dropped well over 100,000 tons of explosives on the Gaza Strip,more tonnagethan struck Dresden, Hamburg, and London combined during the second world war. More than 64,000 Palestinians have beenkilled, most of them by Israel’s military, with the Lancetcalculatinga much higher death toll and a retired Israeli generalnotingthat more than 200,000 Palestinians have been killed or wounded. The Lancet says that on average, 35 children arekilledevery day in Gaza. With Israel blocking most food aid, around a quarter of all Gaza residents were suffering fromfaminein August. Hospitals are often hit, inviolationof international humanitarian law. Around 200 journalists have beenkilled, with many of them apparently targeted by the Israel Defense Forces, abreachof international law. Together, this constitutesgenocide, according to the International Association of Genocide Scholars. But for Israel’s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, Gaza is just a “real-estate bonanza.”These horrors do not chime with Fifa’s stated ideals. Its president, Gianni Infantino, has remained conspicuously silent on the subject of Israel and Gaza, even though Fifa’slegal handbooktrumpets that the group “is committed to respecting all internationally recognised human rights and shall strive to promote the protection of these rights.” Sure, Infantino penned cut-and-pastecondolence lettersto the football associations of Israel and Palestine in the wake of the horrific 7 October attack and the launch of Israel’s military response, but he hasn’t replicated anything resembling hisstatementthat Fifa “condemns the use of force by Russia in Ukraine.” Neither far-right security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir’s statedsupportfor the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, nor inflammatorystatementsby a range of powerful Israeli politicians has moved Infantino to condemn Israel, let alone propose any concrete sanctions against the country, despite the fact that Fifa’s statutesstatethat “Discrimination of any kind against a country, private person or group of people on account of race, skin colour, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, disability, language, religion, political opinion … is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion.”One could argue that denouncing war crimes is too much to expect from a sports organization. But even if we stick to the realm of sports, Israel appears to be violating Fifa rules. The organization’sstatutes stateclearly that “Member associations and their clubs may not play on the territory of another member association without the latter’s approval.” And yet, according toHuman Rights Watch, the Israel Football Association is staging matches on “settlements in the West Bank on land unlawfully taken from Palestinians.” The United Nationshas identifiedat least eight Israeli football clubs that have either developed or played matches “in Israeli colonial settlements of the occupied West Bank.” In addition, the UN says many clubs in the Israel Football Association (IFA) “have exhibited racism towards the Palestinian people and players over the years,” a clear violation of Fifa’s non-discrimination policies. The London-based human-rights group Fair Squaredeterminedthat there is “longstanding and irrefutable evidence that the IFA is in violation of Fifa Statutes.”Last May at the Fifa Congress in Paraguay, Susan Shalabi, a vice-president of the Palestinian Football Association,imploredFifa’s Governance, Audit, and Compliance Committee to concludetwo investigationsinto Israel’s actions in the West Bank. Despite an abundance of evidence, Fifa chose to kick the investigation down the road. By slow-rolling these inquiries, Fifa, whether intentionally or not, has adopted the same approach as Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, calling for investigations into human-rights violations as a strategy of staving off accountability.Beyond staging matches in the West Bank, Israel has engaged in whatscholarsare increasingly calling “athleticide”: killing Palestinian athletes,destroyingsports facilities, andtransmogrifyingGaza’s storied Al Yarmouk Stadium into a temporary detention center. Last month, beloved Palestinian footballer Suleiman Obeid – known to many as thePalestinian Pele– was killed by an Israeli drone strike. He is one ofnearly 800Palestinian athletes who have been killed by Israel since October 2023.Fifa and Uefa have the power to take action. Although admirable, the burden shouldn’t be on star players like Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah toask tough questionsabout the killing of Obeid or for Norway todonatethe profits from its qualifying match against Israel to Gaza relief. The full weight of football governing bodies is required.Although history does not provide us with crisp facsimiles, Fifa’s handling of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows that the group can act on principle. Given the facts on the ground in the West Bank and Gaza, Israel should not be allowed to take the pitch for World Cup qualifying matches. Fifa andUefaneed to expedite investigations into Israeli football malfeasance. By choosing to ignore their own rules, they disfigure them. When impunity thrives on moral sleepwalking, it leaves us precarious – and vulnerable to authoritarianism. Now is the time for Fifa and Uefa to stand in alignment with the principles they so vociferously proclaim.Explore more on these topicsIsraelFifaUefaFootball politicsPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

They also own the tiebreaker because they lead the head-to-head series between the teams this season. The last time the Guardians had sole possession of the division was on 22 April, when they were 14-9 and a half-game ahead of the Tigers.The 1914 Boston Braves were 15 games back in the National League on 4 July and rallied to win by 10.5 games according to Elias. Since baseball went to division play in 1969, the biggest deficit overcome was 14 games by the 1978 New York Yankees to win the AL East.“Ignorance is bliss. You kind of just keep your head down and don’t worry about those kind of things,” Kwan said. “It is a long, long season, so I think if you get caught up in those things early on, you’re going to be doomed.“Just keep pushing, keep doing what we do. Can’t jinx it either. I mean, we’ve been doing what we’ve been doing for so long, it’d be a little silly to look forward too far.”According to FanGraphs, the Guardians had a 2.9% chance to make the postseason and a 0.2% chance to win the division on 1 September. After improving to an MLB-best 18-5 in September, they have a 92.3% chance for the postseason and 80.7% to take the division for the second straight year.“It feels good, but there’s no prize for having that spot today. I’m really proud of what our guys have done to get themselves back into it and give us a chance to get into the postseason,” manager Stephen Vogt said. “We have a lot of work left to go. It’s exciting. Sure, we’re going to enjoy the win for a few hours, but we got another game tomorrow going to come out ready to go.”As for the Tigers, they have to reflect on a painful decline and are on an eight-game losing streak.“It’s painful,” Tigers manager AJ Hinch said after Wednesday’s loss. “I’m having a hard time coming up with words, and I know that’s not the norm. But what I’m seeing out of our team is not normal. But it’s our reality.”A key to the Guardians’ hot September has been their pitching. The starting rotation has allowed two or fewer runs in 19 consecutive games, matching the 2019 Tampa Bay Rays and 1916 New York Giants for the second-longest streak since the mound was moved. The 1917 Chicago White Sox have the mark at 20, according to Elias.Guardians starters are 12-0 with a 1.35 ERA during their 19-game run. Tanner Bibee improved to 3-0 in September, allowing only one run in six innings.“I’ll be honest, I don’t think about the streak at any moment other than when you guys bring it up to me. We’re out here to win games each and every day, and those guys compete with each other,” Vogt said. “The truth is that when they take the mound, they want to give us a chance to win. And man, have they stepped up the last few weeks.”The Guardians finish with Detroit on Thursday before hosting the Texas Rangers in the final regular-season series.

They made harder work of it than they might have done against limited opponents, and there were rather more nervous moments than there probably should have been, but a win’s a win and, after the start to the season Villa have had, that’s the most important thing. But nobody should think Villa are back just yet.They took an early lead, should have had the game wrapped up by the hour and Ollie Watkins missed a penalty to extend his goal drought but, in the end, it took a back-pedalling injury-time save from Marc Bizot to keep out a Remo Freuler header and preserve the victory. “We have won and this is the important thing,” said Unai Emery. “We have to recover more or less again the feeling of being strong and playing with confidence. We played well. If we had been more clinical with moments we had in the attacking third we could have got something, but over 90 minutes it was better than the last matches.”Aston Villa v Bologna, Rangers v Genk, and more: Europa League – liveRead moreIt’s only just over five months since Villa Park last hosted European football, but it feels a lifetime ago. That was the Champions League quarter-final as Villa mounted a rousing fightbackagainst Paris Saint-Germainthat, although it fell short, rattled the eventual champions. Coming after a series of memorable European nights –the win against Bayern, the victory in Leipzig, the last-16 demolition of Club Brugge – there was a clear sense then that this was where Villa belonged and there seemed little reason to think they could not become Champions League regulars.View image in fullscreenJohn McGinn delivers his distinctive celebration after his early goal.Photograph: Aston Villa/Aston Villa FC/Getty ImagesVilla’ssubsequent defeat at Old Traffordon the final day of last season thrust them into the Europa League, engendering a sense of anticlimax that has not yet gone away. Only six players who started against PSG also did so against Bologna, while Monchi, the sporting director, resigned on Tuesday. Nobody really thinks they’re in relegation trouble but, equally, a start in which they have taken just three points and scored just one goal in their first five games has come as a reminder that nothing in the Premier League can be taken for granted.The hope, perhaps, was that the sniff of Europe, even the secondary competition, could awake something in Villa and, up to a point, it did. Evann Guessand had already drawn a sharp low save from Lukasz Skorupski when John McGinn put them ahead after 13 minutes, squeezing his shot from 20 yards between a defensive leg and a post with the keeper unsighted. It was his fourth European goal from outside the box since the beginning of 2023-24, more than any other player in that period, and, if that makes it bafflingBolognaafforded him so much space, some mitigation was provided by the way everybody momentarily froze after a Morgan Rogers’s air-shot.Bologna have themselves begun the season slowly after a little more squad turnover than they might have liked. Villa had a clear physical advantage and, as a result, looked a far more threatening side than they have domestically. But the second goal did not arrive, not even after another moment of Bologna paralysis, prompted when the ball rolled near the arm of a prone Watkins. That allowed Villa to regain possession and, as Watkins ran through, he was clipped by Martin Vitik.View image in fullscreenOllie Watkins’ penalty is saved by Lukasz Skorupski.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAWatkins’s penalty, though, was dreadful, low and slow, and straight down the middle, allowing Skorupski to kick it away. “He has to be happy because he did his work,” said Emery. “Of course if he is scoring he is going to feel better. But the most important thing is how he is working in his task for the team. He didn’t score, but the team scored because of the work he is doing.”The result, inevitably, was pressure. Even the Bologna manager, Vincenzo Italiano, said he could sense the mounting anxiety. Santiago Castro headed against the bar and then, from a left-wing free-kick, Jens Odgaard headed against Bizot, who found himself in no man’s land but at least was able to starfish himself to make the block.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Thereafter, the game essentially had two states: the ball bobbing in and around the Villa box to a soundtrack of nervous grumbling, and Rogers getting annoyed with either himself or Jadon Sancho, who had come off the bench for Emi Buendía to make his Villa debut, as Villa squandered another counterattacking opportunity, as growls of frustration ran around the stands.Villa’sEuropa Leaguecampaign is up and running, but they remain a long way from the heights of last season.Explore more on these topicsEuropa LeagueAston VillaBolognamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It is whoever can put down that performance on Saturday. Our goal is to be that team. They are an incredibly difficult team to play against, they have an aura about them that has been almost untouched in the last 10 years. Our goal is to burst it.”Alex Tessier echoed the Maple Leafs’ belief that they can spoil England’s home party at a sold-out Twickenham on Saturday. “We will give everything we have got because we believe we can go all of the way,” the captain said. “It’s not done yet but that is the goal, it’s been the goal. I think we have shown what this group is about already, in our performances throughout the pool games, quarters and the semi-final. It will be important for every one of us.“It has been huge already. We have taken a massive step forward in terms of Canadian rugby, just reaching the final again. We will play for each other and we will give everything for each other on Saturday.”Canada have been well supported throughout the tournament, with the country music star Shania Twain commenting on their social media posts. The full-back Julia Schell is a huge Twain fan“She responded again post-game, just as much excitement the second time around.

But sources inside national federations said events appeared to be coming to a head and thatUefaand its president, Aleksander Ceferin, were increasingly expected to take action.There have been an increasing number of interventions away from the game. On Tuesday, a group of senior diplomats called on Uefa and Fifa to enact a ban after the publication of a report by the United Nations independent international commission of inquiry thatfound Israel was committing genocidein Gaza. Last week, the campaign group Game Over Israel took over a billboard in New York’s Times Square to call for federations to boycott any matches with the country.It is understood that voices within the game have also been speaking up in private, including those from the club world.Italy is one of the countries under pressure to act. TheAzzurri, along with Norway, are due to face Israel in the next round of qualifiers, with their match scheduled for 14 October in Udine. Italy is fresh from a24-hour general strikein protest against Israel’s behaviour in Gaza.Gabriele Gravina, the president of the Italian football federation, who sits on the Uefa exco, said this week that any boycott “would only favour Israel, who could in theory be boosted in their qualifying path to the tournament”. He also said he “denounced” the suffering in Gaza and that “there is nobody who could be indifferent to this feeling of suffering and pain”.Any decision to suspend the Israel Football Association would be taken in a simple majority vote by the 19 members of Uefa’s exco. Insiders suggest if it were proposed, the vote would have a strong chance of passing with as few as three or four abstentions or votes against. It could, however, have considerable political consequences.The United States government, for example, has warned it would stand against any such decision, with the country co-hosting theWorld Cupnext summer. “We will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel’s national soccer team from the World Cup,” a spokesperson for the US Department of State told Sky News.Any suspension would mean Uefa removing a participant from a Fifa-organised competition. Fifa, under its president, Gianni Infantino, has developed astrong relationship with the Trump administration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All night he had watched Marcos Llorente fly up the wing; for the last half an hour he had watched his son do so too, all clenched jaw and bulging veins, stuck on fast forward, a determination so intense it looked as if he might explode. Now it was the turn of the Atlético Madrid manager, who had literally been on his knees for much of the night, to sprint up the touchline in his black suit and shiny shoes, screaming and let loose again. Simeone had been here before, a week earlier, when he had admitted thatAtlético’s victory had brought reliefnot joy. This was even wilder: five goals, four of them belters, and 54,098 people losing their heads.Football Daily | Marko Arnautovic makes good on his solemn vow to an old friendRead moreSimeone especially. Six weeks into the season and for the sixth time Atlético had scored first; for the fifth time, though, they weren’t going to win. Worse, this time the team that had drawn with Elche, Alavés and Mallorca and beenbeaten by Espanyolwere going to lose, and just in time for the derby to decide their fate, Real Madrid turning up in two days to do what they do: twist the knife, an entire season over before Atlético had even reached October. Madrid, with six wins from six already, could leave Atlético15points behind their rivals. Which was when it happened. “This sport is wonderful,” Simeone said after. “It is all gone, and then – well, sometimes – it gives you that happiness back. As always in football, in life, faith is the most important thing.” A superhero doesn’t go amiss either, the striker they call “the Spider” standing amid the mayhem doing Peter Parkerpe-choo, pe-choosfrom his wrists.Four days earlier Julián Alvarez had missed his first penalty for Atlético, finishing a fifth consecutive game without a goal, sitting on the bench muttering: “Why always me?” – at least that’s what the lip readers said – as Atlético were held at Mallorca. All that enthusiasm, all that investment – €175m this summer, €380m over the past two years – and they had slipped to 14th andninepoints behind Madrid; now, a little after 11pm on Wednesday night, withReal having defeated Levante 4-1at the Ciutat de Valencia 24 hours earlier, it was 12. Alvarez saved them, scoring the opener, the equaliser, and a last-minute winner in the other derby as Atlético beat Rayo Vallecano 3-2, heading up the tunnel with the match ball under his arm.View image in fullscreenDiego Simeone can barely watch during Atlético’s win over Rayo.Photograph: Diego Souto/Getty ImagesHis lovely volley against Rayo had given Atlético another early lead – they scored after eight minutes against Elche, seven against Alavés, nine against Villarreal, and 15 this time – but just before half-time, it started to happen again. The team that averages 10 shots to score and only two to concede conceded again. From 35 metres,Pep Chavarría hit a ridiculous shot, ripping through the air and past Jan Oblak into the net, rising all the way until it went in off a corner of post and bar. Then on 77 minutes, Álvaro García dashed through, went round the keeper and put Rayo into a 2-1 lead. Atlético had been behind six minutes all season; now here they were again.Quick GuideLa Liga roundup: Barça roar back to beat Real OviedoShowBarcelonafought back from a goal down to beatReal Oviedo3-1 on Thursday, with second-half goals from Eric García, Robert Lewandowski and Ronald Araújo overturning Alberto Reina's first-half opener.The win keeps Barcelona unbeaten in the league, sitting second in the standings with 16 points from six matches, two behind leaders Real Madrid. Oviedo remain mired in the relegation zone in 18th with just three points.A costly error from Barcelona goalkeeper Joan García gifted Oviedo the lead. In an attempt to clear the ball outside his area, he misplaced his pass, allowing Reina to easily lob him from distance in the 33rd minute.Barcelona equalised in the 56th minute when Eric García tapped in a rebound from close range and substitute Lewandowski put Barcelona ahead in the 70th minute with a towering header.Oviedo pushed forward in search of an equaliser but were undone in the 88th minute when Araújo headed home from a corner, sealing the points for the Catalans.In the night's other La Liga game,Elchesubstitute Adrià Pedrosa scored a bizarre stoppage-time equaliser atOsasunain a 1-1 draw. Having seemingly failed to latch on to a through ball in the 92nd minute, he then saw the home side's onrushing goalkeeper-captain Sergio Herrera collide with teammate Enzo Boyomo.The ball went through the keeper's legs, leaving Pedrosa – who had continued his run – free to finish into the unguarded net, despite desperate lunges from the Osasuna defence. Víctor Muñoz had opened the scoring early on.Reuters and Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Make that seven. It took longer to do the video assistant referee check than it did for them to get level, Alvarez turning in a rebound 36 seconds after the restart. During the wait Simeone had sent on two full-backs, which no one but him understood, yet it worked, correcting his earlier adjustments. And, on 89 minutes, with the Metropolitano roaring, Alvarez cut inside and curled into the corner, opening up his body as if to go to the far post but turning his ankle to bend it into the near post instead, everyone racing to the corner with their coach running in the same direction. “We had to win, come what may,” Llorente said.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowAthletic Bilbao 1-1 GironaEspanyol 2-2 ValenciaLevante 1-4 Real MadridSevilla 1-2 VillarrealGetafe 1-0 AlavésAtlético Madrid 3-2 Rayo VallecanoReal Sociedad 1-0 Real MallorcaReal Oviedo 1-3 BarcelonaOsasuna 1-1 ElcheWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“When it’s so close,” it hurts more, the Rayo coach, Iñigo Pérez, said. Asked about his absurd goal, Chavarría said he didn’t care. One day he will, maybe, but not now, turning and heading silently up the tunnel. Behind him, Simeone was celebrating with his players, hopping about to a chant of “Whoever doesn’t bounce is a Madridista!”. At the final whistle, he had crashed into his assistant manager, Nelson Vivas, high-fived Nahuel Molina, who happened to be there, and hugged Antoine Griezmann. Then he went off in search of Alvarez, squeezing him hard.He had needed to. Despite the hat-trick, Alvarez might not even have been the best player on the pitch – Llorente’s performance wasridiculous– but it had been all about the Argentinian. And he is, Simeone said, their best player. As Rayo’s García put it: “He’s one of the best in the world. It’s a bit of a pity he’s not on our team, but they have a higher salary limit, more money, more everything. We could do with a player like that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He had cut an oddly forlorn figure of late too, hard to avoid the feeling that this might not feel like his kind of place too much longer, another player worn down by it all. Alvarez had missed a sitter against Espanyol – hitting a post at the end of a glorious move with the score at 1-0 on the opening weekend, with Atlético going on to lose 2-1 – and not scored since. He said he wasn’t grumbling about Simeone on the Mallorca bench, insisting he had been mis(lip)read, “but then you know how social media is”; but he was, he said, grumbling about himself, “using bad words I can’t say again”, and it wasn’t the first time he had been invited to sit down early, a sense of things unravelling.Asked how Alvarez could score a goal like the winner against Rayo, Simeone’s explanation was simple: “Because he’s very good.” When it was suggested that it had been Lionel Messi-like, he replied: “Well, he’s Julián Alvarez.” There was more, he knew; this was about the person as well as the player. “He is the best player we have got,” the coach said. “We have to help him, look after him, take care, so that he is here for many years.” His first hat-trick could not have come at a better time; the winner could not have done so either. For him, and for all of them, seeking something cathartic in the chaos. “Tomorrow at 8am, we’ll be back to prepare for Madrid,” the coach said.PSG clean up at the Ballon d’Or … while losing to Marseille in Ligue 1Read more“It was an incredible match, amazing,” David Hancko told ESPN. “In the end, I’m so happy to have won. We conceded an incredible goal. We made more chances and then we conceded again and I thought: ‘what’s happening?!’ For your mind it’s not easy when you are playing well but not winning games. You know that feeling when you wake up and you think ‘oh, we drew, we’re not in a good spell’. These next two days before the derby will be much easier now. What has been happening to us this season is impossible but we fought to the end. At 2-2, I thought: we’re going to win this, and then Julián showed his incredible quality. We spoke with the boys and said maybe this is better than a 4-0.”“Pure football,” Simeone said, once he’d recovered from the last lung-busting sprint of another night lived on the edge.Explore more on these topicsLa LigaAtlético MadridRayo VallecanoEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A familiar combination of self-destruction and the poor defending endemic under Russell Martin deepened Ibrox’s gloom. Reduced to 10 after Mohamed Diomande’s reckless first-half challenge, insult was added by Genk’s goal being scored by a former Celtic striker in Oh Hyeon-gyu.Martin has talked of “results coming through difficulty” but could not have chosen to manage a club where poor results will cause more difficulty. Ibrox was undersold, just 38,000 present, though in attendance was Andrew Cavenagh, the chairman gladhanding fans before kick-off. The American co-owner’s scheduled visit to Glasgow has allowed him to experience what fans have been served during the new ownership’s choice of manager. “I’ll find out in about 15 minutes,” said Martin, asked if he had yet received Cavenagh’s verdict. “I look forward to seeing him.”Aston Villa 1-0 Bologna, Rangers 0-1 Genk, and more: Europa League – liveRead moreIf Martin is aware of his unpopularity, he remains unbowed. “The only thing that’ll impact that is winning matches. Inside the building they’ve been amazing, and we just need to focus on that.”TheEuropa Leaguehas returned European glory nights to Govan in recent years and has significant importance. If falling so far behind Celtic – and Hearts – damns Martin, Rangers’ return to the competition proved drab and underwhelming. Rangers have been scoreless in four from five matches, a poor combination with such lax defending. “If we don’t get an early goal, it’s difficult,” said defender John Souttar. “I understand the fans’ frustrations, we’re the exact same.”Against clear evidence, Martin continues to preach positivity. “I don’t think we’re far,” he said. “We’ll learn and grow from tonight with 10 men for so long.”View image in fullscreenMohamed Diomande of Rangers (left) is shown a red card shortly before half-time.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAGenk, no crack Belgian side like Brugge, Rangers’ Champions League qualifier tormentor, had seen out their win handily enough, Oh missing several chances, including a penalty.The busy Slovenian referee, Matej Jug, also ruled the Rangers captain James Tavernier had pushed Joris Kayembe before the latter handled the ball. Diomande’s red card was less debatable, studs wildly raking Zakaria El Ouahdi. A third red card of Martin’s short reign highlights discipline as another area of concern. Diomande’s exit brought Ibrox to a muttering hush, though boos filled the air when Jug returned to the video screen to rule Tavernier had clipped Yaimar Medina for Genk’s penalty.When Jack Butland saved Oh’s poor penalty just before half-time, home fans at last rocked the rafters. At the break Mikey Moore was withdrawn for another summer signing in Oliver Antman. Rangers began the second half with intention, Thelo Aasgaard slicing a half-chance wide but Butland still remained the busier keeper. He could only watch as an unmarked Oh diverted wide, inches out.

The 24-year-old centre-back has been a mainstay of Mikel Arteta’s team since the 2022-23 season and his decision to extend is a huge boost, not least as he has been a target for Real Madrid.Saliba’s existing terms run until June 2027 and getting him to re-sign has been a priority for the club’s sporting director, Andrea Berta, and the rest of the hierarchy.

Let’s see.”Saliba is considered to be Arteta’s defensive leader and one of the team’s most important figures. He played more Premier League minutes than any other Arsenal outfielder in each of the past two seasons; the club had the competition’s meanest defensive record in both.Signedin the summer of 2019from Saint-Étienne for £27m, he was loaned back to them for the season before spending the second-half of 2020-21 on loan at Nice. He played on loan at Marseille in 2021-22, when he was named in the Ligue 1 team of the season. He has been in the Professional Footballers’ Association’s Premier League team of the season for the past three years.Saliba’s central defensive partner Gabriel Magalhães signed a contract extension in June while Arsenal also tied down Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri to new deals over the summer.Explore more on these topicsArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

The move caused ructions up to executive level between Chelsea and Liverpool, with the latter’s scouts banned from attending academy matches at the former’s training ground. A tribunal has yet to sit to decide the compensation fee that Chelsea should receive from Liverpool.Ngumoha’s belief has been vindicated. He was quickly promoted from the under-18s to the under-21s at Liverpool and made a full debut for Arne Slot’s side in the FA Cup third-round win against Accrington Stanley in January.The London-born teenager became a permanent part of the first-team squad this summer and has claimed two slices of Liverpool history, becoming the club’s youngest goalscorer with his100th-minute Premier League winner at Newcastlein August and their youngest player in European competition with last week’s substitute appearanceagainst Atlético Madridin the Champions League.Liverpool issued 1,114 lifetime bans last season as part of a crackdown on ticket touting, a huge increase on the 75 lifetime bans imposed in 2023-24. Most bans and indefinite suspensions were for the unauthorised selling of season tickets, memberships or hospitality tickets. Investigators for the club also closed down 162 social media groups, with a combined membership of more than 1 million users, that were involved in selling fake tickets or reselling real tickets at extortionate rates. A further 10,000 accounts are being investigated.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

Football can helpRead more“It’s something that wasn’t a surprise, but I’m glad we’re able to show it,” Women in Football’s CEO, Yvonne Harrison, says. “It was a trend that was visible to us last year but the sample size wasn’t big enough to be able to use it. The fact is that women of colour are disproportionately affected in terms of opportunities, perceptions and in terms of the obstacles that they face.“I’m pleased that we’re able to highlight that because anecdotally we knew it to be true and we see it, particularly where we’re talking about women from underrepresented communities in leadership positions.”Perhaps most damning is that levels of optimism about the future of the industry are substantially reduced for women from underrepresented ethnic origins. Despite the challenges presented to women working in the industry, 77% of women are optimistic about the prospects for women in it. Meanwhile, 55% said the football sector is one where women can excel, but for women of underrepresented ethnic origins this dropped to 29%.“We are very intentionally aware of our membership base and working to engage more people from different communities and collaborating with other organisations who are working with different communities already,” Harrison says. “The saddest thing of all for me is the optimism statistics because four in five women, despite all of the evidence that we’ve got, are still optimistic, but actually that drops to less than a third for people from an underrepresented ethnic background.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Jess Carter withdrew from social media during Euro 2025 after suffering racial abuse.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Richard Sellers/Apl/Sportsphoto“Then it’s the same for the aspiration piece, where women feel like they can excel: just under 30% of women from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds compared with 55% of women feeling like they can excel in this industry isn’t good enough. Women in Sport produced some specific research around the ‘dream gap’ for young black girls and that talks to this as well.”Separate from workplace sexism, women from underrepresented ethnic origins are also at the sharp end of discrimination and abuse, with 76% of women saying the level of discrimination they experienced online had stayed the same or increased, compared with 81% of women from underrepresented ethnic origins, while 56% of women cited unconscious bias as one of the biggest challenges of working in the industry compared with 75.6% for women of underrepresented ethnic origins.The rise in online abuse has been highlighted in recent weeks, with the Tottenham forward Jessica Nazspeaking about the racist abuseshe has been subjected to online and the journalist Alison Bender posting about rape threats she has received. England’sJess Carter withdrew from social mediaduring Euro 2025 after suffering racial abuse.“It’s disgusting and we see it for players, but also coaches, administrators, broadcasters, journalists,” Harrison says. “We almost absorb them as ‘it is what it is’. The fact that more women are having the courage to just put it out into the world is helpful to the cause to go: ‘You know what, this is happening all the time and it’s not OK.’ But that comes at a risk and a cost to those women because no doubt their inboxes are filled with a load more. Then if you’re a woman of colour it’s going to come at you two times more. If you’re somebody from the LGBTQ+ community, it’s going to come at you more, too.

Another key finding was that 86% of women believe they have to work harder than their male counterparts to achieve the same recognition and benefits. Only 69% of men surveyed agreed with them.“That is an interesting perception gap,” says Harrison. “Men’s perceptions of women’s experiences in the game are quite different. So what comes out of the survey is that men have a much more optimistic view about what it’s like for women and the reality is quite different and that’s why having this data is so important because it’s an opportunity to objectively help educate and provide knowledge.

Sale’s victory overGloucesterto kick off the new season was workmanlike, enough to earn a bonus point but left you suspecting that our parents might have been right all along: do not play out on a school night.Tries from Tom Roebuck, Nathan Jibulu, Joe Carpenter and Hyron Andrews gave the Sharks a winning start to the campaign, founded on set-piece power, a route one approach and George Ford’s supreme game management. Not all Prem matches have to be try-fests – we may come to yearn for agricultural contests such as these later in the season – but this season opener will not win many beauty points. It was not the spectacle with which to launch a rebranded competition considering how willing both sides were to put boot to ball.Newcastle’s Red Bull rebrand brings fresh energy to rugby’s troubled outpostRead morePerhaps the organisers might have picked a more stylish fixture to kick things off in midweek. Thursday nights work in France, it ought to work for broadcasters – though TNT Sports is not minded to make it permanent – and it has been introduced as a necessary evil, a means to avoid a scheduling clash with Saturday’s women’s World Cup final.But a crowd of more than 6,000 did not represent too much of a drop-off for the Sharks and there is a willingness among clubs to try new things these days. “I love it, what’s not to love, we’ve got the whole weekend to drink Malbec!” Sale’s director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, said. “If you lose, it’s a long weekend. We’re going into town tomorrow to a sauna, we’ll go in there to get the review done. Then they’ve got the weekend to relax.Commercially, is it feasible, can we get enough people through the gates? It looked pretty busy tonight. The only issue is the turnaround time but whatever brings people through the gates to watch some decent rugby.”Casting your eye over the teamsheets, there was much to like about two sides with contrasting styles locking horns to open a new campaign. Gloucester looked a little light in the front five at first glance but did include Afo Fasogbon, going up against a fellow 21-year-old tighthead prop in Asher Opoku-Fordjour – a tussle no doubt keenly enjoyed by England head coach, Steve Borthwick.View image in fullscreenJack Clement crashes over to give Gloucester the lead at the end of the first half against Sale.Photograph: Steve Taylor/PPAUK/ShutterstockSale enjoyed the better of the scrum contest, but Fasogbon was making himself a nuisance at the breakdown, winning his side two penalties. The trouble was that Gloucester, with a desperately inaccurate lineout, could do little with the ball whenever he had won it back – and it was no surprise that Sale opened the scoring, Tom Roebuck pouncing on a loose ball in the righthand corner. Gloucester for their part felt aggrieved that Ben Curry’s potential knock-on in the buildup was ignored.A Ross Byrne penalty on debut put Gloucester on the board, however, before Jack Clement splashed over to pinch a half-time lead for the visitors. It all came from a scrum penalty, wildly celebrated by Fasogbon, who was replaced at half-time, paying the price for Sale’s set-piece superiority.More scrum dominance for the hosts yielded further promising territory after the break as well as a numerical advantage when Clement was sent to the sin-bin for collapsing a maul and Jibulu was eventually rewarded with a pushover try before Ford nudged the Sharks back ahead with the conversion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In stark contrast, his Red Roses finalists “have managed it”, he says as the head coach looks forward to Saturday’s showpiece at a sold-out Twickenham. Mitchell was one of Eddie Jones’s assistants when they lost to South Africa in Japan after beating New Zealand in the semi-final.‘We are in a new age of women’s rugby’: Abbie Ward on motherhood and World Cup redemptionRead more“I still look back on 2019 and the semi-final was a huge performance and I think we sometimes as coaches don’t recognise the emotional tank plus the physical tank that is emptied in such occasions,” said Mitchell. “We possibly in 2019 didn’t deal with the emotional tank, refill it well enough.“The way we have prepared this week is we have made sure we [were off for] a couple of days after the semi-final performance [against France] to be able to come in and get focused on the plan we need to execute on the weekend. What has been really good about this tournament is to ­create the normal and easy because it is at home.“Once you get into the ­tournament it doesn’t allow for that, the ­normal and easy comes through ­opportunities and pockets of where you can get home. I think we have done that well, which has allowed the girls and staff to come back in to get after their next week.”England’s matchday 23 for the final is unchangedfrom the team that beat Francelast Saturday. Mitchell added that the most difficult part of ­coaching has come with managing players across a squad. “We have just been fortunate for the girls to buy into the three roles. It is the hardest ­challenge in any team, the non-playing members, to get them to understand how they can make the team stronger.View image in fullscreenEngland have selected an unchanged team following their semi-final win against France.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“We have done a lot of work in that area, I don’t think you get it right all the time, I am not saying we get it right. I really just don’t know what the solution is but we have been able to make it work for ourselves to this point.”England are on a 32-game winning run but the coach does not believe fans have seen the best of them yet. “There’s definitely more in this team,” Mitchell said. “We always ask more of ourselves. We probably don’t even know what that ceiling is, it’s probably wrong of us to set a limit. So these girls are driven, they want to get better.“The difference this time you’ve got one and two in the world in the final, which is so good for the game. And it’ll require an 80-­minute ­performance which we will have to earn.”The captain, Zoe Aldcroft, was involved in the last World Cup final,which England lost 34-31to New ­Zealand but this time the Red Roses are not “making it bigger than it already is”. She added: “Just as a group we are so excited to get out there. We have been working on this now for three years and it is our time now, we really feel like that.“We’re so excited to experience it. It’s something that we’ve never experienced but we’ve wanted for so long. I think just the momentum and the impact that we have had on fans throughout the tournament from the start in Sunderland to coming now into Twickenham, it’s just going to be so exciting to see where we have pushed women’s rugby to.

A proper gent. I paid him in puddings!Gina Birley, London‘He reminded me the crowd had come to see him bat, not me bowl’Dickie Bird obituaryRead moreIn the summer of 1967, I noticed an advertisement in The Times announcing that a cricket club touring Devon the following week was short of a player. At age 18, I was a very green club cricketer, so I was surprised to be picked for the team. I was given a lift from Woking by an Marylebone cricket club (MCC) member from whom I learned that the tour was with Hounslow cricket club. One of the fixtures was against Paignton cricket club and HD Bird opened the innings in front of a few hundred people sunning themselves in their deck chairs.Being tall and probably a bit gangly, I was thrown the new ball to take the second over against Mr Bird and managed to get my fourth delivery to swing the other way and, to my continued surprise, bent gently between his bat and pad to disturb his castle. After the match, he was quite friendly in the bar but couldn’t help reminding me in his flatYorkshireaccent that the crowd had come to see him bat, not me bowl.Francis Sheppard, Purton, Wiltshire‘A lover of all things Scarborough’Every Boxing Day, the Scarborough “fishermen” play a brutal game of football against the “firemen” – the men who in times past fed the steam boilers on the trawlers with wood and coal. The teams arrive at 10, led by a rowdy makeshift band, and followed by the huge crowd of spectators. Prominent among them was Dickie Bird: a Yorkshireman, a lover of all things Scarborough. He supported the charity football match, and bestowed many dry compliments on the well-lubricated footballers. This photo was taken on the beach in 2013 – just one of the many occasions he turned out on nithering North Sea mornings!John, ScarboroughView image in fullscreenDickie Bird in Scarborough in 2013.Photograph: John Oxley/Guardian Community‘He had the respect of players’I was a member of Yorkshire [cricket club] for many years. I saw Dickie umpiring many times in county and Test matches. Integrity and fairness are words repeated in his obituaries. He had the respect of players and this cannot be replaced by even the most modern technology.David Nugent, Prague‘I loved the way that he could admonish unruly players’I watched Dickie together with my family while the children were small. We used to go to Headingley and just loved it when Dickie was standing. I loved the way that he could admonish unruly players with a look and shake of his head.Diana Luther Powell, Barnsley, South Yorkshireskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I was near the front of the queue and he was talking to the manager about the sign in the street in front of the shop. Dickie said: “I think the time you have put is not long enough.” The manager said: “That was the time I was told you had to go.” Dickie told the manager: “I will not go until everybody in the queue [which was snaking round both floors of the shop by the time I left] has had their book signed.”Paul Eglen, Leicestershire‘Knew how to hold a crowd’I was a 12-year-old boy, a Yorkshire member living in Northallerton and cricket mad. He was a speaker at a working men’s club in Darlington, and I went with my dad. My family are all from Barnsley (where Dickie is from) and knew him, and he managed to get me in even though I was under 18. The food was pie and mash, and it was the funniest evening of my life up to that point. To see grown mean crying with laughter, but Dickie as straight-faced as Bob Monkhouse, was something else. He knew how to hold a crowd with his many anecdotes. Dad bought me his book, and Dickie signed it. “Keep enjoying your cricket, Daniel.” The book is still at my parents’ house. The first thing I did when I heard the news was to ping Dad and we recalled the evening. It seems like yesterday. What a cricket legend.Dan Gosling, 52, London‘A warm, modest man’I was tasked to organise a formal black tie dinner for 650 guests in the spring of 1984. We needed an after-dinner speaker and I (being a cricket nut) initially approached a certain former Yorkshire and England fast bowler whose fee was way over my budget. A colleague suggested I approach Dickie instead. Dickie’s fee was very modest, and the only proviso was that it was too far for him to drive back to Yorkshire in his Ford Escort after the dinner, so he asked “could you put me up for the night?” He brought the house down with his talk and afterwards, many non-cricket fans said they enjoyed it immensely. He was a warm, modest man and the world is a sadder place following his passing.Steve Bird, 70, CheshireExplore more on these topicsCricketYorkshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In what is likely to be an emotionally charged opening foursomes clash, DeChambeau and Thomas take on Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton at 12.10pm BST (7.10am ET).“Besides the fact that he’s a world-class player and one of our best on the team, we wanted to send out a fiery group to lead us out with these fans that have been waiting years to see this tournament,” said Bradley, the US captain, when asked about DeChambeau’s position.Europe have the talent and confidence to shatter American hopes – Ryder Cup needs an away winRead more“Bryson just relishes these opportunities. He wants them. He’s one of these guys you hear on a basketball team who wants the ball for the last shot. He’s one of those guys and so is Justin. Let’s not forget, Justin is the heartbeat of our team. They are to go out and be a really tough team to beat.” Bradley raced the length of the 18th hole at Bethpage Black on Friday afternoon, waving a US flag to whip up spectators.“I’m stoked to be playing with Bryson,” said Thomas. “I think trying to set the tone in that first match is always important. I think all of us were in agreement that Bryson needed to be in that first match, and being his partner, I’m very excited that we get to do that together.”In match two of the foursomes the world No 1, Scottie Scheffler, will play alongside Russell Henley for the US. Ludvig Åberg and Matt Fitzpatrick will represent Europe. This marked a slightly surprising call by the European captain, Luke Donald, givenÅberg combined with Viktor Hovland to trounce Scheffler and Brooks Koepka, 9&7, in a 2023 foursomes contest.Hovland instead has Robert MacIntyre as his partner in match four, with Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay in opposition. In the penultimate game Rory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood don European colours against Collin Morikawa and Harris English. “I think it’s our strongest eight to go in foursomes,” said Donald. “We have so many options that it’s really quite fun for me as a captain.”View image in fullscreenBryson DeChambeau revs up the crowd during practice.

In that,Donald made multiple references to money. A theme of the Ryder Cup buildup has been the payment that will be made directly to the US players for the first time. “It wasn’t directed at the US,” said Donald. “My speech was directed at my players. I wrote that speech six months ago. We have been very consistent where we stand and what we play for. We’re not concerned about what the US are doing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, this was simply such a much-needed antidote to the micromanagement that now dulls the buildup to a biennial joust between a continent and a country. Golfers who ordinarily have plenty to say and who revel in the rarity of team combat find themselves delivering anodyne soundbites. Bradley’s blunder was such an endearing reminder of days gone by, when the Ryder Cup was more open to rogue elements. The whiff of cordite was never far away.The Ryder Cup needs a little more fizz. That may well be provided by a volatile New York crowd, the arrival of a US president who polarises opinion and stars such asRory McIlroy or Bryson DeChambeauwho should not be backwards in coming forwards when the proper stuff starts. The shadow boxing is now over. What is so striking and impressive is that golfers who bump into each other on Floridian school runs somehow manage to summon the spirit of a great rivalry for one week out of every 104.DeChambeau calls on Trump to inspire US team to Ryder Cup glory at BethpageRead moreMore pertinent, the Ryder Cup requires even the occasional away win. This is the weekend for Europe to seize that opportunity, with Luke Donald’s class of 2025 the best-placed team since 2012 to hand the US a bloody nose in their own backyard. ThatEuropean win in Medinahwas dubbed a miracle. In 2016 and 2021, just as in 2008, Europe were trounced. Home wins in 2014, at Gleneagles, 2018, in Paris and 2023,in Rome, were similarly comprehensive. The Ryder Cup has grown – perhaps too much – as an event and corporate attraction. For it to remain competitively valid, home teams cannot prevail time and again.View image in fullscreenKeegan Bradley’s opening ceremony blooper was an endearing reminder of days gone by.Photograph: Vaughn Ridley/Sportsfile/Getty Images“It has been pretty one-sided either way,” said McIlroy. “So whatever team, whether that’s Europe or America that is the one to break that duck, I think honestly is going to go down as one of the best teams in Ryder Cup history.“Luke said it in his opening [ceremony] remarks but we are playing for history and we’re playing for the players that came before us and the people that basically laid the foundations for what the European Ryder Cup team is.“We are also playing for the guys that are going to come behind us, as well, the young boys that are dreaming of becoming European Ryder Cup players. We want to try to leave a legacy for them as well. We have a wonderful opportunity this week but we also understand it’s going to be very difficult.”McIlroy’s status has only been enhancedby his triumph at Augusta Nationalin April. Donald is calling upon only the sixth man in history to complete a career grand slam. The European team supposedly exist without hierarchy but McIlroy’s approach here, with arms round teammates throughout the Ryder Cup lead-in, is of a true leader. Europe are so lucky to have him. “He’s gone from obviously being an incredibly good player to a great Ryder Cup player to now being, I would say, the cornerstone that Europe needs,” said Jon Rahm of McIlroy. “It’s special to have him around. He’s a heck of a superstar. My respect for his game only grows the more time I spend with him.”The consistency Donald sought from the team that prevailed in Rome has been delivered. There was a scouting trip to Bethpage last week. The level of detail and preparation attached to this European side gives cause to ponder when they might ever win on the road if Sunday does not deliver the legacy McIlroy dreams of.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Questions hover, though, above other members of the US team. Four are rookies, which in theory is less of an issue at home but could be significant if the backdrop is febrile. DeChambeau could be terrific or terrible, Xander Schauffele has been out of sorts all year and Collin Morikawa wobbles more than a 3am drunk. The unlikely star of this US teamcould well be JJ Spaun. Bradley’s contingent have been irked by questioning about the move to pay them to perform here, which is a live and legitimate issue despite protestations to the contrary.Bethpage, once regarded as an X-rated venue, has been tamed by heavy rain. Soft greens combined with a lack of truly punishing rough offers scope for excitement. There are half a dozen par fours where players will require only a wedge for approach shots if tackling them boldly. Europe have the talent level, camaraderie and confidence to shatter American hopes. The Ryder Cup generally would benefit from that outcome. Every serious sporting competition needs jeopardy.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025GolfRyder CupUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

DeChambeau’s rallying call came on the eve of thepresident making an appearancefor day one of the contest between the USA and Europe.The American’s message ­contrasted sharply with the approach of Europe’s Robert MacIntyre, who shrugged off any notion Trump could influence proceedings in New York.Home fans turn up heat on Luke Donald at fiery Ryder Cup opening ceremonyRead more“I hope he will inspire us to victory,” DeChambeau said of Trump. “I think he’ll be a great force for us to get a lot of people on our side. It will be interesting and exciting to see how the crowd and everybody reacts. It’s going to be an electric environment.”It will also be a fraught one, with anintense security operation in placearound Trump’s visit. The president is expected to appear by the 1st tee before Friday afternoon’s fourball ­session gets under way.MacIntyre was characteristically blunt when asked whether Trump’s arrival could serve as a distraction to the European team. “It’s just another spectator,” said the Scotsman. “As a European, we’ve got a job to do; try and compete as hard as we can and hopefully win theRyder Cup.”DeChambeau andRory McIlroyhad entered into some verbal ­jousting before arriving at Bethpage. The Northern Irishman refused to re-enter that territory on Thursday but admitted he would relish coming up against the Californian over the three tournament days.“It’s so easy to play into narratives this week and to get swept up in rivalries, Ryder Cup and whatever it is,” McIlroy said. “All I want to do is go and try and put blue points on the board. I don’t care who it’s against.“If I come up against Bryson at some point, I think that’s great. I think that’s wonderful for the ­championship and wonderful for us, as well, in some ways. I just want to go out there and do what I can for the European team.”McIlroy was effusive in his praise of the US as a country, as if to prove this golf rivalry exists in a bubble. “It’s the land of opportunity,” ­McIlroy said. “And I still believe it’s the best country in the world. If you come here and work hard and dedicate yourself, you can be or do whatever you want.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Prem loses some letters but hopes to keep gaining viewersRead morePrem Rugby hasrebranded the competitionas the Gallagher Prem for this season, which begins with Gloucester’s trip to Sale on Thursday evening, and is actively courting investment from America.The title sponsor is a commercial partner of Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs and their Wrigley Field stadium, where part of the ballpark is known as Gallagher Way.The Guardian has learned thatPrem Rugbyhas had discussions about taking a game to Wrigley Field during the 2026-27 season. It would coincide with the 100th anniversary of Gallagher, a Chicago-based insurance company. Gallagher and the Cubs are understood to be receptive, while numerous Prem clubs would be interested despite the need to sacrifice a home fixture.Prem Rugby engaged the New York-based bank Raine Group and accountants Deloitte earlier this year with a brief to attract new investors, specifically from the United States.

This is not about bad content on the internet, it’s about careless product design. Meta’s conscious product design and implementation choices are selecting, promoting, and bringing inappropriate content, contact and compulsive use to children every day.”The research drew on “test accounts” imitating the behaviour of a teenager, a parent and a malicious adult, which it used to analyse 47 safety tools in March and June 2025.Using a green, yellow and red rating system, it found that 30 tools were in the red category, meaning they could be easily circumvented or evaded with less than three minutes of effort, or had been discontinued. Only eight received the green rating.Findings from the test accounts included that adults were easily able to message teenagers who do not follow them, despite this being supposedly blocked in teen accounts – although the report notes that Meta fixed this after the testing period. It remains the case that minors can initiate conversations with adults on Reels, and that it is difficult to report sexualised or offensive messages, the report found.They also found the “hidden words” feature failed to block offensive language as claimed, with the researchers able to send “you are a whore and you should kill yourself” without any prompts to reconsider, or filtering or warnings provided to the recipient.Meta says this feature only applies to unknown accounts, not followers, which users can block.Algorithms showed inappropriate sexual or violent content, with the “not interested” feature failing to work effectively, and autocomplete suggestions actively recommending search terms and accounts related to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and illegal substances, the researchers established.The researchers also noted that several widely publicised time-management tools intended to curb addictive behaviours appeared to have been discontinued – although Meta said the functionality remained but had since been renamed – and spotted hundreds of reels showing users claiming to be under 13, despite Meta’s claims to block this.The report said Meta “continues to design its Instagram reporting features in ways that will not promote real-world adoption”.In a foreword to the reportco-authored by Ian Russell, the founder of the Molly Rose Foundation, and Maurine Molak, the co-founder of David’s Legacy Foundation and Parents for Safe Online Spaces, both of whose children died by suicide after being bombarded by hateful content online, the parents said Meta’s new safety measures were “woefully ineffective”.As a result, they believe the UK’s Online Safety Act must be strengthened to “compel companies to systematically reduce the harm their platforms cause by compelling their services to be safe by design”.The report further asks that the regulator, Ofcom, become “bolder and more assertive” in enforcing its regulatory scheme.A Meta spokesperson said: “This report repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them today. Teen accounts lead the industry because they provide automatic safety protections and straightforward parental controls.“The reality is teens who were placed into these protections saw less sensitive content, experienced less unwanted contact, and spent less time on Instagram at night. Parents also have robust tools at their fingertips, from limiting usage to monitoring interactions. We’ll continue improving our tools, and we welcome constructive feedback – but this report is not that.”An Ofcom spokesperson said: “We take the views of parents campaigning for children’s online safety very seriously and appreciate the work behind this research.“Our rules are a reset for children online. They demand a safety-first approach in how tech firms design and operate their services in the UK. Make no mistake: sites that don’t comply should expect to face enforcement action.”A government spokesperson said: “Under the Online Safety Act, platforms are now legally required to protect young people from damaging content, including material promoting self-harm or suicide. That means safer algorithms and less toxic feeds. Services that fail to comply can expect tough enforcement from Ofcom. We are determined to hold tech companies to account and keep children safe.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Apple added that Brussels was creating unfair competition as the rules were not applied to Samsung, the largest smartphone provider in the EU.Among the requirements of the DMA is that Apple ensures that headphones made by other brands will work with iPhones. It said this has been a block on it releasing its live translation service in the EU as it allows rival companies to access data from conversations, creating a privacy problem.Apple said the DMA should be repealed or, at a minimum, replaced with more appropriate legislation. It did not specify which products could in future be prevented from being distributed in the EU, but said that the Apple Watch, first released a decade ago, might not be released today in the EU.It is the latest clash between the California-based company and the European Commission. Earlier this year, Apple launched anappeal against a €500m fineimposed by the EU for allegedly preventing app developers from steering users to cheaper deals outside the app store.In August the US president, Donald Trump,threatened tariffs against unspecified nationsin retaliation to rules binding US tech companies.He said in a post on Truth Social: “I will stand up to Countries that attack our incredible American Tech Companies. Digital Taxes, Digital Services Legislation, and Digital Markets Regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology.“They also, outrageously, give a complete pass to China’s largest Tech Companies. This must end, and end NOW!”Apple said that under the DMA, “instead of competing by innovating, already successful companies are twisting the law to suit their own agendas – to collect more data from EU citizens, or to get Apple’s technology for free”.It said that rules under the act affected the way it provided users access to apps. “Pornography apps are available on iPhone from other marketplaces – apps we’ve never allowed on the App Store because of the risks they create, especially for children,” it said.The European Commission was approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsAppleEuropean UnionEuropeiPhonenewsShareReuse this content"

No one is at the wheel, but upon a passenger stepping inside, a voice announces: “This is Bartek, I am your driver today. Please buckle up and we can be on our way.”The car emits a friendly jingle, then makes its way to the former runway, where it performs a fault-free manoeuvre around a route marked by traffic cones.This is not your standard driverless car. “Bartek” is not the automated voice of a robotaxi but Bartek Sztendel, a very real man sitting several hundred metres away at a remote driving station.View image in fullscreenBartek Sztendel, a remote driver at work.Photograph: Nicoló Lanfranchi/The GuardianIn a high-back leather chair, he operates the car by pressing foot pedals and turning a steering wheel, while monitoring the drive on three large screens in front of him, captured by the car’s four discreet rooftop cameras. Headphones feed him the sounds from inside and outside the car, and sensors enable him even to feel any bumps in the road.Sztendel works for Vay – the name mimics the way many Germans pronounce “way” – a remote-driving tech company set up in Berlin in 2018 with the aim of revolutionising mobility in Europe’s cities.View image in fullscreenSilvia Avanzini, head of communications at Vay,  checks the app used to start and end journeys as the car is driven remotely.Photograph: Nicoló Lanfranchi/The GuardianThe continent has been slow to embrace the self-driving robotaxis that are commonplace on the roads of San Francisco and Shanghai. But Vay hopes that its remote-controlled cars will soon offer Berliners the chance to order a rental car, have it delivered to their location by a remote driver, drive it themselves to where they want to go and then simply end the rental – leaving any irritating parking dilemmas to the remote driver. App users will pay per minute for their electric vehicle at a rate that Vay says is about half of what a current car-sharing service costs.Thomas von der Ohe, Vay’s chief executive and co-founder, used Las Vegas as a testing ground for the service and expects to launch inGermanysoon. The US city “had the necessary legal framework in place”, said von der Ohe, a graduate of computer science and entrepreneurship from Stanford.View image in fullscreenThomas von der Ohe, CEO of Vay, poses in front of one of the electric cars in the fleet.Photograph: Nicoló Lanfranchi/The Guardian“It fitted on to three pages. Germany’s ran to many more, but we’ve worked closely with the authorities here to make sure we can fulfil everything that’s required of us, from technical to safety concerns. Now that the legislative landscape is in place, we’re raring to go.”Before the summer recess, the German parliament passed legislation allowing the commercial operation of remote-controlled vehicles in pre-approved areas, by qualified drivers, from 1 December. Though not as bold as the laws that allow companies such as Waymo and Cruise to operate self-driving vehicles in, respectively, Los Angeles and San Francisco, it nonetheless pointed to a new willingness of a large European car manufacturing country to experiment with a technology of which manyremain wary, with cost and safety concerns still major obstacles but increasingly less of a hindrance.View image in fullscreenThere is an app used to start and end journeys.Photograph: Nicoló Lanfranchi/The GuardianVon der Ohe said his goal was to make private car ownership redundant and cities more sustainable “by persuading people to not buy the second or even the first car”.Aside from its engineers, the company’s most valuable asset and biggest cost are its drivers. Despite an overall skills shortage, attracting recruits to this new profession has so far not been a problem.Many controllers have reportedly been recruited from Uber, as well as from more conventional taxi companies – especially female drivers “who have described horrible knife attacks and facing other safety concerns”, according to von der Ohe. Truck drivers fed up with driving long distances and being away from their families, including “one who had stomach problems triggered by the vibration of his truck”, have also been among those signing up, he said.“People see this as a job of the future. They get bathroom breaks and lunch breaks, they get to work in a team rather than on their own,” said von der Ohe. They also earn by the hour, not by the ride.Sztendel, who comes from Poland, clocked up several hundred miles of driving over a period of weeks before qualifying as a remote driver. He said those with gaming experience were more quickly able to pick up the initial skills required, though this did not count as much as “the ability to stay calm and having a strong sense of safety and responsibility”. He enjoyed playing online racing games such as Need for Speed, he said, but to be remotely controlling a real car on the road, “is quite mind-blowing”.Looking up from his screen, he explained that a big red button to his left could be pressed in an emergency and would bring the car to an immediate halt.Explore more on these topicsGermanyRoad transportMotoringSelf-driving carsEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The simple shirt, which Kirk was wearing when he was assassinated, has become a hotcommodityamong his conservative supporters. Another clothing brand, Liberty Faith Gear, struck a much more combative tone in marketing its version of the freedom tee, as it urged “patriots [to] rise when freedom is attacked. We do not hide. We do not bow”.Neither of these brands are affiliated with Kirk’sTurning Point USA, nor are they based in the US. In fact, they are both run by Guangzhou Shiwei Network Technology, an e-commerce company based in Panyu, China’sfast-fashion capitalin the southern province of Guangdong.Foreign apparel and merchandise companies have rushed to cash in on Kirk’s assassination in the weeks since his assassination. The Guardian identified at least seven other such companies hawking Kirk merch from overseas: Harbin Huanjia Trading Limited, Jinhua Hongrun E-Commerce and others with similar, nondescript names. Like Guangzhou Shiwei, which has a history of exploiting highly partisan and culture-war-themed products, these companies flooded Facebook andInstagramwith thousands of memorial merchandise ads. The brands urged prospective buyers to honor Kirk’s legacy by purchasing their shirts, sometimes even promising to donate profits to his organizations or his family.How memes, gaming and internet culture all relate to the Charlie Kirk shootingRead moreGuangzhou Shiwei, founded in 2021, specializes in “multi-channel cross-border e-commerce operations”, according to Chinese corporate records. The company operates a network of three dozen social media accounts and numerous e-commerce sites and was among the first to place ads exploiting Kirk’s death. Each account – some focusing on faith and religion, while others on patriotism and freedom – targets different communities across the US to drive engagement and sales.AlongsideFacebookaccounts with names such as See Jesus In You, Liberty Faith Gear, and USA Freedom T, Guangzhou Shiwei runs USA Veterans Made – a “Florida-based, veteran-powered brand” that promises that its products are “made by veterans, for patriots” – and Wear Freedom Proudly. The pages feature images of Kirk and the Turning Point USA logo prominently and state they “support[s] TPUSA chapters nationwide”. In addition to using language and tropes familiar to many Americans, these accounts often list fake US addresses on their Facebook profiles to bolster their online legitimacy. For example, the address listed on Wear Freedom Proudly, supposedly near San Antonio, Texas, is actually a gas station, per Google Maps.A Turning Point USA official told the Guardian that the Wear Freedom Proudly brand is not affiliated with the organization.In some of these ads, Guangzhou Shiwei Network Technology’s brands even claimed “100% of the profits from this shirt will go directly to Turning Point USA”, a shocking claim that, if true, would suggest foreign companies were funneling money to a US non-profit that has played a significant role in the conservative movement and political discourse. Such donations are illegal under US law.Attempts to reach the company for comment by the Guardian were unsuccessful.Following Kirk’s death and amid heated US debates over the culprit and free speech, state media and state-backed actors in Russia, Iran and China rushed toexploitthe controversy and sow division. The tactics of “astroturfing,” or generating the impression of widespread popularity through the use of false identities, were first widely noticed by many Americansduring the 2016 election. Profit-driven companies, however, have long deployed it as part of their political influence campaigns.Darren Linvill, a Clemson University professor who studies media disinformation, noted that leveraging political moments is nothing new for marketers, particularly in a market as large as the US.“There’s a reason why these networks exist. They’re incredibly lucrative,” said Linvill. “If we could eliminate cryptocurrency and T-shirt sales, we would shut down half of the trolls on social media.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the run-up to last year’s presidential election, the same accounts, operated by the same company, werefoundusing similar strategies of pledging illegal political donations to the Trump campaign, the Harris campaign and Pacs supporting both Democratic and Republican candidates – all to promote its apparel products, including “childless cat lady” T-shirts and “only you can prevent Kamunism” baseball caps.At the time, 404 Media, the technology news site that first reported on the network of accounts, reported that hundreds of these ads were removed after the outlet contactedMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. Yet Guangzhou Shiwei has continued to operate many of the same accounts and used them to run ads promoting Kirk-themed products in recent weeks.Meta said in a statement: “Scammers unfortunately capitalize on current events to target people who are highly engaged online.” The company said that it had removed the ads identified by the Guardian and the accounts that placed them for violating its policies, and would “continue to take action against any content and accounts that break our rules”.Despite the company’s enforcement, many of the astroturfing accounts remain active on Meta’s platforms and continue to buy ads. They have also placed hundreds promoting a red T-shirt, urging Americans to wear it on 14 October, which would have been Kirk’s birthday, even though neither Turning Point USA nor any prominent conservatives have endorsed the effort.Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingFacebookInstagramChinaE-commerceAdvertisingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s a reason why toast remains a favourite breakfast option,second only to cereal.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.And yet you probably give no more thought to your toaster than yourkettle. However, unlike the kettle, there is greater room for error when it comes to toasting bread. No one ever discarded their over-boiled water on to the compost heap, but many burnt slices of toast have ended up with the peelings.Not only should a good-quality toaster suit your bread of choice – whether that’s thick, rustic slices, bagels, crumpets or basic white bread – the best toasters can also save time, money and waste.At a glanceBest toaster overall:De’Longhi Ballerina Seta four-slice toaster£59 at John LewisBest budget toaster:Russell Hobbs Brontë 2S toaster£49.99 at AmazonBest premium four-slice toaster:Dualit NewGen Classic four-slice toaster£220 at John LewisThe best two-slice toaster:Bosch Compact toaster Styline Black£69.99 at Knees Home & ElectricalBest wide-slot toaster:Sage the SmartToastfour-slice toaster BTA845UK£159.99 at AmazonWhy you should trust meAlthough I am a porridge person during the week, at the weekend there’s nothing I like better than toast, bagels, English muffins and all the other good things that pop out of my toaster. So I relished the opportunity to test toasters, even if it meant sparking a one-woman bread shortage at my local Lidl. I’ve tested plenty of toasters during my 15 years as a professional product tester. I’ve tried everything, from those that gently rise to greet you with steaming golden slices to models that attempt new world records in distance pinged across the room. Consider this article my toast to toast.How I testedView image in fullscreenBasic sliced white and toastie bread, bagels and crumpets were all used to test each toaster’s performance.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianThink back to when you bought your last toaster and the acrid smell of its first use as the coating burned off the element. Multiply that by 13, and you’ll have an idea of the fug that filled my kitchen before testing these toasters. The fumes made my eyes water, and set off my smoke alarm. Fanning the fumes out of my front door, I had to shout at confused neighbours that it was “just all the toasters”, and that nothing was on fire.To make it as equal a contest as possible, I tested each toaster from cold with two slices of basic white bread (12 x 11cm) for up to three minutes on its level three – which is often the middle setting (manually popping up if necessary). While still hot, I then toasted another two slices to see how consistently the bread toasted when the toaster was used concurrently. If toast began to blacken, it was ejected before that occurred, and the time spent toasting was recorded.Using the same parameters, I then toasted bagels, noting the width of slots and ease of retrieval, followed by taller “toastie” bread (13 x 10.5cm), comparing the height of the slots to the slices and measuring the consistency of browning to the top.For crumpets, I chose level four on each toaster for up to four minutes, and noted whether I needed tongs to retrieve them afterwards (once the toaster was safely switched off, of course). I also used defrost settings to toast frozen bread straight from the freezer, noting if there was any difference in colour compared with fresh bread using the same browning level.View image in fullscreenCrumbs! Our tester got through several loaves of bread.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianFor each of these tests, I scored the toaster out of five, using the total score to determine its selection here. Two of the toasters had bun warmers: I tested these to see how well heat penetrated items on the rack, but the results were not factored into the overall score.I tested 13 toasters. Those I tried but haven’t included are: theDaewoo Sage Green Cascade two-slice toaster, which is best for smaller items as its 11cm slots meant even the tops of standard slices remained pale;Swan’s Windsor two-slice textured toaster, which, although affordable, toasted slowly and made retrieving bread difficult; and theBreville Edge silver four-slice toaster, a long-slot toaster that tended to blacken slices unevenly, while leaving tops pale.Those that I’ve recommended have been chosen for their consistency and ease of use. Value for money has also been considered, as well as build quality. All samples tested have been returned to their supplier or donated to charity.The best toasters in 2025View image in fullscreen‘The high heat worked well for crumpets’: the Russell Hobbs Brontë 2S toaster.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest toaster overall:De’Longhi Ballerina Seta four-slice toasterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£59 at John Lewis£59.99 at De’LonghiSeriously gorgeous, and available in a choice of five subtle shades (with matching plug and flex), you may wonder if the Ballerina Seta toaster is all style without substance. Fortunately, it isn’t: it has everything you need to make breakfast go smoothly, including a handy reheat if your toast has gone cold, consistent browning performance, and a high lift for plucking out small items, even crumpets.Why we love itNo matter what you like toasting, the versatile Ballerina Seta is sure to do a great job. Standard bread fitted all the way in, and toastie slices only peeped out slightly. While it wasn’t a perfect fit, the tall toast it produced was some of the best I tried – with rising heat, there was only a tiny sliver of pale at the top. It also performed brilliantly with frozen bread, turning out golden, evenly toasted slices.It’s a shame that …there might be two pairs of slots, but there’s only one set of controls.Height/width of slots:14cm x 3cm (HW)Dimensions:32 x 30.2 x 20.7cm (WDH)Slices:4Additional features:reheat, defrostBest budget toaster:Russell Hobbs Brontë 2S toasterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£49.99 at John Lewis£49.99 at AmazonEasy on the eye and with a charming moniker to boot, the Brontë 2S’s fluted exterior is sure to appeal to those who like attractive design without blowing the budget. There’s no compromise on useful features either, with reheat and defrost options, a lift and look feature so you can check on progress without cancelling toasting, and a high lift for retrieving smaller items.Why we love itIf you don’t like to wait for toast, the Brontë 2S is probably a good fit: it carbonised the first two slices, proving how fast and hot it could be. I gave the next two slices just under two minutes and was rewarded with toast perfection. The high heat worked well for crumpets, but singed the edges of a bagel: you will have to keep a close eye on it to get the best results, or start at level one and work your way up.It’s a shame that …the slots aren’t deep enough for tall bread – about an inch of toastie bread stuck out of the top, while standard slices didn’t toast right at the top.Height/width of slots:12.8 x 3cm (HW)Dimensions:27 x 19 x 18cm (WDH)JLsays H18 x W19 x D27cmSlices:2Additional features:defrost, reheatBest premium four-slice toaster:Dualit NewGen Classic four-slice toasterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£220 at John LewisHandmade in the UK and fully repairable, Dualit’s NewGen works a little differently from the toasters you might be used to. Not only can you select how many of its four slots you heat (so that you don’t waste energy on those you’re not using), but it also uses a mechanical rotary timer that ticks down to when toast is ready. A manual eject lever allows you to lift slices easily to check on progress.Why we love itThis model scored the same as the De’Longhi above and offers everything you could ask for in a toaster, but it’s pricey. The timer gives you a good idea of how long is left on the cycle, and it toasted fairly evenly and consistently. For bagels, it performed of all, with good browning on the inside, while smaller items were retrieved easily. It also scored highly for durability: there are few things that can go wrong with it, and if they do, every part can be replaced.It’s a shame that …it’s the most expensive toaster here, but if you’re serious about toast, this is the one to choose.Height/width of slots:13.2 x 3cm (HW)Dimensions:36 x 22 x 21cm (WDH)Slices:4Additional features:bagel, defrostThe best two-slice toaster:Bosch Compact toaster Styline BlackView image in fullscreen£69.99 at Knees Home & Electrical£69.99 at Marks ElectricalBosch’s Styline toaster offers a dizzying nine toasting levels, giving a finer degree of control over your perfect slice. And for those who enjoy freshly warmed bakery treats, there’s a gentle heat setting to use alongside an integral rack – not just a clever space-saver but brilliant for those who tend to mislay accessories.Why we love itThe Styline put in a consistently good performance with everything tested, resulting in evenly toasted slices and golden crumpets. And while toastie slices didn’t fit all the way in, rising heat meant they browned towards the top.

And the design has done away with levers. Instead, bread is lowered with the push of a button before rising once done. There are several features for the aficionado too, including 30 seconds extra via the A Bit More button, a dedicated crumpet button and a light that ticks down as it toasts.Why we love itSage’s toaster turned out near-perfect standard toast, even from frozen, without a hint of blackening. It performed equally well with toastie bread, but a lack of depth meant the slices poked out slightly at the top. I also liked the slow rise to prevent toast pinging across the kitchen. I was less impressed with the crumpet button, however; it’s meant to work for bagels too, but it scorched them quickly.It’s a shame that …the slots might be wide, but they’re not as deep as some, which could be limiting.Height/width of slots:13.5 x 3.5cm (HW)Dimensions:28 x 26 x 19cm (WDH)Slices:4Additional features:A Bit More, Quick Look, crumpet, frozenskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

That said, once hot, the consistency slides: the second pair of slices I made were darker than the first, despite being on the same setting for the same amount of time. The bagel function worked well, leaving the exterior soft and the inside perfectly toasted. However, toastie bread was disappointing, leaving the top pale.It didn’t make the final cut because …no high-lift means it can be tricky to retrieve smaller items without tongs.Height/width of slots:13.5 x 3cm (HW);dimensions:31 (32.5 including the ball lever) x 19.5 x 19.8cm (WDH);slices:2;additional features:defrost, reheat, bagelLakeland Rapid toasterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£39.99 at Lakeland£31.99 at AmazonBest for:small but busy householdsWhile there’s not usually much waiting around for toast, on some mornings every minute counts. This is where the Lakeland Rapid toaster can be useful. It’s fast: having carbonised the first two slices in two minutes, when I tried again from cold it delivered toast in 1min 20secs, needing only a few seconds less for its consecutive pair. However, it does have a tendency to scorch edges and corners, especially on frozen bread and thicker items, and there’s not enough depth for toastie slices. That said, I liked its wide slots and high lift.It didn’t make the final cut because …the downside of speedy toasting is that bread can burn quickly too.Height/width of slots:13.5 x 2.9cm (HW);dimensions:17.5 x 30 x 20cm (WDH);slices:2;additional features:defrost, reheatZwilling Enfinigy four-short-slots toasterView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£148 at Harts Of Stur£149 at ZwillingBest for:the easily distractedA toaster that promises never to burn your toast is an attractive premise. However, the reality of the Zwilling Enfinigy is that it’s fairly slow to brown: three minutes on level three yielded a pale, barely toasted result. Tops of slices also tended to be pale, more so for the toastie bread. I did like the Enfinigy’s gradual lift though, and felt that if the appeal of no burns outweighs the waiting around, it could still be a good investment.It didn’t make the final cut because …after four minutes on level four, crumpets weren’t golden brown and still fairly doughy rather than crisp.Height/width of slots:13 x 3cm (HW);dimensions:28.8 x 29.2 x 20.6cm (WDH);slices:4;additional features:defrost, reheat; bagelWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenConsider the size of your household when deciding on a two- or four-slice toaster.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianWhat key features should I look out for?While they’re not all strictly necessary, there are plenty of features that will make your toaster more versatile and convenient to use. A must for me is the high-lift lever, allowing you to retrieve bagels and other small items without burning your fingers or reaching for the tongs. Another handy one is “lift and look”, so you can check on toasting progress without cancelling the cycle.For busy mornings, toasters with a reheat setting mean no more cold slices at breakfast, while defrost settings add gentle heating to the beginning of the cycle to thaw your bread before toasting. And for those who like homemade bread or toastie slices, toasters with extra-wide or long slots should be able to accommodate different types of bread with ease.Other features I consider as nice-to-haves include the ability to add on a little extra time – for more browning without starting a new cycle – and bagel or crumpet options that usually toast the top or cut side without the same intense heat as the base.Two-slice toasters v four-slice toastersThe best deciding factors between a two- or a four-slice toaster are the size of your household and how often you enjoy a slice of toast. For those who eat toast frequently, or are catering for a crowd, a four-slice toaster is ideal, offering the highest capacity, and sometimes more handy features than a two-slice counterpart. However, if toast is an occasional treat, or you live in a solo household, a two-slice toaster will take up less space on your countertop and usually be more affordable.What do the numbers mean on my toaster?For most, the numbers refer to intensity, ie how brown the toast will be, with the lowest digits corresponding to lightly toasted slices and the higher ones to dark brown toastiness or items that need more heat, such as crumpets.These “capacitor-based toasters” feature a circuit that turns off once its capacitor (an energy-storing electrical component) charges up to a certain voltage. However, there’s little consistency between manufacturers and models. Less common are timer-based toasters, where the numbers refer to how many minutes the bread will be toasted.How to clean your toasterAlways unplug your toaster before cleaning. The majority have crumb trays that slide out to be emptied, so be sure to do this once a week if it’s in regular use. Hold your toaster over a bin, slide out the tray and empty it, using a small brush to dislodge debris. Next, hold the toaster upside down and give it a shake – this should remove more crumbs. Wash the tray with washing-up liquid and water, rinse and dry thoroughly before replacing. Finally, wipe down the outside with a damp, slightly soapy microfibre cloth, paying attention to dials and handles. If you find any crumbs in these parts, use your small brush to remove them. Dry with a towel.How to recycle your toasterIf your toaster is no longer working, there are several ways you can recycle it. These include at your local recycling centre, at stores that offer theRetailer Take-back scheme, kerbside recycling bins and drop-off points. Use the postcode checker atRecycle Your Electricalsto find options near you.

Here’s what worked for some lucky couplesLeah HarperThu 25 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 01.42 EDTShareUsing dating apps to find love is commonplace these days – and yet, for many singles, it has become a double-edged sword. The perks of having a never-ending supply of potential matches at your fingertips are obvious – but the appeal of connecting and meeting with strangers is time-limited. It can be especially frustrating to feel as if you’re stuck at the swiping stage.In 2023, US jeweller Shane Company found that the average American will spendabout eight months using dating apps– swiping on around 3,960 profiles – before finding a partner. But for chronic daters, those numbers will probably sound optimistic; speaking to friends and colleagues, it’s not uncommon to spend years “on the apps” without significant romantic success. The “download-delete-repeat” cycle can be disheartening and dating-app fatigue is growing;last year’s Online Nation report from Ofcomshowed that app use had declined significantly, with a drop of nearly 16% in the use of the 10 most popular dating apps. No wonderMeta this week announced that it is bringing an AI assistant to Facebook Dating, as well as Meet Cute, a new “surprise match” feature designed to help users “avoid swipe fatigue”.But it doesn’t have to be this way.According to Pew Research Center, around 10% of heterosexual people and 24% of LGBTQ+ people do meet their long-term partner through a dating site or app – and some seem to do it without dedicating huge amounts of time to fruitless swiping. Is it simply a case of the stars swiftly aligning – or is there a secret to their success?Liz, 28, from Nottingham, downloaded Bumble on a Wednesday and matched with her now-husband the same day. They had their first date on the Friday, and have been together for eight years. Her advice for not getting stuck on the apps? Delete them.View image in fullscreenDeleting the app can be a better way to get to know one another …Photograph: Posed by models. Emir Memedovski/Getty Images“If you meet someone you have a connection with, delete the apps and give that person your full attention – you aren’t on a dating show!” she says. “After the first date, I knew I really liked him, and I thought: ‘I need to focus on one person at a time.’ You can always go back to the apps later if it doesn’t work out.”She also found that not everyone she had swiped right on – to indicate that she was interested – would look at the app every day: “So you get this delayed response with matches. I found the constant pings on my phone really distracting – too many people, too many conversations.”It can be tempting to keep your options open, and speaking to multiple matches is generally deemed acceptable in the early stages of dating. But Liz and her partner deleted Bumble within a week of meeting and found that prioritising one person was a better way to get to know one another.Another way to avoid the so-called paradox of choice is to intentionally narrow your dating pool. Joseph, 42, from Liverpool, is an advocate for finding your niche: he met his partner after just a couple of months of using vegan and vegetarian dating appGrazer. They got engaged 10 months later, and have now been married for six years. They also have two (vegan) children together.If you meet someone you have a connection with, delete the apps and give them your full attention – you aren’t on a dating show“It filtered out what I knew I didn’t want,” he says. “It was more just knowing that everyone was on the same wavelength; that took a lot of the stress away. No awkward conversation about being vegan, and no tough arguments in five years’ time about whether we’re going to raise our children vegan or not. There weren’t a lot of people on Grazer, especially in Liverpool, because it was quite new, but it was quality over quantity.”It’s important to know what you’re looking for, says couples therapist and dating coachShan Merchant, “whether that’s someone who likes exercise, or enjoys being in nature or likes creativity”. Her advice is to use a mainstream app that has a lot of people signed up, “and also go for more of a specialist app, so you’re not limiting your focus too much”.Of course, a good way to find someone whose interests and values align with your own is to be completely honest when creating your profile, whichever app you choose.“My strategy was that I almost wanted to put people off, so that I would only end up meeting with people who were genuinely interested,” says Hannah, 39, from Leeds, who has now been with her partner for seven years. She was on Bumble for around a month before they met, and had been on dates with just two other people from the app.“I had a theory about being tactical with my photos,” says Hannah. “I wanted them to be reflective of me in real life. My first photo was one where I had my hair done and my makeup on and I thought I looked good, but immediately my second photo was me in the garden, no makeup, just a casual day. Loads of men have all their photos of them doing sport – I don’t have anything against sport, but you sort of think, is that all they do? A lack of variety of photos was definitely something that made me swipe past people – you want to know what the rest of their life looks like.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Michelle Thompson/The GuardianWhile many of the people I spoke to cited the fact that they took dating seriously as the key to their app-based success, Hannah believes that, for her, it was almost the opposite. She’d recently moved back to the north of England after 10 years in London; it was more that she wanted to meet new people and explore the local area.“I think that mindset made a big difference – I wasn’t going with a checklist,” she says. “It helped me meet someone good.” It’s important, she adds, “to try to ignore preconceptions and be open about who you meet”.Loads of men have photos of them doing sport. I don’t have anything against sport, but you think: is that all they do?While theories about how you can “manifest” the perfect partner have gained traction in recent years, Merchant suggests there are other, more practical, ways in which your frame of mind can affect your search for love.“Keep your energy up and only use apps when you’re feeling good – if you’re feeling tired or stressed, or hungover or low, I wouldn’t recommend going on a dating app, because that’s going to be the filter through which you see people,” she says. “A lot of people struggle to keep a positive attitude when dating – but I think that’s the biggest thing when it comes to dating app success.”For Nicholas, 69, from Chichester, it was the pandemic that prompted him to be more proactive about dating – something he believes was intrinsic to his positive experience. He connected with his partner within a week of signing up to the now defunct Guardian Soulmates; they’ve been in a relationship for more than five years, living together since February 2022.“I was apprehensive but knew I had to bite the bullet,” he says. “Have a conversation with yourself as to whether you actually want to make it happen, or whether you want an excuse as to why it hasn’t happened. Show why you would be a good companion. Be willing to go beyond your comfort zone. If you’ve put a profile up, you’ve got to be looking and responding to people.”Even if not every interaction goes well, “you’re getting practice in how the dynamics work,” says Nicholas. He suggestsRomeo, also known as PlanetRomeo, as a good alternative for LGBTQ+ people looking for relationships rather than hookups.Liz also sees how, for some people, dating apps themselves can become part of the problem, rather than the solution. “I love my friends dearly, but I’ve watched them on the apps be like: ‘I’ve really enjoyed getting all these Likes but I’m never going to message a single one of them.’ There’s a sense that, because the other person is just a digital image on a screen, their feelings don’t matter.” If you’re genuinely keen to meet someone, her advice is to remember that profiles are real people: “Don’t mislead anyone, ghost them or stand them up.”View image in fullscreenThoughtful gifts can be an ice-breaker …Photograph: Posed by models. Janina Steinmetz/Getty ImagesTinder may have gaineda particularly bad reputation for such practicesin recent years, but Dan, 45, from the Netherlands, connected with his now-wife about two weeks after installing the app. They’ve been in a relationship for 10 years and have a son together. For him, the key was making sure he stood out.“I’ve heard people often say I come across as incredibly boring from a distance,” he says. “Suffice to say, I’m never going to seduce anyone with my gorgeous looks or flamboyant style. I’m not rich or influential either. The good thing about dating apps was that they allowed me to immediately start a conversation, which plays to my strong points.” When messaging someone, he would always try to ask a question or make a joke about something on their profile, to show that he had read it. “It didn’t always work, but sometimes it did.”Once on a date, Dan was similarly keen to make an impression, and brought small, thoughtful gifts, to act as ice-breakers. “On the first date with my wife, I brought her a giftwrapped bar of mint chocolate, after she’d mentioned she hated that flavour,” he says. “Just after unwrapping, while she was clearly trying to decide whether to be offended or pretend to be grateful, I mischievously handed her another chocolate bar – this time her favourite flavour.” Again, it showed that he had been paying attention.I was rejected for wearing clothes that weren’t sufficiently hip, which was a good call: if that’s important to you, I’m not your man“Don’t be afraid of rejection,” he advises. “I was rejected for wearing clothes that weren’t sufficiently hip, which was a good call on that woman’s part: if that’s important to you, I’m not your man. I was rejected for ordering a non-alcoholic drink on another first date. Again, a good call: I’d never be the booze buddy she hoped for. And I’m sure I’ve been rejected many times by women with a different sense of humour to me – for which I’m thankful, because it gave me a chance to keep looking until I found someone who, after 10 years, still chuckles at my dad jokes.”Fear of rejection can certainly play a big role in why so many singles use dating apps intermittently and with caution – which can often prolong their search. “A lot of people aren’t willing to be rejected,” says Merchant, “and when you’re on a dating app, you get rejected a lot, but you’re also rejecting a lot.” People take rejection personally, she says, and then they give up. “I feel sad when people do that because I know that if they remain positive, eventually, everyone meets someone – that’s what I see.”As is so often the case, the secret to dating app success may be a side order of serendipity. “I personally think that there’s a lot of luck involved,” says Merchant. “Make sure you spend time with people who talk positively about dating – people get very jaded but it’s important not to expose yourself to that. If you feel yourself getting burnt out, come off the apps and come back when your energy is stronger.”Even those who seem to have been struck by Cupid’s bow almost instantaneously agree that taking a break can be beneficial. “You can get into a rut of seeing the same faces,” says Joseph. “If you take a step back and give it a few months, you’ll see new people and work out what you’re actually after, rather than chasing something just for the sake of it.Some people featured in this article responded to acommunity callout.

But it is vital their potential as a creative and satirical tool isn’t stifledThu 25 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 20.21 EDTShareSalman Rushdie believes AI will not be a threat to authors until ChatGPT can write“a funny book”. His faith in human over synthetic creativity may hold some truth in the literary space. But on our screens – from film, art and satire to the algorithmically turbo-charged, factually opaque, monetised churn of the 24/7 news cycle – AI is already making us laugh.Deepfakes – synthetic audio and video of people doing and saying things they never said or did – are the chief comedic disruptorsin a suite of increasingly persuasive AI tools shaping the post-truth reality envisioned by the Microsoft engineer Eric Horvitz,where fact and fiction are indistinguishable. In eight short years, deepfakes have risen from cultural outlier to mainstream meme, embodying the futuristRoy Amara’s Law: we overestimate the effects of new technology in the short run but underestimate its long-term impacts.And withsome experts predicting 90% of online contentcould be AI-generated by 2027, the extent to which synthetic replicas will change how we trust and interact with on-screen depictions of real people is now an urgent question for creators, policymakers and viewers.When deepfakes emerged in 2017 as incel-produced nonconsensual porn, the alarm they generated was justified. But as soon as deepfakes started being used a political tool, concerns snowballed into panic. Philosophers labelled them an“epistemic threat”to evidentiary systems; corporations mounted costly (and unsuccessful)detection programs; and pundits warned of an“info-apocalypse”, in which a convincing deepfake of a world leader couldstart world war three. Less dramatic but equally chilling was the prediction that the mere awareness of deepfakes wouldcollapse civic trust altogether. In 2018 Jordan Peele made a propheticdeepfake of Obamaurging viewers to rely on credible news sources, lest we become a “fucked up dystopia”.Cut to 2025, and satirical deepfakes are part of the news cycle. Shortly after attending Pope Francis’ funeral, the US president, Donald Trump,posted a viral deepfake of himself in papal regalia. In response to Doge cuts to public services,a deepfake of Trump fellating Elon Musk’s footappeared on a DC government lobby screen. After Trump’s declaration he would transform Gaza into a Middle Eastern “Riviera”,a satirical deepfakeappeared on Instagram showing Trump sipping cocktails with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in an AI-slop fantasy of Gaza as a beachside resort, full of gold Trump statues and happy Palestinian children. And just last month, South Park’sdeepfake of Trump with a micro-peniselicitedan official rebuke from the White House.Deepfakes have been disrupting democratic processes since 2018, when Indian nationalists circulated a deepfake porn video of thejournalist Rana Ayyub, in an attempt to silence her. But the elevation of deepfake satire as a weapon in mainstream politics is a more recent trend. During the 2024 US election campaign, Trump posted absurdist deepfakes of Kamala Harrisaddressing a communist rallyand admitting she was a DEI hire. A surreal Republican attack ad showed adeepfake Joe Biden winning the presidencyand its AI-imagined consequences: war with Taiwan, bank closures and US cities destroyed by crime. Echoing warnings that the rise of deepfakes could be used todiscredit authentic recordings,Trump falsely accused Harris of deepfaking hercrowd sizes.If you are outraged by Trump’s use of AI and deepfakes, don’t be – that’s exactly what he wants | Sophia Smith GalerRead moreAndAI “slopaganda”is coming for Trump too. Viral platformsMake AI Great AgainandGlobal Presidentsare generating billions of views for videos featuring a panoply of strongmen – from Vladimir Putin and VolodymyrZelenskyy to Kim Jong-un – emasculating Trump in slapstick pranks. (That Chinese leader Xi Jinping is largely absent from these clips hasprompted speculation about their origins and goals.)In stark contrast to this perniciously populist deepfakery, progressive artists and activists are using AI counterfeits to provoke, astonish and speak truth to power. Stephanie Lepp’sDeepfake Reckoningsimagines a “morally courageous” US justice Brett Kavanaugh; and Kendrick Lamar’sThe Heartmusic video deepfakes him as OJ Simpson and Kobe Bryant, to destabilise assumptions about black identity.Compil des Bleuesinserts the faces of France’s soccer stars on to the bodies of its female World Cup team, to highlight the women’s equal athleticism; while the Lincoln Project’s posthumous deepfake of Trump’s father, Fred,labels his son“a fuck up”, “trash” and “a disgrace”; declaring “I’ve been dead for 30 years and I’m still ashamed of you.”We thought Donald could use some words of encouragement from his father Fred, who was such a strong supporter of his career. Fred’s angry he handed over his empire to a son so “low-rent” he even lost money running a casino & will be lucky to keep his dumb ass out of prison. (AI)pic.twitter.com/5gXtKKHJmS— The Lincoln Project (@ProjectLincoln)February 16, 2024Professional film-makers are also manipulating deepfakes to play with the truth. Black Mirror’sJoan is Awfuldepicts a matryoshka-like dystopia where characters are deepfakes of deepfakes;Sassy Justiceby the South Park creators portrays Trump as a corruption-slaying TV journalist; and the Polish biopicPutindelivers an unflinching AI portrait of its titular hero. The documentaryWelcome to Chechnyadeploys deepfake masks to protect its persecuted gay subjects, whileA Life Uncharteduses real audio of its deceased protagonist, Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson, to construct a candid deepfake interview.Deepfakes come with very real risks that demand urgent regulation:cybercrime,corporate fraud,intimate image-abuseand political disinformation among them. But it is vital that AI’s escalating persuasive power is regulated without stifling creativity and innovation.On this, at least, film-makers and big tech are aligned. When xAI unveiled its new Grok AI tool, German satirists used it to make a deepfake ofElon Musk committing an armed robbery– and thanked him for supporting free speech.Dr Anna Broinowski is a film-maker, author and synthetic media researcher at the University of Sydney.

Throughout the development of FC 26, EAmet with a panel of influencers and community representativesto directly drive design decisions. The result is a football experience split into two. Offline it’s a sim, where ratings and fatigue come to the fore. Online, it’s purely an esport – fast, and furious, with shots and goals prioritised over William Saliba-calibre defending.Offline, it’s a refreshing call. In career mode, for instance, matches are as sedately paced as they’ve been from any FC or Fifa in recent memory. Tactics matter. Stats differentials such as ball control, and vision, matter. Even weather effects such as wind and the state of the pitch matter, with the ball sticking and/or skidding on wet turf. Patient build-up play is welcomed, and it’s possible to unpick a defence without 17 flicks of the skill stick. There’s a cerebral feel long absent from this series.View image in fullscreenOn target … EA Sports FC 26.Photograph: Electronic ArtsIndeed, after some stagnant years, manager mode feels like the purists’ way to play. The new career carousel means results affect job stability, with bosses being sacked or poached by other clubs. For the first time, that leads to CPU-controlled teams adopting their incoming gaffer’s tactics, lending welcome variety. Added to that are random events such as training injuries, or one-off headaches – in my West Ham career, Kyle Walker-Peters and El Hadji Malick Diouf were ruled out of an away game at Arsenal due to “dodgy food”. Legacy issues, such as soulless cut-scenes, remain, but it’s a worthy alternative to the always controversial Ultimate Team.Meanwhile, Ultimate Team – or FUT – has long been criticised as little more than a gambling mode, where the people who pay most to open the game’s Panini-like packs of random players, will almost always come out on top. This time, there has been a raft of fan-pleasing changes, such as levelling up goalkeepers using the Evolution mechanic, and the return of all-silver tournaments (online competitions that only let you use silver-ranked players). It’s possible to build a strong side without spending a penny: after one week, my squad already boasts Toni Kroos, Lionel Messi and Rúben Dias. However, those cash-dropping temptations of random packs remain, and will continue to be the series’ most divisive feature.Gameplay within Ultimate Team adopts those “competitive” online settings, and aligns with longstanding community feedback. Prepare for basketball-style goal-fests full of tricks and shots on target. New goalkeeper AI and animations help keep the score down, but it’s still incredibly tough to defend. The lack of fatigue is especially challenging. In previous editions, keeping a fast attacker quiet for 70 minutes would mean he or she being subbed, rewarding your stellar defensive skills. Now they can run at maximum speed deep into injury time, nullifying strong backline play. Again, this is what the player base wanted, but it dilutes any sense of realism.This frantic gameplay is more effective and enjoyable in returning five-a-side mode Rush. Myriad quality of life improvements make this as addictive as its distant predecessor, Fifa Street. Teething problems such as players rubber-banding their controller to ostensibly leave you a teammate short are addressed. Keepers make smart saves, and the default perspective intelligently tracks your player while still maintaining full view of the pitch. Here the lack of defensive capabilities are less egregious, and at present it’s the most enjoyable way to experience FUT.FC 26 remains a strong package, despite its deliberate choice to abandon authenticity in the online space. There are still numerous gamers out there who crave realism, even in competitive matches. Yet while this represents a step backwards for real football, it’s unquestionably a stride forwards in the field of fan service. This is not the sim Pro Evo purists have longed for – but as an esports collaborative between the developer and its community, Fifa’s third follow-up achieves the majority of its aims.EA Sports FC 26 is released on 26 September,Explore more on these topicsGamesSports gamesPlayStation 5Xbox OneXbox series S/XNintendo Switch 2Nintendo SwitchreviewsShareReuse this content"

When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Fifa moved with lightning speed,banningRussia from all competitions four days later. In ajoint statementwith Uefa, Europe’s football governing body, they asserted, “Football is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine.” And yet, little solidarity has been afforded Palestinians. When it comes to Israel, Fifa and Uefa have foot-dragged.Pressure is ramping up on the barons of football to take action. After United Nations experts issued astatementdemanding that Israel be suspended from international football because of the genocide in Gaza,the Times reportsthat Uefa may take up the issue as soon as next week.Israel’s future in Uefa could come to a head before October World Cup qualifiersRead moreFootball is politics by other means. Fifa and Uefa demonstrated as much with their ban on Russia. Fifa’s guiding statutes give it the power to take a similar moral stance against the actions of Israel and to offer “full solidarity” with Palestinians, especially since thePalestine Football Associationis a Fifa member. To sit silent is to signal brazen favoritism. Fifa and Uefa should suspend Israel from competition.Some mayarguethat sports and politics shouldn’t mix. But in a time ofrising authoritarianismacross the globe, includingin the United Statesunder Donald Trump, now is the time for international organizations to stand up for core moral principles. Today, selective ethics are freighted with extra danger: they enable demagoguery.Israel is orchestrating a staggering human tragedy in Gaza. It has dropped well over 100,000 tons of explosives on the Gaza Strip,more tonnagethan struck Dresden, Hamburg, and London combined during the second world war. More than 64,000 Palestinians have beenkilled, most of them by Israel’s military, with the Lancetcalculatinga much higher death toll and a retired Israeli generalnotingthat more than 200,000 Palestinians have been killed or wounded. The Lancet says that on average, 35 children arekilledevery day in Gaza. With Israel blocking most food aid, around a quarter of all Gaza residents were suffering fromfaminein August. Hospitals are often hit, inviolationof international humanitarian law. Around 200 journalists have beenkilled, with many of them apparently targeted by the Israel Defense Forces, abreachof international law. Together, this constitutesgenocide, according to the International Association of Genocide Scholars. But for Israel’s far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, Gaza is just a “real-estate bonanza.”These horrors do not chime with Fifa’s stated ideals. Its president, Gianni Infantino, has remained conspicuously silent on the subject of Israel and Gaza, even though Fifa’slegal handbooktrumpets that the group “is committed to respecting all internationally recognised human rights and shall strive to promote the protection of these rights.” Sure, Infantino penned cut-and-pastecondolence lettersto the football associations of Israel and Palestine in the wake of the horrific 7 October attack and the launch of Israel’s military response, but he hasn’t replicated anything resembling hisstatementthat Fifa “condemns the use of force by Russia in Ukraine.” Neither far-right security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir’s statedsupportfor the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, nor inflammatorystatementsby a range of powerful Israeli politicians has moved Infantino to condemn Israel, let alone propose any concrete sanctions against the country, despite the fact that Fifa’s statutesstatethat “Discrimination of any kind against a country, private person or group of people on account of race, skin colour, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, disability, language, religion, political opinion … is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion.”One could argue that denouncing war crimes is too much to expect from a sports organization. But even if we stick to the realm of sports, Israel appears to be violating Fifa rules. The organization’sstatutes stateclearly that “Member associations and their clubs may not play on the territory of another member association without the latter’s approval.” And yet, according toHuman Rights Watch, the Israel Football Association is staging matches on “settlements in the West Bank on land unlawfully taken from Palestinians.” The United Nationshas identifiedat least eight Israeli football clubs that have either developed or played matches “in Israeli colonial settlements of the occupied West Bank.” In addition, the UN says many clubs in the Israel Football Association (IFA) “have exhibited racism towards the Palestinian people and players over the years,” a clear violation of Fifa’s non-discrimination policies. The London-based human-rights group Fair Squaredeterminedthat there is “longstanding and irrefutable evidence that the IFA is in violation of Fifa Statutes.”Last May at the Fifa Congress in Paraguay, Susan Shalabi, a vice-president of the Palestinian Football Association,imploredFifa’s Governance, Audit, and Compliance Committee to concludetwo investigationsinto Israel’s actions in the West Bank. Despite an abundance of evidence, Fifa chose to kick the investigation down the road. By slow-rolling these inquiries, Fifa, whether intentionally or not, has adopted the same approach as Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, calling for investigations into human-rights violations as a strategy of staving off accountability.Beyond staging matches in the West Bank, Israel has engaged in whatscholarsare increasingly calling “athleticide”: killing Palestinian athletes,destroyingsports facilities, andtransmogrifyingGaza’s storied Al Yarmouk Stadium into a temporary detention center. Last month, beloved Palestinian footballer Suleiman Obeid – known to many as thePalestinian Pele– was killed by an Israeli drone strike. He is one ofnearly 800Palestinian athletes who have been killed by Israel since October 2023.Fifa and Uefa have the power to take action. Although admirable, the burden shouldn’t be on star players like Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah toask tough questionsabout the killing of Obeid or for Norway todonatethe profits from its qualifying match against Israel to Gaza relief. The full weight of football governing bodies is required.Although history does not provide us with crisp facsimiles, Fifa’s handling of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows that the group can act on principle. Given the facts on the ground in the West Bank and Gaza, Israel should not be allowed to take the pitch for World Cup qualifying matches. Fifa andUefaneed to expedite investigations into Israeli football malfeasance. By choosing to ignore their own rules, they disfigure them. When impunity thrives on moral sleepwalking, it leaves us precarious – and vulnerable to authoritarianism. Now is the time for Fifa and Uefa to stand in alignment with the principles they so vociferously proclaim.Explore more on these topicsIsraelFifaUefaFootball politicsPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

But it is vital their potential as a creative and satirical tool isn’t stifledThu 25 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 20.21 EDTShareSalman Rushdie believes AI will not be a threat to authors until ChatGPT can write“a funny book”. His faith in human over synthetic creativity may hold some truth in the literary space. But on our screens – from film, art and satire to the algorithmically turbo-charged, factually opaque, monetised churn of the 24/7 news cycle – AI is already making us laugh.Deepfakes – synthetic audio and video of people doing and saying things they never said or did – are the chief comedic disruptorsin a suite of increasingly persuasive AI tools shaping the post-truth reality envisioned by the Microsoft engineer Eric Horvitz,where fact and fiction are indistinguishable. In eight short years, deepfakes have risen from cultural outlier to mainstream meme, embodying the futuristRoy Amara’s Law: we overestimate the effects of new technology in the short run but underestimate its long-term impacts.And withsome experts predicting 90% of online contentcould be AI-generated by 2027, the extent to which synthetic replicas will change how we trust and interact with on-screen depictions of real people is now an urgent question for creators, policymakers and viewers.When deepfakes emerged in 2017 as incel-produced nonconsensual porn, the alarm they generated was justified. But as soon as deepfakes started being used a political tool, concerns snowballed into panic. Philosophers labelled them an“epistemic threat”to evidentiary systems; corporations mounted costly (and unsuccessful)detection programs; and pundits warned of an“info-apocalypse”, in which a convincing deepfake of a world leader couldstart world war three. Less dramatic but equally chilling was the prediction that the mere awareness of deepfakes wouldcollapse civic trust altogether. In 2018 Jordan Peele made a propheticdeepfake of Obamaurging viewers to rely on credible news sources, lest we become a “fucked up dystopia”.Cut to 2025, and satirical deepfakes are part of the news cycle. Shortly after attending Pope Francis’ funeral, the US president, Donald Trump,posted a viral deepfake of himself in papal regalia. In response to Doge cuts to public services,a deepfake of Trump fellating Elon Musk’s footappeared on a DC government lobby screen. After Trump’s declaration he would transform Gaza into a Middle Eastern “Riviera”,a satirical deepfakeappeared on Instagram showing Trump sipping cocktails with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in an AI-slop fantasy of Gaza as a beachside resort, full of gold Trump statues and happy Palestinian children. And just last month, South Park’sdeepfake of Trump with a micro-peniselicitedan official rebuke from the White House.Deepfakes have been disrupting democratic processes since 2018, when Indian nationalists circulated a deepfake porn video of thejournalist Rana Ayyub, in an attempt to silence her. But the elevation of deepfake satire as a weapon in mainstream politics is a more recent trend. During the 2024 US election campaign, Trump posted absurdist deepfakes of Kamala Harrisaddressing a communist rallyand admitting she was a DEI hire. A surreal Republican attack ad showed adeepfake Joe Biden winning the presidencyand its AI-imagined consequences: war with Taiwan, bank closures and US cities destroyed by crime. Echoing warnings that the rise of deepfakes could be used todiscredit authentic recordings,Trump falsely accused Harris of deepfaking hercrowd sizes.If you are outraged by Trump’s use of AI and deepfakes, don’t be – that’s exactly what he wants | Sophia Smith GalerRead moreAndAI “slopaganda”is coming for Trump too. Viral platformsMake AI Great AgainandGlobal Presidentsare generating billions of views for videos featuring a panoply of strongmen – from Vladimir Putin and VolodymyrZelenskyy to Kim Jong-un – emasculating Trump in slapstick pranks. (That Chinese leader Xi Jinping is largely absent from these clips hasprompted speculation about their origins and goals.)In stark contrast to this perniciously populist deepfakery, progressive artists and activists are using AI counterfeits to provoke, astonish and speak truth to power. Stephanie Lepp’sDeepfake Reckoningsimagines a “morally courageous” US justice Brett Kavanaugh; and Kendrick Lamar’sThe Heartmusic video deepfakes him as OJ Simpson and Kobe Bryant, to destabilise assumptions about black identity.Compil des Bleuesinserts the faces of France’s soccer stars on to the bodies of its female World Cup team, to highlight the women’s equal athleticism; while the Lincoln Project’s posthumous deepfake of Trump’s father, Fred,labels his son“a fuck up”, “trash” and “a disgrace”; declaring “I’ve been dead for 30 years and I’m still ashamed of you.”We thought Donald could use some words of encouragement from his father Fred, who was such a strong supporter of his career. Fred’s angry he handed over his empire to a son so “low-rent” he even lost money running a casino & will be lucky to keep his dumb ass out of prison. (AI)pic.twitter.com/5gXtKKHJmS— The Lincoln Project (@ProjectLincoln)February 16, 2024Professional film-makers are also manipulating deepfakes to play with the truth. Black Mirror’sJoan is Awfuldepicts a matryoshka-like dystopia where characters are deepfakes of deepfakes;Sassy Justiceby the South Park creators portrays Trump as a corruption-slaying TV journalist; and the Polish biopicPutindelivers an unflinching AI portrait of its titular hero. The documentaryWelcome to Chechnyadeploys deepfake masks to protect its persecuted gay subjects, whileA Life Uncharteduses real audio of its deceased protagonist, Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson, to construct a candid deepfake interview.Deepfakes come with very real risks that demand urgent regulation:cybercrime,corporate fraud,intimate image-abuseand political disinformation among them. But it is vital that AI’s escalating persuasive power is regulated without stifling creativity and innovation.On this, at least, film-makers and big tech are aligned. When xAI unveiled its new Grok AI tool, German satirists used it to make a deepfake ofElon Musk committing an armed robbery– and thanked him for supporting free speech.Dr Anna Broinowski is a film-maker, author and synthetic media researcher at the University of Sydney.

Don’t be fooledSteven GreenhouseThe budget measure will hurt poor people and boost rich people. It should really be called the Billionaires’ Tax Cut ActThu 25 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 17.03 EDTShareJust a few months ago,Donald Trumpsought to bamboozle the American people into believing that hisOne Big Beautiful Bill Act– with its trillions in tax cuts for the rich – was a legislative wonder stuffed with one marvel after another. Buta Pew opinion pollin August found that millions of Americans have wised up about the measure and now view it as a big, unbeautiful monstrosity.Many Americans have come to realize that Trump’s not-so-beautiful bill – instead of being filled with good things that benefit average Americans – is overflowing with big tax cuts for the wealthy as well as many unfortunate things that will hurt typical working families. As we saw in the town halls held across the US, many Americans are furious about some painful things that Trump and congressional Republicans inserted into the bill: cuts that will make health insurance more expensive, cuts that reduce food assistance, cuts that make it harder for students from working families to afford college. All this is bad news for working families who struggle to make ends meet.President Trump and his administration can’t hide from the fact that many Americans detest the bill — 46% disapprove of it, while just 32% approve (23% say they’re unsure what they think). What’s more, 33% of Americans “strongly disapprove” of the bill.Alarmed that the bill has become a public relations and political disaster, Trump and his allies have embraced a curious strategy to address that problem. Their strategy is not what you might hope – they’re not seeking to amend the bill to make it less painful for average Americans. Rather, their strategy is slick marketing: to simply rebrand the bill, to make it sound better. TheWhite House is telling Republicansto stop calling it the One Big Beautiful Bill and instead call it the nice-sounding Working Families Tax Cut Bill.Majority of college students say they will be affected by Trump’s new tax bill: ‘Honestly, I’m cooked’Read moreUnfortunately, that name is another effort to dupe America’s working families. The bill gives45% of next year’s tax cutsto the highest-earning 5% of US households, while just 1% of the tax cuts go the lowest-earning 20% of households. Under the bill, far morein net tax cuts, $117bn, will go to the wealthiest 1% of households next year than will go to the bottom 60% ($77bn).If the White House and GOP lawmakers want to be accurate, they should call the bill the Billionaires’ and Millionaires’ Tax Cut Act. The bill gives a$13,622 tax cutto households in the top 10% by income, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The top 0.1% of households (those with income of more than $3.3m a year) willreceive annual tax cuts of $103,500on average, according to the Yale Budget Lab.If you’re wealthy enough to have $15m in assets, the bill is very good for you. Under the bill,the first $15m in an individual’s assets are exemptfrom the estate tax, nearly triple the $5.5m in pre-Trump days. For couples, the first $30m in assets will be exempt. Does anyone think that these sound like working family tax cuts?Frankly, it would be more accurate to call the bill the Working Families Benefits Cut Bill. Containing a painful$1.4tn in Medicaid and other cutsthat Republicans insisted on to help finance their tax cuts for the rich, the bill is filled with benefit cuts that hurt working families. Roughly15 million Americanswill lose health coverage and become uninsured because the bill cuts Medicaid funding and reduces subsidies for Obamacare.Other results of the bill:4 million people will losesome or all of their food aid, while4.4 million students from working familiesmight lose all or some of their federal aid to go to college.When one combines the effects of Trump’s tariffs and his 'big, beautiful bill', 90% of US families will end up worse off“Who’s getting hit, who’s bearing the cost?It’s people with low and middle incomes, people that the president and many Republican policymakers promised to serve and support in the last election,” said Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.President Trump is correct that the bill contains some tax cuts for working Americans – for instance, itincreases the standard income tax deductionby $750 for individuals and $1,500 for couples. The bad news is that for tens of millions of families, the bill’s benefit cuts, especially on health coverage, outweigh the meager tax cuts that the bill gives non-affluent Americans. In many ways, Trump and GOP lawmakers are making this a shell game – they say you’re benefiting from tax cuts, but the fact is that because of the benefit cuts, millions of working families will end up worse off.According to the CBO, Americans in the bottom 10% by income (averaging $23,751) will end up$1,214 worse offon average per year, while the next lowest 10% (averaging $43,092) will end up$392 worse offper year. Those in the third-lowest tenth ($54,453) will receive a mere $23 annual gain. Those in the fourth-lowest decile ($67,637) will see a very modest net gain of $379. Cutting through all these numbers, this shows that for tens of millions of families, the bill is a net loser or a wash.“This really isa big, beautiful bill for billionaires, but for the poor and the working class in this country, you are actually poorer,” said the representative Brendan Boyle, the top Democrat on the House budget committee.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The reason: the non-wealthy spend a higher share of their income on imports, whether on furniture, electronics or coffee, than the wealthy do. The Yale Budget Lab found that when one combines the effects of Trump’s tariffs and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,90% of American families will end up worse off. Seventy per cent of households will face losses ranging from $780 to $2,570 each year.President Trump boasts that two provisions he championed – no tax on tips and no tax on overtime – will be great for working Americans. But those provisions will be far less helpful than people realize. Just3% of US workers receive tips, and one-third of them earn so little that they don’t pay federal income taxes. So no tax on tips won’t help them.No tax on overtime won’t help workers nearly as much as many think. The deductionapplies only to the “half”in “time and a half” overtime pay. So if a worker earns $20 an hour and receives $30 per overtime hour, that worker can deduct only the $10 premium per overtime hour, not the full $30. John Ricco, an analyst at the Yale Budget Lab, says that for the bottom 40% of Americans by income, no tax on overtime will mean “less than a $10 tax cutper year” – “essentially a rounding error”.By seeking to call this bill the Working Families Tax Cut Bill, Trump and the GOP are again seeking to hold themselves out as the best friends of American workers, even though Trump, since returning to office, has taken dozens of anti-worker actions. Hehalted enforcement of a regulationthat protects miners from a debilitating, often fatal lung disease. He hasstripped 1 million federal employeesof their important right to bargain collectively and has torn up union contracts for hundreds of thousands.He fired the chairof the National Labor Relations Board, leaving the nation’s top labor watchdog without a quorum to protect workers from companies’ unlawful anti-union actions. Trump is also pushing toend minimum wage and overtime protectionsfor 3.7 million home-care and domestic workers.People who care about working families – whether union leaders, clergy or community leaders – need to make clear to the public that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act hurts many working Americans. It is a bait and switch, telling working families that it’s good for them even as it cuts benefits for millions of working Americans while lavishing big tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionTax and spendingDonald TrumpUS economyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Nowhere was that fear more acute than in the transgender community.Within hours, Republicans were already blaming trans people; one commentatoreven claimedthe bullets carried “transgender symbols”, a claim investigatorsquickly debunked. But the deeper fear wasn’t misinformation – it was the crackdown that would follow. With fragile rights hanging by the thread of court rulings and blue-state protections, trans people braced for the worst. And they were right: The right has seized on the shooting as its own Reichstag fire, accelerating a campaign to target transgender existence – now with the full weight of the Trump administration behind it.The stage was already set for a crackdown. Kirk had been one of the right’s loudest anti-LGBTQ+ crusaders, and his anti-trans rhetoric was reflected in the 2024 campaign as Trump and other Republicans leaned into hate-filled ads. Kirk’s record was clear: he called forNuremberg trials of doctorswho provide gender-affirming care, branded transgender people“abominations unto God”, urged men to“take care of”trans people “like they did in the ’50s and ’60s”, and railed against high schoolerscoming out as gay or bisexualas part of some LGBTQ+ “agenda”. He championed “Don’t Say Gay” lawswhile blasting Disneyas “degenerates … held hostage by their gay employees” for opposing them. If Republicans could pin his killing on a transgender person, they could elevate him as a martyr to justify the crackdown.And within hours, the first justification arrived. Conservative influencer Stephen Crowderclaimed“sources” told him the bullets had transgender symbols etched onto them. The Wall Street Journallaundered the claim, only toquietly walk itback a day later – after the Utah governor, Spencer Cox,read the etchings himselfand confirmed none carried any such markings. Still, the narrative couldn’t end with a white cisgender man as the shooter. Republicans quickly seized on reports that Kirk’s killer hada transgender girlfriend. Never mind thatshe cooperated fully with policeand helped secure the indictment by turning over incriminating texts. Her mere proximity to the story was enough to let the right pour gasoline on its crusade against transgender people.In the days since Kirk’s killing, we have seen an escalation of rhetoric and policies targeting transgender people. Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina, famous for her efforts to ban the first transgender congresswoman Sarah McBride of Delaware from the bathroom in Congress, quicklycalled for the institutionalizationof transgender people. The same day, representative Ronny Jackson of Texasadvocated for the same, saying: “We have to treat these people … we have to get them off the streets and we have to get them off the internet and we can’t let them communicate with one another. I’m all about free speech, but this is a virus. This is a cancer that is spreading across this country.”The targeting of transgender people didn’t stop at rhetoric. Concrete policy followed almost immediately. House Republicans began advancing appropriations bills stuffed with anti-LGBTQ+ riders. The National Defense Authorization Actcleared the chamberwith provisions banning Pride flags on military bases, blocking transgender bathroom access, and more.Additional spending billscarried the same playbook: a sweeping federal funding ban on transgender healthcare at any age that could threaten hospitals nationwide, restrictions on incarcerated trans people, a Pride flag ban, and even provisions undermining Washington DC’s protections for transgender care.To be sure, many of these riders were already baked into Republican appropriations bills, the product of months of Republican wishlist politics. But this time something new is happening: Trump is personallydigging inon the anti-trans provisions and using them as leverage to drive the government toward a shutdown. In past standoffs, high-level talks between Trump, congressional Republicans, and Democrats centered on broad fiscal issues. Now, with an October shutdown looming, Trump has zeroed in on Democrats’ push to strip anti-LGBTQ+ riders – especially the anti-trans measures – as his pretext to cancel negotiations at the 11th hour.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has filedan emergency motionwith the supreme court to overturn lower court rulings that allow transgender people to correct the gender markers on their passports. Emergency motions are meant for true crises of national importance. Yet the White House is arguing that a transgender woman carrying an “F” on her passport qualifies. If the court grants Trump a win, the administration hasalready signaledit will revoke and reissue passports obtained through the class-action suit – which could plunge transgender travelers into chaos.More broadly, fear is mounting that Trump will weaponize federal agencies against trans and queer people – and the organizations that support them – under the banner of counterterrorism. In the wake of the shooting, White House policy chief Stephen Miller, JD Vance, and Trump himselfall signaled plansto target non-profits for “messaging designed to trigger and incite violence”; notably, these same kinds of steps wereused in Russiatocrack down on LGBTQ+ organizations.At the same time, the Heritage Foundation – architects of Project 2025 and closely tied to the administration –rolled out a proposalto brand transgender rights activists as domestic terror groups, complete with calls for infiltration and surveillance.For transgender people, Kirk’s killing has unleashed a new wave of anti-trans hate so intense that some are now making plans to leave the country altogether. Those of us who have tracked this movement for years can see the shift: the far right, led by Trump and his administration, has seized on the shooting as a rallying cry. Trans people did not shoot Charlie Kirk. Yet we are forced to bear the weight of the right’s reaction – turned into scapegoats for a tragedy that was never ours.Erin Reed is a transgender journalist based in Washington DC.

Now, ordinary people are taking humanitarian matters into their own hands – and putting their lives on the lineThu 25 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 06.01 EDTShareRight now – as presidential planes touch down in New York City for the UN general assembly – a fleet of civilian vessels is sailing to Gaza: the largest convoy in history to traverse the Mediterranean Sea with a mission to establish a humanitarian corridor to reach the starving people of Palestine.I am a member of that mission. Since the first batch of boats departed from Barcelona, I have been assigned to Family, the lead vessel of the fleet: a humble motor-cruiser carrying doctors and lawyers, journalists and parliamentarians, students and sea rescue workers from 10 countries across the world.All together, this “Global Sumud Flotilla” carries hundreds of participants from more than 40 national delegations, united by their shared conviction that something must be done to halt the destruction of Gaza – and that if governments refuse to do it, then ordinary people will.With or without a ceasefire, humanitarian aid must enter Gaza. We managed it in previous wars | Moazzam MalikRead moreLast week, legal experts from an independent UN commission declared thatIsraelhas committed genocide in the Gaza Strip. “It is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the criteria set forth in the Genocide Convention,” they concluded.For the participants of this flotilla – as for so many millions of people across the world – the UN declaration comes as no surprise. In the two years since the attacks of 7 October, we have scrolled through countless images of senseless slaughter and felt powerless to stop it.That power, according to international law, resides in the states that represent us. Last year, the UN general assembly overwhelmingly adopted Resolution ES‑10/24, which established the obligations of all member-states to takeimmediate action to defend the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people.Yet one year later – days after the deadline established by that Resolution – those same member-states continue to arm, aid, and abet the state of Israel in its expanding campaign of destruction, eviction, and annexation of the occupiedPalestinian territories.That is why so many millions of ordinary people are taking to the streets, from New York to London and beyond: to exhort their representatives to listen to the conscience of their constituents and respond to Gaza’s humanitarian crisis with the urgency it requires.That movement is growing. This week, ports, trains and highways across Italy were shut down with a single message of solidarity:Blocchiamo Tutto,we will block everything until the government ofGiorgia Melonibreaks commercial, military and diplomatic ties with the state of Israel.The sustained inaction of the international community has also forced us to take action at sea. We are not the first ones to do so. Since 2008, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition has deployed scores of civilian vessels carrying tons of humanitarian aid to Gaza.In some cases – such as the Mavi Marmara –Israel has respondedwith lethal force, raiding the boat and killing nine activists on board; a 10th died from injuries in the hours that followed. In others – such as the more recent Madleen –Israel hasridiculed the effortas a mere “selfie cruise” to indulge the celebrity of its participants.Our present voyage, however, is unprecedented – a fleet of 40 boats, larger than the sum of all previous missions. Such a large-scale humanitarian effort has forced the state of Israel to choose between these two incompatible narratives: are we simply pleasure cruising across the Mediterranean? Or do we represent an imminent threat to their national security?In recent days, the decision by the government ofBenjamin Netanyahuhas been made clear. Our convoy is now described as the “Hamas Flotilla”, with the state of Israel insinuating that the flotilla maintains links to “organized terror” and threatening to “stop” our flotilla by any means necessary – a clear and flagrant violation of international humanitarian law.Attacks on aid workers are outrageous. This violence needs more attention and it has to stop | Andrew Colvin and Jagan ChapagainRead moreI can see the fear on the faces of my fellow boatmates. Each day, we conduct drills to practice non-violent protocols in case of our interception. And each night, we take shifts monitoring the skies for drones that fly overhead with increasing frequency as our journey progresses.These protocols are not mere performance. Back in the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said, drones targeted our vessels in two successive midnight attacks, deploying explosive devices onto the decks of the Familyand the Almarespectively. In the investigation that followed, Tunisian authorities described the attacks as “premeditated aggression” against the flotilla.But the defamatory narrative of a “Hamas Flotilla” – motivated by antisemitism, rather than humanism; directed by “terrorists”, rather than ordinary citizens – also risks running into the absurd.Here on the Family,I am joined by Ada Colau, former mayor of Barcelona and mother of two young children. I am joined by Bianca Webb-Pullman, a practicing family medic who traveled all the way from Australia. And I am joined by Adèle Haenel, a French actor who enjoys beating me in chess whenever we have a free moment on board.My personal identity presents a particular problem for this narrative. Coming from a Jewish family in the United States, I joined the humanitarian mission for the same reason that so many Jews in the US are speaking out about the assault on Gaza: to reclaim my identity – my heritage, our traditions, its symbols – from the nation-state that seeks to monopolize them.Governments across the world are beginning to speak out about the threats issued against our flotilla. Last week, 16 states – including Spain and Slovenia, Brazil and Mexico – issued a joint statement warning: “Any violation of international law and human rights of the participants in the Flotilla, including attacks against the vessels in international waters or illegal detention, will lead to accountability.”From the flotilla, we have welcomed this important recognition of our humanitarian intentions and rights under international law – while wondering why so many governments with citizens on board, such as France and the United States, refused to sign it.Starmer finally said it: ‘We recognise Palestine.’ But Gaza desperately needs action – where is that? | Nesrine MalikRead moreYet the statement confuses means for ends. This flotilla is but a means to establish a nautical humanitarian corridor, where the state of Israel has blocked aid entry points on land. Any state that is serious about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza should not simply offer protection to our civilian fleet, but join us, deploying vessels at the scale that corresponds to the severity of Gaza’s present suffering.Donald Trumphas made a mockery of international law with the establishment of the so-called “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation”, which – far from delivering on its stated mission – has deployed cruel, inhumane and often lethal methods for the distribution of paltry aid.But it should not fall on the shoulders of ordinary people to rescue international law from ruin. Only states – gathered together now at theUnited Nations– can apply the necessary measures to halt the destruction of Gaza and protect the lives and livelihoods of its people.For now, we are preparing to complete our mission in the coming days. At the time of writing, it is not too late for states to step up and join our mission, sailing alongside us through the Mediterranean Sea. But even in their absence, we will sail on, undeterred the threats issued against us.

Warning signs are already thereLarry ElliottThe longer the period between crises, the greater the complacency. That complacency is pushing share prices ever-higherThu 25 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 12.49 EDTShareUS job creation has stalled and, despite the curbs on migration,unemployment is rising. Tariffs are pushing up the cost of imports. And Donald Trump is at war with the governor of his own central bankand wants him out.But traders on Wall Street are not bothered by the fact that inflation is above the target or that growth is slowing. Share prices are testing new record levels on an almost daily basis. Jerome Powell, the man Trump wants to be rid of, says stocksare “fairly highly valued”, which is an understatement if ever there was one. By historical standards, stocks are extremely highly valued. There is trouble – perhaps big trouble – ahead.Recessions happen rarely and the same goes for financial crashes. Both are predicted more often than they materialise. Leaving to one side the exceptional circumstances of the 2020 pandemic, it has been 17 years since there was a prolonged fall in share prices. Memories of the slump that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers17 years ago this month have dimmed. Traders in their 20s and 30s have little or no experience of what a genuine financial market panic feels like.That’s the first warning sign. The longer the period between crises, the greater the complacency, the sense that the good times will go on for ever. Those who note that all previous booms have ended in painful busts are ignored. The old lie – it’s different this time – is trotted out.The belief that the party will continue has pushed share prices ever-higher in New York and London, even though the reasons for the optimism are tenuous. In the UK, the economy is barely growing while inflation isrunning at almost doublethe Bank of England’s 2% target. As was the case last year, constant speculation about tax rises to be announced in the budget is hitting consumer and business confidence.The record-breaking run of share prices on Wall Street is the result of a bet that artificial intelligence will raise the economy’s growth rate. That may happen, but it will be years before the impact is felt. The same was said of the IT boom that propelled share prices to dizzying heights in the late 1990s. It wasn’t different that time either.No two market crashes are alike. The current state of affairs feels different from 2008, when the crash was caused by the overexposure of banks to the US housing market, and turbocharged by the widespread use of new financial instruments that were supposed to reduce risk but did the opposite. If there are parallels, they are with the recession-triggered stock market setbacks of the 1970s and early 1980s, when downturns were deliberately engineered to combat high inflation.All of which makes the power struggle between Trump and Powell pivotal. Despite what the president might say, the performance of the US economy is mediocre at best, although the weaknesses have been disguised by the fact that the better-off have been doing just fine. The top 10% of earnersaccount for almost halfof consumer spending – the highest level since the late 1980s.View image in fullscreenTraders in Chicago on 16 September 2008, the day after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.Photograph: M Spencer Green/APThe bias towards the rich is nothing new but creates its own risks. Exposure to the stock market has never been higher, with 30% of the wealth of Americans accounted for by shares. Since share ownership is concentrated among the better-off, theUS economyis relying on the Wall Street boom continuing, and for the rich to carry on spending their gains.Americans trying to get by on low and middle incomes are not so fortunate. Since the end of the pandemic, they have seen their real incomes pretty much flatline. As one Wall Street analyst, Mark Zandi, put it, the fate of the US economy lies in the hands of the well-to-do. “As long as they keep spending, the economy should avoid recession, but if they turn more cautious, for whatever reason, the economy has a big problem.”One obvious reason for the rich to turn more cautious would be a fall in share prices. If that happened, their wealth would take a hit and they would spend less. Growth would slow. Add in the negative impact of tariffs and there would be a genuine threat of recession next year. In those circumstances, Powell and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve would be expected to support share prices by cutting interest rates. Indeed, it is Wall Street’s certainty that the US central bank willbow to Trump’s pressureto do so that is preventing share prices from falling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As Dario Perkins of the research firm TS Lombardputs it, just as trade unions were the custodians of full employment immediately after the second world war, so central banks were the custodians of neoliberalism. While ostensibly independent, they made sure that capital triumphed in the fight against labour – and carried on winning. In both the global financial crisis of 2008 and the pandemic, central banks took aggressive action to put a floor under share prices.So Powell may well deliver, but he may not. The Fed has twin targets: to keep inflation at 2% over time and to support employment. Inflation is running at just under 3% so there is now a choice: keep interest rates higher than the markets expect in order to tame inflation, or ditch the inflation target to justify interest rate cuts.Either way, the prospects are not good. If the Fed resists the pressure for cheaper borrowing, it increases the chances of the US economy falling into recession. If it bows to the pressure, it will keep the stock market bubble inflated – for now at least – but at the risk of higher inflation. This could well trigger a backlash from the bond markets, which in effect set the interest rates for mortgages and servicing the US national debt,currently 124% of GDP.It is always easier to be wise after the event and identify the causes of stock market crashes with the benefit of hindsight. There should be no such problem this time. In the months to come, we shall see whether the bull market can survive the president’s attempt to set US interest rates from the White House. Wall Street seems untroubled by this. It shouldn’t be.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS economyOpinionUS economic growth and recessionFederal ReserveStock marketsFinancial crisisEconomicsBankingcommentShareReuse this content"

But there he was, the 33-year-old Democratic nominee for November’s New York City mayoral election; the upstart democratic socialist who has stormed on to the national stage witha wildfire campaignon an unabashedly progressive platform of affordability in one of the world’s most expensive cities. Last Sunday, hemingled in an Arsenal barin Brooklyn,flanked by fellow Gooner Spike Lee, peering at the big screen with a solemnity befitting theshowdown with Manchester City.Mamdani is the overwhelming favorite in the race to run the United States’ largest city, sitting15 points clearof his nearest rival, Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani is potentially New York’s first Muslim mayor. And also its first soccer mayor.Fifa not planning 64-team men’s World Cup despite Infantino’s Trump Tower summitRead moreHe has waded into those waters repeatedly in the last few weeks. He launched apetitionpushing back againstFifa’s dynamic pricing modelfor tickets at the 2026 World Cup, and demanding a price cap on resale tickets and an affordable allotment reserved for local residents. Heannounced the news through another of his instantly viral videos, flashing the social media savvy and political acuity that excites his supporters so much, along with a surprisingly soft touch on the ball. Then he appeared onthe Guardian’s Football Weekly podcast.There’s some political theater to this, of course. Mamdani’s petition is a very, very long shot to change Fifa’s policy, even if he wins the election, as is expected. The petition’s signup page on his website includes a handy box you can check to pledge to his campaign. But Mamdani was shrewd enough to understand that Fifa was there to be dunked on, and that the expected hyperinflation on World Cup tickets – America’s disposable incomeis why the sport has moved so many signature events stateside, after all – dovetailed nicely with his affordability agenda.Besides, Mamdani made a good point by highlighting that tickets for theWorld Cupmatches staged in Mexicodohave a cap on resale pricing, thanks to exactly the type of government policy he espouses. It isn’t such a long ideological leap for the candidate promising free bus fares and childcare, city-owned grocery stores, rent freezes, and a $30-per-hour minimum wage, to plead for New Yorkers to be able to attend World Cup games in their own backyard.Mamdani treading into a kind of soccer populism, however, is less interesting for the impact it may have on the sport than the distinct possibility that he’s happened upon an untapped and useful force in American politics.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

George W Bush was an unrepentant sports nut, and a onetime owner of MLB’s Texas Rangers. John McCain was forever calling into sports talk radio shows. Mitt Romney was quick to remind the nation of his role in rescuing the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics from failure in 2002. Sarah Palin styled herself as the nation’s “hockey mom.”And then there’s Donald Trump, who hasembraced sports fullyand leverages them constantly to score political points. Helambasted the NFLwhen much of the league kneeled during the national anthem in a reckoning with racism. Trump’s first vice-president, Mike Pence,went to an NFL game only to summarily walk outwhen the players kneeled, as expected.Trumpcriticized the Cleveland Guardiansfor changing their name, blaming “cancel culture.” He turned up at an Atlanta Braves gamejust to do the racist tomahawk chop. He becamethe first sitting US president to attend a Super Bowl, betweenthe Kansas City Chiefsand Philadelphia Eagles in February – even though Trumphas historically been foggyon which the state the Chiefs are from (Arrowhead Stadium is in Missouri, for the record). Trump retains close ties to the New York Yankees ownership. He has boasted of great baseball talent in his youth – although this wasa brazen lie. He showed up to tennis’ US Openand was greeted with a chorus of boos, and willpop into this week’s Ryder Cupas well.There’s evena plausible theory out therethat Trump only ever ran for president because he’d been spurned by the NFL’s club of owners, a group he was desperate to belong to, when he attempted to buy the Buffalo Bills. True or not, it’s clear that sports are essential to Trump’s political aims.Infantino’s latest Oval Office show reminds us Trump will be inescapable at the 2026 World CupRead moreBy contrast, Democratic party leaders have largely kept sports at arm’s length for the last decade. Barack Obama was a notable exception – he made sure to be seen playing enough basketball to litter the internet with compilation reels and evenAnd1-style mixtapes, the better to distract from how much he liked to golf, orhow bad he was at bowling. (Albeitnot nearly as bad as George HW Bush.) Obama was the first president to publicize his own March Madness bracket. But the long-running custom of presidential nominees of the major parties cozying up to sports, in whatever way they could, ended on one side of the aisle. Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris mostly left sports alone.Wittingly or not, Mamdani has spotted an opening to tether the left to sports. And with American football, baseball and basketball feeling all tapped out for political clout, soccer – whose American fans seem to skew progressive anyway – is an ideal foil for his platform. What sport, after all, better embodies unfettered, latter-day capitalism and its parasitical relationship with its own customer base than soccer? What sport works harder at making itself unaffordable to its traditional fanbase? Where else will Mamdani find better similes for his kitchen-table issues?Tax the rich? Let us now speak of the world’s richest sport, whereineverybodylikestododgetheirtaxes.There are limitations, of course, to how much a young, future mayor – maybe, probably – can budge his party in an ossified landscape dominated by a stubborn class of elders. But if nothing else, Mamdani might write a new playbook, or at least a new play or two, to get the left back into the conversation around sports.Leander Schaerlaeckens’ book on the United States men’s national soccer team, The Long Game, is out in the spring of 2026.

Yet there is at least one piece of verse he adores and regularly performs to cheering crowds. Last month, the White House eventurned it into a short film. Called The Snake (and originally written as a song by Oscar Brown Jr), it is as close as this president gets to a credo.The poem begins with a half-frozen snake, “all frosted with the dew” and begging to be taken into the warmth. His plea is heeded by a “tender-hearted woman”:She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silkAnd she laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milkStroking and kissing his “pretty skin”, the woman clasps him tight but “instead of saying thank you, the snake gave her a vicious bite”.These rhymes are the very essence of Trumpism: never let outsiders get too close, or you’ll be repaid in venom. No hugs, just extraction. It’s how he sees business, politics and, naturally, immigration. His recital on the White House video is overlaid with images of brown-skinned men in handcuffs getting hauled away.Watching his extraordinary speech this week at the UN, I thought again of The Snake. It is the perfect depiction of the dynamic between Trump and the British establishment – a relationship where Trump is the vicious serpent.Last week he was Keir Starmer’s most honoured guest, enjoying a banquet at Windsor Castle and wooed by King Charles as “the closest of kin”. One return flight later, Trump tore into his host – “I hope the prime minister’s listening” – and lumped the UK among those Old World shitholes “going to hell”.“You’ve bitten me, but why?“And you knewyour bitewas poisonous and now I’m going todie.”For the best part of a year, Starmer has hugged Trump as close as he can: an unprecedented second state visit, a night at a castle and a day at Chequers, photo ops with royals. All this for yankee dollars. Lower tariffs and higher investment are Starmer’s ROI (Return on Ingratiation). Last week he snagged his biggest prize yet, the US-UK tech deal. “Record-breaking” investment,trumpeted Downing Street. “A wowee number,”agreed the BBC’s estimable business editor Simon Jack. Prepare for it to be ballyhooed at next week’s Labour conference – and for the press pack to nod along. After all, they spent more time last week gawping at Melania’s hats than delving below the topline figures.Yet if Labour members and other voters knew what had actually been signed in their names they would be angered, rather than heartened. Far closer to the truth is to imagine a snake in skin of stars and stripes, wrapping itself ever tighter around your land, your data, your water supply and your electricity pylons – all the while claiming it’s for your own good.It’s not just the double-counting of projects unveiled a year or more ago, such as Google’sgrand opening by the M25orBlackstone in Northumberland. Such are the grubby standards of British government.Far more striking is Starmer’s doffing his cap at foreign investors as “life-changing”. Most Britons will feel differently. The Glazers, Blackstone and Macquarie are all examples of “inward investment”, but fans of Manchester United, patients ofSouthern Cross care homesand customersof Thames Watercould tell MPs how well those went.So it shall prove with the £31bn of technology investments. Whitehall’s own publications make clear that most of the US cash is not going into new businesses or swanky offices, but datacentres – which are absolutely central to AI, yet barely discussed in British politics. Our government claims they are “the factories powering AI” because in Westminster “factories” is shorthand for production, people, jobs. That is exactly not what datacentres are. They are much closer to hi-tech warehouses full, not of people, but machines. They don’t produce, they store: your data and mine. Nor do they provide much employment.Look at the planning documents for Blackstone’s new premises outside Blyth in Northumberland: more than 500,000 sq mfor up to 10 datacentres. Blackstone estimates that construction will require at peak 1,200 workers for an estimated 10 years.“Jobs, jobs, jobs,”promised Starmer. Really? Once up and running, the entire vast complex will need only 40 employees for each datacentre. But by then the Labour leader will be long gone.Ask Blackstone what the permanent staff will do, and it’s admirably upfront: these people will not be generals of the new data economy but its lowly footsolders, on wages to match – the maintenance, support and security guards. This site was meant to be the bustling Britishvolt factory, back when Boris Johnson was at his most boosterish. Now it will be a giant empty Mary Celeste.Yet the “hyperscale” datacentres going up across Britain are essential to Microsoft, Google and the other US giants who sit atop the artificial intelligence industry and who need vast computing power. It’s Silicon Valley that will own, operate and kit out the centres – and many of the billions that Starmer claims are coming to our shores will flow back west. It’s not the bricks and mortar that requires all those billions – it’s the Nvidia chips that go inside.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are spaces beyond oversight (the government doesn’t even know how many datacentres are on British soil) and their owners will demand low taxes.“Take me in, oh tender woman“Take me in, for heaven’s sake“Take me in, oh tender woman,” sighedthat vicious snakeFor Silicon Valley, the economy of tomorrow. For the rest of us? In the capital, datacentres are already competing with houses for energy and water. In documents published earlier this year, the borough of Tower Hamlets in east London warned of the risk of a “sudden increase in connection applications from datacentres, reserving available network capacity”. The consequences, officials warned, could be that “housebuilding, at scale, is unable to proceed for potentially 10 years+, due to lack of available electrical capacity”.The UK risks becoming a “vassal state,”warned Nick Clegg last weekand for the first time since 2010, we can all agree with Nick. We are tying ourselves into Silicon Valley’s AI infrastructure: its datacentres, its cloud computing. The plumbing and pipelines of our information economy are owned and run through Trump’s US. As the president flew into Stansted, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, Jon Cunliffe, warned that the US could easily “weaponise” its dominance of the international payments system, flicking a “kill switch”to disable countries for resisting White House diktat. Think Canada, if it doesn’t want to become the 51st state, or Denmark if it insists on keeping Greenland.And if you still think it impossible that Trump could force huge American companies to bend to his political will, just ask Jimmy Kimmel.“Shut up, silly woman,” said the reptile with a grin“You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.”Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

Let’s be honest: as Labour in government, we’ve sometimes struggled with both. We’ve found it hard to tell the real story about what is wrong with Britain and how we are going to fix it. For too long we’ve allowed Nigel Farage toset the terms of the debate, and far too often our responses have seemed tactical, not principled. By tacking one way and then the other, we have failed to provide a clear sense of whose side we are on and why.As a result, we risk losing support by taking progressive voters for granted while failing to articulate a clear and compelling argument to those flirting with Farage that sets out why they would be wrong to put their faith in him.Taking onReform UKis the battle of our political age, but we shouldn’t end up arguing on their terms, using their language. We need to wrest back control of the political megaphone that Farage brandishes and use it to amplify a Labour message based on the values we cherish – and that the British people share. AsLabour’s deputy leaderI would take the fight to Farage in a way that would energise our movement and expose the mendacity his populist rhetoric disguises.This week, the Reform leader announced he woulddeport millions of peoplewho live here legally, rounding up law-abiding residents with settled status who work hard, pay their taxes and help make our country great. It was the most outrageous political announcement of my lifetime, raising the prospect of US-style immigration raids on homes and workplaces. The parents we meet outside the school gates, the neighbours we chat to on the street and the colleagues we share a drink with after work could be tracked down, arrested and disappeared. It is a disgraceful scheme cooked up by a man who is the love child of Margaret Thatcher and Enoch Powell. No amount of posing with pint in hand and fag in mouth can mask the malice, division and hatred that drives it.We need to call out Farage for what he is, strongly and unashamedly. When the US president lies about about Londonwanting to “go to sharia law”under mayor Sadiq Khan, we have to call it out. When billionaires like Elon Musk encourage violencein our communities, we have to face up and fight. There can be no triangulation in the face of the hard right.We need to rediscover the intellectual self-confidence to take the fight to Farage and set out the solutions the country needs to tackle the deep-seated problems holding Britain back.Like all populists, Farage advocates simple solutions to complex problems. He tells voters that immigration is the root cause of deep societal challenges, including underfunded public services and stagnating living standards. The truth is they are caused bydeep inequalitiesthat lie at the heart of our economic system that have been exacerbated by 14 years of chaoticConservative rule.From Thatcherism to Cameron-era austerity, the Covid pandemic and the energy crisis, the majority of people in this country feel the economy has been run for the benefit of someone else rather than them. The wealthiest are cushioned from economic turmoil by asset inflation, while the less fortunate battle job insecurity, falling pay, rising rent, andsoaring food and energy bills. Inequality between classes, communities and regions has worsened over the last few decades.This is as true for the young person living in a city paying an extortionate rent as it is for the older couple living near a run-down town centre, the shopkeeper in suburbia struggling to make ends meet or the undervalued care worker who has to take the bus to work in the early hours of the morning.We need to be far clearer that we are on their side as a government whose only objective is to serve ordinary, hardworking people of all ages, ethnicities and backgrounds.Labour has already achieved a huge amount. We are introducingnew workplace rights, have raised theminimum wage, brought railwaysback into public ownership, and created thousands of newGP and hospital appointments. But these policies need to be set out as part of a Labour narrative that explains how we are rewiring the country so it works for everyone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We know there is an urgent need to control our borders, and we recognise that the way asylum seekers are housedcan cause tensionsin local communities. Labour can’t respond to difficult conversations by trying to change the subject. But nor can we allow Reform to set the terms of the debate.In Farage’s Britain, owning a home would remain out of reach for too many. Millions would be priced out of decent healthcare or run the risk of being fired without due process. Wages would continue to stagnate for all but the richest.As a full-time, campaigning deputy leader, I would help build the infrastructure this government needs to win the war for attention. I would take the fight to Reform by focusing on who they really are and what they believe.Farage has been allowed to hog the political microphone all summer.

Largely unclearThu 25 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 19.54 EDTShareAfew years ago, a hot guy started following me on Instagram. “Very nice,” I said to myself in Borat’s voice. Still got it. Then, he started replying to my Instagram stories. A laughing reaction here, a “haha” reply there. He was clearly flirting with me! After a few weeks of consistent interaction, I told a co-worker about “this guy on Instagram who is, like, obsessed with me”. She demanded I show his profile. “Why certainly,” I said, grinning like a fisherman wielding a juicy mackerel. “Babe,” she said. “He’s a reply guy. He does this to everyone.”After taking some time to painstakingly remove the dagger from my heart, I asked for more information. She told me that a “reply guy” is a person – typically male – who exists in the inboxes of multiple women simultaneously. His modus operandi is simple: start and maintain multiple low-effort conversations with as many warm bodies as possible. But his motives? Largely unclear.Cinemagoers tutted – but in Materialists, I finally saw a true reflection of today’s dating market | Elle HuntRead moreI posted about this phenomenon on Instagram, eager to know how many others had been on the receiving end of a reply guy’s replies. The response was overwhelming.“Story of my life,” one respondent told me. “I have had the same reply guys come out of the woodwork every time I’m single.” People told me stories of reply guys who had been messaging them for years – some would be legally entitled to long service leave. “I replied to one guy and said, ‘We should just get a drink instead of liking stories’, and he stopped.”And therein lies the inherent contradiction of the reply guy: when a target finally responds, he retreats.@makeupbyalessandra, a creator and makeup artist in Melbourne, went viral on TikTok after sharing her own experience with a reply guy. She describes a man she had been speaking to for a month and a half while she was on holiday in Europe. “He was very keen, commenting on my stories, asking me to send updates and photos, saying he can’t wait for me to be back,” she says. “The minute I got back to Melbourne? Crickets.” Still, he maintained the replies. When she posted a photo of herself looking “fire”, he was right back in her inbox: “You are something else.”This phenomenon differs from other dating foibles, such as breadcrumbing (giving morsels of attention but never the full cake of commitment) or orbiting (remaining in someone’s periphery). Unlike more traditional cases of being “led on”, true reply guys aren’t hanging around hoping for casual sex. This fact frustrates many of the women I spoke to – they’d actually prefer transactional intimacy over taking care of a Tamagotchi with limited conversational skills. “Fuckboys don’t even want to fuck any more,” one woman told me. “It’s annoying and weird.”Serial dating and push presents: love in the age of the algorithm is complex | Zandile PowellRead moreWhat confounds most women I spoke to is the “why” behind this behaviour. Surely they aren’t actually interested in whether you had steak or salmon for dinner. Maintaining a never-ending dialogue is reminiscent of after-school evenings chatting to randoms on Club Penguin. As an adult, these digital relationships feel like a waste of time. And yet, women all over the world find themselves holed up on a Tuesday night, answering questions such as “What’s your McDonald’s order?” from someone who doesn’t even have the courtesy to take them out for a 75c cone.To make matters worse, many women report that they later discovered their most loyal reply guys had actually been in relationships the entire time. I spoke to the ex-girlfriend of a notorious reply guy. “While we were together, he was endlessly messaging other women, and just like commenting on their stories, complimenting them and asking what they had for dinner,” she told me. “Turns out he never actually met up with any of them. It wasn’t even anything sexual … the messages were often pretty mundane and would go on for ages.” When she confronted him about it, he said he was seeking women’s validation. “I think a lot of these reply guys are in relationships, seeing someone else or happy jacking off. They just want female attention because of their self-induced loneliness.”Then it hit me. There could be a solution to the reply guy. And that’s the reply guy. What if, like injecting snake venom to quell a bite, we all added our favourite reply guy to a humongous group chat? We could introduce them by name and share a few fun facts (Jarrod loves hummus, Matt is more into carrot-and-cashew) before letting them loose to create new connections based on common interests (something they’re experts in finding). There would be an environmental impact – the cloud would likely explode due to the sheer volume of messages. But maybe – and stay with me here – this could be the answer to the male loneliness epidemic? There’s only one way to find out.Lucinda Price is an author and comedian who goes by the name FroomesExplore more on these topicsDatingOpinionRelationshipscommentShareReuse this content"

The pairing has been controversial in Norway: Märtha Louise stepped down from her official duties before marrying Verrett, the couple have a history of promotingpseudoscientific beliefs, and Verrett – who is black – has long been the target of racist abuse. It is on this last point that Verrett used the programme to deliver a stinging critique of his in-laws, King Harald and Queen Sonja.“Most people who are white are trained to listen to white people and not to people of colour,” he says in the film. “Her father, her mom, her brother … they didn’t even know what racism was. They would look at me like I was crazy when I would say there’s racism.”It makes for dramatic television. But the portrayal of the king and queen as naive, out of touch and even prejudiced is not just misleading, it distorts what they represent inNorway. In fact,for families like mine, the royal couple became a rare unifying force in a society still learning what diversity meant.International viewers might see this as an echo of Britain’s Windsors, glamorous, scandal-ridden, polarising figures who dominate headlines – whereas the Norwegian royals may come across as quieter, less visible, and largely uncontroversial. In reality, Harald and Sonja have been moral anchors in a country that only began receiving significant immigration from Asia and Africa in the 1970s. They wield no political power, yet their authority carries weight. For many Norwegians with immigrant backgrounds – myself included – the royal couple have been among the few who have consistently spoken of us as belonging.That is why Verrett’s accusations have provoked fury and widespread rebuttals. This groundswell of support was not engineered by the palace: citizens spontaneously rallied behind their king and queen.View image in fullscreenThe marriage of Durek Verrett and Märtha Louise, in Rebel Royals.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixSome of the loudest voices have come from minority communities. On aprime-time debate showdays after the Netflix documentary premiered, queer activists and representatives from religious groups, disabled communities, anti-racist networks and women’s organisations lined up to testify to the couple’s inclusivity.The examples are not hard to find. In 2016 theking declared: “Norwegians have come from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Poland, Sweden, Somalia and Syria.” For tens of thousands of us, that single line cut through the online hate telling us we would never be “real Norwegians”. Inclusion and diversity have not been symbolic gestures, but the king’s life’s work. In his New Year’s Eve speech in 2007 the king addressed racism directly: “We are constantly reminded that humanity and mutual respect cannot be taken for granted. Xenophobia, everyday racism and violence are part of the news picture. Tolerance can be enshrined in law – but prejudice against those who think differently has its roots in the human mind. It is there that the battle must be won.”Sonja, who was not born a royal and fought for nine years to be allowed to marry Harald, has channelled her own experience of exclusion into decades of advocacy for women and minorities. In a small, homogeneous country, these gestures have mattered.None of this means Norway is free of racism. Its recent politics underscores the tension: in the last election, an anti-immigration party made surprising gains, indicating how fragile social cohesion feels in a time of heightened polarisation. Verrett’s personal experiences of prejudice deserve acknowledgment. But to brand the monarchs as ignorant or racist does more harm than good. If every criticism is recast as racism, the term itself is emptied of power – leaving those most affected less protected.Verrett’s own controversies also matter. In Norway, he has been criticised less for his skin colour than for his actions:selling amuletshe claimed could protect against Covid, or suggestingchildhood cancer is caused by unhappiness. His self-promotion jars with Nordic norms of modesty. Conflating cultural disapproval with racial bias only deepens mistrust.The lesson is larger than Norway. Public figures invoking racism carry responsibility: their words can clarify, but they can also obscure. If we want the fight against discrimination to succeed, we must name real prejudice when we see it – and also recognise genuine allies, even when imperfect.For all their privilege, King Harald and Queen Sonja have opened doors, literally and figuratively, to those once shut out. They deserve better than caricature. And Norway – like every democracy – deserves a conversation about race that confronts hard truths without collapsing into distortion.Shazia Majid is a columnist at the Norwegian newspaper VGDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Despite the chaos, they are willing Your Party to get off the groundThu 25 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 11.13 EDTShareDoes Britain need another leftwing party? If you’re not on the left – or if you are, but consider yourself a realist – then the answer may seem obvious. This is a conservative country, you probably believe, in its underlying political assumptions, electoral system and media biases. Any party that doesn’t fit these is put under intolerable pressure. It always splinters, shrinks and collapses, sooner or later.If even the Labour party, in which radical leftwingers are only ever a minority, is still fundamentally unacceptable to many voters and powerful interests – as the right’s constant outrage at Keir Starmer’s occasionally egalitarian government demonstrates – then what chance does a less established, more disruptive party than Labour have? Over the past half century in particular, ever since Margaret Thatchersuccessfully undermined socialism’s legitimacyas a mainstream belief system, the space for leftwing politics has sharply contracted in this country. Britain has become one of the world’s least left-tolerant democracies.A string of socialist parties have been formed, from Respect to Left Unity to the Socialist Labour party, their expectations sometimes sky high, but then rapidly scaled down. Factionalism, personality clashes and ideological differences – often worsened by the claustrophobia of doing politics in siege conditions – have further doomed these parties to frustrated termination, or the humiliation of lingering on, but on a tiny scale. To many people across the political spectrum, the British radical left is best known as the butt ofjokes about self-sabotage, delusions and impotence. Tellingly, fewer such jokes are made about the radical right. FromRobert Jenrickto Reform UK, the realisation of its dreams seems less amusingly far away.Over the past two turbulent months, Zarah Sultana and Jeremy Corbyn’snew partyhas sometimes seemed to be following these depressingly familiar patterns. Despite the decades of experience of those involved in previous leftwing projects, wearily familiar mistakes have been made:public rows, a lack of robust party structures, protracted internal stalemates and sudden, counterproductive outbursts by leading figures. One strategist who has been helping build the party for more than a year says they now feel “misery and rage”, and have stepped away.Yet, to feel nothing but despair (or delight) at the problems of Your Party is to look at British politics in an orthodox and narrow way. The less common but necessary question to ask about the struggles of such projects is whether they are stunting not just the left but our politics more generally – at a time when it desperatelyneeds to change.Britain, it is widely thought, is in a period of social and economic crisis as bad as those of the 1930s and 1970s. But, unlike then, much of the public is politically disengaged. Election turnouts are lower, politicians are seen as more similar to each other, and political cynicism and avoidance reign. Even to talk about politics in a public place, such as a pub, can lead to strangers grumpily asking you to talk about something else. As the perceptive political and cultural theoristMark Fisherused to say, Britain has a depressed economy but boom-time politics: complacently repetitive, ideologically limited – a holdover from the relatively comfortable and depoliticised early 21st century.The three most popular parties – Reform,Labourand the Tories – are ever tougher on crime and immigrants, and deferential to big business. All three prioritise the same socially conservative voters. All three believe that economic growth can be driven by deregulation and the City of London, as though the 2008 financial crisis never happened.The lack of an effective leftwing party since then – with the brief exception of the best days ofCorbyn’s Labour leadershipin 2017 and 2018 – is one of the main reasons our politics is so stuck and angry. Without a party that seriously addresses this country’s socially corrosive inequality, the exploitative and dysfunctional character of the privatised utilities and wider British capitalism, and the racist myths that dominate the debate about immigration and multiculturalism, mainstream politics will continue to move rightwards without solving, and often inflaming, the problems it claims to be addressing.The Lib Dems present their anti-authoritarian, centrist politics as a way out of this cycle. But a party that also says farmland should be “exempt from inheritance tax”, despite the wealth of many landowners and the funding crisis in public services, clearly has limits as a challenger to the status quo.The Greens, under their new leftwing leader,Zack Polanski, look better suited to that role. He attacks elites and defends the vulnerable with more aggression than his party has previously, and it is attracting activists and thinkers who used to be aligned with Corbynism, such as James Meadway and Michael Chessum. Helped by Your Party’s turmoil, Green membership hasgrown to almost 80,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s what they could learn from Farage and Polanski | Zoe WilliamsRead moreAnd yet,10 timesthat many signed up on the Your Party website this summer. Many leftists are still making up their minds about which party, if any, might satisfy their hopes. As the former Your Party strategist tells me, “Conditions are even more favourable for a new party now than last autumn” when serious work on the project began. “Labour is even lower in the polls.”In recent days, Sultana and Corbyn have madeconciliatory public statements. Your Party remains in a contradictory state: tense, ready to explode into conflict again, yet also a half-formed party of rare potential. Corbynsaid on Tuesday, “I’m getting … massive numbers of messages saying: ‘When’s the [founding] conference? Get on with it, I want to go out campaigning and I want candidates and I want to see you in the local elections [next May].’”With few energising political movements around, it’s possible that the conference, now scheduled for 29 and 30 November, or public rallies featuring Corbyn and Sultana – both speakers with big followings – could make the in-fighting of the past two months fade away. With the electorate restless and fragmented, Your Party could win local and parliamentary contests, and establish itself as a leftwing party with leverage, as sometimes exists in continental Europe: a participant in coalition governments, or at least a party that forces centrist rivals to the left.Yet some Your Party activists fear its credibility has been too damaged and its promise of a bottom-up, non-factional politics too diluted for the project to succeed as originally hoped. “A shadow of what it could have been”, as one organiser puts it. If he’s right, many in mainstream politics will celebrate.But he hasn’t stopped working for the party quite yet. The large minority of leftwing Britons need a party that explicitly represents them, he says.

When did we decide to aim no higher than the middle – whether in politics or economics?This week the OECD released its latest report onthe global economy, where the pretence is that things are mostly normal and fine. The report’s title was Finding the Right Balance in Uncertain Times. And I had to think, “balance” between what?The clear issue is Donald Trump, whose policies often seem like thought bubbles based on whatever unscientific garbage he heard on TV in the 1980s and still thinks is true. But we can’t mention that and so instead we talk about “uncertain times” and needing to find a balance between that and, I guess, reality?Similarly, theIMF’s most recent report in Aprilwas A Critical Juncture Amid Policy Shifts.A US fascism expert’s warning to Australia: ‘You guys are probably next’Read moreAh yes, policy shifts where Trump put a tariff on every country including thoseuninhabited by humans, and is instigating anauthoritarianregime in the world’s biggest economy. But rather than sound the alarm we talk of “policy shifts” as though Trump is just tweaking a few regulations.This week as well,the IMF’s economistswarned of “weak growth as economic environment shifts” in a note that referred to “diverging pathways in a fragmented global economy”, which is bland even for that organisation.But we have long taught ourselves to smother things of great concern with blandness and pretend that nothing truly bad is happening.This weekTrump’s speechwas full of derision and division at the UN, and yet whether or not he wouldmeet with Anthony Albaneseremained a note of concern across Australian political media.None of those talking up Trump “snubbing” Albanese think a meeting has any possibility of a good or logical outcome, but apparently we should not demand more from our politicians than their acting a foolish pantomime based on standards that haven’t applied for more than a decade.Not to worry, Trump will spout idiocy and journalists will write it up as though it is normal.The entireOECDreport, for example, mentions climate change just once – as an afterthought in a list of “difficult budgetary choices … such as rising defence spending [which] augment the impending fiscal pressures from ageing populations and climate change.”Don’t get too worried about climate change; it’s just a budget choice!And don’t get too worried about the Trump administration’s policies – they are just “risks”, even as the OECD points out that effective tariff rate on US merchandise imports is now the highest rate since the Great Depression:If the graph does not display click hereThe OECD report also included forecasts for economic growth for this year and the next, and Australia is set to do well in comparison with other large economies:If the graph does not display click hereThat is fine for us, but the reality is Australia, as well as the rest of the advanced economic world, is mired in mediocre sludge.If the graph does not display click hereThe OECD’s expectation of 2.3% GDP growth is not far off similar IMF’s estimates, which go out to 2030. At no point does the IMF predict growth anywhere close to the long-term average:If the graph does not display click hereTo be fair, the OECD and IMF are a pretty dull organisations devoted to calming the horses, even as they are being led away to the knackery – ignore climate change, ignore Trump and just keep mentioning (as the OECD did) that “monetary policy should remain vigilant”.This is important because next week the Reserve Bank will meet, andall signsare that it will “be vigilant” and keep the cash rate steady at 3.6%. And I have to ask myself: why would that be at all acceptable unless mediocrity was the aim?No one thinks our economy is surging; indeed, the most recent unemployment figures show that unemployment has been rising and has now been above 4% all this year:If the graph does not display click hereNot that long agoeconomistsweretalking up the hopeoflocking inunemployment at 4%.But no. The RBA decided it was wrong to aim for a situation where “everyone who wants a job should be able to find one without searching for too long” (as was stated in the2023 employment white paper). Rather it felt it better that an extra 100,000 or so people lose their jobs, because it believes that needed to happen to get inflation below 3%.The RBA so lacks ambition to lock in historic low unemployment that rather than provide stimulus to a slowing economy, it has soughtevery opportunityto avoid lowering rates.As a result, Wednesday’smonthly CPI figuresshowing inflation grew at 3% over the past year will most likely be taken as reason to do nothing next week, despite the underlying inflation measure falling from 2.7% to 2.6%:If the graph does not display click hereRather than seek stronger (heck, even average) growth or lower unemployment, the RBA’s governor, Michele Bullock, seems more concerned about things heating up.On Monday she warnedthe House economics committee“there may be more excess demand in the economy, and labour market outcomes may be stronger than expected”. She also talked of household consumption picking up, without noting how far below trend level it remains:If the graph does not display click hereAll of this however is unfortunately very much in keeping with the times.If the RBA is to do nothing next week, it will not be a case of prudence or a need for more data, rather it will be just another example of one of our institutions aiming low – settling for the middle, rather than seeking better things.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsReserve Bank of AustraliaOECDInterest ratesUnemploymentInflationcommentShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Richard Isaac/Rex/ShutterstockAs Nick Cave and Kylie Minogue’s Where the Wild Roses Grow turns 30, we count down pop’s finest two-handers, from career-revivers to celebrity meta-textsByAlexis PetridisThu 25 Sep 2025 10.07 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 20.14 EDTShare20. Katy B – Lights On (ft Ms Dynamite) (2010)Most pop/hip-hop collaborations don’t qualify here – commissioning a verse from a rapper to increase your single’s “reach” does not a duet make – but Lights On does. It moves back and forth between both participants, and moreover, it’s superb: a perfect evocation of the night ending before the stimulants have worn off.19. Bobbie Gentry and Glen Campbell – Mornin’ Glory (1968)View image in fullscreenCampbell and Gentry at the 1968 Grammy awards.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveThe whole of Gentry and Campbell’s eponymous duets album is a delight, but if you had to pick a highlight, their version of the Gentry-penned Morning Glory is the one. It’s a spectacularly lovely song, its drowsy but glowing mood – a one-night-stand gone right, a rarity in pop – amplified by the twin vocals.18. Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle – Picking Up After You (1982)There’s an argument that Tom Waits’ soundtrack to Francis Ford Coppola’sOne From the Heartis significantly better than the film itself. The weary after-hours jazz of Picking Up After You – in which a marriage gone stale is picked over with scabrous relish by both parties – is particularly splendid.17. Otis Redding and Carla Thomas – Tramp (1967)The genius of Otis Redding and Carla Thomas’s splendidly argumentative take on the old Lowell Folson blues number (aside from its implausibly funky breakbeat) is the way Thomas’s disparaging vocal undercuts Redding’s super-slick soul-man image: “You know what, Otis? You’re country … you wear overalls … and you need a haircut!”16. Prince (with Sheena Easton) – U Got the Look (1987)The kind of improbable masterpiece that only Prince in his pomp could have dreamed up, then executed so convincingly: funk with squealing rock guitars, former MOR favourite Sheena Easton recast as strutting temptress, the whole thing held together by spoken-word sections that compare sex to baseball. The end result is, unaccountably, incredible.View image in fullscreenFlack and Hathaway.Photograph: GAB Archive/Redferns15. Roberta Flack – Back Together Again (ft Donny Hathaway) (1980)Infamously, Back Together Again was recorded the day Donny Hathaway took his own life: the studio session had already been abandoned due to his erratic behaviour. And yet the song is a joy-bringing delight. That such transcendent, life-affirming music could have emerged from such desperate circumstances is testament to the singers’ power and chemistry.14. George Michael and Elton John – Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me (1991)George Michael’s Cover to Cover tour saw him tackling everything from David Bowie’s Fame to Adamski’s Killer, but a surprise London guest appearance by Elton John deservedly provided a transatlantic No 1. The song’s considerable emotional heft was further amplified by the fact that John had only recently emerged from rehab.13. Dan Hartman (with Loleatta Holloway) – Vertigo/Relight My Fire (1979)Take That’s cover might be better known, but the original is the masterpiece: an epic of high-drama disco delirium, squelching synth and cinematic strings. The moment, three minutes in, when the familiar riff kicks in is euphoric, the arrival of the queen of Salsoul three minutes later unfeasibly thrilling.12. Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood – Some Velvet Morning (1967)You’re spoilt for choice when it comes to Sinatra/Hazlewood duets – from the hilarious Jackson to the drowsily erotic Summer Wine, they’re all great. But Some Velvet Morning is the best: darkly sexual and faintly baffling, filled with disorientating shifts in time signature and references to Phaedra (“a sad-assed broad,” as Hazlewood once put it bluntly).11. William Bell and Judy Clay – Private Number (1968)Late-60s Stax at its vertiginous height. Everything about Private Number is exquisite, from its atmospheric intro to the subtle orchestration to Bell and Clay’s vocals, pleading but restrained. The lyrical plot twist is neatly done, and the song’s emotional shift from moody verses to jubilant chorus offers guaranteed elation.10. The Pogues – Fairytale of New York (ft Kirsty MacColl) (1988)View image in fullscreenShane MacGowan of the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl.Photograph: Patrick Ford/RedfernsTry to banish the thought of its festive ubiquity for a moment and instead luxuriate in its exemplary use of the duet as a storytelling device, gradually dragging the grim saga of its dissolute relationship from early optimism through furious rancour to a kind of battered, unpromising reconciliation.9. Charli xcx and Lorde – The Girl, So Confusing Version With Lorde (2024)Charli xcx rerecorded her song about her fraught relationship with Lorde days after its release, with its subject answering all her accusations. Equal parts psychodrama and fourth-wall-breaking play on fans’ obsession with linking pop lyrics to IRL events, it is unequivocal evidence of its authors’ mastery of modern pop stardom, and all that comes with it.8. Brandy and Monica – The Boy Is Mine (1998)The negative image of Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney’s similarly titled but hopelessly drippy The Girl Is Mine. Brandy and Monica dish up five minutes of acidic fingernails-in-the-hair spite (“there is no way you could mistake him for your man – are you insane?”) over a superb, bumping Rodney Jerkins beat.7. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds + Kylie Minogue – Where the Wild Roses Grow (1995)Cave’s 1996 duet with PJ Harvey, Henry Lee, is magnificent, but Where the Wild Roses Grow has the extra improbability factor. At the time of its release, the very idea of Kylie recording a brooding murder ballad with Nick Cave seemed quite remarkable, let alone with results this powerful.6. Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash – Girl From the North Country (1969)First recorded six years earlier on The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan, Girl From the North Country was powerfully reinvented in Cash’s company. Slower and sadder, it now sounds impossibly careworn, as if the two of them are competing to see who can sound the most dejected and heartsick.5. Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton – Islands in the Stream (1983)View image in fullscreenRogers and Parton.Photograph: Gary Gershoff/Getty ImagesThe Bee Gees’ post-disco era of writing songs for other artists offers an embarrassment of riches, but Islands in the Stream is the jewel. It was originally a Motown pastiche intended for Diana Ross, but Parton and Rogers’ country reading is so definitive, it’s hard to imagine it any other way. WhenRogers played Glastonbury, the crowd insisted he sing ittwice.4. Queen and David Bowie – Under Pressure (1981)A duet in which the voices appear to be singing completely different songs – Bowie’s angsty state-of-the-world address alternating with Freddie Mercury’s airy scat vocals – before they suddenly turn to the same page two-and-a-half minutes in, leading to a fantastically powerful finale. It was an unlikely chart-topper, but then so was Bohemian Rhapsody.3. Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell – You’re All I Need to Get By (1968)View image in fullscreenTerrell and Gaye.Photograph: GAB Archive/RedfernsIt’s hard to pick a favourite from the succession of fabulous duets Gaye and Terrell recorded: Ain’t No Mountain High Enough, California Soul, Ain’t Nothin’ Like the Real Thing. But the glorious You’re All I Need to Get By – more obviously gospel-influenced than your usual Motown track – just clinches it.2. Pet Shop Boys with Dusty Springfield – What Have I Done to Deserve This? (1987)Dusty Springfield’s stock was so low that the Pet Shop Boys’ label argued they should record What Have I Done to Deserve This? with Tina Turner instead. What that would have sounded like boggles the mind. It certainly couldn’t have improved on the magical blend of Springfield’s husky pleading and Neil Tennant’s icy lugubriousness.1. Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush – Don’t Give Up (1986)Compiling a list of the greatest duets is a thankless task: even if you confine yourself to rock and pop, and exclude artists for whom duetting is inbuilt or internal (so no Ashford and Simpson or Sam and Dave and no Don’t You Want Me) it’s a vast area to narrow down. Picking a chart-topper is more thankless still, but Don’t Give Up exudes an extraordinary emotional power, linked to the contrast between Gabriel’s utter hopelessness and misery and Bush’s patient expressions of unconditional love: “You still have us”; “You worry too much.” That the latter don’t seem to impact on the former at all makes it devastating, but unforgettable.Explore more on these topicsRankedPop and rockPeter GabrielKate BushfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It made me think of the 6 January attack on the US Capitol; what drives normal working class Americans to make these life choices? I’m counting on the UK to celebrate this film, because I think it’s a little too smart for the American audience, frankly. A more European sensibility is going to respond more powerfully than an American one.Does the Highlander remake fill you with dread, indifference, or cautious optimism?ArcadianSeanHighlander is one of my favourite films. It’s an incredible movie of sword-fighting with Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery and Clancy Brown as the Kurgan, the evil Russian villain, who I’d take over Darth Vader any day. The soundtrack is by Queen. It’s insane. Chris Pratt had never seen Highlander, so I booked a screening room in the middle of the afternoon at the studio where we were shooting Parks and Recreation, and we watched it by ourselves. To answer the question: I like to be supportive of my fellow artists. I’m not a cynical person. I hope that, somehow, it’s even greater than the original. Why aren’t I in the remake? That’s a great question. There’s this Australian bloke … Russell something … and people seem to keep leaning in his direction.View image in fullscreen‘Playing a tech god was fascinating’ … Offerman with Sonoya Mizuno in Devs.Photograph: Raymond LiuWhat was it like working with the genius that isAlex Garland in Devsand playing the role of a technological god?PaulsaxonshawAlex Garland is one of the most underrated of our modern film-makers. He asks these big questions on behalf of all of us. With Devs, the question is: should we give power to the controllers of our technology without any checks and balances? Playing a tech god was fascinating, done with authentic human drama and interpersonal relationships. We filmed in Santa Cruz, San Francisco and London. The Devs building was in a giant sound stage in Manchester. I love Manchester. It’s a wonderful, hardworking city. It reminds me of Chicago, full of charm, populated by working people who love a sausage roll. It’s tough to beat a Greggs. I’ve tried the posh ones. It needs to be a little dirty.I’d never seen anything like your performance inThe Last of Us on TVbefore – a mature gay relationship treated with such tenderness, seriousness and depth. How did Bill’s love story affect you?DancingLashaTumbaiThank you for the compliment. If I succeed at that level, it’s because the writing is that exquisite. Everyone agrees that script was like a piece of wizardry.One of the things I love about my dad [a social studies teacher and woodworker called Ric] and my larger farm family is that we all teach. Everybody can back up a vehicle, park a wagon, dig a hole, bake a loaf of bread or gut a fish. We are self-sustaining. The problem is that it ruins TV and film for me. I get cast as people who use tools or drive vehicles, and it’s excruciating because I never let a stunt person do it. The whole time, my dad is sitting on my shoulder with his arms crossed, watching me. Playing Bill was the most exquisite experience, but when I was processing a deer I’ve just shot, or pulling a carrot out of the earth, all I was thinking was: “Is my dad gonna buy this?”Filming those scenes with Murray Bartlett [from White Lotus] … we were violinists, playing beautiful sonatas of our emotional journey that sounded so sweet together. That’s why the world responded so explosively, because it boiled down to the essence of every novel and work of art: “What the fuck is the point of all of this?” The point is that other people are your purpose. If you’re not living to make them happy, then whatisthe fucking point? I’m going to cry.Having started out on the baritone sax and winning the Louis Armstrongjazzaward in1988, were your initial career aspirations more music focused?JimmySlideMy dad had an old tenor saxophone he’d played as a kid. We were that kind of frugal household: “You wanna play music? Here’s your pick.” I was in a small town marching band. If you’re strong, no matter what instrument you play, they hand you the big drum, tuba or baritone sax. As a teenager, I had aspirations to become an actor, but I lived in a cultural vacuum. My guidance counsellor wanted to hear: doctor, lawyer, barrister. They didn’t want to hear: “I want to be an actor.” They said: “I don’t believe that’s one of the options.” I said: “I guess I want to be a musician.” They said: “I don’t think so, buddy. What kind of life would that be?” Fortunately, I discovered you could get paid to be in plays in Chicago. I’m grateful that I got turned on to music, even though it didn’t end up as my career path.View image in fullscreenPlaying Ron Swanson, with Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope.Photograph: NBCU Photo Bank/Getty ImagesHave you done much Shakespeare? I’d love to see you performPolonius’ “To thine own self be true” speech from Hamlet.gummitchThat’s very generous: Polonius is a helluva nice role. I have done a handful of Shakespeare. I wanted to end up at the RSC or Old Vic. I hope to do more Shakespeare before I’m done – I think I’ve still got a couple of years left in my Romeo before they age me out.Love the moustache. But how do you manage beard itch? Drives me spare.CathChakravartyandJustSomeDadI have obvious physical deformities that have kept me from being considered one of the great beauties of my age. On the plus side, I am able to grow prodigious whiskers. If I put my thumb in my mouth and blow, I can grow about an eighth of an inch. It has been a wonderful boon as an actor to achieve every possible iteration of facial hair. Given my druthers, I would have a big beard all the time, because that’s what mother nature intended.There are two kinds of itch. The first is when it’s breaking the skin. That also causes burn on your partner, so you have to be careful when engaging in any form of canoodling. The other itch is once your beard gets full and you begin storing things in it, like gravy or Guinness. A makeup artist taught me to use an astringent, such as Sea Breeze. Once a week, I’ll give it a good scrub, and that keeps the soup cleaned up.View image in fullscreenWith wife Megan Mullally in Parks and Recreation.Photograph: NBC/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesWhat are the best and worst things about being married toMegan Mullally? Did you have trouble keeping a straight face to her terrifying sexual performance as your ex-wifeTammy II in Parks and Rec?ReckonerandNeckron666She’s an exquisite goddess. She’s the funniest person I’ve ever met – and I’ve met Mel Brooks and John Cleese. She dances, she sings. She’s a dramatic and comedic genius. She has astonishing taste – with a few obvious lapses. We’ll come to blows over who left the cap off the toothpaste. But I’m very grateful that after 25 years, she is still choosing me. The worst part is, in the same way that when I back up a truck and my dad is sitting on my shoulder, when I’m performing, especially singing, Megan is very much on my shoulder. When you’re married to the Lionel Messi of performing, it can be tough to keep your shots on goal.The craziest thing about her dangerous sexuality was that, inParks and Recreation, I was known for keeping a straight face. Chris Pratt would come out of leftfield and make me giggle, but I enjoy deadpan humour, so generally, nobody could make me laugh. Megan would walk into the room and I would be done because, by definition, she knows what buttons to push. All our scenes are her using her sexuality as a weapon against me, and I lost that battle long, long ago.Sovereign is on digital platforms.

The blockbuster show has brought together a who’s who of 80s art, with major pieces from Andy Warhol,Jean-Michel Basquiat, Francesco Clemente, Jeff Koons, Keith Haring, Cindy Sherman, and many others.The goal for Downtown/Uptown is quite simple: to showcase the decade’s best art for new generations. “I was thinking about what art was pivotal to the moment,” said Brett Gorvy, show co-curator. “And also what over time has become pivotal. We’ve been lucky to be able to access the greatest paintings of so many of these artists.”According to Gorvy, the 80s were typified by the central role of celebrity in the art world, as well as being a decade marked by the Aids epidemic and the ascendancy of a hyper-capitalistic mentality. Gordon Gekko’s refrain “greed is good” rang out everywhere, especially the art world, as artists’ journeys from rags to riches were frequently marked by frenzy and extravagance.View image in fullscreenAndy Warhol - Reel Basquiat (1984)Photograph: Courtesy Lonian Gallery II, LLC / Oriol Tarridas“Artists are literally taking things out of dumpsters and creating art, so it seemed like the opposite of Wall Street,” said Gorvy. “But what happens to many of these artists is that money came very quickly. Ultimately there were drugs and excess.”The show taps legendary art dealer Mary Boone, herself a major figure in the 80s art world, to co-curate, offering an unparalleled expertise into the minds of the artists – one piece by Basquiat demonstrates Boone’s intimate role, a punching bag onto which he has written her name in block letters below his iconic crown. “It’s been amazing working with Mary Boone, who was the queen of Soho,” Gorvy said. “She has been this incredible collaborator – ultimately her connections with the artists allowed me to piggyback onto that and have a show that is both historical and that feels very relevant.”Downtown/Uptown opens with a showcase of Warhol’s silkscreen portraits, including ones of show luminaries Clemente, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Basquiat, as well as a very fitting one of dollar signs. “Warhol is a very important figure in the show, because he’s the lynchpin for all this activity,” Gorvy said. “He was a mentor, and his Factory was a place where you could congregate as an artist. There’s the notion that these are young kids basically being presented by Warhol as the superstars. He essentially created the celebrity aspect.”Beyond the all-encompassing effects of money and celebrity, the Aids epidemic also permeated the 80s art world – this aspect of Downtown/Uptown comes into focus in Ross Bleckner’s 27764, which represents a tally of those lost to the disease at the time the work was created in 1987. Done in a muddy off-white and consisting of innumerable strokes, the work is somber and deeply affecting – it’s a jumping off point for the deeper, mournful looks into HIV that Bleckner would make throughout the 90s. “It looks almost like legions of wounds on the canvas,” said Gorvy. “And then, right in the middle, is this number, in this like gothic script.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Lévy Gorvy DayanIn addition to being ravaged by Aids, the art world of the ‘80s was also ravaged by the plague of sexism, a fact that anonymous art collective the Guerrilla Girls managed to declare with an inventiveness and sarcasm that turned heads. Downtown/Uptown pays the collective due respect by showing some of their wittiest posters One such poster notes how the Guggenheim, Met, MoMA, and Whitney collectively featured just a single female artist in a one-person exhibition in 1984. Another wryly collects the “advantages of being a woman artist”, which include “not being stuck in a tenured teaching position” and “having the opportunity to choose between career and motherhood”.Gorvy acknowledged that Downtown/Uptown is very unbalanced when it comes to representing female artists, noting that this fact is sadly reflective of the realities of the ‘80s art world. “What’s striking about this show is the very strong male voice,” Gorvy said. “That notion of female artists finding their own sort of room to grow was not something that existed in the painting world of the 80s. The galleries of the time were not necessarily choosing female artists to promote. I think we have seven female artists in the show, which proportionately is probably pretty accurate.”View image in fullscreenCindy Sherman - Untitled #86 (1981)Photograph: Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth Courtesy Fischl Gornik Family FoundationAccording to Gorvy, the part of 80s artistry that most permeates the art world of today is the focus on figuration, which originally came back into style after a 70s dominated by a harsh and chilly minimalism. “The primacy of figuration today is something where the birth of that was in the 80s,” Gorvy said. “It was very much a reaction against minimalism and the cold mentality of artists not having a hand.”Downtown/Uptown also offers a fascinating opportunity to see how the major works of the 80s have sorted out. It would seem almost impossible to do an 80s show without paying due respect to Andres Serrano’s Piss Christ – which almost singlehandedly launched the culture wars over the arts that would last well into the 90s – yet when Gorvy namechecks those artists who have truly endured, the figure who tops his list is Basquiat.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy of Lévy Gorvy Dayan“With an artist like Basquiat, the authenticity of his work is of bringing the history of the street, of graffiti into the gallery,” Gorvy said. “It has a vitality that just touches you. There’s a reason why Basquiat is one of the top artist today commercially. He’s, well beyond anyone else in the show, the most expensive artist who we have in the exhibition, and he has a relevancy both in terms of younger artists and of the collectors.”Gorvy shared that while working on Downtown/Updown he frequently thought of his 20-year-old daughter, musing on what someone of her generation would want to know about the world of 80s art. “I was thinking of why the 80s should speak to this generation,” he said. He sees relevancy in the fashion and music of Gen Z, an opening that will hopefully make for curiosity. “We’re hopefully introducing these artists to a new audience, showing a full spectrum of artists so that young people can understand it in a very holistic way. In my mind it goes back to the notion of my daughter and asking, ‘How do you pass the baton of something that’s very special?’”Downtown/Uptown: New York in the Eighties is on display at Lévy Gorvy Dayan in New York until 13 DecemberExplore more on these topicsArtExhibitionsDesignAndy WarholJean-Michel BasquiatfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Theassassinationof rightwing pundit Charlie Kirk exploded already fiery political tensions, with the Trump administration and its base embarking on a campaign of retribution the likes of which haven’t been seen since the McCarthy era, and stating, without sufficient evidence, that Kirk’s murder was the result of a wide-ranging leftist plot. Scores of people in the public and private sectors have been punished for commenting on the situation, most notably late-night hostJimmy Kimmel, whose show was briefly pulled off air after the chair of the Federal Communications Commission,Brendan Carr, put parent company Disney under pressure to do so.Suffice to say, the situation is far too dire to worry about where a cartoon sitcom fits into it all, but South Park is a special case. The first episode of season 27 revolved around the politically motivatedcancellationofStephen Colbert, another late-night talkshow host critical ofDonald Trump, while the second directly lampooned Kirk.Donald Trump is having a lovechild with Satan: South Park sets up future chaosRead moreMany on the right have declared South Park morally complicit in Kirk’s murder, despite the fact that Kirk himselfcelebratedthe parody (going so far as to use its caricature of him as his X profile picture). Repeats of that episode were pulled from Comedy Central, although it remains available to stream on Paramount+. Then, a week to the day after Kirk’s death, it was announced that the new episode of South Park would be postponed. This sparked speculation of censorship, although showrunners Matt Stone and Trey Parker roundly denied this, claiming it was simply a matter of a blown deadline (the result of their famously tight schedule).View image in fullscreenBrendan Carr is at risk of ‘losing his freedom of speech’.Illustration: Comedy CentralWhile that seems like an all too convenient excuse, Parker and Stone have never backed down from controversy before. Then again, said controversy has never been this furious before, nor hit so close to home for them. The big question ahead of the newest episode was: what wouldSouth Parkhave to say about all this?The answer is … not much.The latest instalment, provocatively titled Conflict of Interest, makes no mention of Kirk, although it does tackle the aftermath in a roundabout way. In one of the two main storylines, Trump, upset over the impending birth of his unholy lovechild with Satan, sets a series of convoluted traps to force an abortion, only for Carr to continually wander into them. By the end of the episode, Carr, badly injured and hosting a brain parasite as a result of toxoplasmosis from being buried in a mountain of cat poo, is at risk of “losing his freedom of speech”.View image in fullscreenTrump keeps trying to get Satan to have an abortion, but Brendan Carr won’t let it happen.Illustration: Paramount+Despite avoiding one of the touchiest subjects of the day, South Park steered headlong into another, finally addressing the genocide in Palestine by way of prediction market apps. A bet on one of the platforms – “Will Kyle’s mom strike Gaza and destroy a Palestinian hospital?” – grows so large that Kyle’s mom ends up flying toIsraelto put a stop to it.‘It’s like they’re trying to get prosecuted’: when cartoons try to take down governmentsRead moreFor most of the episode, the outrage is directed at all sides, with Kyle angrily yelling: “Jews and Palestinians are not football teams that you bet on”, and his mother proclaiming: “It’s not Jews versus Palestine, it’s Israel versus Palestine!”However, that outrage is ultimately aimed at a specific party, with Kyle’s mom barging into the office of the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, and letting rip: “Just who do you think you are, killing thousands and flattening neighbourhoods, then wrapping yourself in Judaism like it’s some shield from criticism!” If Netanyahu’s comeuppance isn’t as scatologically extreme as Carr’s, it still provides a fleeting moment of catharsis.While not the most outrageous episode of the season, this may be the funniest, with the Looney Tunes-like gags and the prevalence of JD Vance’s impish caricature both earning huge laughs. And if this week’s South Park didn’t quite meet the moment head-on, neither did it back down. It’s good to know that it will continue to go after Trump and his cronies no matter how hot the political temperature grows.South Park is on Paramount+Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTelevisionAnimation on TVUS televisionTV comedyComedyBenjamin NetanyahufeaturesShareReuse this content"

With its name and location, painter Glenn Brown cheekily suggests that this personal museum of the art he collects, plus his own creations, is on a par with London’s famous gallery of rococo paintings and ancien regime clocks. The joke works best on your phone map where you can see how close they are.The current exhibition Hoi Polloi is curated by Brown and supposedly looks at representations of “the ordinary man” in art. It’s a satirical nudge at claims to social worthiness by public galleries for there is zero purpose or theme here, just a mixing and merging of the curious and eclectic in fascinating juxtapositions over four floors of a luxuriously restored building that even has a gothic cellar reminiscent of the one in the Sir John Soane’s Museum. Here you can be spooked by one of Gillian Wearing’s lifelike masks.View image in fullscreenLike festering wallpaper … Brown’s When the Satellite Sings.Photograph: ® The Brown CollectionSince this is Brown’s self-funded enterprise and entry is free, he has only himself to please. Part of the cheek of The Brown Collection is its implication that he is a national treasure who needs no introduction. That is, of course, untrue. Brown, who is from Northumberland, made his name selling paintings – ones that openly recreated and remade other artists’ works – to Charles Saatchi in the 1990s. He was nominated for the Turner prize and there was chatter about plagiarism, but his style has long since evolved into a subtle, technically brilliant obsession with the nature of brushstrokes themselves: what he is or isn’t imitating no longer seems relevant. He makes putting oil on canvas look like an exquisitely refined, utterly perverse pursuit.Brown’s own paintings are the biggest, brightest things here and their weirdness will have you gawping. His new painting The Hoi Polloi is a baroque portrait of someone of indeterminate gender with a blue face, huge ruby lips, and a fantastically creamy, riverine flow of orange curly locks. His point appears to be that no one is ordinary. But ascribing meaning to his imaginatively deranged art is a mug’s game.What fuels this art is art itself and in this erudite, ecstatic private museum art speaks to art across time. Brown has a penchant for the mannered, the odd, the lovely-ugly. This includes an engraving from 1586 by Hendrick Goltzius of a huge near-naked man on a small fat horse, the Roman hero Titus Manlius Torquatus. It is a florid, late Renaissance exercise in subjective excess. Nearby is Brown’s own 2024 painting When the Satellite Sings, where a lifesize nude male sits in a rustic setting, his skin a mass of decorative red and gold flourishes like festering wallpaper. This nude room also includes a row of insidious erotic phantasms by the German surrealist Hans Bellmer – four drawings and a painting, each an intense shot of psychic mayhem with tangled limbs and bulbous buttocks a go-go.Other artists are resurrected from the byways of art history. Austin Osman Spare, born in 1886, was a belated art nouveau symbolist who was rediscovered by the surrealists and is rediscovered again by Brown. Spare looks back at you piercingly from an occult void in his 1911 Self-Portrait. In a later work Man from the Meat Market with Bow-Tie and Top Hat, he relentlessly reveals each threatening fleshy nuance. There are also four portraits by the Scottish painter Anna Zinkeisen, including a nurse with a peculiar shadow across her face.View image in fullscreenPeculiar … Anna Zinkeisen’s Portrait of a Nurse.Photograph: ® The Brown CollectionBrown proves that artists can make the best curators and the most uninhibited collectors. His collection is packed with energy, surprise and fun, but there’s a fragility to it – some of the art would not be worth a second look if it wasn’t so playfully mixed. Only one painting is truly timeless: the Infant Christ, gazing at you out of the dark, by the 18th-century Venetian genius of the rococo, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. You can just make out the face of Joseph staring weirdly at heaven as Jesus perches on his shoulder.Brown himself is the show’s star and its problem. Is he actually a good artist? I’m still not sure. His paintings are, literally, all surface, all bizarre skin and hair, not inner selves. It’s a conscious provocation. Hoi Polloi includes his 2000 work The Real Thing, a pastiche of the late Frank Auerbach in which Auerbach’s massively thick paint is turned into a flat, glassy imitation of his brushy passion. Auerbach was trying to get at real pain and real life. Brown, as his title implies, thinks art can only be about art.By insisting on the emptiness and ultimate sterility of his own work, Brown may be condemning it to impermanence. But it does dazzle and his museum is gloriously eccentric, like something a fin de siècle visionary might have concocted to Illustrate the theory of art for art’s sake. Add a cafe, and this could become a beloved London institution – even when its creator is half forgotten.Hoi Polloi is atthe Brown Collection, London, until 8 August 2026Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtPaintingDrawingSculptureExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

He remembers the movies that defined him – and working with ‘malevolent’ Michael Winner on The SentinelThu 25 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 11.13 EDTShareChris Sarandon is doing great, thanks. The veteran actor looks extremely well for his 83 years, over Zoom from his home office in Connecticut, exuding warmth and geniality. More than once in our conversation – filled with digressions, anecdotes and impersonations – he talks about how he doesn’t take anything for granted.“I occasionally do autograph conventions at Comic Cons,” he says. “And I was standing and talking to [fellow actor] Giancarlo Esposito. He said, ‘Well, how you doing?’ I said, ‘Giancarlo, look around you. There are thousands of people here just to see us and tell us they love us.’ If I said anything other than ‘I’m great’, just grab the nearest inanimate object and smack me with it.”Sarandon is long retired from acting, he says, but “I have a beautiful home, and I live in … not splendour, but I have a huge garden. That’s my profession now: podcaster and gardener.”More on the podcast later; Sarandon’s renown as an actor is built on a handful of classic movies, plus, as he’ll readily admit, a slew of middling to mediocre ones – not to mention a famous ex-wife who shares his surname. He had a golden run in the mid-80s and early 90s: teen horror Fright Night in 1985; fairytale classicThe Princess Bridein 1987; and killer doll horror Child’s Play in 1989; and in 1993, providing the speaking voice for Jack Skellington in Tim Burton’s animated favourite The Nightmare Before Christmas.View image in fullscreenChris Sarandon in Fright Night, 1985.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/AlamyThese are the roles that bring him, and his fans, to the autograph conventions. The shelves behind him are filled with memorabilia, some official, much of it fan-made. “A gentleman last weekend, in Houston, Texas, walked up to me with his teenage daughter and his wife, and they handed me a little diorama that they had been up most of the night making with all their favourite characters of mine,” he says. “There were tiny little posters of all the movies around the background. I’m thrilled. I’ll put it up right behind me.”Sarandon’s breakthrough was in a very different kind of classic movie, though: Sydney Lumet’s heist thrillerDog Day Afternoon, released 50 years ago in 1975 and based on a real-life incident just three years earlier – a Vietnam vet named John Wojtowicz (who becomes Sonny Wortzik in the movie, played by Al Pacino) held up a Brooklyn bank in what turned into a 14-hour hostage siege, which attracted a circus of police, media and onlookers – not all of them unsympathetic. Wojtowicz was married with two children but was reportedly raiding the bank to get money to pay for his lover’s gender reassignment.That was the magic of Dog Day Afternoon. We saw Sonny and Leon as human beingsSarandon played the fictionalised lover, Leon Shermer, who is brought by police to the siege scene from a psychiatric hospital (after a suicide attempt) to try to talk Pacino down. Shermer makes a memorable impression: clutching the hospital robe, hair all a mess, vulnerable yet needy, having an almost mundane lovers’ tiff with Pacino over the phone from across the street. The performance earned Sarandon a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.View image in fullscreenAs Leon Shermer in Dog Day Afternoon.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyDog Day Afternoon was one of the first Hollywood portrayals of gay and transgender characters, and to its credit, it treats their sexualities and gender identities as almost incidental. “That was the magic,” says Sarandon. “We saw these people as human beings, rather than: it’s about a gay couple, or a trans somebody. That certainly was what made it sensational for the public, but as far as we were concerned, what was important was where these two guys came from in their relationship.”Sarandon did his homework. For research, he cooked dinner one night in his apartment for four “drag queens – people who dress in drag and live their lives as women” who a gay actor friend had introduced him to. “We sat around on the floor with our spaghetti, talking. Essentially, I was interested in their backstories.” One of them told him (he adopts a southern accent): “I went to see King Kong, and I looked up atFay Wrayand said, ‘I want to beher,’” he recalls. Another, he realised, he wasn’t seeing as a male in drag but as “a very attractive young woman, to the point where I was flirting with her. That was a real lesson in the dynamic of both the physiological and the emotional dimension of what happens to somebody when, like my character Leon says in the movie, ‘I felt like I was a woman trapped in a man’s body.’”Ironically, for years after Dog Day Afternoon, Sarandon would get hit on by gay men at parties, he says. “But in a very aggressive way, because I was perceived as being ‘femme’. It didn’t disturb me in any way other than, ‘Oh my God, men can be pigs, regardless.’”View image in fullscreen‘I almost quit the business after The Sentinel’ … Sarandon.Photograph: Amir Hamja/The GuardianHe would never be cast in such a role today, he acknowledges, “and rightfully so. It should be somebody who’s more authentically aligned with the character, but I’m very proud of it.” He deplores the waytrans rights have become a political footballin the US. “I proudly wear my Pride bracelet,” he says, holding up his wrist to the camera, “because this, to me is … it’s such a travesty.”Becoming an actor seems to have been almost straightforward for Sarandon. He was born and grew up in a coal mining town in West Virginia, the son of Greek immigrants. His father came to the US in his 20s with nothing; his mother came from a Greek community in Florida. They ran a restaurant serving American cuisine, but spoke Greek at home. Later in life, he adds, his father left his mother and returned to Greece. She then moved to Los Angeles and became a nanny for Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner, then a companion to Rita Hayworth.Susan and I had unreasonable expectations about what life could be likeA college teacher persuaded him to try acting, and despite his initial reluctance, it became his ticket out of West Virginia – first, to the Catholic University of America, in Washington DC, where he did a master’s in theatre studies, and met his first wife, Susan. Then, via regional theatre, to New York, after a director suggested he audition for an agency. “I needed a scene partner, and so Susan read scenes with me, and we sang a couple of songs, I played the guitar, and they signed us both on the spot. Susan was still in college at this point.”They married in 1967. He was 24 and she was 20. By the time Dog Day Afternoon came out, though, they had already separated. “We were both really young,” he explains. “I think we had, as everyone does, unreasonable expectations about what life could be like, and nor did we haveanyidea of what would happen to both of us in terms of our careers and our personal lives.” The separation was not acrimonious, he says. “In fact, we used the same lawyer for our divorce, but her life and my life just diverged.”After they divorced in 1979, Susan had relationships with Louis Malle, David Bowie and Tim Robbins, among others. Chris married model Lisa Ann Cooper in 1980, and they had two daughters and a son before divorcing in 1989. He now lives with his third wife, actor Joanna Gleason, whom he married in 1994.View image in fullscreenIn Lipstick, 1976.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyAfter Dog Day Afternoon, Sarandon had options: he was young, good-looking and Oscar-nominated – prime romantic lead material, you might have thought. But he didn’t go down that route. “Those are always the most boring roles,always,” he says. He much prefers the bad guys. “They do nasty things, and the audience can go, ‘Ooh, I wish I could do that.’” He may have taken it too far with his next role: in the 1976 movie Lipstick, he played Mariel Hemingway’s music teacher, who one day rapes her older sister, played by Hemingway’s real-life model sister Margaux. Lipstick was not a success (it killed Margaux’s acting career but launched Mariel’s). Its protracted rape scene, in particular, was criticised for being exploitative and voyeuristic. “But it was meant to be uncomfortable,” Sarandon says.His next film fared little better: sub-Exorcist horror The Sentinel, directed by Michael Winner. “Michael Winner,” he groans. “Don’t get me started. I almost quit the business after that movie.” Sarandon found the British director to be unpleasant, even “malevolent” on set, he says. And again, the product was a flop. “That was one of those decisions when one thinks, ‘Oh, my name’s above the title and I’m being offered a ridiculous amount of money. And why not play a leading man?’ So what if, halfway through the movie, my face cracks and I’ve become a demon? Or whatever the plot was – I’ve repressed it at this point.”View image in fullscreenWith Christopher Guest in The Princess Bride, 1987.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/AlamyThe horror genre became his friend in the 80s, though: he found the right balance between bad guy and nice guy. In Fright Night, he is the vampire next door and every teenage boy’s nightmare: a sophisticated older man who seduces his girlfriend. But the movie is at heart a witty homage to classic horror cinema (writer director Tom Holland went on to cast him in Child’s Play). It was a similar story with The Princess Bride, a smart, affectionate spin on the classic fairytale fantasy, with Sarandon as the almost likable evil Prince Humperdinck.He has particularly fond memories of Bride: improvising puns with Christopher Guest; introducing his young daughters to the legendaryAndré the Giant(they ran away in terror. André said to him: “Either they run towards me or they run away from me”); director Rob Reiner and the cast singing doo-wop tunes on the set. Shooting in Sheffield, “the food was not great, so we did a lot of barbecuing.

There’s no sex in it, there’s very little violence, and its moral lesson is acceptable to just about everybody. But at the same time, it allows you to be both cynical and romantic.” It contains what’s billed as “the most passionate, most pure” kiss in history, he says, but also includes the line: “Life is pain … anyone who says differently is selling something.”View image in fullscreenWith Catherine Hicks in Child’s Play, 1989.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyLife certainly became more painful for Sarandon from the mid-90s onwards. After The Nightmare Before Christmas, his career seemed to drop off, with guest roles in TV series (he’s playeda lotof doctors), stage roles, minor movie roles, smaller independent films. “I call them mortgage movies,” he says. “I did a bunch of them, some of which I believed in, some I didn’t. Gotta work, gotta pay the rent.”Sarandon went through “a major financial reversal” in the late 80s. “I invested money with a guy who defrauded me. I bought into a number of brownstone buildings in Manhattan when I was doing well, and the guy ended up being a fraud, and because I had signed all of the mortgages with this guy, I became as liable as he was, not criminally, but financially. So I lost everything. I’d been saving money all through my career for my old age, and I had to liquidate it.”It was the worst time of his life, he says. He was broke, his marriage to Cooper was falling apart. Soon after, he landed a role in a Broadway musical that turned out to be a disaster: Nick & Nora, based on Dashiell Hammett’s The Thin Man, which was “just killed by the critics”. It closed after nine performances. One good thing came out of it, though: he met Gleason, who was also in the cast. Soon after, both penniless, they moved to Los Angeles, started working again and got married. “That was the beginning of my third life,” he says. “And now here I am.”View image in fullscreen‘That’s my profession now: podcaster and gardener’ … Sarandon at home.Photograph: Amir Hamja/The GuardianDuring the Covid lockdown he decided to start a food podcast,Cooking By Heart, in which he interviews guests about their lives and culinary memories. The roster has included chefs, writers and actors, includingCary Elwes, Stockard Channing,Rosanna ArquetteandBrad Dourif. One day, he got a message on his Instagram from Susan. “She said, ‘Hi, your podcast looks great. Let’s do one.’” So she came to Connecticut and recorded an episode on stage with him. It was the first time they had seen each other in “maybe 15, 20 years” he says. “It really wasn’t so much an interview as it was, ‘Let’s talk about what’s been going on in our lives.’”Al Pacino on Dog Day Afternoon at 50: ‘It plays more today than it even did then’Read moreIn the podcast, Susan is very kind about him: “When I met Chris, I thought, and correctly so, that he knew everything, because he took me to black-and-white movies and introduced me to literature and basically saved my life, actually, with his kindness.” Reconnecting with her was heartening, he says. “We’re in the last quarter of our lives, and we’ve gotten back together in terms of our friendship. Now we’re close friends again.”The acting has pretty much dried up – “I get offered stuff occasionally, most of which I turn down because it’s not very interesting” – but he’s fine with that, he says. “Honestly, I don’t have the fire in my belly any more. There was a time early in my career where I was on fire, and I was thrilled to be doing what I was doing. I set out to have a career, I didn’t set out to be famous, and so my goals were fulfilled, really, sort of midway through.”After that he was happy to be a “multidisciplinary” kind of actor. “I did it for a long time, and I was able to support myself – except for that disastrous three or four years when things were bleak. But I came out of it, and I did fine. I’m a lucky guy.”Explore more on these topicsFilmSusan SarandonPodcastingPodcastsThe Princess BrideinterviewsShareReuse this content"

With conductor, director, and both leads all making their ENO debuts, the feel is fresh and fun in a production set in a contemporary world but with moments of magic – plus white mice, a pumpkin, a ghost and even a glass slipper, even if Rossini’s version of the story involves matching bracelets.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAt the time of its premiere in Rome in 1817, you were not allowed to show bare ankles on stageView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenRossini’s version has matching bracelets instead of a glass slipper (but the latter does make an appearance in this production)Conductor Yi-Chen Lin explains: “At the time of its premiere in Rome in 1817, you were not allowed to show bare ankles on stage.” So, to avoid falling foul of the censors, the glass slipper was swapped for matching bracelets. Nor is there a fairy godmother – instead there’s Alidoro, the Prince’s tutor; while Don Magnifico, Cinderella’s stepfather, is the selfish and neglectful parent who mistreats his stepdaughter. Her late mother is present in the house, as a ghost, as well as children in playful mice costumes who oversee the action and mastermind the scene changes.View image in fullscreenDon Ramiro (Prince Charming) played by tenor Aaron Godfrey-Mayes, surrounded by the all-male chorus“Our production is set in the here and now – more or less. But we’ve created some story strands that allow period things or elements of mystery to come in. And there’s nods to the classic Cinderella story as well as the Disney version,” says director Julia Burbach.Our Cinderella has more dignity, as well as wit and resilienceView image in fullscreenStepsisters Clorinda (Isabelle Peters) and Tisbe (Grace Durham)And the stepsisters? Here they’re neither ugly nor even particularly wicked. “The way we play it, their dad is not only neglecting Cenerentola but them too,” says Burbach. “The sisters are needy. They want to be seen, to be validated. They are interested in superficial values and their personal taste is a little bitextra, but we can understand why that might have happened!” Cinderella, too, is not quite the passive and fragile heroine of most versions of the tale. “I like how in our production Julia gives her more dignity, as well as wit and resilience,” says Deepa Johnny, who sings Angelina (AKA Cinderella/Cenerentola) . “It’s a fresher take on the character.”View image in fullscreenSimon Bailey (facing), who plays the stepfather Don MagnificoAnd if you’re looking for men in drag – a feature of most versions of the ballet and every panto take on the fairytale – there’s that too, courtesy of the ENO chorus. “Rossini’s opera features a male-only chorus,” says Burbach. “Essentially what they sing is always about nagging the prince – ‘choose a princess, you’ve got to get married, time is passing, what are you doing?’” she says. “I thought, OK, so who would that be in a contemporary realistic context? We’ve got to find a solution for that. And so rather than having a bunch of men in suits we made them an ancestral line of royalty through the centuries, which makes sense of the text and of course allows us to have fun and bring in some period costumes, with the chorus dressed as kings – and queens – through the ages.”View image in fullscreen“I wanted the chorus to be important and have individual roles,” she adds. “The chorus are such a vital part of ENO’s story.”View image in fullscreenENO has endured a turbulent few years with major funding cuts, staff losses and the threat of closure of its London base. This season is a reduced one but features 12 productions and concerts across London and Greater Manchester; this is the first of five brand new productions. The last time ENO performed La Cenerentola was more than 40 years ago. As with all of their productions, this will be sung in English, in a new translation by Christopher Cowell. Many of the singers have sung the opera before in its original Italian: getting their heads – and mouths – around the English, with different vowel sounds and shapes, brings lots of challenges.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenYou have to sing Rossini with absolute effortlessness, as if it’s just flowing out of youView image in fullscreenDirector Julia BurbachView image in fullscreen“The translation is very clever,” says Simon Bailey, who sings Don Magnifico, the stepfather. “There’s lots of bits in the original Italian which are quite boring – and which Chris has improved!” For instance there’s one passage where I tell Cenerentola to go to her room and dust (“Va’ in camera, va’ in camera / La polvere a spazzar”) which is repeated several times. In our English version it’s become “Go fetch a broom and sweep the room / then mop the floor and paint the door / take out the bin and buy some gin / don’t stand there in a trance when I say dance, you dance. You’ve scores of household chores, don’t stand there in a trance.”View image in fullscreenIt’s the first time Yi-Chen Lin has conducted the work in English – as well as the first time she has worked in the UK. She’s from Vienna and first conducted Rossini in the composer’s birthplace, Pesaro. “I have a particular affinity for Rossini’s music,” she says. “I love its lightness and wit and the magic that happens every time you play his music – even if it’s just an overture in a concert – you will see the musicians and the audience smiling!”View image in fullscreenConductor Yi-Chen Lin“He is a genius of melodic invention,” she adds. “And there are moments of heart-stopping beauty.” Deepa Johnny loves the joy that “flows through the music”. “Rossini is my bread and butter,” she laughs. “He’s definitely one of the more technically challenging composers to sing – there has to be absolute precision in every single coloratura, you have to sing with complete effortlessness, as if it’s just flowing out of you.”View image in fullscreenShe finds it easy to connect with the vocalism and gymnastics, she says - “I used to train in Carnatic music, Indian classical singing, which has a lot of very fast-moving notes in ragas. So I feel like my throat is just used to moving very fast!”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAaron Godfrey-Mayes is the production’s Prince Charming. “It’s hard to live up to that title, but I’m doing my best!” Like Deepa, this is his debut at ENO. “I’m the first classical singer in my family, my brother’s actually a heavy metal musician so we couldn’t be more different! But they’re all delighted. And yes they’ll be coming here to watch me.”View image in fullscreenAs a director, says Burbach, there’s a dance you have to do, “between the very rigorous, meticulous planning that – you can’t imagine – goes on for months and months, and then in the moment you also need to be very flexible and adaptable, and always readjust and also allow for challenges to be overcome in different ways.“But this is the joy of live theatre and of being in a room and working with other people.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen“It’s an old story,” says Godfrey-Mayes, “but it’s really one about coming of age and so poignant and relatable.” “This kind of comedy is a wonderful thing,” says Burbach. “It’s a little bit of a satire and it’s a little bit over the top, but at the same time, its kernel is about the sort of problems that everybody has. How to deal with your insecurities, how to be comfortable in your skin. Basically, who am I and who do I want to be?”View image in fullscreenCinderella (La Cenerentola) is at the London Coliseum from Saturday to 14 OctoberExplore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayClassical musicOperaPhotographyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But for those treading the boards of London’sWest Endthis weekend, there is a new peril: rowdy, smartphone-wielding audiences.From heckling and screaming to livestreaming and even copulating during shows, theatres have recently beenfaced with rising levels of disruptive behaviour.The problem is so grave that theatres are being urged to limit how much alcohol is served to audiences, after a survey revealed that more than three-quarters of ushers have experienced violence, aggression or harassment from theatregoers in the past year.The union Bectu, which published the statistics, said it had identified a “shocking scale of poor audience behaviour” and partly laid the blame on “at-seat alcohol”.The survey collected responses from more than 5,500 creative workers. Of those working in theatre and live events (1,051), about a third (31%) said they had personally experienced antisocial behaviour, violence, aggression or harassment in the past year, including 29% working in theatres specifically.The union said front of house staff were bearing the brunt, with 77% saying they had experienced such bad behaviour in the past year.Craig McLachlan withdraws from Cluedo production after backlash over castingRead moreMeanwhile, a majority of respondents across front of house, technical, backstage and admin roles said things had got worse over the last five years. The survey showed that 71% of theatre workers were more likely to say this (compared with 48% working in live events).Philippa Childs, the head of Bectu, said: “This summer, hundreds of thousands of people will have been or be heading to the theatre or to live events, and most will have a great time. Unfortunately, our research shows that increasing numbers of them will behave badly, treating staff like dirt and subjecting them to unacceptable abuse.”The figures come two years after the union revealed how front-of-house staffhad experienced racial slurs, public urination and physical assaults,with half considering leaving the industry as a result.At the time, Bectu launched its Safer Theatres Charter, calling on venue management to take a zero-tolerance approach to antisocial behaviour.Childs said it was “doubly disappointing” that “very little seems to have changed” in the intervening time. “Across the country people are facing regular aggression and abuse simply for carrying out their jobs. This is wholly unacceptable and we urge venues and industry bodies to commit to working with us to tackle this endemic issue.“Everyone has the right to a safe and respectful workplace and with the sector facing a chronic skills shortage our findings should sound alarm bells. We are calling on theatres to have a zero-tolerance approach to bad behaviour and ensure security is sufficient to deal with the problem.”She added: “The advent of at-seat alcohol may also be playing a part and we urge theatres to look at whether a reasonable limit on these sales would have an impact so that people can continue to have a good time without things going too far.”More than half of RSC staff urged to apply for voluntary redundancyRead moreAudience behaviour at live events particularlyworsened in the years after Covid. Writing in the Guardian,the comedian Dani Johns saidthat after the lockdown restrictions lifted and live audiences returned to clubs, there had been an uptick in the amount of abuse and harassment she received.TheWest End actor Marisha Wallace said: “I was in Dreamgirls and there would be fights in the audience. It was wild. It happened so often that they had to get more security and put extra signs up that said: ‘Don’t sing, don’t dance.’”More serious incidents have included police being called to Curve in Leicester in 2023, following reports that a member of staff had been assaulted.The same year, a Manchester performance of The Bodyguard was unable to continue after staff at the Palace theatre, who were attempting to quieten an audience member singing loudly, were greeted with “unprecedented levels of violence”. Police were also called then.Other incidents of disruptive behaviour occurred during performances ofBat Out of HellandThe Drifters Girlin London, as well asJersey Boysin Edinburgh. Meanwhile theRoyal Opera House handed a lifetime banto someone who heckled a child singer, and the newsletterPopbitchand thecomedian Tom Houghtonhave each reported couples having sex during performancesExplore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndnewsShareReuse this content"

That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.”It accusesthe pledge circulated by Film Workers for Palestineand signed by stars including Emma Stone, Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman and Mark Ruffalo of being not “an act of conscience” but rather “a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art. To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective and a form of collective punishment.”Israel’s culture minister threatens national film awards after Palestinian story takes top prizeRead moreThe open letter makes the point that much of the Israeli film and TV industry are “often the loudest critics of government policy” – and frequently penalised by them for this. Last week, the winner of Israel’s own academy awards, The Sea – about a Palestinian boy who risks death to go to the beach in Tel Aviv – was submitted as the country’s entry to the Oscars. This led to the Israeli sports and culture minister vowing to cut funding from the awards.“When artists boycott fellow artists based solely on their country of origin, it is blatant discrimination and a betrayal of our role as storytellers,” added Messing in a statement.The initial pledge was published on 8 September and was signed by some 1,200 professionals – rising overnight to 4,000 and now standing at around 5,000 – who vowed not to work with Israeli film institutions they say are “implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people”.Israeli film industry calls boycott pledge ‘deeply troubling’Read more“As film-makers, actors, film industry workers and institutions, we recognise the power of cinema to shape perceptions,”the pledgereads. “In this urgent moment of crisis, where many of our governments are enabling the carnage in Gaza, we must do everything we can to address complicity in that unrelenting horror.”In the immediate wake of the pledge, many in the Israeli industry expressed considerable disquiet about the boycott, with representatives from the country’s producing, directing, screenwriting and documentary divisions saying the move was misguided and would only “deepen the darkness”.The following week, studio Paramount also condemned the boycott in a statement which read: “Silencing individual creative artists based on their nationality does not promote better understanding or advance the cause of peace. The global entertainment industry should be encouraging artists to tell their stories and share their ideas with audiences throughout the world. We need more engagement and communication – not less.”The full open letterTo our fellow artists and the global film community,We know the power of film. We know the power of story. That is why we cannot stay silent when a story is turned into a weapon, when lies are dressed up as justice, and when artists are misled into amplifying antisemitic propaganda.The pledge circulated under the banner of “Film Workers for Palestine” is not an act of conscience. It is a document of misinformation that advocates for arbitrary censorship and the erasure of art.To censor the very voices trying to find common ground and express their humanity, is wrong, ineffective, and a form of collective punishment.Israel’s film industry includes groundbreaking, celebratory, and critical projects about Palestinians and Jews, which many of you have lauded and celebrated. Israel’s film community is restless, argumentative, and independent, where directors challenge ministers and many of the very festivals you target, consistentlyprogramdissent.Israel’s entertainment industry is a vibrant hub of collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian artists and creatives, who work together every single day to tell complex stories that entertain and inform both communities and the world. Israeli film institutions are not government entities. They are often the loudest critics of government policy.The pledge uses nebulous terms like“implicating” and“complicity.” Who will decide which Israeli film-makers and film institutions are“complicit”? A McCarthyist committee with blacklists? Or is“complicity” just a pretextto boycott all Israelis and Zionists– 95% of the world’s Jewish population–no matter what they create or believe?History warns us. Censorship has been used to silence film-makers before: Nazi Germany’s propaganda machine, Soviet censorship, and even Hollywood’s own blacklists. Every time it was dressed up as virtue. And every time it was oppression. Every time, its targets expanded.We know that many of you have good intentions and believe you are standing for peace. But your names are being weaponised and tied to lies and discrimination. This pledge erases dissenting Israeli voices, legitimises falsehoods, and shields Hamas from blame.If you want peace, call for the immediate release of the remaining hostages. Support film-makers who create dialogue across communities. Stand against Hamas.Let art speak the whole truth.We call on all our colleagues in the entertainment industry to reject this discriminatory and antisemitic boycott call that only adds another roadblock on the path to peace.Explore more on these topicsFilmIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his ‘talent’ was never there.”Stephen Colbert on Jimmy Kimmel: ‘To know him well is to admire him immensely’Read more“You can’t believe they gave me my job back?” Kimmel mused. “I can’t believe we gave youyourjob back.”Trump continued: “I think we’re going to testABCout on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative. A true bunch of losers!”Kimmel fired back: “There’s the threat again, this time straight from FCC-biscuit’s mouth. OnlyDonald Trumpwould try to prove he wasn’t threatening ABC by threatening ABC.“You almost have to feel sorry for the people who work for him, who try to clean up the messes,” he added. “They go to all these lengths to say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t coercion! The president was just musing!’ And then the second Trump is alone, he sits on the toilet, he gets his grubby little thumbs on his phone, and he immediately blows their excuses to smithereens, and says it was ratings that got me fired.”Trump ended his Truth Social rant with: “LetJimmy Kimmelrot in his bad ratings.”“And he does know bad ratings. He has some of the worst ratings any president has ever had,” Kimmel laughed, referring to Trump’s record-lowpollnumbers. “So on behalf of all of us, welcome to the crappy ratings club, Mr President.”Late in the monologue, Kimmel offered an explanation to his critics for his continued focus on Trump. “I talk about Trump more than anything because he’s a bully. I don’t like bullies – I played the clarinet in high school.” And Trump, he said, was “an old-fashioned, 80s movie-style bully”.Backing Trump was like “rooting for Biff from Back to the Future”, he added, referring to the villain of the 1985 film. “I don’t know about you, I’m with Marty McFly.”Stephen ColbertStephen Colbertopened Wednesday’s Late Show monologue in a good mood, “because last night our good friend Jimmy Kimmel returned to television”.“Jimmy spoke beautifully about free speech and unity,” he said. “He made great jokes, showed his deep emotions, got huge ratings.”But “that wasn’t the only victory for free speech yesterday”, as astatuedepicting Trump and Jeffrey Epstein skipping and holding hands was placed on the National Mall. “It’s a lovely piece, but I’ve gotta say, not very realistic – Trump can’t stand on one leg, not with those cankles!” Colbert joked. “It would be like trying to balance on a sock full of overripe honeydew.”The controversial statue was put up by artists issued an official permit to “demonstrate freedom of speech and artistic expression using political imagery” by theNational Park Service. “Good for you, National Park Service,” said Colbert, “and thank you for protecting free speech for almost 24 hours”, because despite the permit allowing the sculpture to stand until Sunday, park police removed it on Wednesday morning.In response, Colbert pretended to navigate the cancellation of Disney+ on his phone – “worked last time!”Park police said the statue was not “in compliance” with the permit, though it did not specify how. “I think we know how it violated the permit,” said Colbert. “We’ve all seen those signs in the national parks: ‘Leave no trace … of the Epstein files.’”Seth MeyersAnd on Late Night,Seth Meyersfocused onTrump’s visit to the UNin New York this week. “It’s easy to forget because so much has happened, but when Trump was running for president last year, he was adamant he was going to bring peace to the world,” he reminded viewers before several clips of Trump making such claims as “I will end the chaos in the Middle East quickly” or end the war in Ukraine “in no longer than one day”.“In fairness, he said it would take him one day, he didn’t saywhichday,” Meyers laughed. But “as a general rule, you should always be skeptical when someone tells you they can solve any problem in one day”.Stephen Colbert on Kimmel’s return: ‘Our long, national, late-nightmare is over’Read moreBut Trump didn’t focus on any of that at hisUN address. Instead, he was thrown off by abroken escalator, which shut down as soon as he stepped on to it. On Fox News, Karoline Leavitt accused the UN of trying to “sabotage” him with the frozen escalator and teleprompter.“Man, you know I’ve heard a lot about these globalists over the years, but I didn’t realize their MO was to just burn you with soft pranks,” Meyers laughed.“Teleprompter down, escalator off. When the president was talking, someone tied his shoelaces together! Are they a shadowy cabal or Kevin from Home Alone?”On Wednesday evening, Trump took to Truth Social to name the escalator episode among three “very sinister events” that took place during his UN visit. He claimed that Melania avoided a “disaster” by not falling “forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first”. He then called for the arrest of the person responsible for the frozen escalator.A spokesperson for the UN previously blamed Trump’s videographer for the incident, suggesting that they may have “inadvertently triggered” a built-in safety function while proceeding backward up the escalator to film his arrival.Meyers had to laugh: “Oh, hey, look at that – they solved the conflict in one day! How about that?”Explore more on these topicsLate-night TV roundupJimmy KimmelStephen ColbertSeth MeyersTV comedyComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To come back to our earlier thing – I just don’t think these things are either/or. I think it’s my deepest wish that I hope people who don’t agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don’t necessarily share the same opinion with.”Watson went on to say she believed that a dialogue over the debate with Rowling was not permitted, adding: “I think the thing I’m most upset about is that a conversation was never made possible.”View image in fullscreenTom Felton, Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Matthew Lewis at the New York premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, 2011.Photograph: Stephen Lovekin/Getty ImagesThe three lead actors in the movie series reunited for the 20th anniversary of the first film in 2021, but Rowling was absent. She serves as executive producer on HBO’s upcoming TV adaptation.Speaking to Shetty, Watson reflected with affection on her years working on Harry Potter, saying that it was sufficiently collegiate as to have given her unrealistic expectations about future jobs.Emma Watson explains long break from acting: ‘I do not miss selling things’Read more“I was coming to those sets with an expectation that I think I had developed on Harry Potter, which was that we were, the people I worked with were going to be my family, and that we were going to be lifelong friends.“I came to work looking for friendship, and that was a very painful experience for me. Outside of Harry Potter and in Hollywood, like, bone-breaking, really painful … because most people don’t come to those environments looking for friendships. They’re looking for, this is my chance, this is my role, this is what I want out of it. I’m focused, this is my job, this is my career. Like, let’s go. And I was not of that mindset. And so I found the rejection really painful.“I think it was so unusual to make a set of films for 12 years and we were a community. Like we, we really were. And so I took that as an expectation into my other workplaces. And I just got my ass kicked. I really did. It, yeah, it broke me.”Although not officially retired from acting, Watson, 35, is currently studying for a postgraduate degree in creative writing at Oxford University. In an interview with Hollywood Authentic earlier this week, she expanded on her hiatus from the profession, saying that while she enjoyed performing, “I do not miss selling things. I found that to be quite soul-destroying. But I do very much miss using my skill-set, and I very much miss the art. I just found I got to do so little of the bit that I actually enjoyed.”Explore more on these topicsFilmEmma WatsonJK RowlingHarry PotternewsShareReuse this content"

Originally embarking on a career as an actor, he studied at the Actors Studio and became a contract player for Columbia Pictures, winning small roles in films such as Psych Out, Drive, He Said and The Last Movie, and TV shows such as Gidget and The Flying Nun.However he swiftly found his metier in the cinema counterculture of the time. Having been brought in to edit Easy Rider, Jaglom made his directorial debut in 1971 with the offbeat fable A Safe Place, starring Tuesday Weld andJack Nicholson, in which Welles appeared as a magician. Its 1976 follow-up, Tracks, starring Dennis Hopper as a Vietnam veteran, was one of the first American films to deal with the psychological fallout from the conflict. Sitting Ducks, released in 1980, was the closest Jaglom came to a mainstream success, with the comic road movie starring Zack Norman, Jaglom’s brother Michael Emil and Jaglom’s wife Patrice Townsend.Jaglom remained resolutely independent, financing his subsequent movies outside the Hollywood system and mining his own life and family for material. He became known for his actor-centred style, with plots often revolving around film-makers or performers airing their views on life and art. Regularly turning out films every two or three years over the next four decades, Jaglom was a fixture at international film festivals; high points include his 1995 film Last Summer in the Hamptons, in which an artistic family gather at the house they are shortly to sell; Deja Vu, a 1997 romance starring Stephen Dillane and Vanessa Redgrave; and Festival in Cannes, in 2001, about a film-makers trying to raise money at the celebrated French event.In his later work, Jaglom investigated his Jewish heritage, in films such as Just 45 Minutes from Broadway in 2012, which was based on his own play about Yiddish theatre, and his final film in 2017, Train to Zakopané, again based on his own play, about the relationship between a Russian Jewish businessman and a Polish nurse.Commercial success as a film-maker largely eluded Jaglom, but his friendship with Welles resulted in what remains his most widely known contribution to popular culture.Jaglom had taped a series of conversations with Wellesover lunch in the early 1980s, whichthe latter had planned to use for an autobiography; after Welles’s death in 1985 the tapes were in storage until their rediscovery and publication in 2013 as My Lunches With Orson.Jaglom was married twice, to Patrice Townsend (between 1979 and 1983)​ and Victoria Foyt (between 1991 and 2013), both of whom worked on a number of his films.Explore more on these topicsFilmOrson WellesDrama filmsComedy filmsJack NicholsonComedynewsShareReuse this content"

They are so fragile that they are rarely brought out of careful storage and may not be seen again for a while.The show is partly a thank you to members of the public who donated more than £100,000 in a week, allowing the museum to bid for another recently discovered Turner painting of Bristol,The Rising Squall. Despite the efforts of Bristol art lovers and the museum, an anonymous UK private collector came in with a higher sum, scuppering the“bring Turner home”effort.View image in fullscreenThe Bristol museum was outbid by a private collector for Turner’s The Rising Squall.Photograph: Malcolm Park/AlamyOn display in the show are four watercolours painted by Turner during his first visit to the city at the end of the 18th century when he was 16. They reveal his growing skill in architectural detail, natural observation and dramatic composition.Julia Carver, a curator of art at the museum, said Turner came toBristolon holiday in 1791 and stayed with a family friend, John Narraway, a glue maker and fell monger (a dealer in animal skins). “They called him prince of the rocks because he spent so much time at the gorge,” Carver said.His jaunts in and around the gorge showed Turner’s commitment to getting into the heart of the landscapes he painted, and throw forward to the story (whichmay be apocryphal) that in later life he bound himself to a ship’s mast to paint Snow Storm: Steam-Boat Off a Harbour’s Mouth.View image in fullscreenAvon Gorge and Bristol Hotwell by JMW Turner.Photograph: c/o Bristol Museum & Art GalleryOne of the paintings in the show is called The Mouth of the Avon, Near Bristol, Seen from Cliffs Below Clifton. The view towards the sea is framed by the rocky walls of aspectacular caveunderneath the site of the Clifton Observatory. “It’s a lovely, dramatic view,” Carver said.A second painting, Avon Gorge and Bristol Hotwell, is another version of the view he painted in The Rising Squall when he returned to the city in 1792.Carver said the museum did not know who pipped them to The Rising Squall. “We would be, of course, delighted if they were interested in lending the painting to us,” she said.Philip Walker, the head of culture and creative industries at Bristol city council, said: “Bring Turner home was the most ambitious fundraising campaign we’ve ever attempted and we were overwhelmed by the support it received.

But huge characters join in to tell a wild, droll tale with the ultimate endingHannah J DaviesThu 25 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 05.02 EDTShareDressed in a khaki jumpsuit, his face red in a way that suggests recent tears, Owen Hanson describes his life behind bars. On his first day in prison, another inmate gave him a weapon – a “bonecrusher” – and told him to keep it on him at all times. “I’m some fucking surfer kid from Redondo Beach and you’re telling me I have to go to war?!” Hanson says, shakily.This is one of many moments in the first episode of Cocaine Quarterback that makes me deeply sceptical. The three-part docuseries – released under the Prime Video Sports umbrella – tells the story of a college footballer from California turned drug kingpin, but part one feels more like The Owen Hanson Story, as presented by Owen Hanson. Central to the tale is his father’s alcoholism, his parents’ divorce, and his first, faltering forays into pill-smuggling, when he rolled up a bag of steroids in Tijuana and stuffed it down the back of his underwear (“not inside the hole,” he elucidates, “[but] in the crack”). The steroids were for his own use. But soon he would be hawking them to his fellow footballers at the University of Southern California, a place conjured up here via exuberant archive footage of players flinging themselves through the air and marching bands. Before long, Hanson was dealing harder drugs – and working with one of the world’s most dangerous organised crime groups, Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel. He had, says Alex Cody Foster – the co-author of his memoir – “the hustle mindset”. More than once it is said that he could have been the CEO of a Fortune 500 company had he put his mind to it.View image in fullscreen‘No more Uggs,mijo’ …Cocaine Quarterback.Photograph: Courtesy of PrimeGladly, Cocaine Quarterback turns out to be more than just an elegy to Hanson’s business acumen. It shares much of its tonal DNA with McMillions, the wry documentary about the McDonald’s Monopoly fraud, also produced by Mark Wahlberg’s Unrealistic Ideas (director Jody McVeigh-Schultz was an editor on that series). As McMillions leaned on larger-than-life characters to tell its tale, so too does Cocaine Quarterback, and the result often feels more mockumentary than documentary. The visuals, too, are frequently droll: reconstructions show dishwashers loaded with cash rather than plates, and phone screens feature pithy messages from the cartel to Hanson. When he gets himself into a pickle in Australia and attempts to send gold bullion back to the US inside furry boots, a text pops up from his bosses: “No more Uggs,mijo.” Elsewhere, MTV Cribs-style images flash up when we learn about the time Hanson gutted his family home (it was, he says, “a dump”), transforming it into a greige mansion complete with $2,000 bottles of tequila on every surface.The main narrative driver here is Hanson’s enduring beef with a professional gambler named Robin Hood 702, who loses the money Hanson says he was supposed to be laundering for him on behalf of the cartel. Robin Hood, AKA Robert Cipriani, denies that this was ever the deal. In any case, he did take $2.5m to a casino, and left with nothing – inadvertently tipping off police and kickstarting a feud with Hanson, who describes him, charmingly, as a “cockroach”, a “maggot” and a “degenerate”. To say that Cipriani comes across as smug and flippant would be an understatement, but Hanson knew how to rile him up. Cue an eccentric private investigator who not only desecrated Cipriani’s mother’s grave, but also Photoshopped a mask-wearing, shovel-holding Hanson into a picture of said grave for extra menace.If Hanson is initially imbued with far too much glamour, the scuzzier reality of his life of crime slowly unfurls over the three episodes. As Nick Mullaly of the New South Wales police says, Hanson was “very ruthless”. Kate McClymont from the Sydney Morning Herald prefers the term “stupid idiot” when it comes to him and his money-laundering associates, who are found to have been brazenly discussing their illegal activities on the phone, not knowing that law enforcement were listening in. After lying in a police interview, Andrew McManus – a music promoter who brought the likes of Lenny Kravitz and Fleetwood Mac to Australia – declared himself “a fucking Academy Award winner!”The end result is a series that’s more entertaining than it has any right to be, and one that lurches firmly back into cautionary tale territory as we learn more about how Hanson was eventually caught (he was sentenced to 21 years in prison in 2017). Really, the whole thing has a lot less to do with sport than it initially claims to; while many of Hanson’s friends ended up in the NFL, he was nowhere near going pro. But as an entry point to a zany true crime tale, it really is a touchdown.Cocaine Quarterback is on Prime Video now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s hard to look away from any show where evil grownups get their comeuppance …Lucy ManganThu 25 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 02.01 EDTShareOh happy day, when we were divided from America, as that insightful old veggie burger George Bernard Shaw had it, only by a common language. These days, there’s rather a lot more to contend with. One that may still be swimming under your radar – or perhaps just obscured by the massive orange flares going off every 30 seconds – is the multibillion dollar “troubled teen industry”. From sea to shining sea, the US is filled with privately run “therapeutic” institutions that promise to rehabilitate “difficult” teenagers and turn them into civilised members of society. They are often transported there by “teen escort services”, who come for the unsuspecting adolescents in the middle of the night and remove them against their – though not their parents’ – will from the family home. “But that’s tantamount to kidnap!” you may think, in your silly British way. And that is why they fought to become independent of us and our lily-livers all those years ago.That is the background against which Mae Martin, standup comedian and writer of the immaculate comedy,Feel Good, has created the eight part mystery drama Wayward. (Martin is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. Their character in Wayward, a cop called Alex Dempsey, is a trans man. Martin’s mesmeric presence, comic timing and occasional air of possession by a baffled duckling endure).View image in fullscreenHas the air of being possessed by a baffled duckling … Mae Martin as Alex Dempsey in Wayward.Photograph: Michael Gibson/NetflixWayward is set in 2003 – partly, I suspect, to avoid the many problems the setup would face if these teens had access to smartphones, and partly to add to the excellently eerie vibe. There is nothing stranger than the recent past. Alex and his pregnant wife, Laura (Sarah Gadon), move to Tall Pines, Vermont – the latter’s bucolic home town – for a fresh start, after the former was involved in a bad shooting on the job. I don’t know how often it works out in real life for Americans who return to their bucolic home towns for a fresh start, but in television the percentage must be in the low single figures. So it proves for our sweet young couple.The town is host to the Tall Pines Academy, a centre run by the deeply odd, bordering on sinister, Evelyn Wade, utterly magnificently played byToni Collette, who manages to combine terrifying understatement with a Grand Guignol air that is absolutely compelling. She gives a coherence to the whole show that the writing does not entirely earn. But to believe in Evelyn is to believe in everything, and you have to believe in Evelyn. It’s like your resistance has been kidnapped.When Alex becomes involved with the fate of a runaway from the academy, his investigations into the boy, as well as the townsfolk’s unquestioning acceptance of the academy’s power, fuel darker and darker suspicions. Theses suspicions are compounded by the discovery that Laura was once a pupil/inmate at the academy and that Evelyn seems to still exert an unwholesome amount of influence over her.A concurrent plotline follows two teenage best friends from Toronto – the bereaved, drug-dabbling Leila (Alyvia Alyn Lind) and the more stable Abbie (Sydney Topliffe), whose main form of rebellion seems to be being friends with Leila. It is enough for her strict parents to have her kidnapped/taken away to the academy. Leila mounts a rescue attempt and is duly incarcerated there too. The place is full of cultish argot, rituals and group counselling classes that resemble struggle sessions more than any kind of healing practice. Physical and psychological abuse is overt and hints of sexual abuse are everywhere. The hold Evelyn has over her charges – and the staff, all recruited from earlier student cohorts – borders on the unholy. Though, ultimately, Wayward is asking us to consider the power of malevolent manipulation on vulnerable people rather than seeking to delve into the occult.Wayward is stylish and hugely watchable – it’s hard for one’s inner adolescent to look away from a punchy eight-parter where so many comeuppances are delivered to horrible grownups. But it tries to do so many things that it doesn’t quite succeed in any. You can feel it trying to interrogate the troubled teen industry, the parents that use it and the profiteers that run it. It also tries to explore the nature of modern youth and the new uncharted areas that kids are required to navigate alone. Plus, it’s trying to deliver a satisfying mystery plot, infuse it with the comedy that comes as naturally to Martin as breathing and put in some emotional payoffs to stop the whole thing becoming a cartoon version of Twin Peaks. Less could have been more, but the warmth and intelligence that Martin as an actor and writer (along with others, in the latter case) brings to the endeavour means it cannot help but endear itself to the viewer. Three stars become four, and no regrets.Wayward is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewToni CollettereviewsShareReuse this content"

Emilia del Valle’s surname comes from her Chilean father, an aristocrat who seduced her mother when she was a novice nun and left before their child was born. Emilia owes her fiercely independent spirit to her liberal-minded stepfather Francisco Claro, whom she calls Papo, who encourages his stepdaughter to think for herself.In her late teens, Emilia writes a series of successful pulp fiction novels under the male pen name Brandon J Price. By the age of 23, she is a columnist at San Francisco’s Daily Examiner; still writing as a man, she longs to do more serious work. Eventually, she is commissioned to travel to Chile, where the father she has never met lives, to cover the war. She is accompanied by a seasoned war reporter, Eric Whelan, with whom she begins a relationship, though the pair part company as they each go in search of their own stories.Told from Emilia’s perspective, the novel is narrated by the Dominican actor Coral Peña, her reading underscoring our heroine’s single-mindedness in overcoming the strictures imposed on 19th-century women. That the romantic subplot doesn’t follow the usual trajectory is shown in the appearance of another narrator, Johnathan McClain, who reads a single chapter written from the perspective of Whelan.

He muttered ominous things about the Venice wobble and the Venice curse. I went anyway and I have to say he had a point. It was autumn and there was something deeply uncanny about the city: fog-bound canals, labyrinthine alleyways, a general sense of decay. If my minibreak had belonged to a literary genre, it wouldn’t have been romance so much as cosmic horror.Fiction, of course, should have prepared me. Couples have been coming unstuck in Venice since Othello and Desdemona. There are the Baxters in Daphne du Maurier’s short story Don’t Look Now, the basis for Nicolas Roeg’s unforgettably creepy film; Mary and Colin in The Comfort of Strangers by Ian McEwan – the city’s not named in the novel, but it’s clearly the setting. And while the love affair in Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice exists only in Von Aschenbach’s mind, the city is still his undoing. To Von Aschenbach and the others, we can now add the name of the unfortunate Evelyn Dolman, the protagonist ofJohn Banville’s new novel, Venetian Vespers. Evelyn is a hack writer from England who has recently married an American heiress called Laura Rensselaer. Their plans to honeymoon in Venice have been delayed by the unexpected death of Laura’s father, the industrialist T Willard Rensselaer. In the wintry early months of 1900, they finally arrive and take up residence in the sinister Palazzo Dioscuri, a stone’s throw from St Mark’s. Dioscuri means the Twins – Castor and Pollux – and it will be a pair of twins who set in motion Evelyn’s inexorable but unforeseeable downfall.From the outset, Evelyn, who narrates the novel, warns us to expect something disquieting. Part of the initial fun is trying to figure out where we are heading. There are elements of Henry James in the story’s setup – the period, the social background of its principal characters – but Banville has set his course for something darker. The bloody history of the Palazzo Dioscuri and its denizens – patrician owner, taciturn servant, saucy serving wench – suggest we’re in gothic territory, and the book is constantly teasing us with other possibilities. A cameo of a hooded woman in St Mark’s nods towards Du Maurier; a recent plague recalls Von Aschenbach. There are surreal twists, hints of madness and the supernatural; unsettling sexual encounters.There are elements of Henry James in the story’s setup, but Banville has set his course for something darkerOver an illustrious literary career, Banville has been compared to James, Proust and Beckett. The received wisdom about his novels is that he’s a master of sentences, mood and allusion, but not much interested in plot. That’s not the case here. Evelyn Dolman resembles some of Banville’s other narrators in his unreliability and his love of winding syntax, but the story he tells is expertly put together. The events of the novel are compressed into a matter of days. Each vividly evoked moment leads on to the next with a deepening sense of intrigue. While the prose is dense, the action behind it is so clearly conceived that you feel as though you’re watching it unfold before you. The geography of the city, the layout of the Palazzo Dioscuri, the passing of time – it’s all conveyed with a cinematic intensity.Banville milks the brooding atmosphere of the wintry city and while telling us explicitly that we’re headed towards a troubling denouement, he keeps us uncertain about what form it will ultimately take. I didn’t guess the ending – and I won’t spoil it for you – but it comes together very satisfyingly.I mentioned that, like other Banville narrators, Evelyn is not only tricky, he has an orotund prose style. Not for him the simple declarative sentence; he likes a hypotactic Jamesian pile-up of adjectives and adverbs, with careful qualifications and a sprinkling of abstract nouns. To an extent, I get that Evelyn’s style is his character: splenetic, self-regarding, full of complaint. His monologue, packed with repetition and the formulations of a hack writer, is also a disguise that conceals him from us and from himself. It’s clear also that we’re not meant to like him. But in another way, I don’t get it at all.As I grow older, I watch the reading of so-called literary novels becoming a niche interest. The reasons for this are many and complicated, but I’m constantly looking for books that will win back wavering or lapsed readers, and so I find myself frustrated by this novel’s aesthetic choices. When you have a story and a setting this strong and resonant, it feels perverse to fence it off from an audience with prose that is deliberately prolix and redundant. At times, the pastiche is skilful and contributes to the sense of the period, but at others you get this: “However, this was one of the instances, rare in that time of intense upset and bereavement, that I put my foot down, with a firmness that came as a surprise, not to say a shock, to all concerned in the matter, including, I suspect, myself.”I would put that sentence out of its misery after “down”. It’s far from a solitary example. Evelyn’s periphrasis and repetitions verge on the obsessive: “I would never master the geography of this impossible city, which seemed to have been designed with great and subtle care specifically to deceive and distress innocent wayfarers such as myself.” The enhancements ofgreatandsubtle,deceiveanddistressare grating and legalistic. I guess Evelyn is used to being paid by the word, but it makes him an exhausting companion. He also writes about everything with a neurotic intensity. “My brain seemed as a purblind, underground creature clawing its way clumsily upwards towards the light.” The pomposity of this contributes to a strong sense that Banville regards his hero with mockery and indifference. It’s hard, therefore, for the reader to care about him.As it stands, Venetian Vespers is a memorable and disturbing read; the frustration I felt is that, written with more economy, it could have been a gasp-inducing stiletto of a book.Venetian Vespers by John Banville is published by Faber.

The play voices its intent in one of many meta-theatrical messages: “Tonight the Artful Dodgers have taken over the Olivier.”It is a bold, brash takeover with striking optics and energised performances. But just as the Artful Dodger seems like a misplaced reference within Euripidean tragedy, so the script often sounds off-key: unfocused, tonally untextured, its knockabout comedy smothering the emotional core of the play.View image in fullscreenA barbarian-like band … Clare Perkins (Vida) and the company of Bacchae at the National Theatre.Photograph: Marc BrennerTaleghani’s version brings to the fore the fear and suspicion of “foreignness” that creates a backdrop of anxiety in the original text. Dionysos (Ukweli Roach) is denied his godly status by King Pentheus (James McArdle) and is out for revenge, along with a chorus of entranced, outsider women who turn from hunted to hunters. They still live in the mountains here but are labelled “terrorists” by the king.This barbarian-like band, with a wardrobe reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean, is led by Vida (Clare Perkins) and each of the Bacchae are given names and histories. It is a good idea to render a generic female chorus distinct, but these women end up as cliched types, their biographies listed in single line summaries and salient features comically overplayed (one is a hard-nut Scot, another touchy-feely). Dionysos looks like a rapper in a gold hoodie who might have walked off theblingy West End set of Hercules. Poor, prophesying Tireseus (Simon Startin) is an old-school ancient stranded here, as if from a different play.View image in fullscreenPolish … James McArdle as Pentheus in Bacchae.Photograph: Marc BrennerCharacters rap in verse with sentences suffixed by “fam”, “cuz” and “bitches” in a mix of regional accents includingMLE. It seems inspired by the Jamie Lloyd school of storytelling (Taleghani starred in hisscintillating rap version of Cyrano). The raps burst with verve and a speed of ideas but lack the sharpness, poetry and emotional power to make the satire soar. The humour is hit-and-miss, characters broad and clownish. There is a pun in the name of the king’s attendant, Clitus (Sam Jenkins-Shaw), and Dionysos calls himself a “cunning linguist”. Pentheus is a shouty king who transforms after disguising himself in a dress, to infiltrate the Bacchae, and speaks of the burdens of masculinity before flipping back to tyrant.This is an accessible, entertaining, new-gen Bacchae but the joshing treatment is frustrating because so much in the original play chimes for our times: the new political puritanism, the unleashed rage of women too long suppressed, and the terrible effects of vengeance and war.The mother-son story between Pentheus and Agave (Sharon Small) never wields its emotional power. Perhaps the comedy undermines it, or maybe its dramatic focus is lost among so many plot-lines. What is the point of a character called Bubull (Reuben Johnson), who Dionysos meets while disguised and imprisoned by the king? He brings a backstory that simply hangs.Rubasingham’s direction is nevertheless as polished as ever and the show has pace, with thrilling lighting by Oliver Fenwick, creating filmic effects on Robert Jones’s set of marble Athenian steps and various moving parts. Kate Prince’s movement is a highlight and it is in the interludes of dance, along with DJ Walde’s musical compositions and Ben and Max Ringham’s sound design, that the show feels at its most elemental.So, while Rubasingham’s high-risk venture does not pay off as a whole, something new, different and daring has entered this old space, and that is no bad thing.At theOlivier theatre, National Theatre, London, until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsNational TheatreTheatreIndhu RubasinghamEuripidesreviewsShareReuse this content"

In between last week’s Lysistrata and next week’s Pygmalion is The Lodger, in a version combining Marie Belloc Lowndes’ 1913 novel with Alfred Hitchcock’s 1927 film and adding its own mysteries.Shadow puppetry is used throughout, evoking luridly illustrated penny dreadfuls and silent cinema, with homages to Hitchcock’s title cards. A killer known as the Avenger is at large: the victims are fair-haired women, their murders on Tuesdays. At oneLondonboarding house – No 13, natch – a lodger (Charlie Woodward) comes under suspicion, a detective (Gabriel Lumsden) gets to work and golden-curled Daisy (Keziah Hayes) is caught between them under the gaze of a maid (Rachel Bardwell).Actor-adapter-director Jack Robertson’s production, with compelling piano composition by Sarah Spencer, has exaggerated silent-film performances from actors in black and white costumes who mouth their words. Benedict Hastings and Sadie Pepperrell’s puppetry, often for action or crowd scenes, is accompanied by dialogue off stage. The two techniques dovetail well in what is primarily a comedy with some ingenious touches. Its only real chill is ironically a diversion from the master of suspense’s film.View image in fullscreenShadow play … The Lodger.Photograph: Miranda MazzarellaHitchcock’s lodger was played by Ivor Novello with haunted eyes and a wraith-like delicacy. The character, who here retains a giveaway surname he has in the novel, is played more benevolently by Woodward. The production satirises the age’s misogyny and lust for sensation yet jarringly never grounds the violence in any sense of reality. Unlike in the film, there is no threat in the lodger’s attempt to touch Daisy’s curls nor the detective’s possessiveness.Hitchcock pulled off dazzling shots like Novello frantically pacing in his room, his soles seen from below as if the ceiling was transparent. On a fringe budget, a more achievable parallel effect to the film is actors framing their own closeups or the wispy fog lit by Brett Kasza. In the design by Rebecca Ward, a candle and vintage lamp set the mood while Daisy’s cloche hat and Clara Bow lipstick evoke the era.

Despite the show’s overly expository dialogue, Clarkston gradually gives way to an intimate story about trying to make the best of the hand you’ve been dealt.Heartstopper’s Joe Locke plays Jake, who wants his life to matter. A forcefully chipper and naive liberal arts graduate, he’s dreamed of heading west to follow the footsteps of his very distant relative, the pioneer William Clark, whose imperialist history is acknowledged if not fully wrestled with. But grounded by his Huntington’s disease, Jake has only made it as far as the nondescript city the explorer is named for. Taking night shifts at Costco, he clatters into the life of Chris (Ruaridh Mollica), whose tough, largely closeted exterior hides immense vulnerability.Mollica effortlessly breathes life into this hard-shelled character who doesn’t know how to talk to a man romantically and has never seen the ocean other than in photographs. Emerging from the night shift, his days are shadowed by his troubled mum, Trisha (played with immaculate control by Sophie Melville), an addict who manipulatively wrings discomfort from Jake’s misplaced efforts to help.View image in fullscreenImmaculate control … Sophie Melville as Trisha in Clarkston.Photograph: Marc BrennerThe script is often heavy-handed, with a backstory handed to us on a plate and little left unsaid. The staging presents limitations with necessarily perfunctory direction in the warehouse scenes, as cart-loads of cardboard boxes and cheese balls are stacked on Milla Clarke’s set. Strangely, some of the audience sit on stage with the actors, their presence adding little but trip hazards.Loneliness pervades Jack Serio’s production as each character loses what they’ve been working so hard to hold on to. But there are glimmers of hope in their nudged jokes, second attempts and the way they sit with each other at their worst moments, unsure what to say but knowing there is purpose in being there, to see what no one else has been allowed to see before.AtTrafalgar theatre, London, until 22 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndreviewsShareReuse this content"

Mark Leipacher, adapter-director of an autumn tour advertised as “prior to the West End”, has made his version self-consciously theatrical. The staging is both impressionistic – a group of “figures” watches and surrounds Ripley, usually in the guise of citizens of European cities, but also clearly the murderer and liar’s pursuing Eumenides – and postmodern. An intermittent conceit is that Ripley is playing himself in a movie based on his life, with the figures shouting “Cut!” and demanding retakes when they sense he is improvising or lying.My general feeling is that meta is often better, but it is unclear what this extra level of pretence adds to a story so deep with deceit and disguise. More effective are the lightning asides in which Ed McVey’s Ripley confides that the line he just spoke was a lie or delivers a subtext, such as “Boring!”, that his interlocutors don’t hear.View image in fullscreenSelf-consciously theatrical … Maisie Smith as Marge Sherwood.Photograph: Mark SeniorMcVey – a very plausible Prince William in The Crown – hasn’t balked at following Alain Delon, Matt Damon, John Malkovich and Andrew Scott into the shoes Ripley steals from his first victim, and finds his own space, strongly showing the pathetic within the psychopathic.As Ripley’s target and avatar, Dickie Greenleaf, Bruce Herbelin-Earle achieves the difficult task of embodying the trust fund dullard Highsmith wrote, while also suggesting why Ripley wants to take over his body and money. As in Shakespeare, the dead – also including Cary Crankson’s arrogant dramatist, Freddie – are not reliably off stage and Leipacher thus atmospherically makes duologues into four-handers, in some of which two actors play the same person. In a more conventional doubling, Christopher Bianchi is the dad of the missing Dickie and an Italian detective, misunderstanding the evidence twice. A shining star of the show is Zeynep Kepekli’s lighting, using neon strips of changing colours to invoke locations and moods.The best Highsmith-Ripley theatre piece is Switzerland, Joanna Murray-Smith’s 2014 play in which the character turns up threatening to kill the novelist. Murray-Smith’s own adaptation of The Talented Mr Ripley is simultaneously running in Sydney, confirming the stage lure of the work. At one point in Leipacher’s version, Ripley, lethally tiring of Dickie’s conversation, moans that he “wants something original”, reflecting my views on another shot at this book.AtBirmingham Repuntil 27 September.Then touringuntil 22 November.Explore more on these topicsTheatreBirmingham RepPatricia HighsmithreviewsShareReuse this content"

At the time of writing, Golden, by the cartoon’s chief protagonists Huntr/x, is enjoying its seventh week at No 1: a couple of weeks back, songs from the film would have occupied seven places in the Top 10 had chart rules not limited artists to three appearances in the Top 40.View image in fullscreenOlivia Dean: The Art of Loving.The most striking challenge to its supremacy has been mounted by London singer-songwriter Olivia Dean. Her single Man I Need has been dug in at No 2 for the last month and has been joined in the Top 10 by its predecessor,Nice to Each Other, and her collaboration with Sam Fender,Rein Me In. Further down the Top 20, her old single Dive is enjoying an unexpected new lease of life. Were it not for a made-up K-pop band, one suspects we’d be talking about Dean’s ongoing success as the pop phenomenon of the moment, and not just in the UK: Man I Need is the fifth most played song in the world on Spotify at the time of writing.Dean’s 2023 debut album,Messy, attracted respectful but mixed reviews and did respectable, rather than remarkable, business. It spawned a hit single inDive, but seemed very much standard-issue stuff – tasteful neo-soul replete with vintage horn arrangements, ballads accompanied by lo-fi, slightly out-of-tune piano, tracks that opened with the sound of crackly old vinyl. Its author did the type of things that tasteful British neo-soul artists do: appearing on Jools Holland’s Hootenanny belting out You Can’t Hurry Love, covering The Christmas Song as part of a seasonal Amazon campaign, turning up on the soundtrack for the new Bridget Jones film alongside Jamie Cullum and George Ezra. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with any of that, but nor did any of it suggest that Dean was the kind of artist built to contest the dominance of a $100m (£74m) smash-hit animation, the soundtrack of which has topped the charts in 16 countries.Olivia Dean: Man I Need – videoSo how has it happened? High-profile support slots on Sam Fender and Sabrina Carpenter’s stadium shows early in the summer probably helped broaden her audience, but the real answer seems to lie on The Art of Loving. While you wouldn’t describe it as a complete reinvention, it certainly constitutes a noticeable rethink. It expunges most of the cliches of Dean’s debut album – or rather quarantines them on a track called Close Up – and instead looks for inspiration to music that emanated from recording studios in 70s LA. The Art of Loving dabbles in both Rumours-adjacent soft rock – you’re never far from a sun-dappled electric piano line or a breezy acoustic guitar; Baby Steps offers up slick, yacht rock-y funk – and, on So Easy (To Fall in Love), Carpenters-style MOR pop that would once have been considered entirely beyond the pale.It’s a sound that’s familiar without feeling hackneyed or self-consciously retro: Something Inbetween is powered by a muffled rhythm that sounds like someone playing a techstep drum’n’bass track with a duvet over the speakers; lurking in the depths of Nice to Each Other there’s a wash of shoegaze-y guitar noise and gusts of ambient synth drone. Airy and inviting, it suits Dean’s sweetly understated vocals – mercifully lacking affectation, either of the post-Winehouse “jazzy” variety or the weird, consonant-mangling “indie voice” that’s supposed to connote intimacy in 21st-century pop – and adds a cinematic gloss to her lyrics. Dean is big on diaristic detail as she navigates ex-related angst and tentative new relationships: “I don’t know where the switches are, or where you keep your cutlery.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

Every chorus has been polished until it catches the light (Baby Steps offers a particularly gleaming example), while one suspects that an enormous amount of effort has been expended on making the melodies of Nice to Each Other and I’ve Seen It sound as effortlessly charming as they do.So the album breezes past. It’s exceptionally well made but feels entirely natural; it’s mainstream commercial pop, but laudably devoid of obvious cliches. If Dean’s debut seemed like an artist trying to find their place in the landscape by ticking relevant boxes, The Art of Loving seems like someone finding their own voice. The sight of Olivia Dean battling a cartoon K-pop band in the charts’ upper echelons is proof that pop in 2025 is a business you can’t really predict, but still, The Art of Loving’s success seems a foregone conclusion.This week Alexis listened toMakaya McCraven – Los GatosChicago jazz drummer-cum-sonic collagist scores an ace by looping a section of a 2015 live improvisation – featuring Tortoise’s Jeff Parker – into a hypnotic reverie.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

This rewarding collection features his larger-scale chamber worksAndrew ClementsThu 25 Sep 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 25 Sep 2025 12.03 EDTShareThe sleeve notes for this ambitiously extensive collection ofLouis Spohr’slarger-scale string chamber music hails him as: “The most significant German composer between Beethoven and Schumann.” Two hundred years on, that seems a dubious claim – historically, Weber surely proved more influential – but there’s no doubt that in his lifetime, as a violin virtuoso and conductor as well as a composer, Spohr (1784-1859) was a celebrated figure across Europe. As a composer, he was certainly prodigious; he wrote in virtually every genre, and alongside his 11 operas, nine symphonies and about 30 concertos, of which at least 19 are for violin, there were copious songs and chamber music, including 34 string quartets.View image in fullscreenWDR SO Cologne: The Romantic Room, Chamber Works by Spohr.Photograph: PentatoneThe selection made by the ensemble of string players from the Cologne orchestra does not include any of those quartets, but concentrates on works requiring larger forces. Two of the six discs are taken up with Spohr’s four double string quartets, three more with six of his seven string quintets (scored for the Mozartean lineup with two violas); the seventh quintet is included on the final disc, alongside a string sextet, and a potpourri on themes of Mozart.This is a formidable amount of music, all of it very decently played and almost all of it virtually entirely unknown these days. Spohr, who is often regarded as a transitional figure between the classical and Romantic eras, took Mozart as his stylistic starting point, though in the double string quartets especially there are moments that seem closer to Beethoven. And by the time he composed his final string quintets in the 1840s, composers such as Mendelssohn and Schumann had already taken music into the new Romantic world. But there’s no doubt that this set has its own rewards, and for the musically curious, offers plenty to discover.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

She went on to say that she also attaches the “coat-on” expression to any dish she gets going as soon as she walks through the door (and before she takes off her coat and has a pee), so thinks of me when she makes coat-on lentils, coat-on rice and leeks, coat-on tomato sauce, coat-on couscous with roast vegetables. As much as I wanted to keep the compliment to myself and not share it, I did remind her that I had borrowed the expression from Nigella Lawson and her bookHow to Eat, to which the woman replied: “What a generous food writer you are.” I thanked her back, complimented her on her blue jacket, then bounced all the way to the cash desk to pay for the dishcloths and potato peeler, and then all along Oxford Street.If I ever see that woman again, I need to tell her that, since our meeting, I have also been attaching the prefix “coat-on” to various dishes and actions, not least boiling the kettle to jumpstart the water for coat-on spaghetti. Coincidentally, it is 20 years since I moved to Rome; 19 and a half years since Vincenzo and I first argued about how to cook pasta (him telling me I used too little water and salt, and took too much time; me telling him he was supercilious and boring); and 10 years since Ifirst wrote about spaghetti for this column. Some things have changed, others have not (salt), and I now have a medium-sized repertoire of coat-on spaghettis.The first of these speedy, coat-on favourites is spaghetti with a quick tomato, garlic and chilli sauce. It is described by a Neapolitan friend as a mix between a quick tomato sauce (AKAsciuesciue,pronounced “shway shway” and meaning “hurry hurry’’) and that store-cupboard saviour spaghetti with garlic, chilli and olive oil (aglio, olio e peperoncino,or AOP). Like spaghetti AOP, spaghetti with quick tomato, garlic and chilli sauce is not so much a sauce but a flavourful and fast coating for the thin strings of pasta. It is also a condiment in which the olive oil plays a fundamental role, so use the best you have, and don’t skimp.I have suggested slicing the garlic, but if you want a milder flavour, crush the cloves so they break but remain whole. If you prefer a more intense flavour, chop the cloves, while, for the most intense flavour of all, squash the cloves with the side of a knife until they reduce to a paste.The second coat-on recipe is a store-cupboard version of the Sicilian dishpasta con le sarde(pasta with sardines and wild fennel), which also showcases the power (culinary, biblical, or both) of tinned sardines: a small tin or two packs an intensely flavoured punch and goes a long way. If you can find fennel fronds or dill, great, otherwise parsley works well as the green herbal element. Again, what you are making here is not so much a sauce as a tasty condiment that coats the strands of spaghetti.Spaghetti with quick tomato, garlic and chilli sauceTinned plum tomatoes help the “hurry”, of course, while fresh tomatoes require a little more time and peeling, otherwise, the skins curl into hard bits when the flesh is mashed to a soft pulp. Use your best-tasting olive oil – and don’t skimp: it istheessential ingredient.Prep5 minCook10 minServes4Salt450g spaghetti6-8 tbspolive oil2garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced3 whole, peeled plum tomatoes, tinned or fresh and peeled1 tspred chill flakes1 handfulbasil leavesBring a pan of water to a boil, add some salt, then cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions, until al dente.Meanwhile, in a large frying pan, gently warm the olive oil and garlic, so the garlic becomes soft and fragrant, then add the tomatoes, chilli and a pinch of salt, and fry gently, mashing the tomatoes with the back of a fork or potato masher, so the flesh breaks down into a rustic sauce – this will take about four minutes on a lively heat. (If the sauce is ready before the pasta, pull the pan off the heat, then return it just before adding the spaghetti.)Once the spaghetti is al dente, use a forked spoon or spider sieve to lift it directly into the tomato pan, complete with the residual cooking water clinging to it, then toss very vigorously, ripping in the basil leaves as you do so. Serve at once.Spaghetti with tinned sardines, anchovy, capers, chilli and lemonView image in fullscreenRachel Roddy’s spaghetti with tinned sardines, anchovy, capers, chilli and lemon.Try to find sardines packed in olive oil, in which case you can reduce the amount of olive oil listed below.

Most of my audience, however, recalled it rather less fondly: as a super-sweet drink that seems to have wedged itself irreversibly into the brain of anyone who was alive and drinking in the 1970s and 80s.If super-sweet is your thing, have at it, but it’s my great pleasure to inform the rest of you that there’s so much more to discover. Lambrusco comes from the region of Emilia-Romagna, where there are eight related lambrusco varieties that produce a range of styles – dry, off-dry, red, pink, white – so there’s something to fit every palate.Indeed, while I was in Edinburgh, I had a good lunch atSotto, an enoteca and trattoria that opened last year, where I was pleased to see a bottle of lambrusco on the menu. It’s a wine that owner and sommelier James Clark says has an important part to play on his list: “Lambrusco challenges people’s preconceptions: you can bring a table of people from my parents’ generation a glass of something dry, floral and elegant that is unrecognisable from what they thought lambrusco is.”And what of food pairings? “It can comfortably sit alongside a range of foods,” Clark says. “It’s great with cured meats and fried antipasti, say, and even spicy food. We often have agnocchi frittowith culatello [a type of cured pork] on the menu, and I cannot think of a better pairing for that than a glass of lambrusco.”Lambrusco is also my go-to pizza wine. The dish and the drink share a conviviality, and the red fruit meets the freshness of good tomato sauce. If you’ve got a friend whose quarter/midlife crisis has come in the shape of a hi-tech pizza oven, give them an excuse to fire it up and bring over a bottle of red fizz.Four lambruscos to surprise your palateNivola Lambrusco£13 (or £12 on ‘“mix-six”) Majestic, 10.5%.
