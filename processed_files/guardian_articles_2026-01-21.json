Will the bookies’ favourite become the first female Traitor to win a UK series?Michael HoganWed 21 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 09.41 ESTShareEven a stopped castle clock is right twice a day. During last Friday’s jack-in-the-box mission onThe Traitors, the remaining contestants were asked which of their fellow players would make the best Traitor. In a rare moment of insight, Weymouth gardener James Baker – he of the clumsy shield-stealing – said: “Rachel. She has those FBI skills and is just so smooth.”He doesn’t know the half of it. Cut to Rachel saying through gritted teeth: “Shut up, James. Just shush.” She might have been momentarily rattled but the canny operator was soon making a mental note of everyone’s answers to use against them later. Translation: James’s days could be numbered.Rachel Duffy from County Down could be about to become the first female Traitor to win a UK series. She’s bookies’ hot favourite going into this week’s three-night endgame – just ahead of Stephen Libby, her fellow Traitor, who has a spectacular jumpsuit collection but a lot more suspicion swirling around him.As 22 players have been whittled down to eight, how has Rachel seen off 14 rivals with barely a bruise on her? She’s only received one banishment vote all series – and that was from crime novelist Harriet Tyce, who was promptly seen off. Rachel entered Ardross Castle armed with pre-planned tactics and it’s working like a dream. In terms of pure strategy, she’s arguably the best Traitor we’ve ever seen.View image in fullscreenHiding in plain sight … Roxy, Rachel, Ellie and Jade take part in one of the tasks.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan CherryShe honed her skulduggery skills playing Mafia – the social deduction game on which The Traitors is loosely based – with friends and family for the past 15 years. “They call me Monica from Friends because I’m so competitive,” she laughed. Going from the parlour game to its televised equivalent, she’s played an absolute blinder. Clever, cunning Rachel has pulled the strings all series from beneath that green velvet cloak.In her fireside interview before being chosen as a Traitor, she confessed to Claudia Winkleman that she once lied her way into a hotel suite upgrade by pretending she was the Irish president’s daughter. She’s a great liar because she knows precisely how to hide it. Many viewers laughed last week when Rachel revealed that her pre-show preparation included being trained by a former FBI agent in the art of lying: how to spot micro-expressions, read blink patterns, monitor breathing and swallowing. She told the credulous Faithful that she took the course so she could help them root out Traitors. None twigged that it actually enables her to dupe, deceive and mask the telltale signs.She’s been publicly (and correctly) accused twice but somehow still has no heat on her. The two rivals to launch outright attacks were Harriet and Fiona Hughes, the red-cloaked Secret Traitor from Swansea. Both were comfortably beaten, leaving Rachel’s reputation miraculously unsullied. If you’re going to take a shot at the queen, you can’t afford to miss. Any other Faithful with lingering doubts will now be terrified to take her on. Don’t mess with ruthless Rach.She might have main character energy but Rachel is no pantomime villain. She’s grasped that as well as a battle of wits, The Traitors is partly a popularity contest. She’s carefully cultivated friendships within the castle but, crucially, without forming cliques. Being so well liked helps make Rachel bulletproof.View image in fullscreenMinion vibes … Rachel talks to retired Met detective Amanda Collier at breakfast.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PAEven her outfits are strategic. She dresses in bright, breezy colours, almost channelling a CBeebies presenter. She once teamed denim dungarees with a yellow top, sparking Minion memes. When she needed to get her game face on, Rachel glammed up for a pivotal round table. Even her nemesis Harriet noted how she was “dressed to kill”. “Very good,” smiled Rachel, before dispatching the former barrister.She’s happy to be underestimated too. Rachel semi-fibbed about her occupation, telling castmates she works in marketing. Sort of true. She actually has a high-powered post in strategic communications. Well versed in the arts of persuasion and manipulation, her day job is to craft compelling narratives. She’s transferred those skills to The Traitors.Remember her gathering everyone together to announce that Amanda Collier was secretly a retired Met detective? This not only enabled Rachel to control the castle conversation – she’s still wielding Amanda’s (wrong) theories as weapons – but made her look trusted by a confirmed Faithful, therefore likely to be one herself. She pulled the wool over a seasoned copper’s eyes and in the process, everyone else’s too.At those all-important round tables, Rachel and co-conspirator Stephen are convincing actors who use silence effectively. Communications expert Vernon Thompson, head of voice and speech at City Lit, says: “When accused, the instinct is to rush to defend yourself. However, silence can be a powerful tool. Waiting just two or three seconds before replying not only makes you appear calm and measured but also flips perceptions. A panicked defence is less credible than a composed pause, followed by a considered response.”Rachel knows when to talk, what to say and when to keep her own counsel. She often sits back and lets others do her job for her. She tends to speak up towards the end of round tables, so whatever she says is still ringing in everyone’s ears when it’s time to write a name on their slate.Witness how she masterfully set up psychologist Ellie in the latest episode to divert scrutiny from Stephen. She claimed that somebody had inadvertently given themselves away and promised to bring proof to the round table. Rather than unveiling any actual evidence, Rachel admitted to “telling a wee white lie”. She had no strong suspicions, claiming she’d instead tried to flush out a Traitor by monitoring whose behaviour changed – and insisted it was Ellie’s. The widely unsuspected Ellie was suddenly toast. Rachel is head of strategic communications for a reason.View image in fullscreenThe best we’ve ever seen? … Rachel, Ross and Jade at the round table.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PASuch cool, collected gameplay makes her a formidable foe. Neither is she averse to causing chaos when it serves her. She blindsided Ross by casually asking: “Was Hugo this dramatic in the turret?” When Ross lamely pretended not to know what she meant, his fate was sealed. Rachel innocently acted like it was all a joke. Likewise with the baby of the group, 22-year-old Faraaz, who she impishly accused of “getting rid of all the oldies”, before bidding farewell with, “Goodnight, my Traitor son.” Just a bit of banter, but subtly sowing seeds. Faraaz might now be reluctant to vote against Rachel for fear of looking ageist.‘She is so mother!’ Why older women reign supreme on The TraitorsRead moreThis year’s batch have played the game harder than any previous cohort. Before the series launched, Winkleman teased: “We get some very juicy confrontations. It gets hardcore. We’ve never seen it played like this brilliant cast play it.” She was probably referring to Harriet’s breakfast fury and Fiona’s kitchen accusations – two electric TV moments, sure, but soon forgotten. As Rachel says: “I know the difference between reality and a game.”Rachel has been pivotal to the Highland hysteria, soaking up pressure without ever breaking sweat. Can she continue her dominance right to the end? We left on a cliffhanger, with the Traitors weighing up who to give the ceremonial dagger, which bestows a double vote at the next round table. Did Rachel decide to keep it for herself? It would probably shore up her and Stephen’s survival, but isn’t without risks, since it could also attract suspicion.Yet it’s a typical Rachel move. A calculated gamble which she has the smarts to pull off. Is she even better at this game than the only two previous UK Traitors to win: series two’s baby-faced assassin Harry Clark and chaotic Alan Carr from the inaugural celebrity edition? We’ll know by Friday night’s grand final. You wouldn’t put it past her to pull the ultimate Traitor move, scrap her pact with Stephen and walk away with the entire prize pot. It would be no less than Rachel deserves.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Apart from Donald Trump giving a long, rambling press conference in which he offered only a few mild insults to his supposed allies and posting mockups of Canada and Greenland covered in the Stars and Stripes. Apart from that. But that barely raises an eyebrow these days.Still, any respite – even 12 hours – is to be welcomed. Gives Keir Starmer a moment to catch his breath. A morning when the news cycle looks vaguely like it did the night before. Even if that is situation normal: all fucked up. A chance to think. Rather than be bounced into yet another psychotic parallel universe. Shame then thatKemi Badenochdidn’t also use the time to do the same. Thinking has never appeared to be her strong point.There are times when the leader of the opposition has to play the long game at prime minister’s questions. To not make everything about party politics. Starmer understood this when Labour was in opposition. Time and again at critical moments in the Ukraine war, he would make a point of backing Boris Johnson in his support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It wasn’t just about presenting a united front. It was about showing he had the nous and the judgment to put the national interest first.There again, Kemi is always going to be Kemi. She just can’t help herself. At heart, she’s just not that serious a politician. She’s an opportunist who can’t see the bigger picture. Prefers the cheap shot to the exclusion of all else. Can’t bear the thought of getting throughPMQswithout some dig at Starmer and Labour. Still, at least she got the first question about right. One out of six ain’t bad. She agreed with Keir that the future of Greenland was for the Greenlanders and the Danes alone.Kemi then went rogue. If Starmer believed in self-determination for Greenland, how come he didn’t extend the same rights to the Chagossians? After all, even The Donald had now rubbished the UK government’s deal with Mauritius. You’d have thought this might have raised a red flag for Badenoch. Almost everyone who hitches their wagon to something the US president has said gets burned sooner or later. Because he invariably changes his mind. Just nine months previously, Trump had given the Chagos deal the thumbs up. Nor was he over the detail. He seemed to think the UK was making money out of the deal. He normally approves of that.Even if Kemi hadn’t brought up Trump’s change of mind, her internal logic collapsed in on itself. At no time in the past 50 years has the self-determination of the Chagossians been Tory party policy. So why now? It was as though she was making it up as she was going along. Just where did she imagine the Chagossians would go? All the islands apart from Diego Garcia are uninhabitable. And you can’t imagine the US would pack up their airbase on Diego Garcia to let the islanders back. So it was all completely mad. Just an ill-thought-through soundbite designed to appeal to the less attentive of her backbenchers.Keir went to town. This was exactly the level of debate he had come to expect from the leader of the opposition. She was siding with a president who had only used a Chagos deal he didn’t understand as a wedge. Trump was just angry at not getting his own way over Greenland and was lashing out in whatever way he could. And Kemi didn’t have the judgment to see what she was doing by backing an out-of-control US president who was hellbent on destroying Nato and Europe. All for a quick gag at PMQs. She had just sold out her credibility by jumping on The Donald bandwagon.Look, Starmer went on. These things aren’t easy. The UK had no choice but to keep trying to deal with Trump. Showboating the country into a trade war by threatening retaliatory tariffs was not in the national interest. We had to pretend that the president was rational, even when he wasn’t. Otherwise we might as well give up now. And we couldn’t give up because there was still a war going on between Russia and Ukraine that couldn’t be won without American help.But on Greenland he would never yield. That was his red line. Our red line. This was hisstrongest stance on Trump so far. It turned out you can push Keir only so far but no more.For the rest of the session, Badenoch was on the back foot. She tried to make a play of Keir showing no leadership over the Chinese embassy – she seemed to think the Chinese have gone on a spying work-to-rule until they got their planning permission through – but it was her leadership that was found wanting. Starmer ran through some of her more obvious failings. Her support for Trump over Chagos; her excitement at the Liz Truss budget; the endless stream of defections.“I threw Robert Jenrick out of my party,” Kemi insisted. Oh really, said Keir. Was that before or after you had corrected the typos in his defection speech. Kemi looked crushed. Starmer continued. “They shout at PMQs on a Wednesday and defect on a Thursday.” In which case, Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary, must be on defection watch, because Lindsay Hoyle threw him out of the chamber. Holden didn’t appear to be making any more noise than any other Tory MP. But maybe the speaker was just having a bad day.Still, at least we were spared Nigel Farage trying to dance on the head of the Trumpian pin. Nige was off in Davos. Having said he would never go there. Too many globalists making money for themselves, he once said. Maybe now he thinks that’s a good thing. He’s going to charge punters a whole lot more for birthday videos when he can do it from the cabinet room. Like The Donald, Nige believes the main purpose of a career in politics is to cash in. Just let’s hope he remembers to declare his earnings next time.Explore more on these topicsKemi BadenochThe politics sketchKeir StarmerPMQsHouse of CommonscommentShareReuse this content"

This was only a third start since his latest return began with the second 45 minutes of the goalless draw at Sunderland on New Year’s Day. Last week Rodri declared he was “ready to go” and said: “I’m really happy to be on the pitch every single day.” Yet inSaturday’s 2-0 loss at Manchester Unitedhe was a one-paced, non-factor unable to do what he did with ease pre‑anterior cruciate ligament rupture: run midfield and so the contest. InTuesday’s 3-1 humbling in Norwaythe Spaniard was the same, and two moments tell the tale of his form. First Jens Petter Hauge left him a statue before registering a memorable long-range strike for Bodø’s third goal; then came the two yellow cards in two minutes that had Rodri sent off.Haaland hit by scoring strugglesYou have to go back a full month for the last time Erling Haaland netted other than from the penalty spot, with two goals against West Ham inManchester City’s 3-0 win. His sole strike in eight games since was inthe 1-1 draw against Brightonon 7 January, the goal-glutton somehow failing to register even whenExeter were given a 10-1 beatingin the FA Cup third round. After the Bodø defeat, a sour return for Haaland to his native country, he was asked about the fallow run. “I don’t have the answers,” he said. “I take full responsibility for not being able to score the goals I should do.” Haaland branded the loss “embarrassing” and he and City’s other three members of the captaincy group agreed that the 374 travelling fans should be reimbursed their tickets for the game – a sum of £9,357. The 25-year-old has 20 goals in the Premier League (in 22 games) and six in seven Champions League appearances, part of a phenomenal 26 in 31 matches in all competitions. So maybe it is time merely for a breather and for Omar Marmoush to have a game or two as the City spearhead.View image in fullscreenManchester City’s Erling Haaland has not scored from open play since mid December.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersGuardiola grasping for explanationsIn the Aspmyra Stadion’s below-freezing conditions City’s manager seemed a man petrified by his side’s tameness, unable to affect their fortunes whatever he tried. Example: at 2-0 down at the start of the second half he briefly switched to a wingback system that had Phil Foden on the left and Rayan Aït-Nouri on the right but this soon vanished, as did any true hope when Hauge made it 3-0. After the final whistle Guardiola was left grasping for an explanation for a run that shows zero league wins in 2026. “When we started New Year’s Day we missed [chances] and after then came injuries and Matheus [Nunes] has flu,” he said. “Many things are against us. Now, because we lost important players we lost a little bit, but in general the tone of the team was much better against Bodø than United.” For the trip to the Arctic Circle the list of absentees ran to 11: Josko Gvardiol, Nunes, Rúben Dias, Nico González, Savinho, Jérémy Doku, Oscar Bobb, Antoine Semenyo, John Stones, Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva. The insipid manner of the defeat – as at United – concerns the manager.Foden a shadow of himselfThe last of City’s Big Four who should be disappointed in a downward trajectory on the performance graph is Foden, who is playing more like the brother of the “Stockport Iniesta” than the player who shone earlier in the season. Substituted at half-time of the derby defeat, he again did not last the full game at Bodø, being removed on 70 minutes. This season Foden has 10 goals in 30 appearances and four assists: not shabby, except he last scored five and a half weeks ago and last created a goal eight days earlier. The hope will be that Foden, Rodri, Haaland and Guardiola are experiencing an unfortunate midwinter slump at the same time, rather than this being part of a deeper, more fundamental malaise. Off the field it is the manager’s problem to understand and solve, but on the pitch Foden and the rest, as City’s main actors, have to take the lead or the team will not “be there” in April and May, as Guardiola likes to say – in the hunt for the title, Champions League and FA Cup.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola and Phil Foden have struggled to find answers to City’s problems.Photograph: Dave Thompson/AP… some good news: Guéhi is in the buildingSigning a 25-year-old first-choice England defender entering his prime yearsfor £20mwill prove a coup if Marc Guéhi can perform as slickly as he has for his country and when captaining Crystal Palace – particularly when leading the club tolast season’s FA Cup win. Guéhi’s calm head and nimble pace have arrived just when City required a fillip, because a big factor in the faltering form are the injuries to Gvardiol, Dias and Stones, the frontline centre-backs. With Abdukodir Khusanov, 21, improving in the middle of the rearguard via a blend of aggression and speed, Guéhi and the Uzbekistan international could emerge from the team’s torpor as an A-list partnership that will cover for the prolonged absence of Gvardiol and Dias.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaanalysisShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Inever stopped wearing skirts, I just sort of stopped thinking about them. They were a plus-one, not the main event. For the past few years I have planned my outfits around my obsession with pleated trousers, or my latest experimental jean shape. Or I have worn dresses. Sometimes I have ended up in a skirt, but the skirt was kind of an afterthought. For instance, at one point last year when it was chilly and I needed to look smart as well as cosy, I picked out a sweater and a pair of knee-high boots, and then slotted in a plain midi in satin or wool, just something to sit in between.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Things could be about to change. I’ve got a feeling that 2026 could be the year that skirts get main character energy again. For a start: hemlines are getting shorter again, which makes skirts more attention-grabbing. If you left the house with your eyes open at any point in 2025, you will have noticed this happening: generation Z and Alpha wear very, very short skirts – she says, trying and failing not to sound about 150 years old – but the trend for above-the-knee hemlines crosses all generations. Adult women with their legs out was very much a feature of the pre-Christmas party season. But what is noticeable is that the mini renaissance is much more about a skirt, than it is about a dress. A short skirt feels cooler; more about your style and less about your body than a minidress.Call me an old fuddy-duddy: when I’m walking up a Tube escalator, I don’t actually want to show my pants to the worldWhen the Fashion Museum Bath named Miu Miu’s buttock-skimmingmicro-kilt as their “dress of the year” for 2022, it felt quite confusing. How can a skirt be the dress of the year? With hindsight, it is clear that they were on to something. Separates are the stars of the modern wardrobe. Even the Princess of Wales has started wearing tailored suits, instead of tailored dresses. And as a fast-moving, hot-potato conversation topic, jean silhouettes are right up there with mortgage rates. I wonder if this shift from dresses to separates is partly because as we try to shop less and focus on restyling what we already have, we lean into the enhanced scope for layering that comes with choosing mix-and-match separates over one-and-done dresses.View image in fullscreenSarah Jessica Parker in a pencil skirt.Photograph: HBOThe MVP skirt doesn’t have to be mini. The knee-length pencil skirt is poised for a comeback. And just before Christmas, I wrote about howA Little Bit Of Lace has become a formula for glamour, and name-checkedmy favourite White Company satin skirt, which has a lace band at its calf-length hem. Wear it with a polo neck sweater, thick wool tights, and flat boots.What stops most of us wearing miniskirts is that most brands cut them very short. This is what the kids want (as already discussed) and also what looks great on a mannequin in a shop window. But call me an old fuddy-duddy: when I’m walking up a tube escalator, I don’t actually want to show my pants to the world.Whistlesare a good source of cool short-but-not tiny skirts. This season, their A-lineleather skirtsand side-buckled wool ones (a nod to kilts, but more wearable) measure 44cm from waistband to hem. By contrast, most of Zara’s miniskirts measure between 33 and 39cm. That’s a big difference – although I did buy a leopard mini at Zara a couple of summers ago, having spotted that it had a generous hem I could let down, which I have worn loads. I find that tight minis can feel a bit wiggly, and A-line ones a bit childish. A flippy-hem silhouette, which hugs your hips but kicks out at the top of your thighs, is my top tip.My favourite is from Reiss(£88), and I have written about it before. Next’sBoucle Flippy Mini Skirt(£38) is similar.A fun hemline, a flippy shape, a buttery leather: what gives your skirt the main character energy is up to you.

The prize was some money, a camera and a return ticket to anywhere in the world. I chose Chile. The camera was an all-bells-and-whistles model: I sold it to a taxi driver at 3am. I’ve always preferred working with light 35mm cameras.After three months in Chile, I caught a train that rose up to the high Bolivian Altiplano plateau, leaving me with a splitting headache only relieved by some coca tea. I had an open-ended commission with the Financial Times to provide photographs from financial areas of the South American cities I went to, so while my main aim was to wander around photographing exciting things I came across, I also made sure to head to the financial district and government quarters in the city of La Paz, which is where this was taken.When I took the picture, I wasn’t entirely sure what was happeningThis was the year Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada was elected president of Bolivia, and my visit coincided with his campaign. As the election loomed, there was a real sense of apprehension in the city. There were loads of soldiers and police around; there were rumours that any unregistered land would be sequestered by the new government, and I think that’s why the people in this picture were queueing with their papers.There was no way to be discreet when I took it. My camera was quite loud and you can see one of the people looking right at me. People’s bemusement at being photographed while they’re just going about their lives is something I’ve encountered a lot. This wasn’t a wedding picture or a happy occasion: I gather that the claims had to be filed before a deadline which was probably quite close. But I wasn’t entirely sure when I took the picture what was happening, only that it was important to these people and there was a very tense atmosphere. That’s the sense I wanted to capture.Then I was approached by some plainclothes police officers who bundled me into the back of a car and drove me to the local station, where I was questioned for a long time about why I was there and what I was doing. I told them I was a tourist taking photographs for myself but they still tried to take my film. Happily, I managed to fob them off with some unexposed rolls. On the way out, I had to walk down a line of police who took turns to punch and kick me all the way to the door. That was my warning, but they also told me I’d be followed and watched. I didn’t hang around.There’s a degree of ambiguity – that’s something all my favourite pictures haveThis image is one of many that weren’t published at the time but now form part of a series I callStill Films, which draws on my background in both photojournalism and film-making. I’ve always been drawn to black and white, filmic images, and scenes I stumble upon that look as if they’ve been set up. The series delves into the interplay between cinema and photography: still images that evoke a narrative that transcends the frame.There are loads of pictures I took in La Paz that I love, but as soon as I saw this one on the contact sheet I recognised that filmlike quality. There’s tension in the composition, as the figures create a chain leading towards the open doorway guarded by a soldier, but also a degree of ambiguity. I think that’s something all my favourite pictures have in common, my own and those by others. I don’t like my photographs to be too rigid or immediate, I want them to be imbued with the same sense of excitement and wonder I felt when I pressed the shutter.Photography is subjective, and I’ve always been reluctant to go somewhere and try to tell a story as an outsider. I arrived in Bolivia without foreknowledge or judgment, and what was going on at the time is really kind of irrelevant to the image. I think the best photographs provide more questions than answers.Rod Morris’s CVView image in fullscreenBorn:Southampton, 1963Highpoint:Winning the Time Out/STA travel photographer of the year and using the prize money to travel to South America to take photographs in Chile on environmental projects for three months before travelling on to Peru and Bolivia.Toptip:Adopt the mindset of photographing on film: take less, think more.

The warmth, the softness, the hefty pressure that renders you unable to fidget or indeed move. Worries subside, and you have no choice but to slide into slumber.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Studieshave demonstrated some success for weighted blankets assleep aids, but where these hefty quilts seem to excel is in alleviating anxiety – and not just according toTikTok influencers. Scientists, medics and theNHSare trialling them to comfortdementia patients, sootheneurodivergent childrenand even relievechronic pain.I’ve long been intrigued by weighted blankets. The list of maladies they’re said to soothe is like looking in the mirror (anxiety, check; restless legs when I’m trying to fall asleep, oh, very check), and I’m always open to drug-free remedies. However, being pinned down never struck me as relaxing, and weighted blankets can even be dangerous if given to the wrong person.NHS guidelinescaution against their use by children with learning difficulties and mobility problems that might prevent them from removing the blanket by themselves.To find out what these blankets could (or couldn’t) do for me, I assembled 10 bestsellers and set about cocooning myself in the name of research. Here I reveal which weighted blankets lifted a weight from my shoulders, and which ones just weighed me down.At a glanceBest weighted blanket overall:Emma Hug£104 at EmmaBest budget weighted blanket:Silentnight Wellbeing£35 at MorrisonsBest warm weighted blanket:The Oodie weighted blanket£65.40 at the OodieBest weighted blanket for kids:OHS Minecraft£19 at OHSWhy you should trust meI’ve spent three decades reviewing products, from smartphones tohay fever remedies, so I’m professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically improve our lives by buying their stuff. I also have a solid background in napping, insomnia and swearing at alarm clocks, so I always welcome the chance to sleep on the job for the Filter.Weighted blankets claim to directly target problems I’ve struggled with for years. I’ve been on anti-anxiety meds since the 90s, and HRT has taken the edge off my sleep issues, but some non-medicinal interventions on both counts would be most welcome.How I testedView image in fullscreenHibernation station: the blankets were weighed, measured and used for cocooning.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianWeighted blankets are less diverse thanmattressesorheated clothes airers. They do the same thing, and most are the same size – 150 x 200cm, a bit smaller than a double duvet (200 x 200cm). They even tend to be a uniform shade of light grey. Ranking them would require some careful nit-picking.“Weighted” is very much a part of the product description, but I was still surprised by how heavy the blankets were. At about 7kg each, that’s 70 kilos of bedding I faced hefting up the stairs – although after reviewing so many mattresses for the Filter, carrying a few kilos of fabric felt like a day off.I began by weighing each blanket while still in its (weightless) plastic carry case, then whipped out the tape measure. Some blankets weren’t quite the advertised weight and size, but only one came up short.My husband and testing partner, Alan, then joined me to rate the samples on factors such as fabric softness, warmth and construction quality. To test how well the weight was distributed, we pulled each blanket over us while lying on our backs and sides, and noted how easily we could turn over in bed under it.We also deployed dirt (a smudge of compost from a houseplant) to test the ease of spot cleaning. Some weighted blankets are machine washable, but I wasn’t prepared to test this by risking my machine. One brand I tested,Allure Bath Fashions, says blankets over 5.5kg should be washed in commercial machines, and I’m happy to follow that advice.Then came the cocooning. We spent three cosy evenings on the sofa, wrapped in a series of test blankets and taking care not to spill TV snacks, given the aforementioned cleaning caveat. Next, we slept under each blanket for a few nights in September and October. A full-size weighted blanket isn’t big enough for two adults to share as their only bedding, so we used a 2.4-tog summer duvet underneath to ensure we were both covered.View image in fullscreenWeighty issue: writer Jane Hoskyn, right, donating tested blankets at Southampton Hospitals Charity.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianAutumn’s night temperatures were occasionally too warm to keep the blanket on all night, but I was still able to test them as a way to soothe restless legs. Each morning, I recorded how well each one had helped me fall asleep, regulate my temperature and stop fidgeting.After testing, I donated my sample blankets to theSouthampton Hospitals Charity, which passed them on to the hospital’s Bassett Ward for dementia patients. “They were so well received,” says hospital engagement officer Shona Brooks.The best weighted blankets you can buy in 2026View image in fullscreenCat’s eyes: a feline assistant was on hand for the blanket-testing bonanza.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBest weighted blanket overall:Emma HugEmmaHug with bamboo coverfrom£104£104 at Emma£104.95 at Mattress OnlineWhat we loveSpreads weight evenly and helps control temperatureWhat we don’t loveExpensive, and even more so with the brilliant coverPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£104 at Emma£104.95 at Mattress OnlineThe generous, evenly spread weight of Emma’s blanket made it an instant favourite with me, my husband and our cat. Its soft, breathable cotton shell contains just over 7kg of glass microbeads, encased in microfibre and spread evenly among a patchwork of finely stitched squares. The overall effect is delicious, like being hugged by cosy cotton pyjamas.Why we love itAll weighted blankets keep you warm by trapping in your body heat, but there’s a fine line between warm and overheated in bed. The Emma Hug’s cotton fabric makes the blanket feel warm without the risk of overheating or feeling clammy.Despite its heft (7.3kg by my measure), we found it easy to move around underneath the cotton fabric without getting tangled. That said, the weight discouraged us both from fidgeting as much as normal, and this proved surprisingly soothing and soporific.When I first tested the Emma Hug, it came with an optional silkybamboo cover, which costs an additional £40. To my despair, the cover has vanished from Emma’s website, but it seems you can still buy it elsewhere online. Good thing, too, because it not only helps protect the blanket (it’s much easier to wash and dry than the blanket itself) but it also adds a delectable extra layer of comfort. Being enveloped in heavy silken bamboo is, with apologies to my husband, the closest I’ve come to heaven while falling asleep.Even without the cover, the Emma Hug is expensive. However, I think it justifies the cost if, like me, you need all the help you can get with sleep – especially if you have trouble regulating your body temperature.It’s a shame that …the cotton surface of the blanket is slightly less warming than the many polyester blankets we tested, and creases more easily.Size:150 x 200cmWeight (measured):7.3kgMaterial:cotton fabric with glass microbeads and polyester microfibre fillingWashing:blanket is machine washable at 30C, cover at 40CEmmaHug with bamboo coverfrom£104£104 at Emma£104.95 at Mattress OnlineWhat we loveSpreads weight evenly and helps control temperatureWhat we don’t loveExpensive, and even more so with the brilliant coverBest budget weighted blanket:Silentnight WellbeingSilentnightWellbeing£35£35 at MorrisonsWhat we loveSuperbly priced and wonderfully softWhat we don’t loveThe fabric might be simply too hot in summerPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£35 at MorrisonsThis charcoal-coloured comforter is the only weighted blanket Silentnight makes, and it’s a cracker – at less than half the price of the Emma or more hyped blankets, such as the Oodie.Why we love itSilentnight’s blanket looks magnificent and feels wonderfully soft against your skin. It’s machine washable, but if you’d rather not risk it in your machine, you’ll be glad to hear it was one of the easiest to spot clean in our dirt test. That may partly be because dark grey doesn’t show stains as easily as the more ubiquitous light grey.At 6.9kg, the Silentnight weighs marginally less than other weighted blankets of similar dimensions. It was heavy enough to envelope me with satisfying pressure, though, and genuinely helped calm me as I laid on my side to go to sleep.It’s a shame that …the jersey-like fabric isn’t particularly cooling. I didn’t experience any sweatiness while sleeping with it, but this blanket wouldn’t be my first choice on hot nights.Size:152 x 203cmWeight (measured):6.9kgMaterial:polyester fabric with glass microbeads and polyester fillingWashing:machine washable at 40CSilentnightWellbeing£35£35 at MorrisonsWhat we loveSuperbly priced and wonderfully softWhat we don’t loveThe fabric might be simply too hot in summerBest warm weighted blanket:The Oodie weighted blanketthe OodieWeighted blanket£65.40£65.40 at the OodieWhat we loveThe warmest of the bunch, and available in a range of coloursWhat we don’t loveIt’s quite expensive at full RRPPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£65.40 at the OodieMade by the Australian company whose eponymouswearable blanketkept thousands of home workers toasty in lockdown, this fluffy blanket was the warmest sofa snuggler in my test. Bonus points, too, for coming in a wider range of colours and weights than its opposition.Why we love itThe Oodie’s silky fleece fabric is a sensory delight, and I liked the high quality of details such as the stitching and well-padded squares. While Oodie weighted blankets come in various weights, they’re all the same size at 125 x 196.5cm: smaller than most, and easier to store. My Oodie never made me feel swamped, and its relatively nimble weight and size made it easy to carry between bed and sofa.I tested a 4.5kg Oodie weighted blanket, the lightest in its range. Your blanket should ideally weigh about 10% of your body weight, and for short women like me, this can present a challenge. At under 50kg, I am officially too small for standard 7kg blankets, let alone 9kg behemoths like the heaviest in the Oodie’s range. The 9kg will feel gratifyingly heavy for larger people who struggle to get the full benefit from lighter blankets.All Oodie weighted blankets come in a lovely cotton carry bag that’d make them an ideal gift.It’s a shame that …with an RRP of £109, this blanket is one of the most expensive in my test, but look out for regular discounts. I bought it for £89, still steep but not unjustifiably so.Size:125 x 196.5cmWeight (measured):4.5kg (also available in6.8kgand9kg)Material:polyester fabric with glass microbeads and polyester microfibre fillingWashing:hand wash or cold machine washthe OodieWeighted blanket£65.40£65.40 at the OodieWhat we loveThe warmest of the bunch, and available in a range of coloursWhat we don’t loveIt’s quite expensive at full RRPBest weighted blanket for kids:OHS MinecraftOHSMinecraft£19£19 at OHSWhat we lovePerfectly weighted for kids with beautiful padding and stitchingWhat we don’t loveIt’s too light for adults, so outgrowing it is inevitablePhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£19 at OHSWeighted blankets have been used to calmchildren with autism, but your child need not have any diagnosis to benefit from their soothing effects. This single-size blanket from OHS weighs 3kg, ideal for children weighing about 30kg or more.Why we love itThe weight is spread evenly, so when it’s wrapped around you or laid flat over your body, it feels much lighter than, say, the concentrated 3kg of a cat in your lap. That makes it ideal for kids, who should not be given heavier blankets. “It is important that your child can move around by themselves under the weighted blanket and be able to remove [it] easily,” sayNHS guidelines.This Minecraft-themed blanket is beautifully padded and stitched, so there’s no danger of the non-toxic microbeads spilling out or being removed by inquisitive hands. It comes ina range of patterns, includingspace print and a swish electric blue, all with a deliciously tactile silky feel that I found quite soothing in itself. It’s by far the easiest blanket in my test to wash and dry, too.It’s a shame that …this excellent quilt has a necessarily limited target audience. It’s not big or heavy enough to work as a weighted blanket for adults, and mustn’t be used for babies or toddlers.Size:100 x 150cmWeight (measured):3kg as advertisedMaterial:polyester fabric with non-toxic glass microbeads and polyester fillingWashing:hand wash recommendedOHSMinecraft£19£19 at OHSWhat we lovePerfectly weighted for kids with beautiful padding and stitchingWhat we don’t loveIt’s too light for adults, so outgrowing it is inevitableThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘I could stroke it all day’: the OHS fluffy faux fur weighted blanket.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianOHS fluffy faux furOHSFluffy faux fur£18£18 at OHSWhat we loveLuxuriously fluffy and tactileWhat we don’t loveDifficult to clean, and likely won’t stay fluffy foreverPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£18 at OHSBest for:looking fabulous while being swaddled to sleepI could stroke the faux fur side of this budget blanket all day. The 4cm-long polyester fibre “hairs” create a sumptuous sea of fluff whose tactile pleasures soothed me almost as much as the blanket’s weight did.

At less than half the price of the Emma blanket and cover, though, it’s an excellent alternative.It didn’t make the final cut because …the silkiness of the fabric makes it feel less cosy than some of the others.

OHS’s blanket was too heavy for me, and even when I lay on my side, I found myself pushing it off. I may well feel differently on freezing winter nights.Alan adored this one, though, commenting that he just wished the colour choices could be more creative. At least OHSdoesgive you colour choices with itsweighted blankets, unlike other brands, such as Silentnight and Emma. You can choose from dark grey, light grey and beige “mink”, which we tested.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s too heavy for me and my decidedly non-commercial washing machine. Hand washing would take some muscle, too, so I’m glad this one spot-cleaned surprisingly well in our test.Size:150 x 200cm (also available 125 x 180cm);weight (measured):7.9kg;material:polyester fabric with glass microbeads and polyester filling;washing:hand wash and air dryOHSWaffle fleecefrom£18£18 at OHS£21.99 at AmazonWhat we loveIncredibly warm and keenly pricedWhat we don’t lovePerhaps too heavy for some sleepersAllure Bath Fashions SlumberAllure Bath FashionsSlumberfrom£40£40 at Allure Bath Fashions£44.99 at AmazonWhat we loveComes in a variety of weights and sizes for all tastesWhat we don’t loveLacks a little skin-friendly softnessFrom £40 at Allure Bath FashionsFrom £44.99 at AmazonBest for:smaller or larger people who find standard 7kg blankets too heavy or lightAllure’s blanket is one of the few that come in a range of lighter and heavier versions. I didn’t test the 9kg but tried both the 4kg and 7kg versions. Both had their benefits, with the 4kg offering just the right degree of hug on the sofa, while the 7kg did a better job of calming my fidgety body and restless legs in bed.Unusually, this dark grey blanket comes with a tog rating. At 2.5 tog, it won’t overheat you on warm nights, but its enveloping pressure will help keep out the chill in winter.It didn’t make the final cut because …this excellent-value blanket is similar to the Silentnight, but its fabric is less soft against your skin.Size:152 x 203cm (also available 122 x 185cm);weight:7.3kg (also available 4kg, 5.5kg, 6.8kg, 9kg);material:polyester fabric with glass microbeads and polyester filling;washing:machine washable at 30C, but the brand says blankets weighing over 5.5kg should be washed in a commercial machineAllure Bath FashionsSlumberfrom£40£40 at Allure Bath Fashions£44.99 at AmazonWhat we loveComes in a variety of weights and sizes for all tastesWhat we don’t loveLacks a little skin-friendly softnessLifemax microwave weighted blanketLifemaxMicrowave weighted blanketfrom£29.99£29.99 at Robert Dyas£29.99 at LifemaxWhat we loveA weighted shawl-like blanket for targeted comfortWhat we don’t loveIt’s far too small to deliver serious therapeutic benefitsPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£29.99 at Robert Dyas£29.99 at LifemaxBest for:draping around your shoulders or warming your feet on chilly daysAnd now for something slightly different. At 1.3kg and about the size of two pillowcases, the Lifemax isn’t really a weighted blanket like the others in my test. It’s essentially a wheat bag, with its contents divided between 18 quilt-like sections. After 45 seconds in the microwave, it turns into a warm, fragrant, weighted shawl. (Be careful not to overheat, as per microwavablehot-water bottles.)Lifemax’s fluffy black comforter arrived quite late in my testing schedule, and it felt like a gift from the gods because I’d just been felled by an October cold and found it difficult tosleep. Adding this gently weighted soother to my bedtime routine genuinely helped, especially with a drop ofOlbas oilon the warm fabric.It’s a shame that …it’s too small and light to deliver the pressure of a therapeutic weighted blanket.Size:43 x 106cm;weight:1.3kg;material:polyester fabric, lavender-scented flax seed filling;washing:spot clean with a damp clothLifemaxMicrowave weighted blanketfrom£29.99£29.99 at Robert Dyas£29.99 at LifemaxWhat we loveA weighted shawl-like blanket for targeted comfortWhat we don’t loveIt’s far too small to deliver serious therapeutic benefitsWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenLook for a weighted blanket that is about 10% of your body weight.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianWhat does a weighted blanket do?A weighted blanket is not just a heavy blanket, or like lying under a rug. True weighted blankets are designed to feel floppy and spread their weight evenly, so they exert gentle-but-firm pressure consistently across your body.This is a form of “deep touch pressure” (DTP), a therapy that mimics being hugged or swaddled. According to researchers, DTP can boost the body’s production of neurotransmitters, including“happy hormone” serotonin, so it has the potential to alleviate anxiety.At least one study into DTP has usedlead aprons, but the idea of being swaddled in lead doesn’t do much for my serotonin levels, so I was relieved to learn that today’s blankets use safer ingredients, such as tiny “micro” glass beads. The beads are divided evenly among quilted squares to ensure a proper spread of weight, and padded (usually with polyester microfibre) for comfort and durability.Weighted blankets have been embraced as therapeutic tools by health organisations, including theRoyal College of Occupational Therapistsand numerous NHS trusts. When I delivered our test blankets to Southampton Hospitals Charity at the city’s university hospital, passing staff commented that their own weighted blankets had helped them with ADHD and insomnia. These blankets are catching on as a sleep aid, too, with a 2024studycalling them “a promising [drug-free] tool” for sleep disorders.They may not work for everyone, though. Besides being unsuitable for those experiencing certain health problems, weighted blankets don’t feel comfortable for all users. “If you love the feeling of being tightly tucked in at night, a weighted blanket might be perfect for you,” says Hannah Shore, head of sleep science atMattress Online. “But if you prefer a little more movement, you may find them slightly restricting. You could always use it in your wind-down routine to help you relax before you go to bed.”How heavy should a weighted blanket be?Your weighted blanket should be about 10% of your body weight. If you weigh 71.8kg (11st 3lb), the average weight of UK women according to themost recent NHS data, a standard 7kg weighted blanket would be heavy enough to exert therapeutic pressure, but not so heavy that it’s uncomfortable or unsafe.Dimensions matter, too. Most weighted blankets for adults measure 150 x 200cm, the same as the sleeping surface of a king-sizemattress. You can’t buy weighted blankets much bigger than this. The standard size is big enough to safely envelope one person lying down or sitting on the sofa, or two of you if you sleep in close quarters. Whatever size or weight the blanket is, never put it over your head.What’s the best way to wash a weighted blanket?Most of my test blankets say they are machine washable. In practice, the only items I risked in my machine were the 3kg OHS kids’ weighted blanket (on cold) and the Emma Hug’s bamboo cover (on 30C). Both washed clean and dried within two hours on myheated airer.Full-size weighted blankets are more of a challenge. They roughly double their weight when wet, giving butch new meaning to the phrase “wet blanket”. The manufacturerAllurerecommends using a commercial machine to wash blankets over 5.5kg, but check the launderette’s weight limits before you pile in.Hand washing is an option, but again the weight may be prohibitive, especially for arms which, like mine, haven’t seen the inside of a gym for years.Sleepscientist Shore recommends a lighter approach – or a blanket cover. “If your blanket doesn’t have a cover, you can spot clean it with lukewarm water and a little detergent. Always make sure you check the care instructions first to avoid invalidating your guarantee or warranty.”For more:The best electric blankets and heated throwsThe best hot-water bottlesI tested the most-hyped sleep aids – here’s what workedJane Hoskyn is a features journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.

The crossbench peer Baroness Kidron, who supports Conservative peer Lord Nash’s amendment in the House of Lords, is right to say Starmer’s approach ‘is not leading; it is not governing’. He is ‘doing nothing – slowly’, which is ‘the very epitome of party before country’.Let’s just get on with it.”She added: “Putting our children’s mental health first is the right thing to do. How much longer will we have to wait until the government agrees?”After the Lords vote passed, John Nash, a former schools minister and Tory peer, said: “Tonight, peers put our children’s future first. This vote begins the process of stopping the catastrophic harm that social media is inflicting on a generation.“Medical professionals, intelligence officers, police officers, teachers and hundreds of thousands of parents clearly demanded action, and the Lords have listened.”TheConservativesmade no moves towards banning social media during their time in government, though the Online Safety Act placed more obligations on internet and social media providers to protect children from harmful content.However, Badenoch said the consensus had shifted, with campaigners, clinicians, parents and experts now aligned against allowing under-16s access to social media. She also argued some internet restrictions for adults could be lifted if children were more protected from social media.She said her party believed in freedom but that the ability to make good choices was not yet fully formed in children, who did not have the necessary impulse control, emotional regulation and ability to assess risks.On Sunday, the Guardian revealed thatmore than 60 Labour MPs have written to Starmerurging him to back a social media ban for under-16s, including select committee chairs, former frontbenchers and MPs from the right and left of the party.In the letter, which was organised by Fred Thomas, the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, the MPs say: “Across our constituencies, we hear the same message: children are anxious, unhappy, and unable to focus on learning. They are not building the social skills needed to thrive, nor having the experiences that will prepare them for adulthood.”On Wednesday another letter from campaignersurged parliament to back a ban, with signatories including the actors Hugh Grant and Sophie Winklemanand Esther Ghey, the mother of Brianna Ghey, who was murdered by two teenagers in Warrington, Cheshire, in 2023. It said national polling by the charity Parentkind had found 93% of parents thought social media was harmful to children and young people.It said: “No other amendment to the bill on this topic has the same cross-party support or would deliver promptly the change needed to get children off social media.”Explore more on these topicsSocial media banKemi BadenochKeir StarmerConservativesLabourSocial media bansSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

I think it’s fundamentally wrong to put all of us through this again when all we wanted was an apology and some accountability.”With his voice wavering, he added: “They continue to come after me. They have made my wife’s life an absolute misery, my lord.”The Duchess of Sussex sued ANL and won in 2021 after the Mail on Sunday published parts of apersonal letter to her father, Thomas Markle. A judge ruled that Meghan had a “reasonable expectation that the contents of the letter would remain private”. She later won a copyright claim over the letter.Harry gave two hours of testimony as the first witness in the case that he and six other prominent figures have brought against ANL, accusing it of using private investigators, hacking and “blagging” information by unlawful means.The six others areDoreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence, who was killed in a racist murder more than 30 years ago; Elton John and his husband, David Furnish; the actorsElizabeth Hurleyand Sadie Frost; and the former Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes.In a witness statement submitted to the court, Harry accused the publisher of having “a campaign, an obsession of having every aspect of my life under surveillance so they could get the run on their competitors and drive me paranoid beyond belief, isolating me, and probably wanting to drive me to drugs and drinking to sell more of their papers”.Associated Newspapers denies any wrongdoing, previously describing the claims as “lurid” and “preposterous”.Harry engaged in frosty exchanges with Antony White, ANL’s barrister, during his cross-examination. White repeatedly put it to him that information in the 14 articles he was complaining about had been secured legitimately by journalists through their contacts within the duke’s social circles.The duke insisted he did not have a “leaky” social circle that gave stories to ANL’s journalists. He said the moment he became suspicious about someone, he had to cut them off.He added it had been impossible to complain about some of the stories when they were published, but he now believed they came from the use of unlawful information gathering.White said Katie Nicholl, a former Mail on Sunday royal correspondent, who wrote several of the stories, had gone to the same social events and nightclubs. He suggested the duke also had a good relationship with Rebecca English, the Daily Mail’s royal editor.“I did not have a good relationship with Ms English. Quite the opposite,” Harry said. “For the avoidance of doubt, I’m not friends with any of these journalists and never have been,” he added.White said Harry was at one point Facebook friends with a third journalist, the Mail on Sunday’s former diary editor Charlotte Griffiths. He suggested Harry had used the pseudonym “Mr Mischief” on the site, which the duke flatly denied. White also said Harry had met Griffiths in Ibiza, which he also denied.White has previously told the court the seven claimants were “clutching at straws in the wind and seeking to bind them together” by asking the court to equate the payment of a private investigator with proof that unlawful means were being used to secure stories.The publisher said stories were obtained “entirely legitimately from information provided by contacts of the journalists responsible, including individuals in the Duke of Sussex’s social circle, press officers and publicists, freelance journalists, photographers and prior reports”.In his written statement, Harry said he learned of alleged unlawful activity by the Daily Mail publisher after he had taken action against the publishers of the Daily Mirror and the Sun.“I am determined to hold Associated accountable, for everyone’s sake,” he said. “If the defendant, the owner of various national newspapers including the Daily Mail, which, by its own definition, is the most influential and popular newspaper in the UK, can evade justice without there being a trial of my claims then what does that say about the industry as a whole and the consequences for our great country?”The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryAssociated NewspapersDaily MailMail on SundayMeghan, the Duchess of SussexNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

The UK had the highest relative increase for all ages, rising more than threefold from 0.12% to 0.39%. In the Netherlands, prevalence more than doubled, from 0.67% to 1.56%.The results of the study, which tracked methylphenidate, dexamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, atomoxetine and guanfacine, waspublishedin the Lancet Regional Health – Europe journal.Adult use increased substantially in all countries, particularly among women. In the UK, prevalence among people aged 25 and over increased from 0.01% in 2010 to 0.20% in 2023, with a more than 20-fold increase in women and 15-fold in men.Although ADHD medication use remained higher among males, the sex gap in treatment narrowed over time and with increasing age, the researchers said.“We observed a consistent increase in ADHD medication use across Europe, but the most striking changes were among adults, especially women,” said Xintong Li, the lead study author at Oxford. “These findings likely reflect growing awareness and diagnosis of adult ADHD, but they also raise important questions about long-term treatment patterns and care needs.”The results also suggested a much lower rate of ADHD medication use compared with the estimated rate of ADHD itself, which is thought to affect about 8% of children and adolescents and 3% of adults globally, the researchers said.They said while it was true that not everyone with ADHD required medication, the findings suggested a substantial proportion may not be doing so.Methylphenidate was the most commonly used medication across all countries. Newer treatments such as lisdexamfetamine and guanfacine showed steady uptake after market approval. However, continuation of treatment after initiation was relatively low, varying substantially between countries.The findings reflected growing recognition of ADHD as a lifelong condition and highlighted the need for healthcare systems to plan for rising demand, particularly amid ongoing ADHD medication shortages in parts of Europe, the researchers said.In the UK, the NHS is overspending by £164m a year on ADHD services, with an increasing amount going to unregulated private assessments, the Guardian reportedearlier this month.Analysis showed that total spending on NHS ADHD services was expected to be more than double existing budgets. Further data showed the amount spent on private ADHD services had more than tripled over three years.Prof Daniel Prieto-Alhambra, a senior author of the study, said: “Understanding how ADHD medications are being used in real-world clinical practice is essential for healthcare planning. These data can help health systems anticipate demand and reduce the risk of future medication shortages, while also highlighting populations that may need closer monitoring.”Explore more on these topicsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderHealthDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their trial is one of the most high-profile national security cases to be heard in Hong Kong since Beijingimposed the law in 2020. The defendants face a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment if convicted. The law has a near-100% conviction rate.The three defendants were key members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, the group that for decades organised the annual vigil for the victims of the1989 Tiananmen Square massacrein Beijing.Until thevigil was bannedin 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, amid a crackdown on free expression in Hong Kong, it was the only mass memorial event for the massacre on Chinese territory. For decades, it was a symbol of Hong Kong’s autonomy from mainland China, an identity that persisted even after Hong Kong was returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997.View image in fullscreenAlbert Ho, seen here in May 2021 being escorted to a prison van to go to a court in Hong Kong, has said he was on ‘the right side of history’.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APChow, an internationally lauded human rights barrister, has been detained for more than four years awaiting trial. Lee and Ho, former Hong Kong legislators, have also been previously sentenced for convictions of unauthorised assembly in relation to protests and vigils held during the 2019-20 pro-democracy movement.In 2021, speaking before his sentencing for his involvement in the 2020 Tiananmen Square vigil,Ho saidthat he was on “the right side of history”.Ho was part of a group of activistswho were convictedfor organising and participating in an unauthorised assembly in August 2019. In 2024, that conviction was upheld by judges on Hong Kong’s top court,a panel which includedthe British judge David Neuberger.The annual vigil organised by the Hong Kong Alliance attracted tens of thousands of attenders each year. Organisers estimated that 180,000 people attendedthe 2019 vigil, which was held days before Hong Kong erupted in a series of protests against the Chinese Communist party’s tightening grip on the city.Under increasing pressure from the authorities, the Alliancedisbanded in 2021.View image in fullscreenLee Cheuk-Yan, photographed here in June 2018, has been previously sentenced for convictions of unauthorised assembly.Photograph: Helen Davidson/The GuardianThursday’s trial will be heard in front of three judges handpicked by the government to hear national security cases, rather than a jury.One of the judges, Alex Lee, recently presided over the trial of Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy former media mogul who wasconvicted on national security chargesin December. The British citizen is awaiting sentencing and faces spending the rest of his life in prison.Other national security cases are making their way through the courts. Wong Kwok-ngon, a political commenter,appeared in courton Tuesday, accused of allegedly divulging details of a national security police investigation in the days after theWang Fuk Court firein November that killed more than 160 people. Wong is charged under Hong Kong’s homegrown national security law, known as article 23, which is separate from the Beijing-enacted security law.Sarah Brooks, Amnesty International’s deputy regional director for Asia, said: “This case is not about national security – it is about rewriting history and punishing those who refuse to forget the victims of the Tiananmen crackdown.”Mark Clifford, the president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, said: “The Chinese regime will stop at nothing to erase history and silence those who seek to keep the truth of Tiananmen alive. Chow Hang-tung, Lee Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho are courageous patriots who have devoted their lives to representing Chinese people denied basic rights. Sadly, they are also symbols of how far Hong Kong’s once-respected justice system has fallen, persecuted for demanding that Beijing keep its promises to the people of Hong Kong.”Explore more on these topicsHong KongAsia PacificProtestChinaTiananmen Square protests 1989newsShareReuse this content"

Power plants burning coal, oil and gas generated 29%.Beatrice Petrovich, an analyst at the Ember thinktank and the lead author of the report, said it was a “major tipping point” that was of strategic importance to the EU, which has grown increasingly panicked about its reliance on other countries for energy.“The importance of this goes beyond the power sector,” she said. “The danger of relying on fossil fuels looms large in destabilised geopolitics.”Europe faces growing tensions with the US – its chief supplier of liquefied natural gas – over Donald Trump’s desire to take over Greenland. At a summit in Davos on Tuesday, the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, criticised Europe’s adoption of solar and wind, arguing that its lack of domestic battery factories risked making it “subservient” to China.“If you are going to be dependent on someone, it had better be your best allies,” he said in a justification of the “America first” approach that he encouraged other countries to emulate.A graph showing the percentage of electricity generation by means of productionAnalysts said the trend was driven by a boom in solar, which generated a record 13% of EU power. In five countries – including the Netherlands, which is not known for its sun – it provided more than 20%.Wind turbines generated slightly less than the previous year, the report found, but remained the second-largest source of electricity, responsible for 17% of EU power.The role of fossil gas increased by 8% – largely because of a weather-related drop in hydropower output – but remained well below its most recent 2019 peak, the report found. Coal-burning fell to a new historic low, accounting for less than 10% of EU power, most of it in Germany and Poland.Solar and wind were “becoming the backbone” of Europe’s power system, said Petras Katinas, an analyst at the Centre for Research onEnergyand Clean Air, who was not involved in the report.“Solar alone grew by more than 20% in a single year, proving that clean power can scale faster than any conventional technology,” he said. “The challenge now is not generation, but how quickly Europe can deploy grids, batteries, and flexibility.”Climate scientists and energy modellers have stressed that most of the electricity needed to power a carbon-free economy will come from rays of sunlight shining on panels and gusts of wind spinning turbines.But European countries have been slow to modernise electricity grids to incorporate large volumes of renewable energy, which varies during the day and is delivered by a distributed network of machines.However, the report found early signs that evening peaks in electricity demand – which typically require burning gas at great cost to bill payers – are starting to be met by batteries.The analysts suggest that Italy, which hosts one-fifth of the EU’s operating battery capacity and has a large pipeline of planned projects, may be about to follow the same trajectory as California, where batteries routinely cover 20% of evening demand peaks and are crowding out gas.Petrovich said this could smooth price spikes. “If I were a policymaker or investor, I would seriously start questioning if plans for new gas plants are inflated – and act to avoid a burden for taxpayers and risk of stranded assets.”Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyWind powerSolar powerEnergyEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They argued that the US under Trump had “descended into competitive authoritarianism”, a system in which elections are held but the ruling party abuses power to stifle dissent and tilt the playing field in its favor.There is no universally accepted definition of democracy. Some argue the US is a “flawed” or “illiberal” democracy, or a democracy facing substantial “autocratization” – a process that began long before Trump came to power a decade ago but which his presidency has rapidly accelerated. Still, others believe the concerns are overblown, or reflect an intense partisan dislike of the current president.Since Trump’s first term, scholars have warned that itcan happen here. But many now say this moment is different – not only because Trump’s approach is more methodical and his desire for vengeance more pronounced, but because he now faces far fewer internal constraints.The president’s Republican critics have mostly been driven from public office and those who remain say theyfear retaliationfor speaking out. Trump has repeatedlycircumvented the GOP-controlled Congress, on spending,tariffsandwar powers. And the US’s European allies are scrambling to respond to Trump’s threats to acquire Greenland, by force if necessary. In aninterviewwith the New York Times earlier this month, Trump declared that the only constraint on his presidential power was “my own morality”.Quantitive assessments of the country’s democratic health point are bleak.Ratings of US democracy by scholars – and Americans overall – dropped “significantly” after Trump took office last year, according to data fromBright Line Watch,a non-partisan democracy-monitoring initiative that surveys political scientists and the public on potential threats and erosions. In itsSeptember survey, experts rated US democracy 54 on a 100-point scale, placing the country closer to illiberal or hybrid regimes than to the full democracies of G7 peers such as Canada or the United Kingdom.An assessment by the Century Foundation’snew democracy indexing projectfound that the US had recorded a staggering 28% “collapse” in democratic health over the past year – from 79/100 in 2024 to 57/100 in 2025, the kind of sudden decline more typically associated with coup or other major shock.Nate Schenkkan, the report’s lead author and a former research director atFreedom House, hoped to help Americans distinguish between the “push-pull” of partisan politics and the “authoritarian behavior” of the current administration.“When a major change happens in a political system, it’s very unevenly distributed,” Schenkkan said. “Certain people will feel it first. Certain communities will feel it harder and faster. And it is really important to recognize that just because it hasn’t come to you doesn’t mean that it won’t.”The sense of alarm is especially acute among those who witnessed democratic backsliding elsewhere. Last year, a network of former intelligence and national security professionals applied the same analytical methods they once used to assess the fragility of democracies abroad to the United States. In October, they published an intelligence-style report, concluding with “moderate to high confidence” that the country was“on a trajectory”toward authoritarian rule.The White House has repeatedly rejected claims that the president’s actions amount to authoritarianism, dismissing such criticism as “deeply unserious” and rooted in what the president calls “Trump derangement syndrome”. When pressed, the president has said he was handed a broad mandate to restore “law and order”, secure elections and dismantle what he has described as a corrupt federal bureaucracy.“Here’s the reality: President Trump was resoundingly re-elected by the American people based on his America First agenda,” White House spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, said in a statement. “Now, he’s delivering on all his campaign promises – that’s democracy in action.”Not all scholars agree that American democracy is in imminent peril. Some are wary that democracy indices rely too heavily on subjective indicators, which can amplify pessimism and media alarm over objective markers of democratic breakdown.“I think we should be a little cautious – not that the experts are necessarily wrong,” saidAndrew Little, a political scientist at UC Berkeley, whose researchhas foundthat scholars who rate democratic threats tend toward pessimism. He favors a “minimalist” approach to measuring the health of a democracy: “Is the country having free elections, and are people following the results of those elections?”Especially worrying for scholars of contemporary authoritarianism is the president’s close relationship with tech billionaires, or the so-called “broligarchy”, many of whom donated to and were front and center at his inauguration ceremony a year ago. At the start of his presidency, Trump appointed the Tesla and SpaceX head, Elon Musk, to lead the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge.Oligarchs typically exert influence from the outside, saidRuth Ben-Ghiat, a prominent historian and author ofStrongmen: Mussolini to the Present. But with Doge, the “oligarch of oligarchs was allowed to come inside the government and was basically given the key to access our treasury, the payment systems and data systems of a superpower”, she said. “So we are innovating the autocratic playbook.”While at the White House, Musk took a chainsaw to the federal government, firing thousands of workers in sweeping, indiscriminate cuts that were quickly challenged in court. Estimates suggestmore than 300,000 federal workersleft in the Trump-era exodus, draining the government of top scientists, researchers and analysts.Traditionally autocratic regimes expand social services for supporters as a way to buy loyalty, while stripping away their political rights, Ben-Ghiat said: “That’s how they get so many people to go along and look the other way.” But Trump, she said,has diverged from that model: rather than shoring up the social safety net, his administration, abetted by congressional Republicans, has moved to “kneecap” public health and social programs, including childcare benefits – cuts Democrats plan toforegroundin this year’s midterm elections.Even the most grim assessments stress that democratic decline is not irreversible – and warn that fatalism itself can accelerate backsliding.“History suggests that it is possible to recover from democratic erosion – but far from a guarantee,”Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College and a co-director of Bright Line Watch, said by email.Staying engaged, protesting, voting and supporting Republicans who dissent were all ways to contest Trump’s power, he said, adding: “The survival of democracy depends on people believing in its continued viability and fighting to defend it.”Last year, millions joinedNo Kings ralliesto denounce a president they say has wielded power like a monarch.At the ballot box, Democratswon a series of victoriesin the 2025 off-year elections, and are well positioned to retake the House – and possibly the Senate – in the 2026 midterms. Trump, meanwhile, remainsunpopularnationally – a vulnerability for his party heading into this year’s elections. A CNN pollfoundthat a majority of Americans believe Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, and 58% call his first year a failure.Trump’s fragile political standing is one indication that the administration’s narrative is increasingly at “odds with what people see – their lived experience”, Ben-Ghiat said. The more that gap widens, she said, “the more people will wake up”.She pointed to Minneapolis, where Trump has threatened to invoke theInsurrection Actas a response to protests against the killing of a 37-year-old US citizen by a federal immigration officer. Instead of retreating, hundreds of Minnesotans registered for training to become“observers” of enforcement activity.In the courts, Trump’s executive actions have been met with robust legal resistance. The ACLU, which has filed over 200 legal challenges against the Trump administration in the past year, touted a nearly65% success ratein “defeating, delaying, or diluting federal policies”.“We judge the moment we’re in not by examining the president’s actions alone, but by evaluating the system’s response to those provocations as well,”Ben Wizner, deputy legal director at the ACLU, said.Despite the supreme court’s conservative supermajority – cemented by Trump in his first term – and the president’s sustained campaign to delegitimize judges, Wizner retained a measured optimism: “I am confident that we will emerge from this latest stress test to our democracy with our fundamental rights intact.”Looking ahead, many scholars predict Trump’s assault on democratic norms and the rule of law is likely to worsen in the lead-up to the 2026 midterms – an erosion that could become entrenched if Democrats fail to secure a check on his presidency by winning back a chamber of Congress.The most recent Bright Line survey found experts increasingly worried about political violence following the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Concerns also focused on the administration’s aggressive response to peaceful protest, the weaponization of government agencies to punish political opponents, and the president’s unprecedented push to gerrymander congressional districts in Republican states.Elsewhere, Democrats and political observers have raised fears that Trump could dispatch the national guard to polling places as an intimidation tactic, while others worry about the expansion of ICE operations in Democratic-run cities.In an interview with Reuters last week, Trump mused that he had accomplished so much in 2025, “we shouldn’t even have an election” in 2026. The White House said he was “simply joking”. Though the federal government cannot unilaterally cancel the midterms, Trump has already takenextraordinary stepsto try to change how elections are conducted.“Autocrats try to convince us that we’re hopeless and helpless. That they’re always going to be there, and there’s no point in resisting,” Ben-Ghiat said. But political dissidents of repressive regimes know better, she said, recalling a conversation withYulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leaderAlexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal colony.She had asked Navalnaya how she viewed the US after Trump’s return to power. “You still have elections,” she replied. “And you can use them.”This article was amended on 21 January 2026. Donald Trump did not place his hand on a Bible while taking his second oath of office in January 2025, as an earlier version said. Also, the original headline was amended to indicate it has been a year since Trump’s inauguration, not his election.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpThe first year of Trump 2.0Trump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They will no longer pretend the US is a reliable ally, or even that the old western alliance exists.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump half withdrew his threat to invade Greenland in an unnervingly rambling speech at Davos.Photograph: Laurent Gilliéron/ReutersTrump’s threat to invade Greenland – half-withdrawn in his unnervingly ramblingDavos speechon Wednesday – and his glorification of the use of tariffs to intimidate his allies have been the final straw. As such – on the first anniversary of his second term – the taboos around denying him the role of “leader of the free world” seem to have been broken.Just as the greengrocer in Havel’s story took down the sign in the shop window praising the communist empire and started to tell the truth about the sham in which he had been living, so leaders of some of the west’s liberal middle powers appear intent on shedding the collective lie about the continued value of a partnership with the US. Whether this collective discovery of backbone is more than rhetorical, time will tell.Carney, perhaps the most articulate of those giving voice to this sentiment,vowed he would no longer live in a state of nostalgia, waiting for an old world to return.This is rupture not a transition, he said. Without once mentioning the US, he marked “the end of a pleasant fiction and the beginning of a brutal reality where the geopolitics of the great powers is subject to no constraints”.The former governor of the Bank of England was far from alone in his diagnosis that the old, deeply imperfect rules-based order has been trampled underfoot by Trump. Speaking to the European parliament on Wednesday, the European Commission’s president,Ursula von der Leyen, said: “We now live in a world defined by raw power, whether economic or military, technological or geopolitical. In an increasingly lawless world, Europe needs its own levers of power.”View image in fullscreenFinland’s president, Alexander Stubb, attends Davos.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, repeatedlybelittledand mocked by Trump this week, was at his most frank: the world is heading towards a “rule-free” system, where imperialist ambitions weigh heavily on multilateralism; the international bodies that once served to resolve problems are weakened, even abandoned; the US “is openly seeking to weaken and subordinate Europe”, he said.The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, the author of a book entitled The Triangle of Power: Rebalancing the New World Order, argued that liberalEuropewas being squeezed twice over by the US because Washington no longer regards Europe as important in the hierarchy of US interests and because it is seen as a woke, ideological enemy.Nato chief urges ‘thoughtful diplomacy’ after US treasury secretary’s jibe at DenmarkRead moreStubb said: “The people around Trump in the Maga movement see themselves as leading a big shift in the same way that Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher did after the Keynesian consensus collapsed. They are leading a movement against liberalism, globalisation and interdependence.”The leader most reluctant to join this public confessional was the dogmatically pragmaticKeir Starmer. Without mentioning the UK, Carney sent a message to Starmer about the flaws in his position. “When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon,” he said, “we negotiate from weakness.” This is not sovereignty, he added, and the only choice for “in-between” countries was to compete with one another for favour or combine “to create a third path with impact”.It was notable that Ed Miliband, the UK’s energy secretary, made a point of praising Carney’s speech, saying “the situation has changed” between Starmer and the US. His remarks reflect the growing division inside the Labour leadership about the need not just to voice differences with Trump but to join with others in challenging the whole ideology.View image in fullscreenMark Carney sent a message to Keir Starmer about the flaws in the position of ‘in-between countries’.Photograph: Arnd Wiegmann/ReutersWedded to the US because of the nuclear and security relationship, British diplomats have only seen the negatives in a rift with its indispensable ally. But Starmer has over the past year started to see the benefits in investing in a network of middle-power alliances to withstand the behemoths of China, Russia and the US.Starmer’s allies say the obvious place for him to take this is by engaging with Macron to reopen the stalled talks on a closer defence alliance with Europe, including access to the European defence industry. Those talks fell apart over the high entry fee into that market demanded by the EU.So many European powers now share a common diagnosis that the US’s values-based realism requires Europe and the UK to work more closely than ever.That requires taking the world as it is, and not as one would like it to be, one of Stubb’s favourite phrases. It means trying, if possible, to find points of agreement with the US on Greenland through a possible permanent Nato presence, and on Ukraine through security guarantees. What can be salvaged from the relationship should be salvaged.It does not mean giving gratuitous offence, but it does mean, like Havel’s greengrocer, “naming reality”. As Carney counselled his fellow leaders:“When middle powers criticise economic intimidation from one direction but stay silent when it comes from another, we are keeping the sign in the window.”For Starmer this would be a huge wrench, breaking with 80 years of foreign policy. It may be that Trump has left him no choice.Explore more on these topicsDavosDavos 2026Donald TrumpTrump administrationMark CarneyCanadaFranceanalysisShareReuse this content"

But before long, the meeting had some very real political consequences.The brief encounter set off a chain of events including a call from Johnson to Donald Trump, a social media blast from the US president against the Chagos deal, and on Wednesday, an unprecedented public rebuff to Trump fromKeir Starmer.“President Trump deployed words on Chagos yesterday that were different to his previous words of welcome and support. He deployed those words for the express purpose of putting pressure on me and Britain,” the prime ministertold the Commons.“He wants me to yield on my position, and I’m not going to do so … I will not yield. Britain will not yield on our principles and values about the future of Greenland and the threats of tariffs.”Starmer toughens rhetoric on Trump and decries pressure over GreenlandRead moreThe developments of the past 48 hours initially blindsided Downing Street but have resulted in a new, more combative stance from the prime minister. One that, some believe, could fundamentally alter the dynamic in his relationship with Trump and redraw US-UK relations for the foreseeable future.“The future of Greenland is for people of Greenland and Kingdom of Denmark alone, and tariffs to pressure allies is completely wrong,” a spokesperson for the prime minister said afterwards. “This is a significant moment, a national moment.”The Labour government agreed in October 2024 to hand over sovereignty of Chagos to Mauritius. Underthe terms of the deal, the UK will maintain an initial 99-year lease of Diego Garcia, where it runs a military base jointly with the US, at a cost projected officially to be £3.4bn.The deal was agreed under pressure from Washington, British officials say, adding that their American counterparts were worried about what would happen to the base if Mauritius won a case at the international court of justice over its sovereignty.Almost immediately, the Reform leader Nigel Farage started warning that the incoming Trump administration did not like the deal,telling the Commonsit had been an “enormous mistake” to sign it before the election.Farage’s warnings prompted an intensive lobbying operation from Downing Street.Officials, led by the then ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, hurried to reassure Trump’s allies the deal was in US interests. They believed they had been successful when Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, signed a statement last May backing the deal.“Following a comprehensive interagency review, the Trump administration determined that this agreement secures the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint US-UK military facility at Diego Garcia,”Rubio wrote.One person involved said persuading Rubio to sign that statement took “a lot of talk, explaining and persuading” from the British side.But while those talks were taking place, British conservatives also kept pressing their case.Last September, a group of prominent right-wingers – including the Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith, the Labour peer Kate Hoey and the television historian David Starkey –wrote a letterto Trump arguing China and Russia could use the deal to work against US military interests. One of those who signed was the British-American commentator Nile Gardiner, a key intermediary between those close to Farage and the Trump administration.For several months the efforts failed, with no sign of the US administration shifting position. But as Trump has renewed his interest in taking over Greenland in recent days, British right-wingers saw an opportunity to press their case again.On Monday night, according to Tory sources, Badenoch told Johnson that even though the US had welcomed the deal, it was actually weakening British and American interests.The message was repeated to the speakeron GB Newsby Farage himself, who said: “I don’t know why America has not been more forthright in saying this is a bad idea.” That evening, Johnson was later to tell MPs, he spoke to Trump, where British officials believe he raised the Chagos issue.Hours later, the president’s bombshell dropped on his Truth Social platform. “The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired,”he wrote.Some Labour figures believe the government’s position has not been helped by the fact there is no permanent ambassador in Washington to make the counter argument. Christian Turner, Mandelson’s replacement, will not begin until the beginning of February.Starmer argued on Wednesday that Trump’s real purpose was to put pressure on him to acquiesce to the president’s plan to buy Greenland, rather than to unravel the Chagos deal itself. His allies point out the fact that they were mentioned in the same sentence, and insist they will continue to pilot the legislation ratifying it through parliament.While the president’s post about Chagos might have prompted Starmer’s unusually outspoken criticism of the president, the prime minister’s allies say he had been toying with taking a tougher stance since the weekend when Trump began threatening Denmark’s allies with additional tariffs.One ally said the prime minister regarded the threat of tariffs as “completely unacceptable” and made him rethink his previously cautious approach to criticising the president in public.Allies also say he feels particularly aggrieved that Trump has criticised the UK despite its military assistance when the USrecently seizeda Russian oil tanker in the Atlantic.Starmer was also motivated by domestic political concerns however, hoping to depict Badenoch as supine before the Trump administration, and Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, as only interested in gesture politics.“Using the use of tariffs to pressure allies is completely wrong,” Starmer’s spokesperson said on Wednesday. “But [the prime minister] also set out the importance of the US-UK relationship, not least for Ukraine, in the face of leaders like Ed Davey reaching for gesture politics over a really serious issue.”Despite all the bluster of this week however, the political realities are unchanged. Starmer is pressing ahead with the Chagos deal, while Trump is threatening Greenland but is promising not to use force to take control of the territory.As Starmer’s official spokesperson told reporters on Wednesday: “The situation remains the same.”Explore more on these topicsChagos IslandsKemi BadenochMike JohnsonKeir StarmeranalysisShareReuse this content"

Obviously, I try to burp at home and not in our open-plan office, but it depends on what I’ve had for lunch. Sometimes it just has to come out, you know?That’s more information about your digestive tract than I need, given we’re talking about whether houses themselves need burping.A house doesn’t have a stomach. So: no.“House burping” is what America’s content creators have christened the German practice ofLüften, or airing out their homes by opening windows, presumably because it’s a bit like burping a baby. TikTok is full of them enthusiastically describing it as a “mom hack”, or explaining it’s “supposed to keep sickness away”.Does thisLüftenkeep sickness away, then?It’s supposed to shift stale air, ensure adequate ventilation and prevent mould buildup, all of which are good for people and places (Lüftenis even mandatory in some leases in Germany). The idea that it’s a health essential got even more popular during the pandemic, whenChancellor Merkel saidLüftencould be “one of the cheapest and most effective ways” to prevent the spread of Covid.And what do the Germans think ofLüftengoing viral Stateside?Mostly they seem to be mocking these TikToks with their ownamused reaction videosand comments like “America discovers fresh air. God help me …” and “Lüften is a TIKTOKTREND?!”.But they must basically approve, right? Make America Fresh Again!Actually,Lüftenisn’t uncontroversial, even in Germany. Paradoxically, Germans are also reputed to be extremely averse to draughts. There’s awell-known retortto people who insist on airing when it’s Baltic:Erfroren sind schon viele, erstunken ist noch keiner.Meaning?Many people have frozen to death, but no one has ever died from a bad smell.That’s not what my colleagues say when I’m eating my sardine and egg salad al desko. Are there other objections?Yes –in 2021, researchers suggestedLüftencould be undermining energy efficiency, thus contributing to greenhouse emissions. As researcher Amelie Bauertold Politico, despite living in well-ventilated buildings that didn’t need airing, residents “stuck to their habits and kept opening windows”. PlusLüftencan lead to relationship breakdown.What?!In a report on the house-burping trend,the Washington Postspoke to a woman who said her half-German boyfriend’s insistence on airing their Berlin flat overnight, however cold it was, “actually became one of the bigger friction points in our relationship” (apparently three bats flew in one night). They split up.Yikes. Are you supposed to leave windows open all night?No. According to aGerman foreign ministryInstagram account that explains German culture to the uninitiated,Stoßlüften(that’s shock ventilation – opening a few windows wide) only takes a few minutes.

Hemocked Emmanuel Macron’s aviator sunglasses, chided Mark Carney (“Canada lives because of the United States”), asserted that the Swiss are “only good because of us” and had a dig at Denmark for losing Greenland “in six hours” during the second world war.But beyond the fractious rhetoric, the US president brought a deeper message on Wednesday that sought to unify the west rather than divide it. It was his most dark, insidious and sinister project of all.Trump surmised: Yes, we might have our internal squabbles, but I am bringing tough love because we are all in this together. We are the standard bearers of western civilisation. We must resist the barbarian hordes. We must save the white man.The ageing president, who in 2024 complained, “We got a lot of bad genes in our country right now,”told the World Economic Forumthat he was “derived from Europe”, namely: “100% Scotland, my mother; 100% German, my father. And we believe deeply in the bonds we share with Europe as a civilisation.”Speak hysterically and carry a big stick: Trump’s foreign policy threatsRead moreHe lamented that “certain places inEuropeare not even recognisable, frankly, any more”, blaming culprits that included “unchecked mass migration”. Trump said: “It’s horrible what they’re doing to themselves. They’re destroying themselves, these beautiful, beautiful places. We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones.”What came next was pure racism as Trump reflected on immigration to his own country, where he has made the Somali community aspecial targetof his deportation rhetoric after recent governmentfraud casesin Minnesota in which a majority of defendants had Somali roots.“We’re cracking down on more than $19bn in fraud that was stolen by Somalian bandits,” he said. “Can you believe that Somalia – they turned out to be higher IQ than we thought. I always say these are low-IQ people. How did they go intoMinnesotaand steal all that money?”Then he got to theheart of the matter: “The situation in Minnesota reminds us that the west cannot mass-import foreign cultures which have failed to ever build a successful society of their own. I mean, we’re taking people from Somalia, and Somalia is a failed – it’s not a nation. Got no government, got no police, got no nothing.” (Somalia does, in fact, have a government, though not democratically elected.)He launched a bitter tirade atIlhan Omar, a Somali-born Democratic congresswoman who is a US citizen. Then he insisted: “The explosion of prosperity and conclusion and progress that built the west did not come from our tax codes. It ultimately came from our very special culture.“This is the precious inheritance that America and Europe have in common, and we share it. We share it but we have to keep it strong. We have to become stronger, more successful and more prosperous than ever. We have to defend that culture and rediscover the spirit that lifted the west from the depths of the dark ages to the pinnacle of human achievement.”Trump’s speech had the fingerprints ofStephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and architect of his draconian immigration policy, all over it. It chimed with an entire discourse of white identity politics festering on the US right.It is there in the“great replacement” theory,a conspiratorial notion that demographic change is engineered to replace white majorities with non-white populations, undermining traditional culture. It is there in Trump’s decision to grant asylum to white South Africans because of a fictitious “white genocide” said to be taking place in their country. It is there in the rabid ideology underpinning Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) thuggish assault on immigrants in Minneapolis.It is also there in Miller’s worldview, which haslong promotedracist fears of demographic replacement of white people and civilisation decline. He has become the editor who turns Trump’s pub chatter into “Make America great again” scripture.Speaking at the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk’s funeral last year,Miller said: “Our lineage and our legacy hails back to Athens, to Rome, to Philadelphia, to Monticello. Our ancestors built the cities. They produced the art and architecture. They built the industry. We stand for what is good, what is virtuous and what is noble.”Only Miller could have spent last Christmas watching a Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra family TV show from 1967 and had this takeaway: “Imagine watching that and thinking America needed infinity migrants from the third world,” hetweeted. (There was an instant backlash from X users noting that both Martin and Sinatra were the sons of immigrants.)Elon Musk, a white manborn in apartheid in South Africaand now the richest person in the world, has amplified such ideas. His feed on X, the social media platform that he owns, is still replete with dire warnings of white civilisation under siege. Earlier this month he retweeted with a “100%” endorsement a post declaring that: “If white men become a minority, we will be slaughtered … White solidarity is the only way to survive.”Trump’s far-right allies have been worrying of late that he has become distracted by global conquest – Iran, Venezuela,Greenland– and losing sight of his creed of “America first”. On Wednesday he may have been addressing the wealthy elites in Davos but, as ever, his true target audience was the one back home. The message: I am still the great white hope.Explore more on these topicsDavos 2026Donald TrumpRaceDavosSomaliaFar right (US)Ilhan OmaranalysisShareReuse this content"

It was fun, but in future snowstorms I won’t be rushing to the pubRobyn VinterWed 21 Jan 2026 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 12.55 ESTShareThe Tan Hill Inn, Yorkshire DalesIn all my years of reporting, nothing seems to fascinate people more than the four days I spent snowed in at Britain’s highest pub last year. It was early January and the Met Office had issued severe warnings for snow. It dawned on me that people were about to live out a British fantasy of being snowed in at their local pub. I knew where I needed to be: The Tan Hill Inn, high up in the wilderness on the very northern edge of theYorkshireDales national park.I packed a bag and picked up Gary Calton, the acclaimed Guardian photographer. Fat snowflakes appeared out of the night sky just hours after we were welcomed into the warmth of the pub. Inside, drinks were flowing and the laughs forthcoming as the locked-in customers settled into the novelty of the experience. Within hours it was clear we weren’t going anywhere. Then at 8pm we had word that the road to the pub was about to be closed and anyone who had not intended to stay the night would need to attempt a swift exit. For us, by then it was too dark and treacherous to risk it.Gary and I had managed to get the last two beds and, though I like the camaraderie of communal lodging, a room of bunkbeds filled with half a dozen drunk men with wet socks isn’t the ideal condition for a restful night’s sleep. Over the next couple of days we got to know people from all over the world, united by this unique experience. We ate together, joked and played games together, had a mass snowball fight and a disco. One man told me it had been “one of the best times of my entire life”.View image in fullscreenThe Tan Hill Inn. A snow plough manages to clear a route to and out from the pub.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianI was writing stories and filing them as I went along, but it was hard to think coherently with the constant rabble of different antics, and, with the small pub surrounded by tundra, there was nowhere to escape for a moment to myself. I pretended I needed the toilet on a few occasions in order to have some personal space.On the morning of day four we got word that the snowplough was coming. The timings would be tight. The harsh wind was whipping the snow over roads as quickly as they were cleared. We dug the car out, ready to leave.Snowed in at Yorkshire’s Tan Hill Inn – in picturesRead moreAfter seeing the chain of vehicles wind away and out of sight, we jumped in and attempted to follow. Gary shouted like a rally co-driver as I steered left and right, occasionally experiencing the eerie near-weightlessness of a skid. These were roads that required concentration at the best of times – steep and winding with some sheer drops at the roadside.But our best efforts – and the £300 I’d spent on winter tyres – ultimately couldn’t save us. The car slid downhill and we heard a dull crunch as it deposited itself on a snow bank, wheels spinning. Miles from another human being, we realised we had left the snow shovel at the pub.Using our gloved hands and a camera tripod, over a period of about an hour we freed the car. It was almost spooky when we made it to gritted roads and civilisation, encountering ordinary people going about their day. The car was juddering violently as I drove – apparently the crash had done some damage – but we had to find somewhere to file our words and pictures before that day’s deadline. With some irony, we ended up in a pub.The final Tan Hill Inn story I wrote – exhausted, sweaty and with still-shaking hands – made it into the annual Bedside Guardian book. It’s a sweet memento of a bizarre experience – one I’d recommend, though in future snowstorms I won’t be rushing to the pub.Explore more on these topicsPubsThe pub that changed meSnowYorkshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As they return, the soft-singing, country-hopping sensation looks backWed 21 Jan 2026 11.31 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 13.18 ESTShareIf you were to imagine the recent evolution of music inEuropeas a series of scenes from a Where’s Wally?-style puzzle book, one bespectacled, lanky figure would pop up on almost every page. There he is in mid-90s London, handing out flyers for his first band Peachfuzz. Here he is in NME at the dawn of the new millennium, fronting folk duo Kings of Convenience and spearheading the new acoustic movement. There he is strumming his guitar in the vanguard of Norway’s “Bergen wave”. Then he’s off spinning records in Berlin nightclubs during the city’s “poor but sexy” post-millennial years. By the 2010s, he’s driving a renaissance of Italian chamber pop as part of La Comitiva, his bandmates hailing from the southern tip of Sicily.It’s hard to think of a figure more musically cosmopolitan than Erlend Otre Øye, connecting the dots across a continent where national scenes rarely overlap – and making magic happen. No wonder his debut solo album, with 10 tracks recorded in 10 different cities, was called Unrest. Of all his reincarnations, though, the one that has best endured (if you go by Spotify) is his four-piece, The Whitest Boy Alive. And this spring and summer, they’re reuniting for a tour ofMexicoandEuropeto celebrate the 20th anniversary of Dreams, their debut album.No other band has come along and done it better than usAfter the success of Quiet Is the New Loud , the first album from Kings of Convenience, his congenial bandmate Eirik Glambek Bøe suffered a breakdown and opted to stay in Bergen to study psychology. “Eirik was never into music as a way of living,” says Øye, via video call from a beach cabin on Mexico’s Pacific coast, his sun-kissed hair and peach shorts announcing how far he has come from rainyNorway. “He was just into it as a nice thing to be doing. I was into making it a career.”And so, at the start of the millennium, Øye moved to Berlin. Despite its cool reputation, the German capital “was a bit of a wasteland for actual played music. So many people who went there became DJs, stroked their chins and talked interestingly about the musical references they made. They didn’t strive to really convince, to really make.”View image in fullscreenJoy Division meets Art Garfunkel ... the Whitest Boy Alive in 2006.Photograph: Scruffy Bird PRHe befriended Marcin Öz, a Polish DJ at the since dissolved clubbing institution WMF. Even though they didn’t share the same taste in electronic music – Öz played minimal techno, Øye beats with breaks – they were both driven. “We were two ambitious people who really had a lot of petrol to go places.” At a rehearsal space on the Karl-Marx-Allee boulevard, they met keyboard player Daniel Nentwig and drummer Sebastian Maschat. “We realised Maschat was a really good drummer: he could play house music beats on an actual drum set, which in 2004 very few bands could do, other than perhaps the Rapture and LCD Soundsystem.”Dreams still sounds gorgeous: unashamedly melancholy indie pop, drilled to the buildup-and-release patterns of deep house, its whispered tales of friendships made and loves lost propped up by a rhythm section that is both as stripped-back as a garage band and as tight as a gang of session musicians. Think Joy Division fronted by Art Garfunkel. In terms of the mood, rather than the music, it was the 21st century’s first answer to Everything But the Girl: music that a generation could dance to but also be sad to.Yet their reception in the Anglosphere was lukewarm. The Guardian was reminded of “Jamiroquai’s most soulless moments”. Pitchfork called Dreams “toothless”, as if “Kraftwerk had produced Fleetwood Mac”. Did he mind? “If you look at it now,” he shrugs, “all the bands the critics did like haven’t really made it that far. So they were a bit wrong.”Perhaps the problem was in the name. The Whitest Boy Alive was the result of a self-effacing quip Øye made in an interview with a German music magazine to describe his own musical tastes. Öz thought it was funny. “It stopped us from having any success in the US in the beginning,” says Øye, “because in the US, people are afraid of anything that could be racially connected. Which is ironic, because in many ways the music is not that white at all.”View image in fullscreenBreakdown crisis ... Øye, right, and Eirik Glambek Bøe, AKA Kings of Convenience.Photograph: David Sillitoe/The GuardianThis would be a familiar tale: Kings of Convenience’s most obvious musical inspiration wasn’t folk but Brazilian bossa nova. The Whitest Boy Alive’s best-known track was 1517, almost definitely the only love song about the Reformation ever to have featured on a Fifa video game. It evolves around a (not-very-white) tresillo rhythm that is typical of reggaeton.Their tour will take in Potsdam, Paris and Copenhagen. But the one country where the band has had the greatest impact is not in Europe. “It’s Mexico, for sure,” Øye says. “We played a festival in 2021 – and there were 8,000 people who knew every word to every song. It was an incredible party.”The Whitest Boy Alive broke up in 2014, with a statement that hinted at internal strife and cited their song Golden Cage (“You knew what you wanted and you fought so hard / Just to find yourself sitting in a golden cage”). Øye reflects: “We were trying to make a new album, but with too much democracy. You could say that was the straitjacket, the golden cage.”He blames his hearing problems on the British band SwervedriverThe main reason the band stopped is less dramatic, although tragically ironic given Øye’s love of hushed vocals and clean, undistorted guitar sounds. He has tinnitus and hyperacusis, the latter causing an unusually low tolerance for environmental noise that makes rehearsal studios and indoor gigs almost unbearable.“It’s a constant peep,” he says stoically. “You get used to it after a while. It’s not so troublesome any more, but if I continue being in loud situations, it starts to go higher.” Half-jokingly, he blames a gig he attended by the British alternative rock band Swervedriver in Bergen in 1997.In the early 2010s, Øye bought a house in Syracuse, Sicily, and moved there with his mother, who died in 2016. He has spent six months a year there since, which seems a remarkably long period in Øye time. Has he finally discovered stillness? “Where I live in Syracuse, it’s green all year round. That’s fantastic. But having grown up in Norway, almost any country will be an improvement. People think Norway’s full of snow. To me, Norway is just trees with no leaves. Autumn is two weeks and the rest is just barren, lifeless, grey. It’s so very grim.”View image in fullscreenDriving a renaissance of Italian chamber pop … performing as part of La Comitiva in 2021.Photograph: Rodolfo Sassano/AlamyI’m sceptical about the anti-patriotism. Surely his homeland is the biggest cultural superpower Europe has right now, with Joachim Trier’sSentimental Valueand its star Renate Reinsvesweeping up film awards,Karl Ove Knausgårdleading contemporary fiction and Erling Haaland breaking record after record in the Premier League? Norway is even going to the World Cup.Øye can’t hide his excitement when I mention the football. “It’s interesting to talk about Haaland because he is not very Norwegian. He’s not your typical modest Norwegian prime minister character. He’s more of a star that wants to be treated like a star.” He cites the Law of Jante, a code of conduct first articulated in a 1930s novel that still has some effect on Scandinavian etiquette: don’t think you are anything special.“I’m very proud of Norwegian egalitarianism,” he says. “But I feel that, culturally, we’ve taken a huge step forward by allowing Haaland to be the star and just playing around him. Finally we have a good team, because we’re allowing people to be a bit different.” Is there a bit of Haaland in Europe’s indie-music Wally, forever wandering around the continent because he too wants to find a team happy to play around him?Øye rejects the comparison, but I wonder if that’s just more Jante. Because when I ask him why he got his old band back together, he says: “The main reason is no one else can play our music. I mean, it’s not as if other bands have come along and done it much better than us. No, it’s still only The Whitest Boy Alive who can do The Whitest Boy Alive.”The Whitest Boy Alive play Waschhaus Potsdam on 25 August; Vega Copenhagen on 27 August and Cabaret Sauvage in Paris on 31 August.Explore more on these topicsCultureNorwayEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s vital to put young people’s mental health firstKemi Badenoch is the leader of the Conservative partyBadenoch tells Starmer to ‘just get on’ with under-16s social media banWed 21 Jan 2026 11.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 11.10 ESTShareThe Conservative party believes in freedom. We believe people should be able to make choices about their own lives. That they, not the state, should decide what they do. But freedom is not a given. It depends on something more fundamental: the ability to make good choices in the first place. And that ability is not fully formed in children.For too long, Britain has treated childhood as an afterthought. We know that a child’s early years shape the trajectory of their entire life. Yet our political system has too often focused more on repairing damage in adulthood rather than preventing it early on. That is a dereliction of our duty as politicians.Children’s brains are still developing. Their impulse control, emotional regulation and ability to assess risk are not the same as an adult’s. That is why we have age limits on alcohol, a legal age of consent and safeguarding requirements in schools. To most people this is common sense. And yet, in one crucial area, we have decided to suspend that logic entirely.Children today are allowed to spend hours a day online, exposed to violence, pornography and extremist content. Content that we know is linked to rising anxiety, poor sleep, reduced concentration andknock-on effects on behaviour and education. Content designed not for children, but for adults, optimised to capture attention and maximise engagement.I am a firm believer that you can overcome a huge amount in life with the right knowledge and training. But by exposing children, at scale, to technologies that erode attention spans and disrupt learning, we are making that task harder. We are denying them the mental resilience they will need to shape their own futures.That’s why we in the Conservative party have acted. Last year, theConservativesannounced our plan to ban smartphones in schools.And this month, we have gone further by becoming the first party in Britain to support aban on social media for under-16s. As Conservatives, we believe parents are best placed to raise their own children. But as a parent myself, I also know this: no one can be all-seeing. Children want to be doing what their friends are doing, and are clever enough to figure out how to do it. That’s why I know that thevast majority of parents support a ban, however difficult it will be to implement.My husband and I are raising our children in a world that is more demanding than the one we grew up in. Their generation are growing up more anxious and worried than in previous years. They aremore anxious than previous generations. It would be foolish to blame a single cause, but it would be equally foolish to pretend social media plays no role. Children should be free to grow up and grow into themselves. They should be free to make mistakes, to develop a sense of self and to emerge as healthy, confident young adults with productive lives ahead of them.This is also about economics, not just health and wellbeing. A generation that struggles to concentrate will struggle to study. And a generation that cannot study will struggle to build the companies of the future, serve in our armed forces, or sustain our public services.By restricting social media use for children, we aren’t just protecting children. We can also give more freedoms to adults online. We will no longer need to contort digital spaces to be universally “child-friendly”, or impose blanket restrictions on speech and content because children might see it. If we stop treating children like adults, we can stop treating adults like children too.What is striking is how wide the consensus on this issue has become. Campaigners, clinicians, parents and experts are aligned. Even61 Labour MPshave urged their own leadership to support action.As usual,Keir Starmerand his Labour government haven’t done the thinking on this. The one thing they can normally be relied upon for is a U-turn. But so far they haven’t even managed that. Instead, they’ve announced yet another consultation, kicking the can down the road.We will not be bought off with vague promises of a “national conversation” about whether we should get children off these adult platforms. The prime minister must set out how he will act and by when. The crossbench peer Lady Kidron, who supports Conservative peerLord Nash’s amendmentin the House of Lords, is right to say Starmer’s approach “is not leading; it is not governing”. He is “doing nothing – slowly”, which is “the very epitome of party before country”.Let’s just get on with it.Today, the House of Lords will vote on measures to get children off adult social media platforms and I am proud that it is the Conservative party that is driving this change. Putting our children’s mental health first is the right thing to do. How much longer will we have to wait until the government agrees?Kemi Badenoch is the leader of the Conservative party and MP for North West EssexExplore more on these topicsSocial media banOpinionSocial mediaChildrenKeir StarmerLabourConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

He is a protectionist, not a free trader. He thinks the climate crisis is a hoax and is suspicious of multilateral organisations. He prefers power plays to dialogue and he doesn’t have any time for the “woke” capitalism that Davos has been keen to promote, with its focus on gender equality and ethical investment. The shindig’s organisers, the World Economic Forum (WEF), had to agree tosideline those issuesin order to secure Trump’s appearance.For decades, anti-globalisation protesters have sought to shut down the WEF. Thanks to Trump’s threat to take over Greenland, their prayers may soon be answered. In today’s world,Davosis an irrelevance and it seems fitting that Trump should be on hand this week to deliver the coup de grace to the liberal international rules-based order that the WEF prides itself on upholding.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, was right when he said there has been a shift to a “world without rules”, and there is some irony in that, given that the liberal international rules-based order that has been in place since the second world war was largely a US construct.Pared back to basics, the liberal rules-based order has been just another way of describing US hegemony, with Europe as its junior partner. As part of this arrangement, the US guaranteed Europe’s security through Nato, and acted as the world’s consumer of last resort. Even before the arrival of Trump, this version of a liberal order was breaking down.There are a number of reasons for this. For a start, the institutional framework that makes and enforces the rules is no longer fit for purpose. The economic architecture of the postwar world – the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank – is now more than eight decades old and was designed along specifications drawn up by policymakers in Washington when US power was at its zenith.The US was granted an effective veto over IMF andWorld Bankdecisions. By dint of a gentleman’s agreement, it has the right to appoint the president of the World Bank, while Europe is allowed to choose the managing director of the IMF. Powerful emerging countries such as China, India and Brazil see no reason why the governance of the IMF and World Bank should reflect the world as it stood when they were created in 1944, as opposed to the one that exists today.View image in fullscreenThe British economist John Maynard Keynes (centre) at the UN international monetary and financial conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, July 1944.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesIt is a similar story when it comes to trade. The liberalisation deals that reduced tariffs and increased market access were effectively a stitch-up between the US and Europe. Terms were agreed by the US and its western allies and then imposed on other countries. As developing countries have grown in size and importance, they have proved increasingly resistant to the idea that they should meekly accept agreements that offer them so little. Increasingly, the rest of the world sees little merit in a system weighted in favour of the rich developed nations. It has been more than 30 years since the last global trade agreement.Since then, the US’s position as the world’s economic hegemon has come under serious threat as the result of China’s rapid growth. Europe is in a worse state than the US. It has grown much more slowly, displays no signs of matching US innovation, and relies on it for its security. If Trump did decide to take Greenland by force, Europe collectively would be unable to stop him.The rules-based order is under internal as well as external threat. It was one thing when liberal democracy underpinned an economy in which a rising tide lifted all boats, but quite another in a world where the rich are getting richer while those on middle incomes and below are struggling. That’s most obviously the case in Trump’s America, where labour’s share of national income has fallen to itslowest level since records began.The question is what happens next. Clearly, a well-functioning international order is preferable to the law of the jungle, but crafting one is not going to be easy. It requires faster and more inclusive growth. It requires significantly higher investment in public infrastructure. It requires the rich west to give poorer countries financial help so that they can protect themselves against the climate crisis. It requires Europe to do more to pay for its own defence. And it requires reform of the international institutions: the United Nations and theWorld Trade Organizationas well as the IMF and the World Bank.The original aim of the IMF was to help countries with balance-of-payments problems and the UK, represented byJohn Maynard Keynes, argued that both creditor and debtor nations should have a role to play. The suggestion that creditor nations should be obliged to import more was turned down flat by the US, then comfortably the world’s biggest creditor nation. Instead, the burden of adjustment would fall on debtor nations through lower imports and domestic austerity. A properly functioning rules-based system would remedy this defect.There is no room for complacency. It may be tempting to imagine that things will be different when Trump has left the White House, but such optimism is misplaced. It is not just a question of replacing the narcissist currently residing in the White House. It is about tackling the structural reasons why the rules-based system is collapsing.As Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, said in Davos earlier this week, the old order “is not coming back”.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDavosOpinionWorld BankInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)Davos 2026Donald TrumpSecond world warEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

But European leaders are not as helpless as the US president believesGeorg Riekeles is the associate director of the European Policy CentreWed 21 Jan 2026 12.13 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 13.04 ESTShareEU leaders’ toughrebukes to Donald Trump in Davosmust be followed by concrete action when they convene in Brussels on Thursday night. The US president’s attempt to strong-arm Greenland and Denmark, backed byexplicit tariff threatsagainst those who refuse to comply, is not bluster or improvisation. It is economic coercion, openly deployed to force political submission and territorial concessions. The danger lies in the demand itself, but also in how Europe responds.The EU has reached a moment of truth. If it cannot defend one of its member states whose most basic interests are under direct threat, then the EU is weakened as a geopolitical actor and emptied of purpose.For too long, European leaders have clung to a comforting but false belief that the EU cannot use its economic power against the US, because Europe and Ukraine depend on Washington for security. This argument is wrong. Moreover, it isstrategically corrosive. In a world of open coercion, appeasement and restraint do not buy stability. They invite further pressure.Trade conflicts, like coercive bargaining and military deterrence, are shaped in large part by escalation dominance – the ability to convince the other side that you are more willing and more capable of sustaining pressure. That dominance does not rest on size and leverage alone, but on unity and determination. On both counts,Europehas recently failed itself.The clearest example came last April,when the US imposedits “liberation day” tariffs. At that point, the EU had leverage. Acting forcefully and in parallel with China, it could have delivered a decisive one-two blow that Washington would have struggled to absorb politically and economically. Instead,Europe hesitated, split internally and retreated into caution. The result was the disastrousTurnberry deal brokered by Ursula von der Leyenlast July – an economic capitulation that mistook temporary calm for stability and partnership.As many of us warned it would, that deal has now collapsed under the weight of reality. Appeasement in today’s dog-eat-dog world does not moderate behaviour, it rewards it. Trump’s return with even more explicit demands is not an aberration. It is the logical consequence of Europe signalling that it folds rather than standing up for itself.Hesitation and ambiguity do not stabilise a coercive system. They turn into vulnerabilities to be exploited by those willing to push harder. Europe now finds itself with its back against the wall – and paradoxically, that is where its strength lies.The US has leverage over Europe, but the reverse is also true. The question is not whether both sides can hurt each other; it is who has the greater will to endure and to escalate. As Europeans have most to lose, they also have the strongest imperative and the means to win this. For Europe, the stakes are existential: a union that cannot defend itself economically cannot hope to shape its security environment either.Europeans must at last understand that they cannot “buy” defence security from the US by staying quiet and rolling over when Washington makes unacceptable demands. Folding to Trump does not protect Kyiv. It weakens the case for Ukraine’s defence, signals vulnerability to Moscow, multiplies threats on Europe and further unravels the international order.Europe’s response must therefore be vigorous and comprehensive – politically, diplomatically, militarily and economically.In addition to shoring up a military presence in Greenland through a Nato-led operation, or if necessary a coalition of the willing, Denmark would be justified in invokingNato’s article 4to force a discussion about the future of the alliance. That discussion must address the long-overdue need for Nato operational command and control arrangements in scenarios where the US chooses not to participate.In parallel, when EU leaders meet for their extraordinary European Council on Thursday night, they must issue an unequivocal rejection of Trump’s demands and set out a clear frame of action for forceful economic countermeasures.TheTurnberry trade dealwas premised on restoring stability in transatlantic economic relations, not creating an open channel for further coercion. That premise has been shredded. The European parliament was today voting tosuspend the agreement’s ratificationas a warning to the US. The European Council should go further and declare it null and void.In parallel, EU leaders should make clear to Washington that a retaliation package oftariffs on €93bn worth of US exportsto the EU will snap back into force on 7 February, if Washington refuses to back down. These measures were suspended last year, not abandoned, and postponing them again would amount to a conscious act of restraint in the face of open coercion.Finally, the EU should ready its never previously deployed anti-coercion instrument, or “trade bazooka”. Despite persistentmyths about implementing it, this need not take long at all. With coercion as blatant and public as now, the legal case is clearcut. With enough backing from EU governments under qualified majority voting, the instrument could be mobilised rapidly, giving Brussels a powerful retaliatory set of tools across services, digital platforms, procurement and investment.This is not about seeking confrontation, rather it is about restoring credibility. Trump may believe he has played his hand from a position of strength. Even if Trump appears to have backed off from threatening to use military force, Europe must show that he has misjudged his opponent. The alternative is not peace or stability, but irrelevance and a Europe progressively picked apart by predators.Georg Riekeles is the associate director of the European Policy CentreDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was pointed towards meWarning:This article contains graphic contentWed 21 Jan 2026 18.48 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 21.27 ESTShareHanukah is called “the festival of light”. It is a minor holiday in the Jewish calendar, not biblically prescribed. There are no long synagogue services, no onerous prohibitions or requirements. Just candles, songs and doughnuts. This is probably part of why I always loved it.There were four or five events in Sydney for the first night of Hanukah. In 2024 we went to an event at Dover Heights, but parking was a nightmare. We decide on Bondi (where parking is also a nightmare). Five of us – my mum, husband, son (3), daughter (one-and-a-half) and I pile into the car.We walk past the Christmas markets at Bondi beach, looking for the festival. I google it, but don’t expect to find an answer.Australians to perform acts of kindness on national day of mourning for Bondi terror attack victimsRead moreTypically, Jewish events in Sydney are advertised without locations. A party is at an “eastern suburbs location” or “outdoor venue, Sydney south-east”. The exact location is provided only to people who register, and only on the day. This is a security measure. The idea is that nobody can plan an attack on an unspecified location.So I’m surprised when Google tells that it’s down near the children’s playground. We meander over with the pram.My son runs straight to his paternal grandmother, already inside. We take some photos – the photographer tells us we’ll have a fridge magnet in about half an hour. I will later learn his name isPeter Meagher.We play with bubbles. We visit the petting zoo. We eat doughnuts. The kids share a hotdog with my husband.My son is with my mother-in-law. My husband takes my daughter to chase down my mum in a bid to stop her buying more hotdogs. I am chatting with friends. I haven’t seen my son – or my mother-in-law – for a while. The others haven’t either. Nobody is worried, they are off having fun somewhere. Still. I leave the conversation to go to look for them.I am by myself, walking around an open area, not too far from the gate, trying to get sight of them. I hear a very loud bang. I am not sure what it is. I don’t think much of it. I am busy looking for my kid.I have never heard a gun before.There is another bang, and another.I see someone fall to the ground. I see blood. People are screaming. People are getting on the floor. This is not fireworks.The music hasn’t stopped. Techno covers of Hanukah classics. Songs I have sung since I was a kid. The screaming doesn’t stop the music, but it distorts, somehow, like a bad sci-fi movie.I see the back of my husband’s shirt, I see he is holding my daughter, I see he is near a fence and running. I know he will keep her safe.But I still cannot see my son. I scream his name. I run in circles looking for him for a few more shots. I cannot see him. I see a little girl with face paint. She is screaming for her mummy and daddy. She is scared. She is in an open space. I run and grab her.This space is too open. There are too many shots. I take maybe five steps towards the chairs, I am behind the last row. It is the closest thing I can find to cover. I lie on the grass, on top of the little girl.They say: come, run, we will get you out of here. I do not trust them. I hate that I do not trust them. I always trustThere are many people lying or crouching in the chairs in front of me. Most are elderly. Everyone is screaming.I stay calm, I understand the importance of calm. I talk to the little girl. I say, I’ve got you. She is calm, too. The shots keep coming.This next part is a jumble; I am not sure of the order of events. It seems to go forever. It is less than six minutes.I lift my phone to take a video; the zoom helps me to see better. One man is on the footbridge. He is holding a gun. It is pointed towards me. He fires two times, three. The other man is pacing on the ground, outside the fence. He is moving slowly. He looks calm. The little girl says, “Can you hide?” “Yes,” I say. I put the phone down. It is 6.43pm.A woman is lying in front of me, maybe a metre-and-a-half away, among the chairs. She is facing the shooters – I see the back of her head. Then – the woman is a body. Her head must have turned with the impact. I can see the tip of her nose. There is a U shape where her eyes and forehead used to be. Bits of brain, beige and squishy, are laced through the grass.My shoulder stings. I am dripping blood. I am dripping blood. I am dripping blood and I don’t know how much of it is mine. I am dripping blood on to a little girl. She won’t tell me her name.There is blood on my glasses. I take a selfie to see whether the blood is mine. I see small pieces of brain in my hair. I stop paying attention to the blood. It is 6:47pm.I get a text from my husband. There is blood on my phone. He says, “We are safe. I have [daughter] only.” I say “Have a little girl. Not mine. Someone has been shot.” The texts are short. I write, “I hand bloom. Blood. I don’t kni”. He writes “From you?” I say, “I don’t know. Keeping girl safe. [Son]. My mum.” He responds to son with “With [grandma]. Safe inside playground.”I should explain: these texts are atypical. Normally I write in full sentences, even in text, with no spelling mistakes.It is 6:53pm. My kids should be starting a bath.This next part is better.A man comes up to me, he is crouched. He says I have his daughter. I don’t know him. I don’t want to give her over unless it’s safe. She says “Daddy” and reaches. I feel grateful. I give her over. I tell him: the blood is not hers. I think it is mine. This lady got shot. I tell him, I am sorry. He asks if I am OK. He says I saved her life. His daughter is safe. I am grateful.‘Left an immeasurable void’: Holocaust survivors, community heroes and ‘spirited child’ among victims of Bondi terror attackRead moreI want my husband. My kids. My mum. Nobody has said it is safe. I stay on the floor.Two young men come up to me. They are not wearing shirts – I think they have come from the beach. They say: come, run, we will get you out of here. I do not trust them. I hate that I do not trust them. I always trust. I say – sorry, I do not know you. I will go myself. They say, of course. Now I am sorry. I feel grateful.I get up. I stay low, move towards the boardwalk. I see my mum. She looks unharmed. I am grateful. We walk down the boardwalk. I tell her to walk faster. I find my husband. My daughter. I feel grateful.I tell him, I need to see a doctor.When I was a kid, if I got a cut on my left hand, my dad would give it a kiss, then ask if we needed to amputate the right hand so the left hand didn’t hurt any more. This is to say: I was raised strong. So if I say I need a doctor, my husband takes it seriously.But also: there are two, three ambulances. And there are bodies. Wounded, dead. Being dragged or carried to the far side of the park. I see three paramedics working on someone who is more blood and flesh than human. I do not look too closely. My husband is yelling for a doctor. Someone says, “Wait here.”People are dying. I am sore, but I am OK. I just want to check our baby. We decide to make our own way. I hold my daughter. My husband says, “You need to clean yourself first, you are covered in blood.” I don’t care, I want to hold her. We catch my mother-in-law, my son. I am grateful. I am so grateful. Relief. Relief beyond measure.At the hospital, I am seen quickly. People are kind. They are kind beyond measureMy son says, “Ima, why are you wearing makeup?” Ima is mum, in Hebrew.I say, “It is face paint.”He says, “I want face paint too.”“Another time,” I say.We talk lightly; my son is asking about the helicopters. We are holding hands. We are holding each other. We are going to go back to the car, we are going to go home, we are going to have dinner.My husband drops me off at the hospital on the way home. He takes the kids home. I have not prepared dinner. I am worried about what they will eat. He tells me later he gave them yoghurt and jam and put them to sleep. This is not a real dinner. I am grateful.At the hospital, I am seen quickly. People are kind. They are kind beyond measure. My nurse’s name is Connor. He is gentle, speaks softly. I am grateful.I have minor cuts and bruises. A deep gash in my nose. A long slash on my right shoulder blade, with no depth. Little dots of bleeding on my forehead, my arms. These are already drying. The body heals. Later, I will find out my body has healed around a little piece of shrapnel, under that little dot of bleeding, next to my eyebrow. All that is for later. Now, I want to check my baby. I get an ultrasound. Baby is moving. Baby’s heart is beating.What happens to accidental heroes when the headlines fade? ‘You get your award and then there’s nothing’Read moreI cannot describe how grateful I am. I cannot possibly put this into words. I text my husband.Kids are asleep. My husband comes. Connor and I agree to skip stitches for my nose and glue it instead; it will bleed for a week, but scar less.Connor gets permission to allow me to have a shower. There are brains in my hair. A shower. I am grateful.My husband helps me to wash my body. He is gentle and slow. He finds more cuts in my scalp. I put my bloody clothes back on. We drive home. It is quiet.In coming days, I meet the girl’s parents. She is three years old, just like my son. Her parents say she is OK. I am grateful.View image in fullscreenPhotographs of the people killed in the Bondi beach terror attack on 14 December 2025.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianPeople keep calling me a hero.

My husband, who saved my daughter. My mother-in-law, who saved my son. Every single parent, every single person who saved every single child.When my son started walking, he would often walk himself into danger, as toddlers do. I would stop him from falling off a couch, and he would scream and kick and bite. I taught him: “Our number one job is to keep you safe. Our number two job is to give you love.” I could not keep him safe. I could not keep so many people safe.

For decades, complaints have been heard about gaps in the financing ecosystem for startups and for promising young UK companies, particularly those in tech-related and life science fields, or those spinning out of universities. So one can applaud the existence of a large and distinctly British source of capital to “crowd in”, as politicians like to say, private venture funds.But then we turn to this week’s eye-catching move by the development agency:a £25m equity investment in Kraken Technologies, the whizzy software platform that is being separated from the greater Octopus Energy empire with an eye to an eventual stock market listing. Kraken fits the bill as a tech company but, in two other respects, it is miles away from what the BBB usually does.First, Kraken is definitely not a small business. It is valued at $8.65bn, or £6.45bn, in the fundraising. At that level, if it were a UK-listed company already, it would enter the FTSE 100 index in roughly 70th place, a few slots below Sainsbury’s and a few above Pearson.Second, you’d struggle to claim that the BBB’s presence made all the difference to the success of the wider Kraken/Octopus $1bn fundraising round that was led by a US fund, DI Capital Partners. Kraken has recurring revenues of $500m, so is being valued at roughly 17 times those revenues. If it can raise equity at such a princely multiple, it is not struggling to find backers. The BBB’s investment, note, works at a stake of approximately 0.35% in Kraken. One strongly doubts that was the make-or-break element.Then there is the political angle. Peter Kyle, the business secretary, tried to position the BBB’s £25m in the context of Kraken’s eventual choice of listing venue – a live question since the firm describes itself as “headquartered in London and New York”. The money was “not a bung”, Kyle told the FT, but part of efforts to keep the company in the UK.Does £25m make a difference on that score? Hardly. One can say, as Greg Jackson, Octopus Energy’s founder, did, that it gets “a seat at the table”, but he’s being generous: 0.35% is more of a stool in the corner. Jackson also called the choice of listing venue a “coin toss” between the UK and US. Like him, we’d love London to get the nod, but these decisions invariably come down to the basic question of where the valuation is likely to be higher.Here’s the BBB’s explanation of its thinking: “We have made this investment with the intention of making a financial return. We were introduced to Kraken by Octopus Ventures and were given an opportunity to be involved in a deal. This was too good an opportunity to miss. The majority of investors are international, so this investment ensures that the UK taxpayer gains exposure to Kraken, one of our fastest growing companies.”One can understand the BBB is in it to make money – one should hope so. But its investment mandate seems to have been quietly rewritten if Kraken can be defined as a small business, and if ministers are trying to layer specific listing objectives on top.The BBB’s permanent capital was topped up by £6.6bn in last year’s Treasury spending review, taking the tally to £25.6bn. It was also told it could make direct investments of as much as £60m in a single company, up from a previous £15m. So maybe we should expect more punts on firms that are well beyond startup stage and have done a lot of scaling up already.It would be useful if the new rules were set out explicitly. The Kraken investment may or may not turn out to be a profitable use of taxpayers’ money. But, given the BBB’s supposed objectives, it also looks a case of mission creep.Explore more on these topicsTechnology sectorNils Pratley on financeEconomic policyOctopus EnergynewsShareReuse this content"

My reporting from there concursMaanvi Singhin MinneapolisAfter covering Trump’s immigration policies from Chicago and LA, the Twin Cities operation feels like a marked escalationWed 21 Jan 2026 16.08 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 17.53 ESTShareThe Minneapolis Star Tribune editorial board described the Trump administration’simmigrationenforcement operation in the Twin Cities as “a military occupation”. Local leaders have used words like “siege” and “invasion”. After a week of reporting in Minneapolis and St Paul, I wouldn’t know how else to describe the scene.I’ve been covering the administration’s immigration policies sinceDonald Trump’s inauguration on 20 January last year. I was in Chicago in January last year, when the administration assigned hundreds of federal agents to conduct “enhanced targeted operations” in the city. I was in Los Angeles last summer, when agents began seizing workers at car washes and garment warehouses, grabbing bicyclists and raiding churches.Still, the operation in the Twin Cities felt like a marked escalation.The Department of Homeland Security’s “Operation Metro Surge” in the Twin Cities far surpasses previous mobilizations. The government has assigned some 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota in what it is calling its largest enforcement operation to date. This show of force has an outsized impact inMinneapolisand St Paul, which have a population that is less than one-fifth that of Los Angeles.There are now so many federal immigration officers operating in the region that they outnumber the Minneapolis police force five to one.The tactics of the federal force, too, have grown more aggressive and indiscriminate. Armed officers have appeared at schools, daycares, churches and mosques. Masked agents are stopping residents at traffic lights, or on their walk to the grocery store, demanding – at gunpoint – that they prove their citizenship.The agents are targeting not only undocumented immigrants, but also those with legal immigration status and valid visas, US citizens and tribal citizens. On Tuesday, a group of local law enforcement officers said even their agents were being pulled over, reporting that off-duty police officers of color had been stopped and questioned at gunpoint by the administration’s immigration force.Immigration agents have been emboldened by a supreme court ruling in September, which gave them legal cover to stop, question and detain people based on appearance, accent or vocation.In recent weeks, they have broken into the homes of private residents without judicial warrants. Last week, agents used a battering ram to break down the door of Garrison Gibson, a 38-year-old Liberian man, and arrested him. Over the weekend, they forced their way into the home of 56-year-old US citizen ChongLy “Scott” Thao, and led him outside in his underwear in subfreezing conditions.Minneapolis’s 911 dispatchers, meanwhile, have been overwhelmed by calls from residents who have encountered immigration enforcement. The city’s police chief, Brian O’Hara, said callers have often been hurt by the chemical irritants and crowd-control weapons that federal agents have been using against immigrant targets as well as advocates and bystanders.“The administration has been emboldened,” said Julia Decker, a policy director at the Immigrant Law Center ofMinnesota. “The federal government feels it has the right to act beyond its authority.”Decker said it’s unclear how many instances of warrantless entry have occurred and not been filmed or reported. Lately, in “know your rights” trainings for immigrants, attorneys have had to caveat lessons with an acknowledgement that federal agents won’t necessarily be deterred by constitutional and legal restrictions.For many residents, this has meant that regular life has been suspended. Immigrants and people of color who fear being stopped by ICE are staying home – avoiding work, school and shopping.Approximately 80%of immigrant-run businesses were closed last week. Some restaurants that are still open have posted signs barring federal agents and locked their doors – urging patrons to knock or ring a bell for entry.“Almost every single Latin business has their doors closed,” said Juan Leon, who owns Leo’s Tow in west St Paul. “They’re trying to strangulate our income.”For the past several weeks, he’s been providing a free service towing the abandoned vehicles of those taken by ICE.“It feels as though nowhere is safe,” one woman wrote to the Guardian; she’s a US citizen from Colombia who now carries around her passport with her wherever she goes. “I never felt the level of fear and constant concern that I feel now.” The Guardian is not identifying her because she fears being targeted by authorities.She wondered if her ancestors lived through something similar during the years of civil war in Colombia in the 1940s and 50s.It is difficult to drive around these cities without spotting an ICE vehicle. Evenings are soundtracked with the whistles and car horns of volunteer legal observers, posted at street corners and poised to alert residents that agents are in the area.As was the case in LA, Chicago and so many other cities that have been swamped by federal immigration agents, locals have stepped up to organize mutual aid efforts and food-delivery services for immigrants too afraid to leave their homes. Minnesotans have booked out online legal-observer training sessions.“What you have is moms, grandmas, teenagers out on the streets day in and day out doing everything that they can to protect their communities, so that we can go to bed with a clean conscience,” said Andrew Falstrom, a longtime community organiser. “But whatever we do, we won’t be able to match a federal force backed by billions of dollars.“They have guns and teargas,” he said. “And we’ve got whistles and car horns.”Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisOpinionICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinnesotaUS immigrationUS domestic policyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

I came because every legal door was closed to me. And the danger I faced at home left me with no real choice. Now, however, I am staring down the barrel of a British government policy that could put me in harm’s way again.In my home country, I had a stable job helping manage an oilfield. I was not a failure and was not running towards Europe for a better salary or an easier life. I was running away from power, corruption and injustice. I had to flee because of a powerful, influential individual who targeted me. Where I am from, when someone like that decides to destroy you, there is no protection, no court you can rely on and no future. I tried many times to leave my country legally, but no other country would accept my case. The situation became urgent. Staying meant serious harm or death.I first went to France – but even there I did not feel safe. I knew the person I was running from could reach me. Thepower of smugglers, human trafficking networks and organised crimein France is well known to asylum seekers. I received threats and my family received threats as well. I lived in constant fear. That is why I made the most dangerous decision of my life: to cross the Channel on a small boat. After I left France to travel to the UK, my family received a call from a French number threatening to harm me. They said that they hadn’t managed to catch me while I was in France – but that if I returned there, they would get me.I risked my life because I believed in British law and justice. I believed in its long history of protecting people fleeing persecution. When I saw the UK flag on the Border Force boat, I truly believed it was salvation. I thought the suffering was over, that the long journey and years of living under threat had finally ended.I was wrong. We were not given time to rest or recover. We were taken straight into interviews that did not feel like interviews at all. No one listened to our stories or tried to understand who we were or what had happened to us. The officer barely looked at me, focusing instead on a computer screen.Randomly, a small percentage of people from each boat were sent to detention centres, while others were sent to migrant hotels. I was one of the unlucky ones – I was taken to a detention centre. It was the first time in my life I had seen a place like this, like something out of a prison drama. I was shocked. Ourphones were taken away. I was locked inside with people who had criminal records. The centre was full ofdrugsandviolence. It is extremely dangerous to put innocent people in such an environment. Our only “crime” was asking for asylum.There isno real access to legal representation. It is an unfair battle between the Home Office and people who do not even know what a solicitor is. Many detainees do not understand the process, the language or their rights. People are taken by force on to planes. Fear fills every corridor. When apeaceful protest was organised, the response was brutal. Officers were sent in with dogs and teargas. We never imagined this would happen in the UK. For people who already carry trauma, this treatment causes deep psychological damage.I am subject to the UK government’s “one in, one out” policy. This meansBritain can send asylum seekerswho cross by small boat back to France in return for the same number of asylum seekers in France who have not tried to enter the UK by boat.The UK government says I should return to France. But there is clear evidence of threats against me and my family. When I submitted these threats to the Home Office, I was told that the translation was not done word for word by a licenced translator. This was used as an excuse to dismiss the danger. It felt like a mockery. How can I trust a country that does not stop smugglers, that is full of smuggling networks itself, to protect me? Thethreats and dangersthat await some migrants facing deportation to France have been documented.This UK-France deal is presented as a solution, but it is not.It benefits France,which has received £800m since 2015 from the UK to prevent asylum seekers from coming over. It damages the UK, undermining its reputation for fairness.What has actually changed since the deal came into effect? More than 16,000 people have crossed the Channel since people were first detained for “one in, one out” on 6 August 2025. Until last week, fewer than 250 people had been returned toFrance. The vast majority are stuck in hotels or detention centres. Smugglers are still operating. Crossings have not stopped. France is happy. The UK has gained nothing, except shame and suffering inflicted on a small group of unlucky people.There are always alternatives. There are right ways to address this issue: safe and legal routes, fair asylum processing and real cooperation that targets smugglers, not victims. If France does not stop the small boats and the smuggling networks, the crossings will never stop.Punishing innocent asylum seekers will never solve this problem. The UK does not need harsher detention centres – it needs courage, honesty and leadership. The problem is smugglers and failed policies, not people like me who believed in British justice and risked everything to reach safety.The writer is an asylum seeker in the UK. As told to Diane TaylorA Home Office spokesperson said, “We cannot be clearer: migrants arriving in the United Kingdom illegally on a small boat can expect to be sent back to France.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The incumbent Liberal party faced crushing defeat before Mr Trump threatened toannex Canada. Mr Carney’s candidacy was buoyed up by apatriotic rallyagainst US bullying.Perhaps because his country has also been coveted by Mr Trump, Mr Carney has given one of the most clear-sighted responses of any democratic leader to the US president’s designs on Greenland. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, the Canadian prime ministerset out the challengefor countries whose security and prosperity have depended on a global system underwritten by the US.“The rules-based order is fading,” Mr Carney said, making way for a time of “great-power rivalry”. The change compels “middle powers”, such asCanada, to build new coalitions, invest in security and diversify economic ties. A new multilateral framework must be made from the ruins of the one Mr Trump is vandalising.Britain is also a middle power, and one whose position is uniquely awkward as the US, its closest military partner, is provoking a tariff war with its closest trading partner, the European Union. SirKeir Starmerhas cultivated good relations with Mr Trump while aligning the UK economy more closely with the EU as part of a post-Brexit “reset”.Supporters of the prime minister’s approach cite the need to prevent the US completely abandoning Ukraine to Russian aggression. Performative denunciation of the president might achieve little except to make Nato less popular in the White House and jeopardise Kyiv’s position in ceasefire negotiations.Earlier this week, when threatened with punitive US tariffs for supporting Danish sovereignty over Greenland, Sir Keir extolled the merit of “calm discussion” to resolve the issue. The US president repaid Sir Keir’s measured tone with aggression, attacking his plan to transfer the Chagos Islands to Mauritius as “stupidity” (although that arrangement previously had White House approval). The prime minister rightly pushed back, telling MPs he would not be pressed into changing his position. It should be clear now that the strategy of mid-Atlantic equidistance is unsustainable.Mr Trump’s contempt for old US alliances goes to the core of his politics. Mr Carney may be premature when he says the rupture from the old order has already happened, but it is imminent. Gordon Brown made the same pointin the Guardianearlier this week, calling for a “coalition of the willing” to “build a new global framework”.Sir Keir doesn’t express himself in such terms. He focuses on practical problem-solving in the moment, which he says is the way to achieve results. He is testing the limit of that approach. Without an account of the big picture, the prime minister will not get public consent for the difficult choices that face the UK. One of the tasks incumbent on middle powers, in Mr Carney’s analysis, is to “name reality” – not indulging a pretence that the old ways can endure.Sir Keir has proved he is adept at diplomacy, but he is a political leader, not just a diplomat. His duty is not only to work behind the scenes but to be candid with the public and “name the reality” of the epoch-defining global crisis that Britain must now navigate.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The qualifications arm of the 148-year-old vocational education charity – with a royal charter granted by Queen Victoria – is now the property of a Greek-owned business, PeopleCert, with plans to cut costs and replace UK jobs with cheaper staff abroad. One of the biggest, best-regarded non-profits in England’s further education (FE) sector has thus been turned into an international brand that shares the name of the charity that sold it – now rebadged as the City & Guilds Foundation.Ministers appear not to have been paying attention when this momentous decision was taken by trustees (neither City & Guilds nor the other awarding bodies were mentioned by name in last year’sskills white paper). The sell-off was not debated in parliament. But the deal is belatedly under the spotlight after the Guardian revealed that senior City & Guilds staff, including the chief executive, Kirstie Donnelly, and the chief financial officer, Abid Ismail,received huge bonuses(£1.7m and £1.2m) when the deal went through.The Charity Commission was first to open a statutory inquiry. Then PeopleCert launched its owninvestigation, with Ms Donnelly and Mr Ismail placed on leave. The qualifications regulator, Ofqal, is also monitoring developments. Why the bonuses were paid is the first question that investigators must answer. The charity said it had considered, and rejected, the idea ofpaying bonusesin connection with the deal.The role of Dame Ann Limb must also be examined. As chair of the charity’s trustees, she co-authored anarticleabout the deal with Ms Donnelly, in which the pair claimed that the alignment of the stars had enabled them to “shape the course of history”. In December it was announced that she would step down and become a Labour peer. The Sunday Times’s report that she hadfalsely claimed to have an MA and PhDthrows her suitability into question. Dame Ann is reported to havedonated £50,000to the Labour party.Unlike in Scotland and some other European countries, FE in England is run as a market. But this privatisation tilts the balance further away from a social democratic view of education as a public good. Critics of the deal point out, correctly, that profit-seeking businesses do not behave in the same way as charities, which by law must deliver a public benefit. PeopleCert plans to makesavings totalling £22m. In addition to the offshoring of UK jobs – City & Guilds employs 1,600 people, and many more on short-term contracts – there are concerns that the new owners could raise the fees charged to colleges as they seek a return on investment. Options for students could also narrow, with less profitable qualifications potentially at risk.Ms Donnelly and Mr Ismail must explain their actions and their riches. The light being shone on PeopleCert is welcome too. It is now a big player in the crucial area of technical education – with therate of economic inactivity among young peopleseen as a key concern by Labour ministers. Having denuded itself of its original purpose, the City & Guilds charity still has assets of up to £200m. Its trustees must ensure that this money is put to good use. While the deal cannot be unpicked, delayed scrutiny and accountability are better than none.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Such debate is entirely normal – and essential – for scientific inquiry.New and novel methods must be tried, tested, critiqued, improved and tried again. Science is incremental and gradual – unlike the uncapped production and pollution of plastics, which contain thousands of hazardous chemicals. Decades of robust evidence demonstrates the harms that these inflict on people and planet.While this debate expands with the claim in your report by a former chemist at one of the world’s leading petrochemical and plastics producers that doubts raised about studies on micro- and nanoplastics in the body amount to a “bombshell”, independent scientists are collectively striving for clarity on what is known and what is yet to be understood in this area.In this light, it is worth reflecting on the state of public research. Ever scant resources drive less than healthy competition, pushing cash-strapped universities to enhance visibility through newsworthy findings. Meanwhile, a highly commercialised publishing industry – with thousands of journals making billions from gatekeeping publicly funded research while failing to compensate academic reviewers – is only too happy to oblige. The media are quick to jump on results, yet slower to cover more nuanced methodological debates. As always, the devil is in the detail.While independent researchers continue to conduct rigorous, painstaking science and engage in constructive debate, often uncompensated, for the love of science and the benefit of society, the plastic crisis continues to grow around us each day, with irrefutable evidence of its negative impacts on humans, other animals and the environment. At what point will we move towards bold action?Joe YatesHove, East SussexYour article is right to point out that there is work to be done in refining, standardising and harmonising the analytical techniques for examining microscopic particles in tissue samples. There is a need especially to distinguish microplastics from lipids. But that does not mean this whole area of science is rubbish.Good researchers using well-validated techniques have directly observed microplastic particles in multiple human tissues under the microscope and have even identified which types of plastic are present in these particles.Moreover, we now know a great deal about how the chemicals in microplastics harm health. Microplastic particles act as vectors, Trojan horses that transport toxic plastic chemicals such as phthalates, bisphenols and brominated flame retardants from the environment into the human body. Once in the body, these chemicals leach out of microplastic particles, enter the bloodstream, are distributed to tissues and cells, and cause diseases from cancer to heart disease, from IQ loss in children to decreased fertility.This means that the presence of microplastics in the human body needs to be taken seriously, even though we don’t yet know all the ways in which they may harm health. They cannot be wished away.Our newly launchedCountdown on Health and Plastics, established under the sponsorship of the Lancet,will be coordinating global efforts to improve analyses of microplastics in human tissues and to increase knowledge of the possible impacts of microplastic particles on disease.Prof Philip J LandriganDirector, Global Observatory on Planetary HealthI and my colleagues in the Metabolomics Quality Assurance and Quality Control Consortium (mQACC) agree with the central message in your article; research on micro- and nanoplastics in human tissues requires exceptional analytical rigour, transparency and validation. Notwithstanding, we were concerned by the implication that shortcomings in some studies reflect a lack of analytical rigour within metabolomics as a discipline.The mQACC consortium, which has more than 140 members around the world, works to define, establish, review and promote best-practice analytical chemistry as applied to metabolomics (the study of small molecules involved in metabolism). Robust study design, reliable analytical methods and careful data processing are essential to minimising errors and ensuring reliability of metabolomics data.The metabolomics community is deeply rooted in analytical chemistry, and thus particular emphasis is placed on the need for high standards of identification and quantification. We acknowledge that some published studies have reported misidentifications, often resulting from overreliance on automated tools without sufficient expert review. The mission of mQACC is to provide clear, evidence-based guidance to reduce such issues and to strengthen confidence in metabolomics research. Over the last decade, such efforts have helped promote higher standards of analytical rigour within metabolomics.We strongly support open and critical discussion of scientific research. However, individual studies that fall short of best practice do not represent the broader metabolomics scientific community that has long valued analytical rigour and has built structures to support and uphold it.Jennifer KirwanProfessor of veterinary metabolomics, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, AustriaYour editorial (18 January) correctly states that the re-evaluation of publications on microplastics in human tissues is the scientific process playing out as it should. I think, though, that your comments about peer review and publication highlight an important misunderstanding about why and for whom research papers are written, and what peer review is for.Research reports are published primarily for other researchers. Especially at the beginning of a field, foundational studies may be small, and “scruffy” in terms of methods, but worthy of publication because they highlight an important question and are a rallying cry for more researchers, with a broader range of collective expertise, to investigate thoroughly. Peer reviewers check that a report covers existing knowledge fairly, that it presents and analyses new data appropriately, and that the paper itself does not extend its conclusions beyond the data. Their job ends with the research report – they have no control over how press releases, AI summaries, bloggers and journalists transform what may be a nuanced report, whose uncertainties will be understood by other researchers, into an unjustified bald statement of fact.In my research life (nothing to do with microplastics), I have read many contradictory research reports, each entirely worthy of publication, and often turning out to be contradictory only because, like blind men of the parable each feeling a different part of the elephant, each early report explored only a facet of something eventually understood to be bigger and more complex.Scientific knowledge is always provisional, and research papers are not statements of eternal truth but contributions to an ongoing conversation between scientists. If the public is made sceptical of science by contradictory news reports, this may be because most newspapers say little about really solid areas of science and focus instead on the wild frontiers. Anybody reading this on an electronic device will have a vivid proof of the power and validity of mature science right in their hands.Jamie DaviesProfessor of experimental anatomy, University of EdinburghHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is a position rooted more in nostalgia than in the practical realities of managing public assets – and it overlooks several inconvenient facts.The long-standing reliance on short-term arrangements limited the cafes’ ability to invest in buildings, facilities and staff. This had to change. Moving to longer leases is not about change for its own sake, but about providing stability: enabling investment, fair pay and a sustainable future for customers.The remarketing process was open, competitive – and locally consulted on through our committees, representing local groups and organisations connected to Hampstead Heath and Queen’s Park. We received 30 bids, including from existing operators.Family-run Daisy Green is hardly a faceless multinational. It’s an independent London-based business with a track record of running community cafes across the capital, committed to investment and affordable prices. Like one of the current operators, it began life selling street food at markets. And it does mean that, for the first time, cafe workers on the heath will be paid at least theLondonliving wage by all operators.What we can all agree on is that these spaces matter, as do all the services across the heath, and we fully recognise the affection in which they are held. We manage the heath as a charity, underwriting it by nearly £12m last year, at no cost to council tax payers. We’re proud to have spent over £2m to upgrade theParliament Hill athletics trackto world-class standards.It is scarcely a “ruthless pursuit of profit” or even justifiable to describe the City of London Corporation as a “villain”, as one of your readers put it (Letters, 16 January). Our priority is to ensure we have the funds to safeguard a much-loved open space that welcomes 8 million visitors a year.Alderman Gregory Jones KCChair, Hampstead Heath, Highgate Wood and Queens Park committee, City of London CorporationHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Joe Gomez, deputising for the absent Ibrahima Konaté, ­delivered an accomplished display ­alongside ­Virgil van Dijk as the ­Liverpool ­captain made his 350th appearance for the club.Liverpool played with confidence and composure at a passionate Stade Vélodrome, where the noise started cranking up an hour and a half before kick-off and never let up. Slot deployed the midfield diamond formation that worked effectively in his team’s last European outing,away at Inter, but unlike that night at San Siro there was a place for Mohamed Salah. The Egypt international, dropped against Inter as a consequence of thatexplosive interview at Leeds, was straight back in the starting lineup following his return from the Africa Cup of Nations.“Let’s see the lineup tomorrow if you still think there’s an issue,” Slot had said at the pre-match press conference when asked about his relationship with Salah. The pertinent, unanswered questions concern Salah’s issues with Liverpool and Slot, however, not vice versa.Both teams wore black armbands and joined the applause before kick-off for the formerMarseilleplayer and manager Rolland Courbis, who died on 12 January. The pre-match buildup also featured an impressive tifo of the Beatles reading a copy of La Provence newspaper with the headline ‘Que l’histoire se répète’ – Let history repeat itself – above an image of Didier Drogba celebrating knocking Liverpool out of the Uefa Cup in 2004. The Marseille fans proved far more creative than their team.Quick GuideChampions League roundup: Kane secures Bayern's pathShowHarry Kane struck twice in three minutes to carryBayern Munichto a 2-0 victory over Belgium'sUnion Saint-Gilloisein the Champions League on Wednesday and book their ticket for the knockout stage with a game to spare.Bayern's top scorer headed in at the near post from a Michael Olise corner in the 52nd minute then and added another from the penalty spot after he was brought down. The England captain could have sealed his hat-trick in the 80th minute but hammered his second penalty on to the crossbar. The hosts were down to 10 men from the 64th minute after defender Kim Min-jae was sent off with a second booking.

Atalanta clawed one back in the dying minutes through Nikola Krstovic scored but the surprise defeat leaves them needing a win against Union Saint-Gilloise to secure automatic qualification.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The hosts appeared more intimidated by the occasion than the visitors and, unusually for a De Zerbi team, struggled in possession. ­Liverpool carried the only serious threat in the first half. Alexis Mac Allister, who played under De Zerbi at Brighton, dragged an early chance just wide before Hugo Ekitiké converted following an incisive Liverpool counterattack. Ekitiké was just offside when sweeping Szoboszlai’s low cross under goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli, however.Marseille’s repeated mistakes drove their head coach to distraction. But credit to Liverpool for enforcing so many with their relentless pressing and by shutting off the options to the central defenders, Leonardo Balerdi and Facundo Medina. Another lapse, deep in Liverpool territory, gifted the visitors another counterattack that resulted in Salah flicking an audacious volley from Frimpong’s cross just over the bar.Liverpool’s deserved lead arrived after Balerdi, a persistent danger to his own team, felled Ryan Gravenberch just outside the Marseille area. There was a lengthy wait for the free-kick to be taken while the video assistant referee checked – and eventually cleared – a possible handball by Timothy Weah inside the box moments earlier. Szoboszlai ensured a spot-kick was unnecessary.View image in fullscreenJeremie Frimpong forces an own goal to double Liverpool’s lead.Photograph: Manon Cruz/ReutersSpotting Rulli stranded too far to the right of his goal, and the Marseille wall lining up without a draught excluder, the Liverpool midfielder swept the set piece underneath and inside the keeper’s left-hand post. For Szoboszlai, it was a ­welcome break having missed a penalty against Burnley on Saturday and been accused of disrespect in the FA Cup defeat of Barnsley.De Zerbi’s touchline anger was clearly channelled into his interval instructions as Marseille started the second half with greater intent. Mason Greenwood forced Alisson into a fine save with a shot that dipped from 25 yards. The former Manchester United forward also led a dangerous break that resulted in Hamed Traoré firing wastefully over with only the Liverpool keeper to beat.Greenwood’s two flashes sandwiched an excellent chance for ­Ekitiké to double Liverpool’s lead from an incisive Szoboszlai pass. The forward’s first-time hit cannoned against a post. Slot may have had flashbacks to his team’s failure to kill off Burnley when Florian Wirtz was denied by Rulli at his near post and Ekitiké sent another good opening over the bar.But those concerns were banished when Frimpong ensured the ­Marseille crowd fell silent for a second time. Wirtz and Ekitiké combined brilliantly before finding Mac ­Allister lurking in space. The midfielder sent Frimpong scurrying away from substitute Igor Paixão and his tenacity was rewarded when his low cross trickled inside the far post via touches off both Medina and Rulli. In ­stoppage time Gravenberch surged clear to present Gakpo with a clinical third. The scoreline reflected ­Liverpool’s superiority.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueMarseilleLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

While Eddie Howe’s side are already guaranteed a place in the playoffs to determine the composition of March’s round of 16, they can still bypass next month’s two-legged tie by finishing in the top eight.Szoboszlai’s low blow puts Liverpool on a high as Salah returns in MarseilleRead moreMuch hinges on Wednesday’s trip to Paris Saint-Germain for a set of players with a habit of forgetting their domestic travails and raising their game on European nights. At times it was all so straightforward for Newcastle here it was hard to credit that this was PSV’s first defeat on the road in 10 months.“It was a great performance,” said Howe. “And a great atmosphere. But, of course, I’m aware we have one of the most, if not the most difficult, final game at PSG.”Newcastle’s manager had urged home fans to show his players their “love” and create a club that’s “all in love with each other” and those in the Gallowgate End responded by unfurling a giant banner emblazoned with the message: “Write the next headline”.The subtext clearly challenged Gordon, Wissa and other sometimes underachieving members of Howe’speculiarly inconsistent teamto embrace the European spotlight.Wissa, starting his first Champions League game, did not take long to do precisely that. When Matej Kovar’s weak clearance flew straight to Bruno Guimarães, Newcastle’s captain promptly played in Joelinton courtesy of a perfect pass. He, in turn, squared for the £55m former ­Brentford striker to lift his shot over the prone goalkeeper.View image in fullscreenYoane Wissa marks his first Champions League start with an early goal.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersHowe had asked his players to live up to the attacking values instilled here during Sir Bobby Robson’s tenure. Given that Robson also managedPSV Eindhovenwith some distinction it was an evocative night.Bosz’s teams are invariably entertaining but PSV’s head coach was forced to watch his side struggle horribly defensively while failing to properly test Nick Pope in a game controlled by Newcastle.The Dutch champions and clear Eredivisie leaders arrived protecting an unbeaten away record stretching back to March last year but, judging by his arms-folded stance, Bosz swiftly knew it was under severe threat.PSV are noted for defensive risktaking but when Gordon took his turn to rise to the Gallowgate End’s challenge he was assisted by the visitors’ second significant mistake of the evening.Quick GuideChampions League roundup: Kane secures Bayern's pathShowHarry Kane struck twice in three minutes to carryBayern Munichto a 2-0 victory over Belgium'sUnion Saint-Gilloisein the Champions League on Wednesday and book their ticket for the knockout stage with a game to spare.Bayern's top scorer headed in at the near post from a Michael Olise corner in the 52nd minute then and added another from the penalty spot after he was brought down.

This was Gordon’s sixth European goal this season, making him Newcastle’s joint-leading scorer in the competition alongside Alan Shearer. In the Premier League he has scored twice in 17 matches.Once again PSV’s attempts to build patiently from the back had foundered in the face of a high, hard Newcastle press led, expertly, by Wissa but Howe’s delight was tempered by the sight of Guimarães clearly struggling with an ankle injury.View image in fullscreenBruno Guimarães walks off the pitch injured.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersIn first-half stoppage time Newcastle’s captain finally limped off to be replaced by Lewis Miley. With Aston Villa due here on Sunday for a league game that could prove pivotal in the qualification race for next season’s Champions League, Guimarães’s likely absence will be felt keenly. “It’s sore and swollen but we hope it’s not too serious,” said Howe who at least saw Miley impress.Stronger opponents might have capitalised during those minutes Guimarães hobbled around the pitch but PSV seemed too petrified by his midfield sidekick Joelinton’s intense aggression to benefit. The Brazilian’s stellar performance played a very big part in leaving Bosz’s players utterly cowed.Two-goal leads can be notoriously fragile yet this contest was over well before Harvey Barnes met Pope’s deflected long kick, ran at the defence and curved a left-foot shot beyond the advancing Kovar to score his fifth Champions League goal this season.St James’ Park celebrated with poignant renditions of “Only one Bobby Robson” as PSV supporters probably wondered why Sven ­Botman, excellent in central defence for Newcastle, is not yet part of the Netherlands squad.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueNewcastle UnitedPSV Eindhovenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This was a deeply unconvincing display from ­Chelsea, who took 78 agonising minutes to find a way past the might of the champions of Cyprus, and it was not a surprise that Stamford Bridge greeted victory with such a muted response.The mood was one of relief. There was plenty of angst on a night when the home fans continued their protests against Chelsea’s ­owners. The football was too slow, too ­predictable, and it hardly seemed to register that Moisés Caicedo shattering Pafos FC’s defiance ensured that Liam ­Rosenior’s side will have a chance to secure direct qualification into the ­Champions League last 16 when they visit Napoli in their final game next week.It had threatened to end with Rosenior overseeing one of the most embarrassing results in ­Chelsea’s European history. This was the 41-year-old head coach’s first taste of managing at this level and he knows it will be tougher against Napoli. The Italian champions need to win to avoid elimination and, with the race for a place in the top eight so tight, Chelsea may live to regret not doing more for their goal difference here.Pafos are 30th in the standings and could make it in the playoffs if they beat Slavia Prague next week. They took pride from turning Rosenior’s fourth game in charge into such a grind. “I just have to keep focusing on the job,” Rosenior said. “I would love the fans to be with us and with me. To do that I need to earn that.”Barnes seals easy win against PSV but Newcastle face wait over GuimarãesRead moreChelsea have had a mixed return to Europe’s top table. They were schooled by Bayern Munich in their opening game, responded with comfortable wins against Ajax and ­Benfica, followed dropping points against Qarabag by ­thrashing ­Barcelona and imploded when they were 1-0 up against Atalanta last month. They remain ­maddeningly inconsistent, although they can never be ruled out in a cup com­petition. For Rosenior, there is ­encouragement to be taken from mid-season ­managerial changes ­acting as the catalyst for Chelsea’s two ­Champions League wins.It was Roberto Di Matteo in 2012 and Thomas Tuchel in 2021. What those two managers had, though, was a group of hardened winners. Rosenior has inherited a callow squad from Enzo Maresca, which is one of the gripes supporters have with the ownership, and those who pine for the good old days perhaps felt a pang of nostalgia at David Luiz sitting on the Pafos bench.Quick GuideChampions League roundup: Kane secures Bayern's pathShowHarry Kane struck twice in three minutes to carryBayern Munichto a 2-0 victory over Belgium'sUnion Saint-Gilloisein the Champions League on Wednesday and book their ticket for the knockout stage with a game to spare.Bayern's top scorer headed in at the near post from a Michael Olise corner in the 52nd minute then and added another from the penalty spot after he was brought down.

The Brazilian also helped Antonio Conte’s Chelsea to win the league in 2017 and was one of a few familiar faces in the Pafos team. Ken Sema, once of ­Watford, was at left-wing back and the attack featured Mislav Orsic, the Croatian forward whose goal in a win for Dinamo Zagreb ended Tuchel’s time at Chelsea.Rosenior is the fourth head coach to try his luck since Tuchel’s departure. His new players are yet to adjust to his methods. Chelsea were ­missing Cole Palmer, who was rested after complaining of tightness in his thigh, and there were long spells when they struggled to absorb the absence of their best player.View image in fullscreenAn anxious-looking Liam Rosenior watches on.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAIt was another tough night for Liam Delap. The striker was starved of ­service, failed to shake off his ­markers and never looked like ­scoring before being taken off with 20 minutes left.There was some enterprising football from Chelsea during the first half. Enzo Fernández had a goal disallowed and Reece James shot inches wide. Jay Gorter made fine saves from Caicedo and Jorrel Hato.Pafos, who almost led when Jajá hit the woodwork after his shot deflected off James’s arm, sat back and left everyone behind the ball. They posed such little threat that Filip ­Jörgensen had not made a save before injury forced the ­Chelsea goalkeeper to make way for ­Robert Sánchez at half‑time. Equally they had three draws from their first six games and were ­organised enough to draw Rosenior into ­bringing James off for Estêvão ­Willian for the second half.Estêvão livened up the crowd and almost broke the deadlock with a rasping volley. Yet the frustration deepened. Alejandro Garnacho and Pedro Neto struggled on the flanks and Chelsea began to run out of ideas. They tested Gorter with efforts from distance but grew ponderous on the ball.When the possession is aimless, though, set pieces offer salvation. One slip proved costly for Pafos. Nany Dimata failed to clear Neto’s corner at the near post and Caicedo punished the substitute by heading in from close range.The celebrations were far from ecstatic. Pafos fumed, claiming Benoît Badiashile had shoved one of their players over in the middle. ­Chelsea had avoided their first goalless draw in Europe in 54 games.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueChelseaPafosmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It is more a feeling of: ‘OK, you do the same performance [on 1 February] and just be a little bit sharper in both boxes, then the possibilities to get another result will be big.”This could be the last season that these two sides take part in this competition for a lengthy period, with plans afoot for the three English teams taking part in the Champions League next season to be exempt from this cup as part of a revamp of the format.View image in fullscreenLaura Blindkilde Brown rues a missed opportunity for Manchester City.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAChelsea will face United, League Cup finalists for the first time, after they won at Arsenal in their semi-final on Wednesday night. United’s win came courtesy of Elisabeth Terland’s low finish on the stroke of half-time, before Arsenal’s Olivia Smith was sent off for a second bookable offence.At the Joie Stadium, after Kaptein scored when she was allowed to get in front of the City centre-back Jade Rose and jump unchallenged at the far post to nod in Sandy Baltimore’s hanging cross, City were nearly able to mask a disappointing first-half display with an equaliser moments before half-time, but Vivianne Miedema struck the base of a post after Hampton had ventured out from her goal to try to stop Khadija Shaw’s run. When they struck the woodwork for a second time, moments after the break, it came amid a sustained spell of pressure, with Kerstin Casparij’s effort bouncing back off an upright. That started off a flurry of chances.Grace Clinton headed wide for the hosts before Hampton saved well from both Alex Greenwood and Miedema. At the other end, the ­Chelsea substitute Lauren James forced Ayaka Yamashita into a superb reflex save with a rising strike.Hampton had to be at her best to tip over Yui Hasegawa’s half-volley in eye-catching style and later palm away Lauren Hemp’s curler, with Chelsea – who were 9-1 winners against Liverpool in their quarter-final – hanging on.Explore more on these topicsWomen's League CupWomen's footballManchester City WomenChelsea WomennewsShareReuse this content"

There must be consequences. Perhaps there have alreadybeenconsequences. Harry Brook is very sorry forgetting punched by a bouncer in New Zealand. Rob Key is very sorryfor overseeing an Ashes tour that in retrospect could probably have been an email. Brendon McCullumis not sorry, but has promised to “look at things over the next little while”, which is basically the same as an apology, so fine.In the meantime, the travelling circus of English cricket rolls on. There is a white-ball series in Sri Lanka starting on Thursday morning, for which – consequences, remember – McCullum remains as coach, Key remains as managing director and Brook remains as captain. In addition Zak Crawley returns to open the batting in the 50-over team, a fitting reward for not playing a single 50-over game in the whole of 2024 or 2025. Nature heals.From Ashes hangover to subcontinental scars as England aim to rewrite historyRead morePerhaps we do, too. Two weeks after the teams left the field in Sydney,the raw emotions awakened by England’s defeathave subsided a little. Sleep and teabags have been replenished. The Twenty20 World Cup starts in a fortnight. Winter nets have already begun. This is the blessing and the curse of cricket: there is always fresh hope around the corner, fresh drifts of snow to cover guilty footprints.As for McCullum, his contract runs to the end of the 2027 Ashes and according to reports it would cost more than £1m to break it now. Indeed it is possible that this knowledge has informed some of his more obdurate proclamations to the media in Australia, a recognition that in a landscape rich with franchise cash and poor in willing international coaches, he still holds all the cards.The first point to make here is that losing in Australia should not in itself be a sackable offence. Losing in Australia is just something that happens, often and to everyone, like nasal hair and hiccups. Exceptions: one of the finest Indian teams in history, scraping a couple of 2-1 victories with the help of an all-time fast bowling freak and a playing base of half a billion. Before that, a South African team containing at least half a dozen hall-of-famers. Perhaps one of the reasons English cricket keeps finding itself back in this situation is its stubborn habit of insisting on generational greatness as the bar for employment.None of which is to defendEngland’s sorry excuse for a campaign, which looked bad and felt even worse, a recurring nightmare in which Ollie Pope is driving on the up for ever, in which Travis Head is still flaying Brydon Carse to the square leg boundary. Somehow carelessness feels even less forgivable than ineptitude, which may explain the particularly vindictive strain of criticism this side have been made to endure. Bloodlust, vengeance, punishment beatings: this feels pure and real. We will flog you until you care as much as we do.View image in fullscreenEngland have come in for bitter criticism since the Ashes came to a close.Photograph: Asanka Brendon Ratnayake/ReutersAll the same, perhaps it is worth retracing the steps that brought us here. Should it surprise us that a team renowned for lax preparation and loose shots prepared laxly and shot loosely? Was it really so unforeseeable that a team reared on a no-consequence culture should act as if consequences were alien to them? If it walks like a Bazball and talks like a Bazball, then maybe assume it also wafts in the eighth-stump corridor like a Bazball.Long before Adelaide and Perth andNoosa, there were Rawalpindi and Headingley and the bucket hats and the kebabs,the Nighthawkand winning by, I dunno, 150 runs. From its very conception Bazball was a nonsensical response to a largely nonsensical set of circumstances: a team traumatised by Covid bubbles and haunted by death and decay, a declining player base, an apathetic public, an international game being pecked to bits by franchise cricket. In the face of disaster, choose nihilism. In a results-based business, disregard results entirely.Bazball succeeded because it was based on a lie, and so perhaps it was doomed to fail for the same reasons. But have any of the prevailing winds really shifted in the last four years? Is it remotely possible to recreate 2010-11 in a world of 12-month franchise contracts, when the entire month of August is now majority-owned by Indian entrepreneurs?Of the under-19 squad currently playing in the World Cup in Harare, only four did not come through the private school system, where you are eight times more likely to have access to a turf pitch and 10 times more likely to have a qualified coach. The £35m in grassroots funding announced by Rishi Sunak in 2024 turned out not to exist. The sale of the eight Hundred franchises raised more than £500m, but Sussex have just been put into special financial measures.View image in fullscreenMcCullum takes a break before England’s white-ball series in Sri Lanka gets under way.Photograph: Sameera Peiris/Getty ImagesEnglish cricket remains a metaphor for the country at large: hollowed out and stripped down, a place of VIP queues and boarded-up high streets, pristine public school fields and “no ball games” signs on housing estates. A place where people are slowly tuning out, living paycheck to paycheck, bored of experts.Perhaps McCullum will eventually fall on his six-iron, an appropriate-sized human sacrifice. Perhaps Bazball has already breathed its last, destined to be replaced by some southern hemisphere pragmatist in reflective sunglasses. But if the truth hurts, what real harm is there in maintaining the lie? If the consequences are too painful, why bother? Whether Ben Stokes and McCullum and Key are the best men for the job is a matter for debate. Whether they are the right men is inarguable. In the end, after all, a country gets the cricket team it deserves.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamAshes 2025-26The AshesCricketcommentShareReuse this content"

Daniel Hallett, from the Dragons Supporters’ Club, said their own survey had shown “there is no appetite for a potential merger, there is no appetite for jumping ship to another team who have been historic rivals”.“We recognise change is painful and we went into this understanding that this would be very painful for groups of supporters,” Collier-Keywood said. “But unfortunately the rugby system was broken, the pathways were broken, and we have announced an investment plan of £28m over five years to fix that problem.”The plan proposes scrapping the Ospreys, given the region’s owners are the WRU’s preferred bidder for Cardiff, which the union has owned since the club went into administration.Collier-Keywood and the WRU chief executive, Abi Tierney, believed the situation they had inherited was unsustainable because the WRU was in special financial measures. That meant the most pressing issue they faced was the need to refinance the WRU’s debts.Quick GuideGalthié drops experienced trioShowThe France head coach, Fabian Galthié, has dropped the experienced trio Gaël Fickou, Gregory Alldritt and Les Bleus’ all-time record try-scorer Damian Penaud from his 42-man squad for the start of the Six Nations.All three players will miss France’s Six Nations opener at home against Ireland next month but could be called up later in the tournament.The fly-half Romain Ntamack is also missing through injury but Dupont will make his first France appearance since tearing his cruciate knee ligament in March.For Ireland, Hugo Keenan, who has not played since the British & Irish Lions tour last year, has been named in Andy Farrell’s Six Nations squad.Meanwhile, the former England captain Jamie George is to retire at the end of 2027 after agreeing a one-year contract extension with Saracens.AFP and Guardian sportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.To do so, they needed to negotiate a new Professional Rugby Agreement, but the process had stalled because two regions, Scarlets and Ospreys, wanted more assurances over how the WRU planned to finance Cardiff. “We were going to fail,” Tierney said. “Sometimes one of the issues you face in leadership is that keeping going along the same path isn’t the right thing to do.”Collier-Keywood argued that Welsh rugby is “starved of resources”, with the four teams subsisting on operational budgets that are only around half the size of some of their rivals in other countries.Cutting one of the four regions is “the affordable way forward, and it is also the way forward that will allow our rugby to improve”, he claimed. “When we sat down as a board and looked at the rugby players we had in the system who were Welsh, we didn’t feel we had enough for four teams.”The existing four had been employing “around 30 non-Welsh players”, which he described as “frankly a waste of money in the longer term”.Tierney also denied that the WRU was facing any real threat of an Extraordinary General Meeting, even after Central Glamorgan Rugby Union recently wrote to clubs asking for their support holding a vote of no confidence in Collier-Keywood. “We haven’t received anything from the community clubs,” Tierney said, “and we haven’t yet had any call for an EGM.”Central Glamorgan would need the support of around 30 of the 300 clubs in Wales to force an EGM.Explore more on these topicsWelsh Rugby UnionRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport.”Coquerel had said on Tuesday that he could not see how France could play at the World Cup if Trump went through with his threats overGreenland. “Seriously one imagines going to play the World Cup in a country who attacks its ‘neighbours’, threatens to invade Greenland and rides rough shod over international law,” he said.View image in fullscreenMarina Ferrari, France’s sports minister, says the World Cup is ‘an extremely important moment for those who love sport’.Photograph: Isa Harsin/Sipa/ShutterstockCoquerel’s compatriot Claude Le Roy, a veteran coach who guided Cameroon to the 1988 Africa Cup of Nations title, suggested African teams should boycott the World Cup, to be held between 11 June and 19 July.“One wonders whether it is not necessary to call for a boycott of the 2026 World Cup, given the behaviour of Donald Trump with regard to the continent,” the 77-year-old told the French newspaper Figaro.The French line had come hours after the German government had divested itself of responsibility for taking decisions over a possible boycott. Christiane Schenderlein, the state minister for sports, said in a statement sent to AFP: “Decisions on participation or boycotts at major sporting events lie solely with the competent sports associations, not with politicians. This assessment should therefore be made by the respective associations – in this case, the German FA andFifa.”Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, has cultivated a close relationship with Trump, evencreating a special “Fifa Peace Prize”he awarded to Trump at the World Cup draw in December.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Sport politicsWorld CupFifaFranceDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In one strike, a boy, his father and a 22-year-old man were hit by Israeli drones on the eastern edge of the Bureij refugee camp, according to officials at al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah, which received the bodies.In another case, a 13-year-old boy, Moatsem al-Sharafy, was shot dead by Israeli troops while collecting firewood in the eastern town of Bani Suheila, according to Nasser hospital. Footage shared online showed the boy’s father weeping over his body on a hospital bed.The journalists killed were named as Mohammed Salah Qashta, Abdul Raouf Shaat and Anas Ghneim.View image in fullscreenThe twisted remains of the Egyptian Relief Committee vehicle hit in an Israeli strike.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APShaat was a regular contributor to Agence France-Presse as a photo and video journalist, although the agency said he was not on assignment at the time of the strike.Local journalists said their work was sponsored by the Egyptian Relief Committee, which oversees Egypt’s relief operations in Gaza. Mohammed Mansour, a spokesperson for the committee, said the vehicle had been known to the Israeli military.Video circulating online showed a burned-out vehicle by the roadside, with smoke still rising from the wreckage and debris scattered across the ground. The bodies of two journalists had been taken to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, while the third was transferred to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, medical officials said.The Israeli military said it had ordered the strike after its soldiers “identified several suspects who operated a drone affiliated with Hamas” in central Gaza.“Following the identification and due to the threat that the drone posed to the troops, the IDF precisely struck the suspects who activated the drone,” it said, adding that the details of the incident were under examination.The media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said Israeli forces had killed at least 29Palestinian journalistsin Gaza between December 2024 and December 2025 and thatnearly 220 journalists had been killedsince the start of the Gaza war in October 2023. Other groups put the toll higher.Moatsem al-Sharafy’s mother, Safaa al-Sharafy, told the Associated Press that her son had gone out to gather firewood so she could cook. She said: “He went out in the morning, hungry. He told me he’d go quickly and come back.”Israeli forces have killed at least 466 Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect in October, according to health authorities.Explore more on these topicsGazaJournalist safetyIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestineShareReuse this content"

She has been running a One Mitzvah for Bondi program every week since the terror attack, opening the charity’s doors to hundreds of families to prepare meals for vulnerable communities, and will run two events on Thursday.“We truly believe that enabling kids and families to do these mitzvahs, these acts of kindness, is deeply empowering, giving young people a sense of agency, purpose and hope, especially at times like these,” she said.The president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Daniel Aghion, said he would be spending the day at a synagogue while also practising a mitzvah, which he described as a “beautiful Jewish tradition”.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAghion said theoverwhelming supportfor mitzvahs after the Bondi attack had made him “proud of my Jewish faith and proud of Australians”.“The antidote to exclusion is inclusion,” he said. “One of the beautiful things that can come out of such a terrible event is a way to bring Australians together.“We as a nation want Australia to be a better place, and with very simple steps and acts of kindness, we can go towards making it one.”Mourners will also gather inside theSydneyOpera House on Thursday evening for the official national memorial service, organised by the Chabad of Bondi, with support from the federal government, community partners and faith leaders under the theme: “Light Will Win, a Gathering of Unity and Remembrance.”The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, the opposition leader, Sussan Ley and the premier ofNew South Wales, Chris Minns, will be among those to speak at the invitation-only event.Among those on the guest list are survivors of the terror attack, families, first responders, community leaders, and other government representatives.The Opera House will be bathed in light alongside other significant national buildings in alignment with the day’s theme. Guests will arrive from 5.30pm, with official proceedings to run from 7pm AEDT until approximately 9pm.Those hoping to watch from home can livestream the proceedings on the Chabad of Bondi’s YouTube channel.The event will begin with a national minute of silence, followed by prayers from Rabbi Pinchus Feldman.The national anthem will be sung by the Choir of The Great Synagogue and 15 candles will be lit by families and representatives of the deceased.Lights, mitzvahs and a minute’s silence: how Australians will mark the national day of mourning for Bondi victimsRead moreThere will also be a number of tribute videos, as well as a musical performance alongside the official addresses and memorial readings.Rabbi Yossi Friedman of the Chabad of Bondi said with the memorial event now at capacity, a short name reading and candle lighting service would also take place at Bondi Pavilion from 5.30pm until 6pm.The NSW Jewish Board of Deputies CEO, Michele Goldman, welcomed the day of mourning as a “moment for Australians to pause and reflect on the 15 lives lost in the terror attack on the first night of Hanukah”.“We encourage every Australian to undertake a mitzvah, whether it’s checking on a neighbour, volunteering, or supporting a local business, as a way to honour the victims through acts of kindness,” they said.In Victoria, multifaith leaders will gather for a vigil at St Paul’s Anglican Cathedral in Melbourne at 11.15am on Thursday to mark the day. It will be open to the public and livestreamed online.Victoria’s premier, Jacinta Allan, said the vigil was “a moment to stand with the Jewish community and reaffirm who we are”.It will be the first time Australia has observed a national day of mourning since the death of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022.Explore more on these topicsBondi beach terror attackSydneyNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

It represents a huge injection into a sector where Arts Council England (ACE) funding wascut by 30%in 2010, and follows a previously announced £270m.Nandy said: “We’re investing in every borough in the country because arts belongs to everybody and we are determined to ensure that wherever you live in the country, whatever your background, access to arts and culture belongs to you.”She said she believed this moment was comparable to theaftermath of the second world war, “when a generation of visionaries stepped forward and used the power of the arts to help light the way forwards for a very fractured, devastated notion”.The package also includes £160m to be invested in local and regional museums, and a £425m Creative Foundations Fund, which will be managed by ACE and will support about 300 capital projects at arts venues across the country.The heritage sector will get a further £230m, while public libraries can apply for £27.5m and national portfolio organisations will have an extra £80m available over the course of this parliament. Local and regional museums will get £160m.Darren Henley, the chief executive of ACE, said: “By continuing to fund our cultural infrastructure, the government is investing in our collective future in ensuring creative opportunities for generations to come.”While the plan was welcomed across the sector, there were dissenting voices. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect union, said that package was wrong to focus solely on bricks and mortar institutions rather than those employed in the sector.He said: “Our culture is not just about artefacts, sites and buildings but about the people who bring it to life. This sector is facing an ongoing and intractable crisis in pay and retention which has to be addressed.”Nandy praised a recentreview of ACE by Margaret Hodge, which found there had been a “loss of respect and trust” for the council among those it backed, in part because of “perceived political interference in decision-making”. Hodge called for the scrapping of ACE’s “let’s create” strategy, which was due to run until the end of the decade.The culture secretary hinted she would back the recommendations when she officially responds in the next month, calling it “a really welcome shake-up of a sector that has been underfunded, undervalued and underutilised for too long”.Explore more on these topicsArts fundingMuseumsArts Council EnglandLisa NandynewsShareReuse this content"

Sam Jones, for the prosecution, told the jury that the victim had in effect disappeared from society.He said: “She was kept in and prevented from leaving the address and she was assaulted and hit many, many times and forced to work with the threats of violence. She was denied food and the ability to wash over many years.”The court heard social services were involved with the family in the late 1990s but there were no records of contact since.Jones said: “The fact remains that nothing was done by social services.” He said there were no medical records or dental records for the woman, and she had not seen a doctor in two decades.“The lack of records from the hospital, the doctor and the dentist or any involvement with social services for 20 years provides further support of her never being allowed to leave the house.“By the late 1990s it appears the woman disappeared into a black hole. Not a single meeting that left a record.”Like many of those living in the house, including Wixon, the woman lost many of her teeth due to poor dental hygiene, the court heard.Neighbours occasionally saw her in the garden. One neighbour described the woman as “looking like something out of a concentration camp”. Another claimed she was just “skin and bone” and described seeing her being hit with a broom.One neighbour described Wixon in a social media post as a “slavekeeper”. Police went to the house in March 2021 in response to a tip-off. Officers described the woman’s bedroom as looking like a “prison cell”, with other bedrooms untidy and dirty.Footage from police bodyworn cameras showed the woman appearing thin, timid, unwashed and fearful, with a bruise she attributed to Wixon. She had scarring to her lips and face and large calluses on her feet and ankles from being constantly on her hands and knees cleaning floors.The woman told police: “I don’t want to be here. I don’t feel safe. Mandy hits me all the time. I don’t like it. I haven’t washed for years. She doesn’t let me.”Since being rescued, the woman has been living with a foster family, attending college and has been on holidays abroad. She has suffered nightmares about her ordeal, has a constant wish to clean and has grown her hair, as she always wanted to.Wixon, who had no previous criminal record, maintained she took the woman in to help her as her own family had problems.Edward Hollingsworth, for the defence, described the prosecution case as a “tale of fantasy and lies”.He said: “The life of Amanda Wixon was much more complicated and nuanced. Her other children were not vaccinated, not attending school, and had rotting teeth and head lice.”He said they all lived in squalid conditions and the woman had been neglected but not violently abused.The barrister said the house was cluttered and parts looked filthy. He said: “If the prosecution case is she was a house slave, why was she not tidying it. If you had a woman as a house slave for 20 years, why have you got a house like that?”Hollingsworth pointed out the woman was on the electoral role until 2022 and the benefits agency knew she was there too. It was possible she did not see a doctor because that was just how the family dealt with health matters.Gloucestershire police said Wixon deprived the victim of money. Despite claiming benefits for the victim since 2000, which were paid into Wixon’s bank account, she was forced to live in poverty and wear hand-me-down clothes. She had to serve the family meals, do the washing up and sort the family’s clothing.Wixon forbade the victim from washing herself but was made to bathe Wixon’s children.On one occasion, when Wixon discovered the victim had been given a mobile phone, she took it from her and hit her around the face with it, giving her a black eye. She then smashed the phone with a hammer.In March 2021, after feeling ill, the victim used another secret mobile phone she had been given to call someone she knew for help. The police were called and officers attended.DC Emma Jackson from Gloucestershire police said: “Wixon kept an extremely vulnerable victim captive in appalling conditions for over two decades.“Instead of caring for her, as she was supposed to, she exploited her and forced her to work in domestic servitude whilst subjecting her to the most cruel and inhumane treatment.“I commend the victim in this case for reaching out for help. Knowing all too well what the violent consequences would have been if she’d been caught, it was incredibly courageous of her.”Laura Burgess, a senior crown prosecutor, said: “Amanda Wixon subjected the victim in this case to decades of unimaginable cruelty, exploitation and control. She was denied her freedom, her dignity, and even the most basic autonomy. The progress she has made since being removed from this oppressive environment is a testament to her strength.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsGloucestershirenewsShareReuse this content"

Anything less would license future newsroom raids and normalize censorship by search warrant.”The Post filed two motions in US district court for the eastern district of Virginia. In addition to requesting the government return the materials, the newspaper also asked for an order instructing the government to keep copies of the material under seal – and not review them – until the matter is resolved.“The Post and Natanson have an undeniable interest in, and need for, the seized data,” lawyers for the newspaper wrote. “Withholding this data would harm them irreparably, violate their constitutional rights, and constitute an unlawful prior restraint. Return is the only adequate remedy.”The seizure related to a government contractor, Aurelio Perez-Lugones, who is currently in federal custody in Maryland after being charged with unlawfully retaining national defense information.Last week, the group Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed a memo with the court urging the unsealing of all judicial records related to the raid of Natanson’s home, including the search warrant used, the application and the supporting affidavit.Bruce D Brown, the organization’s president, said in a statement on Wednesday: “This is the first time in US history that the government has searched a reporter’s home in a national security media leak investigation, seizing potentially a vast amount of confidential data and information.“The move imperils public interest reporting and will have ramifications far beyond this specific case. It is critical that the court blocks the government from searching through this material until it can address the profound threat to the first amendment posed by the raid.”The Post said the devices seized by the government “contain years of information about past and current confidential sources and other unpublished newsgathering materials, including those she was using for current reporting” – and that very little of the seized material relates to the warrant issued in the case, which relates specifically to the government contractor at issue.“The government cannot meet its heavy burden to justify this intrusion, and it has ignored narrower, lawful alternatives,” the Post’s lawyers wrote.Because her work devices were seized, Natanson no longer has the ability to communicate with her sources, the Post argued. “Nor are Natanson’s confidential sources likely to work with her again, if the government is permitted to rummage through her files unchecked.”Natanson has not published any stories since the raid. In late December, shepublished a first-person essayabout her reporting process and interactions with anonymous government sources.The attorney general, Pam Bondi, has defended the raid. “The first amendment is a bedrock principle, but this isn’t about that,” she said in an appearance on Fox News last week. “This is about classified material that could jeopardize lives.”Explore more on these topicsMediaWashington PostUS press and publishingTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has highlighted the case as “the kind of community-focused development these reforms will deliver”.It said: “Bath shows how neighbourhood identity, shaped by local history, culture and landscape is reflected in building types, facades and architectural details. This allows people to connect to their local heritage.”Other developments highlighted include Kampus in Manchester and the Malings in Newcastle upon Tyne.View image in fullscreenThe Kampus development in Manchester is among those seen as ‘the kind of community-focused development’ the guidelines could deliver.Photograph: Hufton And Crow/Data FieldsProvisions for nature such asswift bricksandhedgehog highwaysshould be incorporated, as well as protections against the flooding that isbecoming more prevalentowing to the climate crisis, the government said.Thedesign and placemaking planning practice guidance, published in draft on Wednesday for consultation, does not mandate any of these guidelines as requirements, leaving it open to developers to ignore them. Green experts told the Guardian this was a significant flaw.Anna Hollyman, a co-head of policy and places at the UK Green Building Council, said: “[The plans acknowledge] the urgent need to raise the bar for new builds and to integrate liveability with climate mitigation, resilience and nature. Yet in light of the starknational security assessment on global ecosystemspublished yesterday, this is clearly not enough.”The assessment warned of the dire impacts on Britain’s national security from the failure to plan for ecosystem collapse.Hollyman called for clearer regulations. “The built environment sector has the potential to be a proactive contributor to restoring local places and wider ecosystems through biodiversity net gain, nature-based solutions and regenerative design. We need a systemic government response commensurate with the scale of the challenge, one that recognises biodiversity and climate resilience as critical infrastructure to every neighbourhood,” she said.View image in fullscreenHousing in the Malings, Newcastle upon Tyne.Photograph: Hufton And Crow/see caption / data fieldsRachel Hackett, a planning and development manager at the Wildlife Trusts, called for the government to specify measures for wildlife.“We need a bolder, more ambitious plan that cements nature firmly into the housebuilding rules,” she said. “Nature-friendly design measures like swift bricks and hedgehog highways will only make a significant difference for wildlife if they are mandatory for all developments. We have had years of guidelines and optional choices for developers – and years of nature decline.”The guidelines cover the planning of new neighbourhoods and amenities, and can be used by local authorities to set their own design codes for homes in their areas. In theory at least, developers who meet the guidelines should find it easier to obtain planning permission.Matthew Pennycook, the housing and planning minister, said: “Exemplary development should be the norm, not the exception, so that more communities feel the benefits of new development and welcome it. These standards will help ensure new homes and neighbourhoods are attractive, well-connected, sustainable and built to last.”The government has still to publish its regulations governinghow new houses are constructed, which are expected to make solar panels, heat pumps and high standards of insulation mandatory on nearly all new homes. Thelong-delayed future homes standardis now expected early this year.Explore more on these topicsAccess to green spacePlanning policyHousingCommunitiesEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Which were, of course, the new unicorns. Which triggered a moment for narwhals. If you are an unusual-looking animal, this is your time. Even humans who have never seen an axolotl – a type of salamander – in the smooth and slimy flesh will have met a cartoon or cuddly one. Mexican axolotls have the kind of look that is made for commercial reproduction. The most popular domestic species is pink. Some glow in the dark – and their smile is bigger than Walter’s in the Muppets.At Argos or Kmart, you can buy axolotls as cuddly toys, featured on socks, hoodies and bedding, or moulded into nightlights. You can crochet an axolotl, stick a rubber one on the end of your pencil or wear them on your underpants. The Economist saysthey’re a “global megastar”. More than 1,000 axolotl-themed products are listed on Walmart’s website. They graceUS Girl Scouts patches, McDonald’s Happy Meals, and the 50-peso bill, a design so popular that, last year, theBank of Mexico reported that 12.9 million people were hoarding the notes.The animal’s name – which comes from the Aztec god Xolotl – provides greetings card designers with infinite puns. Love you alotl! Thanks alotl! You can ask axolotl questions about how our infatuation came about, but you can’t deny that this beguiling salamander has captured human hearts.“Every time I look at one, I can’t help but smile back,” says Nicole Rowe, who runsan axolotl rehoming centrefrom her house in the West Midlands, England, between shifts at a craft store. “You know that saying: ‘If you smile for long enough, eventually you will start to feel happier’? That’s the effect they have on me.”View image in fullscreen‘I love their little hands and feet’ … Nicole Rowe in her Lotl Room.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianRowe is also an artist who used to design tattoos and now makes axolotl models forher Etsy shop. She has a mug decorated with a pole-dancing axolotl and the words “Only Fins”. On our video call, she’s wearing an axolotlsweatshirt. Behind her, the wall of her spare room, which she calls the Lotl Room, is lined with tanks housing 30 adult axolotls, most of which she has rescued from people who can no longer care for them. There is a whole shelf of cuddly axolotl toys.Rowe acquired her first living axolotl – a “dirty leucistic morph” (pale with dark spots) called Ghost – eight years ago, when she was in her mid-20s. She discovered them via Pokémon (though in Japan they were old news, having broken out in cartoon form ina 1985 advert for UFO instant noodles). In the early 2000s, when Rowe was 11, her favourite Pokémon was Mudkip, and when she delved deeper, Google told her that Mudkip was a cross between a mudskipper fish and an axolotl.View image in fullscreenA child’s hoodie by clothing brand Rapanui, with a picture of the ubiquitous axolotl.Photograph: RapanuiWhen Rowe acquired Ghost, axolotls were so rare that her pet shop had to order one especially for her. In the years since, they have proliferated in popular culture. In 2010, they were one of theinspirations for Toothless the dragonin the film How to Train Your Dragon. In 2020, Fortnite released Axo, an axolotl skin. And the following year, Minecraft introduced axolotls – and a bucket to carry them in – to its 140 million monthly active players. The number of people acquiring pet axolotls surged. The American public radio network NPR ran warning stories of peopleaccidentally breedingthem. (It is illegal to own axolotls in some US states and Canadian provinces.)In the wilds of social media, the axolotl’s viral forebears have often paired unusual facial features with a winning smile. A species name that contains challenging letter combinations definitely helps the social media profile. Take llamas, for instance. But also capybaras,which had a moment in the early 2020s, and quokkas, who are known for their smiley facial expressions and as a result are practicallyfighting off selfie-hunters in south-western Australia. Anykākāpōsor okapis reading this may wish to lie low.So what is it about axolotls that humans find so compulsively relatable?From a commercial point of view, says Joe Evans, a buyer at Selfridges department store in the UK, who first encountered them in toy form, “they have exploded as a must-have character for gen Alpha, with brands such as Squishmallows, Lego and Posture Pals adding them to their ranges. With their soft, squishy shapes and expressive faces, axolotls tap into feelgood comfort. For some, there’s a fascination that these almost mythical-looking creatures are real animals.”View image in fullscreenNicole Rowe with just a few of her cuddly axolotls.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The GuardianOn the one hand, the axolotl is an anthropomorphist’s dream. There is that smile, of course: at times, a childlike line-drawing of happiness, at others, a full, pink, apparently toothless grin. “They’ve also got baby-like features, wide-set eyes,” points out Prof Luis Zambrano, an ecologist conducting a census of the wild axolotl population in the floating gardens of Lake Xochimilco, southernMexicoCity, one of its last remaining habitats.There are also those very human-looking hands. “I love their fingers,” Rowe says. “I love their little hands and feet. Sometimes you see one hand holding on to a plant and the rest of their body floating, and they look like a little flag in the water. It’s so cute.”On social media, an axolotl only has to do something vaguely human –such as yawn, or “dance” – and it instantly generates content. They’rea gift to doodlers, often so still in their tank that owners have plenty of time to draw sunglasses and hats on to the glass and upload the videos to TikTok. Their head shape resembles that of a Funko Pop!, while their “floofs”, or external gills, are a visual trademark as unique and instantly identifiable as a unicorn’s horn.View image in fullscreenGen Alpha’s must-have character … an axolotl keyring from New Look.Photograph: New LookFittingly, there is a sense of magic about axolotls. “Their looks might be the first thing that attracts you, but when you start digging into how these animals function, and the things they can do, it’s amazing,” says Aida Rodrigo Albors, who leadsa research groupat the Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. “They’re simple creatures, but they have amazing powers. If they lose their tail, they can regrow a whole new spinal cord within a new tail. Any tissue that you name, they can regenerate it. Even if they lose a big part of their brain, it grows back.” Rodrigo Albors’ ambition is “to learn how regeneration works, and then try to implement that in animals that can’t regenerate”.The power to regenerate isn’t quite an instant health potion – it takes a few weeks to a few months to regrow a limb – but the implications for human healing are tantalising. When Rodrigo Albors was a PhD student in Dresden, Germany, in the early 2010s, people had no idea what she was talking about when she said she was researching axolotl regeneration. Now, of course, “that’s completely flipped”.Unlike most salamanders, axolotls reach adulthood without ever metamorphosing. “They grow and grow, and live for over 20 years – but remain as tadpoles all their life,” Rodrigo Albors explains.At a time when longevity has gone from a fringe and sometimes wacky research interest toa multibillion-dollar industry, the appeal is obvious. In this regard, axolotls represent a sort of fount of ancient knowledge. It is not quite eternal youth, or the philosopher’s stone, but axolotls may be as close as we get on Earth. Perhaps that’s why the knock-on effect for humans is to celebrate them in pretty infantile ways, such as singing along toAsk an Axolotl, the 2025 YouTube song which had 16m views within a few days of its posting, and will make you pine for the sophistication and wit ofThe Duck Song.Axolotls’ qualities clearly appeal to the human love of fantasy. Those feathery gills give them a mythical or alien look. (Rowe has named hers Ghost, Wraith, Banshee and Apsu, the last after the Babylonian sea god.) InJulio Cortázar’s 1956 short story Axolotl, the narrator stares so hard at the salamanders in the zoo that he becomes one. The fact that axolotls are “so different-looking” is part of their appeal. “They look like they’re not from this world,” Rowe says softly.View image in fullscreenEndangered … an axolotl tank at AquaRio in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.Photograph: Pablo Porciúncula/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the wild, axolotls sadly may not be long for this world. Zambrano says he will be lucky to see a single axolotl in the canals of Lake Xochimilco in the final phase of his census. His own passion for axolotls began with an offer of funding, but it was “love at second sight”, he says, when he encountered them in the work of some of his favourite biologists in history, such as Alexander von Humboldt, Georges Cuvier and Stephen Jay Gould. He has been studying axolotls for 25 years.Drainage, the encroaching development of surrounding areas and the introduction of predatory fish such as carp and tilapia have all contributed toaxolotls’ critically endangered classification. In 1998, Lake Xochimilco had 6,000 axolotls per square kilometre. By 2008, there were only 100, and in 2014 just 36.Three years ago, Zambrano helped to launch a fundraising campaign calledAdoptaxolotlto fund the census and “raise concern about the situation of the axolotl in the wild”. In his office, he has his fair share of toy axolotls – people keep giving them to him – but the wild axolotl is “completely different to the pet one”. It’s brown or grey, and it rarely smiles. “Of course not,” he says. “They don’t like you. Because they are wild …”View image in fullscreenUnsmiling … wild axolotl are brown or grey, ‘completely different to the pet one’.Photograph: izanbar/Getty Images/iStockphotoAxolotls abound in Mexico City’s iconography. When the city co-hosts the World Cup this summer, itsofficial mascot will be a bipedal axolotl. “I am a little bit afraid,” Zambrano says, “of what is going to happen in the World Cup … Everyone will think this is a very nice party, but the cost, particularly here, will be Xochimilco being seen as a tourist attraction instead of the home of the axolotl. People will arrive with garbage and noise, and everybody will want a mariachi in the boat.”If only the Mexican government could do for axolotlswhat the Chinese did for pandas, he says. “About 30 or 40 years ago, their popularity pushed the government to create protective areas in China” – nature reserves, investment in the bears’ habitats. In contrast, Zambrano believes that the local government in Mexico City has acted “contrary to [axolotls’] preservation … They think that it’s an important achievement of conservation to have them in the Mexican zoo in a very special place where the elephants used to be.”More generally, Zambrano is worried that “TikTok, Instagram, Minecraft, all these things, have created a parallel world. So it doesn’t matter if the real ones are going down, if I have them in two dimensions … Internationally, we are going in a very strange direction,” he says.Axolotls in crisis: the fight to save the ‘water monster’ of Mexico CityRead moreMilena Andrzejczak has recently bought two axolotls fromFish Planet in Shoreditch. She loves nature, and knows that Axel and Drogon, which she treats with care and respect, are different from the wild ones, and has read enough to understand that in their native habitat, axolotls are endangered. “So I said: ‘OK, I want to take one and take care of it,” she says. Since she got fish and axolotls, she says, “I said to my husband, we don’t need TV. It’s the most relaxing thing to sit and watch them.” She feels that by caring for them, she is connecting with an animal that she cares about in the wild.“The population is going down, the habitat is really bad, but when you see them floating in a tank, they are in Zen mode,” Zambrano says. Maybe calmness and a smile in the face of possible oblivion is something that humans can relate to. And maybe, too, we relate to the apparent strangeness of axolotls – the sense of a quirk, an oddity, perhaps at a time when we’re finding ourselves increasingly strange. Though, of course, none of us is any stranger than the next animal.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeAmphibiansMexicoAmericasConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In November it issued legal proceedings at Edmonton county court seeking forfeiture of the lease. The dispute is expected to reach court later this year or early next year.Tim Leaver, the deputy leader of the council, said: “The destruction of the ancient Whitewebbs oak was a reckless act which caused huge damage to the tree and cut its expected lifespan. It shocked and angered our entire community. This centuries-old tree, sometimes known as the Guy Fawkes oak, was an irreplaceable part of Enfield’s natural heritage.”He said the partial felling happened without the council’s knowledge or consent, “in clear breach of the lease governing the site”.He added: “Enfield council has served a formal section 146 notice on Mitchells & Butlers, the company responsible for the Toby Carvery at Whitewebbs Park. They have failed to engage meaningfully with the council or to make reparations. We have therefore started forfeiture proceedings for serious breaches of their lease.View image in fullscreenMitchells & Butlers is being urged to pay ‘life support’ costs for the remains of the tree after its stump showed signs of regrowth.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty“We ask that Mitchells & Butlers issues a public apology and provides financial reparations for the irreversible damage they have caused as well as compensate the council for the significant costs incurred. The people of Enfield deserve accountability.”M&B is also being urged to pay“life support” costs for the remains of the treeafter its stump showed signs of regrowth. Such a scheme, which may be too late to save the tree, would cost an estimated £10,000.Michael O’Shea, the managing director of Wicked Uncle Toys, has offered to pay for the work. But for the scheme to go ahead it would need the cooperation of M&B to install a tank and sprinkler system on the site.After reading about the ambitious scheme, O’Shea said: “We are a family company and we think companies should do the decent thing. If it is saveable we will put up the cash if the experts will handle the project management.”Over the coming weeks, the Forestry Commission is due to publish the result of itsinvestigation into the unauthorised felling.M&B has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsMitchells & ButlersFood & drink industryLondonConservationLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

Critics accused the leading fossil fuel companies of “sabotaging climate action” and “being on the wrong side of history” but said the emissions data was increasingly being used to hold the companies accountable.State-owned fossil fuel producers made up 17 of the top 20 emitters in theCarbon Majorsreport, which the authors said underscored the political barriers to tackling global heating. All 17 are controlled by countries that opposed a proposed fossil fuel phaseout at theCop30UN climate summit in December, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, the United Arab Emirates and India. More than 80 other nations had backed the phaseout plan.Saudi Aramco was responsible for 1.7bn tonnes of CO2, much of it from exported oil. If it were a country, Aramco would be the world’s fifth biggest carbon polluter, just behind Russia. ExxonMobil’s fossil fuel production led to 610m tonnes of CO2– it would be the ninth biggest polluter, ahead of South Korea.Since a blip during the Covid pandemic, continued fossil fuel burning has led to carbon emissions resuming their annual rise to record levels each year. Emissions would have to fall by 45% by 2030 to meet the Paris agreement’s goal of 1.5C, a targetnow seen as impossible. But limiting the overshoot is vital, say experts, as every fraction of a degree of heating worsens the climate impacts on communities.Emmett Connaire, of the thinktank InfluenceMap, who led the report, said: “Each year, global emissions become increasingly concentrated among a shrinking group of high-emitting producers, while overall production continues to grow.”Recent oil sector mergers have included ExxonMobil acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources and Chevron acquiring Hess.Tzeporah Berman, of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said: “This latest analysis reinforces a stark reality: a powerful, concentrated group of fossil fuel corporations are not only dominating global emissions but are actively sabotaging climate action and weakening government ambition.”The initiative aims to deliver international cooperation that halts fossil fuel expansion and starts a just transition away from coal, oil and gas. Berman said an April meeting in Colombia of the 80 countries backing a fossil fuel phaseout was a critical step towards securing a sustainable future.Christiana Figueres, a former UN climate chief, said: “The latest Carbon Majors data shows once again that large emitters are on the wrong side of history. While clean energy and electrification is already receiving nearly twice the investment of fossil fuels globally, carbon majors are clinging on to outdated, polluting products. But data provides a tool for the growing majority who are coming together to champion science-backed solutions and accountability.”The Carbon Majors database underpinned recent analysis thatdirectly linked carbon emissionsfrom the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies to dozens of deadly heatwaves that otherwise would have been virtually impossible. The data also enabled another study toattribute trillions of dollarsin economic losses related to extreme heat to individual fossil fuel companies.The database has also provided evidence in legal cases, such as Lliuya v RWE, a landmarkGerman climate litigation case, andclimate superfund laws in New Yorkand Vermont that require large fossil fuel companies to pay for projects to protect citizens against climate impacts such as flooding and extreme heat.Rebecca Brown, the head of the Center for International Environmental Law, said: “The evidence just keeps mounting. Theinternational court of justiceand courts around the world are increasingly connecting the dots between fossil fuel production and climate destruction, making clear that big polluters must phase out fossil fuels and pay up. And when the facts are plain and the law is clear, accountability must follow.”Saudi Aramco declined to comment and ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsFossil fuelsGreenhouse gas emissionsOilOil and gas companiesGasCoalEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

The interests included his work as a broadcaster for GB News and payments for social media output on Google and X.Farage, who is the highest-earning MP, has previously admitted breaching parliamentary rules by failing to register a trip to Florida to appear at a fundraising event for Donald Trump. TheReform UKleader was the main speaker at the $500-a-head Republican party dinner in Tallahassee in March last year.After the latest investigation, Farage told the standards commissioner: “Why have payments that have gone into my account been delayed? Well, gross, gross administrative error. And I’m a little bit shocked by [it], especially as some payments were put in months after I had [provided them].Iran’s central bank using vast quantities of cryptocurrency championed by Farage, says reportRead more“You may say: why don’t I enter those things myself? Well, I don’t do computers. I can come and fill in a register for you, but I don’t do computers. So I rely on other people to do those things for me. I’m not, I’m afraid, computer literate, which makes me yet more an oddball than perhaps I was before.”He said there had been no intention to deceive anyone and that he had nothing to gain by late declarations. Farage also said that he had never been in any trouble with tax authorities, did not claim expenses, and that he was not making money out of being an MP – but that his income was earned “because I am Nigel Farage”.In his decision, Daniel Greenberg, the standards commissioner, found there had been a high number of breaches and that it was of high value, but he accepted that this had been inadvertent.In his apology, Farage said: “I’m sorry. I apologise. I fully accept that I’m in the wrong in every way, because if your staff mess up, ultimately you’re responsible and that’s what happens with rank in life, whether you’re, you know, running a business or a member of parliament.”A Labour party spokesperson said: “Nigel Farage is so distracted with tempting failed Tory politicians into his party that he can’t even get the basics right. He isn’t on the side of working people – he’s just lining his pockets when he should be standing up for his constituents.“He boasts about making money ‘because I’m Nigel Farage’, raking in millions through various outside jobs. But he neglects to do the important work that hard-pressed taxpayers fork out for him to do.“Labour will tighten the rules on MPs’ second jobs to make sure the public get the attention they expect and deserve from their elected representatives.”Keir Starmer, the prime minister, has also previously been found by the standards commissioner to have declared his financial interests late, leading to eight minor and inadvertent breaches of the code.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the man “comes right up the door, picks up the cat, turns around and walks off”.The alleged abduction appears to have been spontaneous, as, according to Crowther’s account, the man seemed to be going about his job normally outside his family home in Elland, WestYorkshirebefore stealing Nora.“He doesn’t get a response at the door as no one was in, so he looks for somewhere safe to put the parcel,” said Crowther. “He then clocked the cat.”Crowther told YorkshireLive on Tuesday that he and his family were “really worried” for Nora’s safety, as she “always stays very close to home” and is not used to new environments.“This morning, after she’d been missing since yesterday lunch, for some reason I looked at the cameras to see if she’d been about over the late afternoon/evening,” he said.“We were devastated when we saw the driver lingering about waiting to seize his opportunity. It was total shock and disbelief when he picked her up and shoved her into his car.”Crowther has pleaded for the speedy return of Nora, as he says she needs to take medication for a heart murmur.The incident has already been reported to West Yorkshire police, who said that a “crime of theft has been recorded, and inquiries remain ongoing”.Crowther said that he had reported the cat burglary to Amazon but decried the lack of help he had received in helping to locate Nora. “Their response was disgusting, asking what monetary value we’d put on the cat,” he said. “How can you put a value on somebody’s pet?”A spokesperson for Amazon confirmed that the company was investigating the incident and that it had been in touch with police.Explore more on these topicsCatsYorkshireAmazonAnimalsPetsnewsShareReuse this content"

I argued the case that these books were of their time and that it’s dishonest to try to make them read differently.“In most instances, I won my point. The few examples where I didn’t win my point were to do with race.”The Lindsay Gordon mystery novels feature a protagonist who is a lesbian Scottish freelance journalist.McDermid, 70, added: “I think it’s kind of interesting to look at novels that were written in a particular time. A lot has changed in 40 years. But a book set in 1987 can’t suddenly have the sensibilities of a book that’s going to be published now.”Asked if she was offended by being assigned a sensitivity reader, she replied: “I was more amused than offended. Rereading those novels again, there are things that I wouldn’t do now, because the world has changed. The characters would not behave in that way now, but I don’t see much point in going back and rewriting your earlier work to make it conform to the times now.“We need to have those earlier historic texts to understand how far we’ve come and how different it is now.”McDermid’s 1995 novel The Mermaids Singing was retrospectively criticised for the depiction of graphic violence and featuring a transgender serial killer who abducts and tortures gay men.The writer, who is also a national year of reading ambassador, met the Queen on Monday during the launch of a reading initiative at the National Library ofScotlandin Edinburgh.The Fife-born writer began her career in 1977 as a newspaper journalist in Glasgow, working for the Daily Record.Explore more on these topicsVal McDermidScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

After nine series of the baking competition, she will hand over her duties to someone else.“Bake Off has been a fabulous part of my life for the last nine years, I have genuinely loved it and I’m sure I’ll miss working with my fellow judge Paul, Alison and Noel and the teams at Love Productions and Channel 4,” said Leith.“But now feels like the right time to step back (I’m 86 for goodness sake!), there’s so much I’d like to do – not least spend summers enjoying my garden. Whoever joins the team, I’m sure they’ll love it as much as I have. I feel very lucky to have been part of it.”Leith joined Bake Off on its move from BBC to Channel 4, as a replacement for original co-host Mary Berry – who opted not to leave the BBC, alongside presenters Mel and Sue.Leith’s tenure as presenter of the baking competition drew controversy in 2017, when she accidentally revealed the winner of the competition via Twitter (now X) – a mistake that she blamed on the time difference between UK time and Bhutan, where she was when she tweeted.“As soon as it went I thought ‘oh my God’ and I went into a panic mode where I couldn’t work my phone and I didn’t know how to delete it quickly and I couldn’t think,” she told ITV’s This Morning the following year. “In the end I just rang my trusty PA and she said, ‘I’ve already deleted it,’ and it was 89 seconds after I had done it and that was too late, it had been retweeted.”Other programmes she has made for Channel 4 since becoming one of its most high-profile presenters includePrue and Danny’s Death Road Trip, where she debated the legality of euthanasia with her then Tory (now Reform UK) MP son, Danny Kruger.Love Productions said, “Huge thanks to Prue who has been a brilliant judge on Bake Off and a much-loved presence in the tent for nearly a decade. From her genuine expertise and encouragement of the bakers to her ability to drop innocent innuendoes that reduce the entire tent (and the audience at home) to tears of laughter, Prue will always have a piece of Bake Off’s heart.”Channel 4’s Chief Content Officer Ian Katz, said, “Prue Leith has been a joyous presence in the tent, pairing absolute culinary authority with great generosity and empathy for the bakers. We are grateful for her passion, her wit, her ineffable style, and all the summers she spent in the tent. She leaves an indelible mark on the show and all its bakers. We will miss her wry, gentle judgment but look forward to working with her on new projects.”Channel 4 have already confirmed that there will be another series of The Great British Bake Off later this year. They will announce Leith’s replacement at a later date.Explore more on these topicsThe Great British Bake OffPrue LeithTelevisionFood TVnewsShareReuse this content"

Over the succeeding months, Carreyrou exposed how the testing devices Holmes said could perform a variety of medical tests with just a drop of blood were not actually being used to perform most of the analyses.After scrutiny from regulators, Theranos started to retract its tests and recall its machines. Holmes stepped down as CEO in June 2018, with the company dissolving soon after. That same year, the US government charged Holmes and her co-executive Sunny Balwani with defrauding both investors and patients, and making false claims about the effectiveness of the company’s technology.Trump hasgranted clemencyto more than 1,600 people since beginning his second term, most for their involvement in theJanuary 6 attackon the US Capitol.

Thousands of male militants were detained in prisons, while women and children were moved to camps, from where some have been gradually repatriated while others have remained for years.The SDF remained in control, as an effective government in north-eastern Syria during the final years of al-Assad’s regime in Damascus. But when al-Assad was ousted in December 2024 by al-Sharaa’s Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), it led to an uncertain situation with the SDF unwilling to fully integrate into the new Syria.View image in fullscreenHumanitarian organisations said they had not been able to visit al-Hawl since Sunday, and were concerned the situation there could become more unstable.Photograph: Mohammed Al-Rifai/EPANanar Hawach, a Syria expert and analyst with Crisis Group, said there was a danger was “not a reborn caliphate but a dispersed insurgency rebuilding in the cracks”. Prison breaks “may have released experienced operatives into a contested security environment” between Syrian government and SDF forces, he said.On Tuesday, the US signalled it had abandoned its support for the SDF. Tom Barrack, the US special envoy for Syria, said: “The original purpose of the SDF as the primary anti-Isis force on the ground has largely expired” and Washington’s partner in holding down IS was the Damascus government.Though HTS has its origins as an offshoot of al-Qaida, the terror group, it has had a history of opposing IS, and cut its ties with al-Qaida in 2016. Before beginning its offensive on Damascus, al-Sharaa emphasised that HTS had moved on, though there has been sectarian violence targeting Alawite, Druze and Kurdish minorities.Hawach said that the new Syrian government “clearly wants to be seen as a counter-terrorism partner” – but he cautioned that “securing Isis detention facilities, managing camps like al-Hawl, and suppressing sleeper cells across newly acquired territory requires resources, discipline, and institutional capacity that the Syrian government is still building”.View image in fullscreenManaging camps such as al-Hawl ‘requires resources, discipline, and institutional capacity that the Syrian government is still building’, said Nanar Hawach, a senior analyst at Crisis Group.Photograph: Mohammed Al-Rifai/EPAA lightning offensiveby the Syrian government forces, starting over the weekend, led to rapid gains from the SDF. The city of Raqqa was captured on Sunday and the SDF agreed to hand over the provinces of Raqqa and Deir ez-Zorfor a ceasefire. That broke down almost immediately, and government forces made more gains.Al-Sharaa agreed to a fresh ceasefire on Tuesday, a day after he had spoken to Donald Trump. The US president said he had been “trying to protect the Kurds”, though it is unclear if the SDF will agree to al-Sharaa’s demands or risk another round of fighting.The SDF leader,Mazloum Abdi, had been given four days from Tuesday to consult Kurdish leaders over accepting the Syrian government’s demands for close integration with Damascus.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIslamic StateKurdsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It was an initial step toward a criminal prosecution by the Department of Justice that, if successful, could send the Clintons to prison in a dispute over compelling them to testify before the House oversight committee.Representative James Comer, the chairperson, said at the start of the committee’s hearing that Clintons had responded not with “cooperation but defiance”.House oversight chair says panel will move to hold Hillary Clinton in contemptRead more“Subpoenas are not mere suggestions, they carry the force of law and require compliance,” said Comer.The Clintons argue that the subpoenas are invalid. Bill Clinton,Donald Trumpand many others connected to Epstein have not been accused of wrongdoing. Yet lawmakers are wrestling over who receives the most scrutiny.Nonetheless, there were signs of a potential thaw as the Clintons, both Democrats, appeared to be searching for an off-ramp to testify. In addition, passage of contempt charges through the full House was far from guaranteed, requiring a majority vote – somethingRepublicansincreasingly struggle to achieve.The repercussions of contempt charges loomed large, given the possibility of a substantial fine and even incarceration.While the charges have historically been used only as a last resort, lawmakers in recent years have been more willing to reach for the option. Comer initiated the contempt proceedings after the Clintons refused for months to fulfill a committee subpoena for their testimony in its Epstein investigation.The clash was the latest turn in the Epstein saga as Congress investigates how he was able to sexually abuse dozens of teenage girls for years. Epstein killed himself in 2019 in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial. The public release of case files has shown details of the connections between Epstein and bothBill Clintonand Trump, among many other high-powered men.Comer rejected an offer on Tuesday from a lawyer for the Clintons to have Comer and the top Democrat on the committee, Representative Robert Garcia of California, interview Bill Clinton in New York, along with staff.The Clintons released a letter last week criticizing Comer for seeking their testimony at a time when the justicedepartment is running a month behind a congressionally mandated deadline to release its complete case files on Epstein.Behind the scenes, however, the longtime Clinton lawyer David Kendall has tried to negotiate an agreement. Kendall raised the prospect of having the Clintons testify on Christmas and Christmas Eve, according to the committee’s account of the negotiations.The Clintons, who contend the subpoenas are invalid because they do not serve any legislative purpose, also say they did not know about Epstein’s abuse. They have offered the committee written declarations about their interactions with Epstein.“We have tried to give you the little information we have. We’ve done so because Mr Epstein’s crimes were horrific,” the Clintons wrote to Comer last week.Contempt of Congress proceedings are rare, used when lawmakers are trying to force testimony for high-profile investigations, such as the infamous inquiry during the 1940s into alleged communist sympathizers in Hollywood or the impeachment proceedings of President Richard Nixon.Most recently, Trump’s advisers Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon were convicted of contempt charges for defying subpoenas from a House panel investigating the 6 January 2021 riot by a mob of the Republican president’s supporters at the Capitol. Both Navarro and Bannon spent months in prison.The January 6 committee also subpoenaed Trump in its inquiry. Trump’s lawyers resisted the subpoena, citing decades of legal precedent they said shielded ex-presidents from being ordered to appear before Congress. The committee ultimately withdrew its subpoena.No former president has ever been successfully forced to appear before Congress, although some have voluntarily appeared.Democrats have largely been focused on advancing the investigation into Epstein rather than mounting an all-out defense of the Clintons, who led their party for decades. They have said Bill Clinton should inform the committee if he has any pertinent information about Epstein’s abuses.A wealthy financier, Epstein donated to Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign and Hillary Clinton’s joint fundraising committee in advance of her 2000 Senate campaign in New York.“No president or former president is above the law,” Garcia said at the committee hearing.Democrats spent the hearing criticizing Comer for focusing on the Clintons when the justice department is behind schedule on releasing the Epstein files. Comer has also allowed several former attorneys general to provide the committee with written statements attesting to their limited knowledge of the case.Nearly all Epstein files still unreleased a month after Congress deadlineRead moreThe committee had also subpoenaedGhislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s longtime confidante who is serving a lengthy prison sentence for a conviction on sex-trafficking charges.“It’s interesting that it’s this subpoena only that Republicans and the chairman have been obsessed about putting all their energy behind,” Garcia said.Comer said the committee will interview Maxwell next month. The attorney general,Pam Bondi, will also appear before the House judiciary committee in February.Democrats embraced the call for full transparency on Epstein after Trump’s return to the White House, particularly after Bondi stumbled on her promise to release the entirety of the unredacted Epstein files to the public. The backlash scrambled traditional ideological lines, leading Republicans to side with Democrats demanding further investigation.The pressure eventually resulted in a bipartisan subpoena from the committee that ordered the justice department and Epstein estate to release files related to Epstein. Republicans quickly moved to include the Clintons in the subpoena.Comer has indicated that he will insist that the subpoena be fulfilled by nothing less than a transcribed deposition of Bill Clinton.“You have to have a transcript in an investigation,” he said. “So no transcript, no deal.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsHouse of RepresentativesRepublicansBill ClintonHillary ClintonUS CongressJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

However, as a precaution the region’s network was shut down pending inspections, stranding hundreds of thousands of people and causing chaos on the roads.View image in fullscreenEmergency responders work at the site of the accident in Gelida. Spain’s transport minister has said the two accidents were ‘completely unrelated’.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockEarlier in the day, several people were injured, none seriously, when a train on the Maresme coast north of Barcelona struck a rock on the track. After a delay, the train was able to continue its journey.The incidents have prompted Spain’s biggest train drivers union to call for an indefinite strike to demand assurances for the profession’s safety.“We are going to demand criminal liability from those responsible for ensuring safety in the railway infrastructure,” the Semaf union said in a statement on Wednesday. It said it could not accept “the constant deterioration of the rail network” and was calling for “urgent new measures”.While the cause ofSunday night’s collisionat Adamuz, near Córdoba in southern Spain, is not yet clear, the train’s black box recorder revealed that the driver of the high-speed train from Málaga to Madrid had warned the control centre that he was in trouble moments before.Map showing the route of the high-speed rail crashThe driver is heard saying: “I’ve got anenganchón[a snag] near Adamuz.” According to the train operator Adif, the issue referred to was related to the connection between the train’s operating system and the overhead power source. The control centre tells him to disconnect the train from the power source; the driver replies that he has already done so.He tells the controller to stop all oncoming trains and is told there aren’t any, but only moments later the high-speed train collides with a regional train heading in the other direction. The driver is then heard saying the train has been derailed and calling for emergency services.1:17Aftermath of high-speed train crash in southern Spain – videoThe two accidents have focused minds on the rail network – both the nearly 4,000km (2,485 miles) of the super-efficient high-speed AVE network, mostly built with EU funding, and the chronically unreliable and underfunded regional services.The transport minister, Óscar Puente, stressed during an interview with the television station Telecinco that the two accidents were “completely unrelated”. But opposition parties have seized the opportunity to pile pressure on the government.“This is too much,” the head of the rightwing Popular party, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, wrote on X as he demanded an “immediate clarification” of the state of the nation’s railways.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday before the Barcelona-area crash, the far-right Vox party’s spokesperson Pepa Millán claimed Spaniards were now “afraid to get on a train”.However, while the latest accidents raise concerns about safety, according to EU statistics Spain’s rail network is one of Europe’s safest. According to the same report, in 2024 a total of 16 passengers died in accidents on Europe’s rail networks, among them one passenger in Spain. During the same period there were 20,000 deaths on Europe’s roads.Explore more on these topicsSpainTrain crashesRail transportEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That speed, possible with the satellites’ planned optical communications, is extreme by consumer standards and would make the network key for data processing and large-scale government programs. Blue Origin said the network would be meant to serve a maximum of roughly 100,000 customers.The reveal of TeraWave coincides with a space industry rush to build data centers in space that can meet the soaring demand for large-scale AI data processing, which on Earth requires immense energy and resources as adoption of the technology expands.The planned network adds another satellite constellation linked to Bezos, executive chairperson of Amazon, which is in an early phase of deploying Leo – a network formerly called Project Kuiper – involving 3,200 satellites providing internet to consumers and businesses.Musk’s Starlink network of roughly 10,000 satellites is farthest ahead in a global push to put internet infrastructure in space, where swarms of low-orbiting satellites offer more security and higher connection speeds than traditional, unitary satellites farther out in space.TheSpaceXCEO has said he plans to build data centers in space, complementing the Starlink network, while Bezos has predicted such space-based centers will be commonplace in orbit within the next 10 to 20 years.Starlink, which has reported more than 6 million customers across at least 140 countries, targets individual consumers, businesses, governments and, with its Starshield variant, US national security agencies. Amazon Leo, with 180 satellites in space so far, has a similar customer strategy.A handful of Chinese companies are swiftly deploying similar satellite networks to get up to pace with Starlink, which has proved key for remote communications and geopolitical conflicts. China is developing new reusable rockets that can loft thousands of these satellites over the next several years for lower costs, a playbook first written by Musk’s SpaceX and its reusable Falcon 9 rocket.Blue Origin’s reusable New Glenn rocket, which has launched twice but has been slow to achieve a rapid flight rate, will likely be a vital part of TeraWave’s deployment.Unlike Starlink, the planned network appears off-limits to individual consumers, according to Blue Origin’s statement.Blue Origin’s statement said: “TeraWave enterprise-grade user and gateway terminals can be rapidly deployed worldwide and interface with existing high-capacity infrastructure, providing additional route diversity and strengthening overall network resilience,” leaving unclear what types of existing infrastructure the network can work with.Explore more on these topicsJeff BezosSpaceBlue OriginAI (artificial intelligence)SpaceXnewsShareReuse this content"

The Wall Street lender would probably have fewer employees in five years’ time as it rolled out AI, he told an audience at theWorld Economic Forumin the Swiss resort of Davos.“Your competitors are going to use it and countries are going to use it,” he said. “However, it may go too fast for society and if it goes too fast for society that’s where governments and businesses [need to] in a collaborative way step in together and come up with a way to retrain people and move it over time.”Dimon said local governments may need to use assistance programmes that supported wages and offered retraining, relocation and early retirement.The 2 million commercial lorry drivers in the US were an example of an area that may need support as driverless trucks hit the road, he said.“Should you do it all at once, if 2 million people go from driving a truck and making $150,000 a year to a next job [that] might be $25,000? No. You will have civil unrest. So phase it in,” Dimon said.“If we have to do that to save society … Society will have more production, we are going to cure a lot of cancers, you’re not going to slow it down. How do you have plans in place if it does something terrible?”Dimon, who was speaking beforeDonald Trump’s address, offered a restrained critique of the US president’s increasingly combative approach to Europe and Nato and demands to take over Greenland.“If the goal is to make them stronger rather than fragment Europe, I think that’s OK,” Dimon said. “I would be using our moral persuasion, our economic persuasion, our intelligence and military to push Europe to do the things that’s right for Europe. The leadership of Europe has to do it, it really can’t be done by America.”Dimon revealed his concerns about Trump’s immigration clampdown, calling for “internal anger” over the issue to be calmed down.“I don’t like what I’m seeing with five grown men beating up little women,” Dimon said, referring to scenes of violence involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers. Rounding up criminals was one thing, Dimon added, but he would like to see data showing who had been rounded up and whether they had broken the law.Dimon said many migrants played important roles in the US economy, such as in healthcare, hospitality and agriculture. “We all know them. They are good people and they should be treated that way,” he said.View image in fullscreenJensen Huang sits between the Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and the European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, in Davos.Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/ReutersJensen Huang, the chief executive of the semiconductor makerNvidia, whose chips are used to power many AI systems, argued that labour shortages rather than mass payoffs were the threat.Playing down fears of AI-driven job losses, Huang told the meeting in Davos that “energy’s creating jobs, the chips industry is creating jobs, the infrastructure layer is creating jobs … jobs, jobs, jobs”.He added: “This is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history, this is going to create a lot of jobs.”Many of those jobs related to tradecraft, Huang said, such as plumbers, electricians, construction, steelworkers, network technicians, and people who install equipment for AI rollout. This was already pushing up salaries in this area in the US, he added, for people involved in building chip factories or AI datacentres.Huang also argued that AI robotics was a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity for Europe, as the region had an “incredibly strong” industrial manufacturing base.“This is your opportunity to now leap past the era of software,” he argued, an area where Silicon Valley has long outperformed Europe.Explore more on these topicsDavos 2026Jamie DimonJP MorganAI (artificial intelligence)NvidianewsShareReuse this content"

Last year a Los Angeles judge ruled that the platforms’ design features may be responsible for harm – and not just the third-party content posted on sites and apps.Historically, tech firms have turned to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law underpinning US internet regulation that exempts platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users, as part of their legal defence. The first bellwether case is still due to begin on 27 January with jury selection.Snap remains a defendant in the other two cases.Beasley Allen, a law firm involved in the lawsuits on the plaintiff side, has said the cases could have profound consequences including billions of dollars in damages, forcing changes in platform design and new US regulations governing how tech firms interact with minors.“The litigation is being compared to past landmark cases against big tobacco and opioid manufacturers – industries that were held accountable for public health harms after years of denial,” the firm said in astatement last year.Snap, Meta,TikTokand YouTube have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaSnapchatTikTokMetaInstagramDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

The British fashion and homeware retailer now controls a swathe of labels, ranging from FatFace,JoulesandMade.comto the UK distribution ofGapand Victoria’s Secret.Next expects profits to top £1.1bn after bumper festive salesRead moreNext said in a statement: “This acquisition secures the future of a much-loved British footwear brand. Next intends to build on this legacy and provide the operational stability and expertise to support Russell & Bromley’s next chapter, allowing it to return to its core mission, the design and curation of world-class, premium footwear and accessories, for many years to come.”Andrew Bromley, the chief executive of Russell & Bromley, which until now has been a family-owned business, said: “Following a strategic review with external advisers, we have taken the difficult decision to sell the Russell & Bromley brand. This is the best route to secure the future for the brand and we would like to thank our staff, suppliers, partners and customers for their support.”Will Wright, the UK chief executive of Interpath, which is acting as administrator to Russell & Bromley, said the 33 stores and nine concessions not included in the deal would remain open and continue to trade while the joint administrators continue to assess options for them.He said: “Across its 147-year history, Russell & Bromley has been at the forefront of contemporary style. We’re pleased therefore to have concluded this transaction, which will preserve the brand and the commitment to quality craftsmanship that it has become so well known for.“Our intention is to continue to trade the remaining portfolio of stores for as long as we can while we explore the options available.”The deal comes after a tough few years for clothing, footwear and homeware retailers as shoppers have reined in spending on non-essentials while they cope with a surge in the cost of energy bills, rent and groceries.The UK arm of accessories and ear-piercing chain Claire’s and The Original Factory Shop homeware chain are bothon the brink of administration.On Wednesday, JD Sports, the clothing and trainers group which also owns outdoor wear retailers Black and Millets, said its sales were down 5.3% at established UK stores in the nine weeks to 3 January. Underlying sales for the group, which also operates in the US, mainland Europe and Asia, fell 1.8% in what it called “a volatile consumer backdrop” in which demand had softened in the first half of December.The business, which is battling lower demand for sports footwear as its top-selling brand, Nike, struggles to produce new ideas, said it expected “a period of muted market growth” in the year ahead.Explore more on these topicsNextMergers and acquisitionsRetail industryJob lossesMen's shoesWomen's shoesFashion industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The legendary bass-baritone spent the first half of the 20th century as one of the greatest talents the US had ever produced, and its second, both in life and in death as an outcast, the greatest casualty of the second Red Scare period to which today’s current attacks on liberal and progressive politics draw comparison.This week marks 50 years since Robeson’s death and the silence remains. His erasure from the lineage over the decades shows that what Robeson’s political opponents did not take from him, the years have most certainly. Robeson’s decoupling from the story of African American culture has been so complete that in the half-century since his death, even generations of Black Americans have never heard of him.His talent was prodigious. Robeson integrated Broadway in 1943, the first Black man to play Othello in the United States. Previous productions of Shakespeare’s jealous Moor casted white actors in blackface, and Robeson’s Othello run of 296 performances remains a Broadway record for a Shakespeare production. A two-time All-American at Rutgers, he was one of the greatest college football players in history. He graduated from Columbia Law, and, before becoming world renowned as a concert singer, stage and Hollywood actor, Robeson even played defensive end for two years in the National Football League. The Robeson legacy spawned a staggering list of Black stage performers, from Lena Horne to Harry Belafonte, James Earl Jones, Andre Braugher, Keith David and Denzel Washington. At his peak, Paul Robeson was the most famous Black American in the world.View image in fullscreenPaul Robeson addressing the World Conference of Partisans of Peace in Paris in 1949.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockAnd yet for his refusal to denounce the Soviet Union as cold war tensions increased, Robeson was isolated by both the white mainstream and by the respectable pillars of the Black establishment – the NAACP, the Urban League and many leading Black political and cultural voices who feared being branded communist by the rising conservative tide. Out of what he called a sense of responsibility to prove that Black Americans were loyal Americans, Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers star who two years earlier integrated the all-white major leagues, was hailed as a national hero in 1949 for testifying against him to the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Following Robinson’s testimony, two bloody riots protesting against Robeson’s appearance at concerts in Peekskill, New York, and the combined pressure of national opinion and the federal government effectively ended Robeson’s iconic standing. Robeson’s name was removed from record books and historical texts, even those from Rutgers, the alma mater he had made famous. Referring to him as “the most dangerous man in America”, the state department refused to issue Robeson a passport for nearly a decade until the supreme court ruled refusing a citizen the right to travel because of one’s political beliefs to be unconstitutional.Robinson’s testimony and its effect on Robeson conjures parallels to today’s violent politics, where the citizenship of many Americans is being questioned and threatened. Disillusioned Black Americans debate whether the re-election of Donald Trump, his subsequent assault on diversity initiatives – which last spring included the removal of a tribute to Jackie Robinson’s military service as part of its elimination of DEI content (until outraged public backlash forced a reversal of the decision) – and the racist rhetoric from Trump and members of his administration is evidence enough to disengage, especially as another byproduct of today’s reality is an intensified period of hostility toward teaching Black history and literature in public schools. Just as many progressives and liberals at the time implored Robinson not to testify against Robeson, this current moment of darkening politics, so goes the argument, is not our fight.Robinson would never escape his part of Robeson’s downfall – and would experience his own sense of betrayal. Years later, during the height of the Vietnam war, the 4 July 1969 edition of The Times published a front-page story of Americans living in a different time of division and returned to Robinson, a solidified American hero, for his thoughts. By that time, Jackie Robinson had been embittered – by the lack of continued racial progress in baseball, by the hardening Republican party whose hostility toward civil rights had jarred and ultimately ended his loyalty to it, the “love it or leave it” inflexibility that had once in part informed his younger self to testify against Robeson two decades earlier. The headline read, Flag on July 4: Thrill to Some, Threat to others. The reporter, Jon Nordheimer, chose Robinson, the army veteran, to bat leadoff. “I wouldn’t fly the flag on Fourth of July or any other day,” said Jackie Robinson, the former baseball star. “When I see a car with a flag pasted on it, I figure the guy behind the wheel isn’t my friend.”View image in fullscreenPaul Robeson in 1958.Photograph: Keystone Features/Getty ImagesThose who stood by Robeson saw no need for rediscovery because their belief in him had never waned. The Tallest Tree in the Forest. The Great Forerunner. Citizen of the World. He had provided the shade for those with his commitment and values, and in return, he received their protection, gratitude and veneration. Along with many others in remembrance of Robeson, one letter to the editor, in particular, appeared as an indictment of society and the individuals who only now, too late, understood the true scope of Robeson, and, as Jackie Robinson would describe it when recalling his own part in Robeson’s downfall, “America’s destructiveness”.As one letter to the editor would say following Robeson’s death: “He wasn’t mentioned in history books, like Nathan Hale. He wasn’t mentioned on football game broadcasts, like Red Grange. He wasn’t mentioned in dramatic reviews, like Barrymore. He wasn’t mentioned by opera critics, like Caruso. The man who was never mentioned despite the fact that he truly excelled not in one of the above fields, but in all of them. Now that the fires that raged in him cool and he is put lifeless into the ground, we mention and accept the fact that he lived. Now, safely silenced, he is suddenly mentioned as a ‘great American’ and newspapers write editorials about him and soon halls of fame and history books will doubtless find a place for him and we can pat ourselves on our bicentennial backs for living in a country where even the dissident can be a hero, once he is dead.”The isolation of Robeson recalls the near-disappearance of another Black icon. While considered an enemy to the white establishment for virtually his entire public life and the first quarter century of his death, a new generation of Black artists, led by Spike Lee, reclaimed Malcolm X for Black people, where he remains protected and reverential, present and timeless. A half-century in death, Paul Robeson, The Tallest Tree in the Forest, still awaits his reappraisal.Adapted from the bookKings And Pawnsby Howard Bryant. Copyright © 2026 by Howard Bryant.

He remembers one particular evening walk that he took with his father, Phil, as they weathered out those early months.As they strode through the neighborhood, Nadel, now 26, said that the prospect of a vaccine was exciting, but the idea of pharmaceutical executives profiting off a devastating virus left him feeling uneasy. Phil grew concerned by the complex ethical predicament that his son laid out, and Nadel could quickly tell that his father was acting strangely.“I think I have to tell you something,” Phil said mid-walk, before explaining that in the early days of the HIV/Aids epidemic he had invested in what are known as, “viatical settlements”. Phil would buy the life insurance policies of people dying of Aids, often with just weeks or months to live, for a portion of the plan’s value in cash. For many, it afforded them the ability to pay for food, rent and hospital bills as debilitating illness left them unable to work. For others, it was their chance to blow the funds on travel or experiences with the limited time they had left.AI, Salman Rushdie and Elon Musk: the most anticipated documentaries of 2026Read more“I was thrown for a total loop,” Nadel told the Guardian. “He had been part of this industry, and that the profits he made from it had helped to bankroll my childhood.”For Nadel, a gay film-maker, it sent him into a “spiral” that did not begin with the desire to make a movie. “I understand myself as somebody who stands on the shoulders of Aids activists who use their bodies to create a world in which I can be healthy and take my PrEP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] every morning, and also in which I can be relatively free as a gay man,” he said. “So many of the advances in gay rights came from the visibility of the Aids era, and here I was learning that my existence and privilege was hinged in some way on those same people dying.”As he began investigating the muddied history of viatical settlements throughout the peak of the Aids crisis, the outlines of a film started to emerge. The result is Nadel’s Oscar-shortlisted documentary short, Cashing Out, which tells the story of how a cottage industry of buying up life insurance policies was both ghoulish and liberating in equal measure.One of the film’s main characters, Scott Page, inadvertently configured an early viatical settlement when his partner, Greg, who was living with Aids, became progressively sick.Short on cash, but armed with a robust life insurance policy, Page ran an advertisement in a local paper to see if someone could buy Greg’s plan in exchange for an advance. When a private investor reached out, the couple struck up a “loose agreement” that allowed Greg to live out the time he had left with some financial security. The payout meant they could also move into a house and get a golden retriever.As dozens of old pictures flash across the screen, you see an idyllic slideshow of two people with a rich life: fixing up their home, lying by the beach and laughing with friends. But it’s also a bittersweet record of Greg’s final months. Page ultimately remembers how the money in-hand was “absolutely transformative” for his late boyfriend, as he “saw the stress leave his body”.The absurdity of getting a cash advance on your death, however, wasn’t lost on Page. When he saw the peace and freedom it gave Greg before he died, he turned his energy into becoming a viatical broker for scores of other gay men – often without loved ones by their bedside – who were dying of an illness that much of the federal government had shrouded in shame and prejudice. When Page started to approach banks and credit unions about getting involved in the investment scheme, they were incredulous and insisted that payouts should be for the families of the deceased. For Page, their arguments weren’t rooted in reality. “These people’s families have walked away from them,” he recalls in the documentary.It meant that private individuals made up most of the initial investor network when it came to buying up policies. They were provided a morbid ledger. On one side, the value of a policy and the dollar amount needed to buy it outright, on the other, the T-cell count of a person living with HIV/Aids and their life expectancy. Often, it served as an assurance that a payout was inevitable. The sicker the policyholder, the quicker the windfall for the investor. Soon, institutions realized that these small-time individual investors were making a lot of money, and changed their tune.Nadel constructs his documentary like a deeply reported magazine story: gripping anecdotes, a rich – albeit macabre – historical backdrop, and varied voices who show that while some people benefited from viatical settlements, there were so many who were left out of the conversation altogether.DeeDee Chamblee, a trailblazing advocate and activist reminds us that for Black trans women living with Aids – who often didn’t have jobs that provided life insurance policies – a viatical settlement was something they could only dream about.View image in fullscreenA still from Cashing Out.Photograph: New YorkerOne of the most harrowing moments of the documentary comes when Chamblee remembers suffering through her illness, with only three T-cells left, and how she would fantasize about getting a payout to live out her final days in peace. “I could go to the beach, and I could stay there until this thing is through,” she reminisces. “That was not a reality at all,” she adds, expecting to end up buried in a wooden box in a “potter’s field” with other unclaimed bodies.Chamblee’s testimony is a jolting reminder that her experience living with Aids is a world away from the white, gay men who had policies to sell. In making Cashing Out, Nadel realized the most marginalized, particularly trans sex workers of color, aren’t “afforded a shred of basic dignity when their death is imminent”.But by the late 1990s, significant developments in antiretroviral therapy meant that HIV-positive people started living longer, defying the odds and outliving the predictions that viatical investors were initially promised. “It was going great, until people didn’t die all the time,” Page says, with a glint of karmic joy in his eyes.Eventually, those betting on death stopped cashing in so easily. Instead, they found themselves stuck paying premiums on policies that would never pay out. “I think they banked on that not being an urgent enough question for our world to answer,” Nadel said. “Then they were angered when the activists from Act Up successfully pushed the government to develop and release drugs quickly … anybody who invested their whole retirement in viaticals was making a really bad investment decision, and that is no one’s fault but their own.”Nadel filmed interviews with his subjects – Page, Chamblee and Sean Strub, a long‑term survivor who founded POZ magazine – over the course of a year. Their unfiltered honesty ultimately prompted him to fold in the story of his own father’s investment in viatical settlements. “I just felt like they were submitting themselves so fully to the process,” he said. “And so for me to have a secret about my relationship with this, that I was keeping from the audience, just felt wrong.”In a recent interview, Nadel said that while his thesis for the film had shifted over time, it now seemed straightforward. “This helped a lot of people, but I’m disgusted that it had to exist,” he said. Modern‑day precarity in accessing healthcare in the US – from the expiration of Covid‑era Obamacare subsidies to the substantial cuts to Medicaid funding projected over the next decade – means Cashing Out can serve as both a historically specific and evergreen indictment of the country’s tenuous social safety net, Nadel said.“When the government refuses to fulfil its role in taking care of us, we have to come together and find creative ways to take care of each other,” he said. “Illness does not discriminate … so I want to encourage people who watch the film to find their strange bedfellows in the fight for survival.”Cashing Out is available to watch onYouTubeExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsAids and HIVLGBTQ+ rightsTransgenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has 90 minutes to clear his name before robo-justice sends him downPeter BradshawWed 21 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 12.02 ESTShareIrish writer Marco van Belle delivers an entertaining script for this real time futurist thriller-satire set in LA in 2029, in a world (as they say) where AI is wholly responsible for assessing criminal guilt or innocence. You’ve heard of RoboCop. This is RoboJustice. Veteran Russian-Kazakh film-maker Timur Bekmambetov directs, bringing his usual robust approach to the big action sequences, and Chris Pratt stars as the LAPD cop accused of murder. (Longtime Pratt fans will appreciate a cameo appearance here of Pratt’s fellow cast-member from TV’sParks and Recreation, Jay Jackson, effectively reprising his performance as sonorous TV newsreader Perd Hapley.)The film’s ostensible target is the insidious power of AI, though the movie partakes of today’s liberal opinion doublethink, in which we all solemnly concur that AI is very worrying while not having the smallest intention of doing anything about it. Pratt plays Detective Chris Raven, an officer with a drinking problem but nonetheless a poster boy for LA law enforcement in 2029 for having brought in the first conviction under the city’s creepy new hi-tech justice system, ironically entitled Mercy (it doesn’t appear to be an acronym). AI is now the sole arbiter of justice and defendants each have a 90-minute trial to make their case in front of Judge Maddox, an AI-hologram played byRebecca Fergusonwho icily insists on the facts but is capable of weird Max-Headroom-type glitches.One day, Raven wakes up hungover in the courtroom’s restraint chair in front of Maddox to be told he is accused of murdering his wife – an event of which he has no memory. He now must clear his name using the city’s vast cloud-bank archive of bodycam and surveillance footage, phone records and with calls to colleagues and family members. Desperate and grieving, Raven now has to pull off the police work of his career.It’s ingenious and watchable stuff, with cheeky twists, although the final escalation to full-on action mayhem is maybe a step too far towards pure absurdity. The film is also a bit lenient on AI: “Human or AI – we all make mistakes.” Uh … yeah. But I wouldn’t be surprised if Raven and Judge Maddox revive their human-digital chemistry for a sequel.Mercy is out on 22 January in Australia and on 23 January in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersChris PrattRebecca FergusonAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingParks and RecreationreviewsShareReuse this content"

The horror film Silent Hill, based on a video game of the same name, has garnered a cult following in the decades since its 2006 release, but it’s not exactly a genre classic nor beloved franchise, with a single little-seen 2012 sequel to its name – until now. Return to Silent Hill brings back the first film’s director, Christopher Gans, for a new story set in the same ash-strewn ghost town, this one based on the Silent Hill 2 video game. Characters in these movies tend to wander into a place that is obviously haunted or cursed, refusing to leave even after it becomes clear that they should, and only decide to escape after it’s too late. Maybe Gans can relate.Mercy review – Chris Pratt takes on AI judge Rebecca Ferguson in ingenious sci-fi thrillerRead moreOr maybe he’s the only man for the job because no one else will take it. That could almost describe James (Jeremy Irvine), the hapless protagonist of Return to Silent Hill. After a chance traffic-accident meeting with Mary (Hannah Emily Anderson) that unconvincingly thwarts her attempt to leave home, the two fall in love, and after a time James even moves to Mary’s oddball town; as a painter, he can go anywhere (though if there’s a reason that Mary couldn’t leave, given that she was already ready to hop a bus when they meet, I missed it). Despite the movie skipping over what makes them so instantly compatible, James is all in; someone has to be.Apart from their meeting, most of James and Mary’s relationship is depicted in flashback throughout the movie, which initially lends it some doomy romantic intrigue lacking from the first film. We know, based on early scenes set well after their first meeting, that at some point Mary and James will be separated, sending him into a state of desperate anguish. In the midst of this wallowing, he gets a mysterious letter drawing him back to the town of Silent Hill, implying that Mary is there somewhere. When he arrives at the entry road and finds a tunnel blocked off, James is undaunted, and sets off on a footpath. When he makes it to town and finds it barely populated and covered in ash, he cannot be dissuaded from poking around. When a filthy, sore-covered man takes a break from vomiting into a rusty toilet to tell James that the city is “one big cemetery”, our hero all but shrugs, and bravely presses forward.It turns out, making a horror movie where the hero is more casually curious (or oblivious) than scared is a tricky proposition. James’s stubborn forward stumble is supposed to indicate his obsessive dedication to Mary – though you’d think that someone so fixated on his ex would realize when he’s meeting a mysterious woman (Anderson again) who looks just like her, only with, uh, blond hair. (Mary also has blond hair.) Still, for a little while the parallel tracks of past, where James has a growing unease with Mary’s bizarre “family”, and a present, where he’s haunted by figurative and literal demons, give Return to Silent Hill a stronger sense of purpose and mystery than it really deserves. As it goes on, however, the movie increasingly consists of James wandering around a visually distinct landscape and encountering different weird sights.In other words, 20 years later Gans still can’t figure out how to escape the open-ended confinement of gameplay, or even give it the forward momentum of a game with a mission. There’s certainly some “cinematic” imagery here, like a horde of gross creatures that look like a cross between shaved rats and xenomorphs from Alien, or even less fantastical stuff, like how James’s therapist (Nicola Alexis) is seen almost exclusively in fractured-mirror fragments for the first half of the movie. But the flashback material does a terrible job establishing any kind of real-world baseline, which makes the whole enterprise feel like a ghostly hallucination, lessening the impact of the scary stuff.Maybe it’s precisely that dream-world ambiguity that has drawn Gans back to Silent Hill. If that’s the case, James really does feel like an avatar for his director: convinced there’s something of substance here, ignoring all the warning signs to the contrary. Nothing left to do but check back in another 20 years.Return to Silent Hill is in cinemas on 23 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsGamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan, the nation was convulsed with dismay when mercurial star player Roy Keane stormed out of Ireland’s chaotic training camp on the Pacific island of Saipan and got on the first plane home after a colossal row with managerMick McCarthy. Could it really be true that Ireland’s key performer was going to let the side down? Was he just a spoilt Man U brat? Or was Keane a true Irish patriot, insisting on high standards of training and management for Irish football which this (English-born) manager wasn’t providing?It’s a story which is capably, straightforwardly told by film-makers Glenn Leyburn and Lisa Barros D’Sa, and well acted by its leads Éanna Hardwicke as Keane andSteve Cooganas McCarthy. It is almost like a theatrical chamber piece, putting us on the spot with the two male egos as they butt heads – but perhaps giving less sense of the angst they were creating back home.McCarthy – English born but with Irish roots, an Irish passport and a proud sense of Irish heritage – knew that his trickiest player would be the legendarily difficult Keane, and so it proved. Hardwicke conveys Keane’s tense, opaque quality: his mutely provocative air of entitlement, his clear belief in himself as a star in a different league from his fellow players, and his inability to resist briefing the press. An interesting part of the drama is the English/Irish divide: Keane cannot quite conceal his contempt for McCarthy’s credentials and for his hero-worship of formerIrelandmanager Jack Charlton, an Englishman. But it is notable that he will listen to the terse advice of Alex Ferguson – a Scot.Everyone thought that Keane had a point about the appalling facilities. But did Keane simply think they were going to lose and wanted to distance himself from the inevitable calamity? If so, thenwhat happened after he leftmade Keane look absurd. As for Coogan’s McCarthy, he can’t quite bring himself to make nice with Keane, but maybe niceness on that level can’t be made. An amusing vignette.Saipan is out now in Ireland and Northern Ireland, and on 23 January in rest of the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsIrelandWorld Cup 2002Roy KeaneMick McCarthySteve CooganreviewsShareReuse this content"

And to know where the nice biscuits are. This is very good advice for any twentysomething starting their first job, but especially one called Myrtle, as this one is, whom I imagine has already had much of the stuffing knocked out of her by her peers’ reactions to this odd parental choice of moniker.Soon, however, they are all in need of substantially more comfort than even a chocolate Hobnob can provide, as a team of armed villains swarms the floor. From there, the glossy new six-part thriller Steal kicks into high gear and doesn’t let up for a moment. The baddies – sporting not masks but sophisticated, subtle prosthetics that can fool all the facial recognition software the police will soon be applying to the CCTV footage – herd Zara (Sophie Turner, continuing to deliver sterling work post-Game of Thrones), Myrtle (Eloise Thomas), Zara’s friend and colleague Luke (Archie Madekwe) and the rest of the rank into one conference room while the management committee is locked in another. A couple of gruesome beatings later, so that nobody is in any doubt about the dedication of the villainous gang, Luke and Zara are yanked out and forced to help them execute a set of trades worth £4bn, and the committee is forced to sign off on them all. At one point, Luke crumbles and Zara must step in to save the day. She is hailed as a hero once the thieves have completed their hi-tech heist and left the building.View image in fullscreenHailed as a hero … Sophie Turner with Archie Madekwe in Steal.Photograph: Ludovic Robert/Prime VideoAll is, of course, not as it seems. The first twist comes in the closing moments of the brilliantly suspenseful opening hour (which keeps things fresh by making its bad guys nimble, intelligent and very quietly vicious, and lards the financial jiggery-pokery with just enough violence to keep things gripping but not repulsive). Spoiler alert, unless you have seen a heist drama before or read any of the publicity surrounding the show, Zara’s in on it.‘It’s very embarrassing’: Sophie Turner on rage, romance and the horror of watching Game of ThronesRead moreOr is she? As the police investigation begins, led by DCI Rhys Kovac (Jacob Fortune-Lloyd) who is an astute detective but a man with secrets of his own, the story expands, switchbacks and takes us on a wild ride through layers of deceit, shifting alliances and varying degrees of necessary preposterousness before depositing us, breathless and hugely entertained, safely at the conclusion. It is the debut screenplay of the writer Sotiris Nikias, but he honed his craft writing crime novels under the pen name Ray Celestin, and we all reap the benefits here.While Luke is soon hopelessly broken by events, Zara is made of sterner stuff. Her survival instincts, rooted in her upbringing at the hands of her alcoholic and volatile mother Haley (there are such emotionally brutal scenes between Turner and Anastasia Hille as Haley that I would gladly watch a purely domestic drama just about them) soon have her taking the fight to those seeking to destroy her. Turner does a fine job of keeping Zara credible – a cornered terrier rather than a superhero – and you long for her to triumph.View image in fullscreenWild ride … DCI Rhys Kovac (Jacob Fortune-Lloyd).Photograph: Colin Hutton/PrimeAmid all the action, however, Steal finds room for thought. While never taking its foot off the narrative gas, the series becomes a meditation on the notion that the love of money is the root of all evil. The world of finance is depicted as one dependent, in essence, on gambling – and gambling by a tiny number of people who use only other people’s cash and who are disproportionately rewarded for doing so. The management committee each earn £1m a year, plus guaranteed bonuses, while the likes of Zara and Luke are paid a fraction of that, even if you factor in the biscuits. Resentment, says Steal, cannot help but build in the company and, if you multiply the experience enough times and continue concentrating wealth generated by many into the hands of fewer and fewer individuals, in society and around the world. What happens then? I have every faith that Zara can take care of herself and her cryptowallet, but the rest of us – increasingly at the mercy of arcane financial systems and players who have nothing but the extraction of wealth in mind – may want to start to organise.Steal is on Prime Video nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

There he stares at himself in the mirror, observing not so much a face as “the expression of a predicament … a dull harassed stare, a coarsened nose, a mouth dragged down by the corners into a grimace as if at the sourness of its own toxins, cheeks sagging from their anchors of muscle”.Set in 1962, Christopher Isherwood’s landmark novel follows a day in the life of a 58-year-old British expat and college professor living in California. George is silently trying to come to terms with the death of his partner, Jim, after a car accident. We accompany him from his morning ablutions – during which he reflects on the judgment of his homophobic neighbour Mrs Strunk – and his drive to work, to a teaching session, a gym workout and a drink with his friend Charley. Throughout we are privy to his internal monologue, which reveals George as a man prone to existential dread and who is isolated in a world that, owing to his sexuality, regards him with suspicion.This is a new recording with actor Alex Jennings (The Crown, A Very English Scandal) as narrator. In his clipped RP tones, he delivers a performance that hums with melancholy and buried rage. As we bear witness to George’s every waking thought, action and memory, we understand the dissociative properties of grief and the masks people wear that allow them to get through the day.Available via Naxos Audiobooks, 4hr 38minFurther listeningWinterAli Smith, Penguin Audio, 7hr 16minBridgerton’s Adjoa Andoh reads the second in Ali Smith’s seasonal quartet.

The queen has appeared in the Beano alongside its celebrated bad boy Dennis the Menace and his dog, Gnasher, as part of a campaign to promote reading.It wasn’t the cartoon Camilla’s waspish waist that captured the headlines (“I wish,”she saidof her comic strip avatar), but what she had to say while encouraging the tween menace to “go all in” for reading: “Comics and audiobooks count too!”Audiobooks have boomed in popularity in recent years – the revenue they generated for UK publishersrose by almost a thirdin 2023-24 – becoming an increasingly central part of the industry. But do they truly count as “proper” reading? Is listening to a book while doing the dishes, walking the dog or drifting off to sleep really as valuable as sitting down to read it?For authors, the publishing trade and those encouraging reading and literacy, the answer is increasingly yes. “Reading is about the content and not the medium,” says Debbie Hicks, the creative director of the Reading Agency, a charity that promotes the personal and social benefits of reading and leads nationwide reading programmes in schools, prisons and communities.Audio may have been traditionally viewed as a lesser medium, acknowledges Hicks, “but we need to reframe what it means to be a reader and throw off these traditional value hierarchies linked to print and books. Reading is about the content and not the medium.”The benefits of audiobooks to those who are visually impaired, dyslexic or time poor are obvious. They can also act as a gateway for those who might be less inclined to read – while significantlymore women than menare readers, more men (33%) than women (24%) listen to audiobooks weekly.The charity’s research shows that the benefits of audio go further: when it comes to developing comprehension skills or acquiring vocabulary, the evidence shows audio is as effective as print, says Hicks.Jon Watt, the chair of the Audio Publishers Group at the Publishers Association, welcomed the queen’s comments, pointing toresearch by the National Literacy Trustin 2024 that found 37.5% of children and young people felt listening to audiobooks had encouraged them to do more traditional reading. More than half (52%) said listening to audio helped when they felt stressed.“Listening is a gateway to reading,” says Watt. “It inspires a love of storytelling which is absolutely critical in getting children to want to read or listen or engage with a story. At a young age, really what we want is them engaging with stories – whether they’re listening or reading, it helps literacy.”In his day job, Watt is the audio and business development director at the publisher Bonnier Books, and he says that for the industry as a whole, audio is “absolutely critical right now”.“Audiobooks are now a major part of the industry and they’re absolutely not an afterthought for anyone in publishing now. At the moment they know they are buying a book, people will be thinking about the audiobook along with print and e-acquisitions. You’re thinking about it in all its formats and that’s been a huge change over the last five years.”The evidence for audio’s increasing centrality is everywhere, he says, from the growing number of books that sell more audio than print and digital copies – once a rarity – to the fact that celebrity memoirs are now routinely narrated by their authors. (“Ten years ago, you would have struggled to get any celebrity near a microphone.”)Spotify introduced audiobooks in 2022 and other new platforms such as Spiracle have entered the market, while the starry casts of audiobooks on Amazon’s service Audible tell their own story: a new production ofPride and Prejudicestars Marisa Abela, Harris Dickinson, Glenn Close, Bill Nighy and Jessie Buckley.For some authors, it may mean abandoning print altogether. The Guardian’s film criticPeter Bradshawhas published three novels in the traditional way; for his latest work about a troubled NHS nurse, entitledMercy, he pitched first to the actor Joanna Scanlan as narrator, and then directly to Audible, which released it earlier this month on audio only.Publishing on audio alone has been “an amazingly liberating and exciting experience”, he says. “If you’d have asked me five years ago, I’d have said the [physical] reading experience is the authentic experience.” But when a good friend recently told him he was reading George Eliot’s Daniel Deronda, “what that meant was he was listening to the audiobook narration”.“As far as he was concerned, he was paying just as much attention to it and getting just as much out of it as he would if he was reading a book. And who knows, this might be the way forward?”Explore more on these topicsAudiobooksQueen CamillafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In May 2022, a few weeks after the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, musician Bulat Khalilov was attending a demonstration in Nalchik, a southern Russian city in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. As he joined a group congregating around the monument to the Circassian victims of Russo-Circassian war, Khalilov was approached by a policeman and sensed trouble. To his surprise, the officer asked: “Are you from Ored Recordings? I follow you on Instagram. You’re doing great.”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Their gathering still had to be dispersed, but the enthusiasm that Ored Recordings inspires even among enforcers of the law speaks volumes about the power of what Khalilov and his friend and label co-founder Timur Kodzoko call “punk ethnography”: the recording of religious chants, laments and displacement songs at family gatherings, local festivals, in people’s kitchens, to fight against the erasure of Circassian culture.When it was its own country, Circassia used to extend from the Black Sea shoreline in the west to the foothills and high ridges of the Greater Caucasus Mountains in the east, and from the Kuban River basin in the north to the mountain valleys bordering present-day Georgia in the south. After Russia invaded Circassia in the middle of the 18th century and then proceeded to systematically kill or displace about 95% of its people, the region today exists as a fragmented territory divided among several regions of the Russian Federation, with diaspora communities scattered across Turkey, the Middle East andEurope.View image in fullscreenCircassian musicians Yashar Khatkho, Memet Achezh and Nikhat Pasht in 2017.Photograph: Timur KodzokoWhereas Russian culture is rooted in Orthodox Christianity, the predominant faith of Circassians now is Sunni Islam. They have their own dance traditions, wedding customs and ethical codes, which influence their music. “Circassian culture was often exoticised within Russia, and we carried a kind of internalised self-doubt, shaped by Soviet and post-Soviet attitudes that framed local culture as backward,” says Khalilov, who was born in Nalchik in 1987 and is of Circassian ancestry. Inspired by field recordists such as Chris Watson and BJ Nilsen, Khalilov and Kodzoko set out to document North Caucasian music. They started the label in 2013 and released their first record a year later – documenting a music festival dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the virtuoso folk musician Aslanbech Chich.These songs are not just abstract sadness; they are tied to genocide, displacement, language loss and everyday colonial conditionsCircassian and wider North Caucasian music is shaped primarily by voice, memory and social function rather than performance or spectacle. It centres on solo or small-group singing, including laments, mourning songs, historical narratives, ritual chants, and songs about work, resistance and displacement. These traditions rely on modal melodies, sustained tones and subtle ornamentation, avoiding western harmonic development.The music is marked by restraint and compression; there is little choral harmony or dramatic expansion. Emotion is conveyed through breath, timbre and phrasing rather than volume. Instruments like thepkhachich(percussion clappers) orshichepshin(bowed lute/flute) typically support the voice rather than lead it. Instruments carry different names across the region – their variety is captured in a documentary the French film-maker Vincent Moon made while travelling with Khalilov and Kodzoko in 2011,Circassia: Sonic Exploration of an Ancient Land.View image in fullscreenLechinkay Ensemble during recording in Kabardino-Balkaria.Photograph: Daliya BeshtoSince their debut, Ored Recordings has released a record every year on or around 21 May, the Circassian Day of Mourning, which marks the end of the Russo-Circassian war in 1864 and the beginning of mass exile. These releases foreground diaspora voices as integral to Circassian history. By linking archival recordings, historical context and contemporary reflection, Ored frames 21 May as a living ritual – where music becomes a tool for mourning loss and asserting continuity.“As kids, we were often skeptical about our culture, and traditional music felt old-fashioned or irrelevant. At the same time, we strongly felt that we were not Russian, even though we couldn’t clearly define what it meant to be Circassian,” says Khalilov. “The goal isn’t revenge or replacing one form of domination with another but imagining a future where different communities can coexist safely and freely.”After February 2022, comparisons between Russia’s historic conquest in the Caucasus and its contemporary war-making have become more obvious – but also more dangerous to state explicitly inside Russia.In its ethnic republics, anti-war and anti-imperial voices are quickly suppressed, while state institutions promote narratives of loyalty and unity around the war in Ukraine. Feeling restricted by their region’s increased isolation from the outside world, Khalilov and Kodzoko decided to leave their homeland.View image in fullscreenOred co-founders … Timur Kodzoko and Bulat Khalilov.Photograph: Zarina KodzaevaWith their families, they moved first to Georgia, where they spent almost two years waiting for visas to Germany, and now live in the university town of Göttingen, in Lower Saxony. This month, Düsseldorf-based record label TAL will release Music from the Caucasus – The Archive of Ored Recordings 2013–2023, a compilation of various recordings with stories of struggle, independence and historical memory in the present.Their move to Germany has reshaped their relationship with the Circassian diaspora. Proximity to artists and labels has opened new experimental directions, including an electronic project with Martina Bertoni and TAL founder Stefan Schneider, formerly of electronica trio To Rococo Rot. The label continues its core regional work with North Caucasian musicians and archival projects. The Karachay band Gollu is preparing a new album, while Kodzoko’s own group Jrpjej is working with a Berlin-based vocalist Svetlana Mamresheva, and the label is developing archival projects with musicians of the Nogai, an ethnic minority scattered across the North Caucasus, the Volga region and Central Asia.“Over time, we realised that it’s not trauma or a victim narrative that gives value to the music – it’s the stories behind it,” says Khalilov. “These songs are not just abstract sadness; they are tied to genocide, displacement, language loss and everyday colonial conditions that still exist. Historical problems continue to shape the present. If we want anything to change, we must speak about it.”Music from the Caucasus – The Archive of Ored Recordings 2013–2023 is out 30 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsMusicEuropeRussiaFolk musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 2018, a jury ruled that Monsanto’s glyphosate weedkiller, Roundup,caused the former groundskeeper’s cancer.Solie’s admission – that real horror can’t be prettified – recalls Noor Hindi’s viral 2020 poem,Fuck Your Lecture on Craft, My People Are Dying. We can’t “treat poetry like it’s some kind of separate thing” to what’s going on around us, says Solie, speaking to me in Soho, London, the morning after finding outshe has won the TS Eliot prizefor her collection Wellwater. “We all have to keep our eyes open”, but “that doesn’t mean we can’t say we’re scared, because it’s scary”.View image in fullscreenWellwater by Karen Solie.The poet, 59, grew up in Saskatchewan, Canada, and is now based between Toronto and St Andrews, Scotland, where she teaches half-time at the university. She began writing poetry in her early 30s, publishing her first collection in 2001. Wellwater is her sixth collection, and was also thejoint winnerof the Forward prize last October.Whether she is writing about agrochemical monopolies or housing insecurity or wildfires, Solie doesn’t once drop her gaze. While the question of art’s role in times of crisis is “a very old one”, the difference now “is that everything feels so accelerated”, Solie says. “There have been other times of crisis”, but now there is a “sense of things careening towards some kind of head”. We “have to feel like human beings with a spirit in order to do anything about anything”, but there are interests that “thrive on us being distracted and divided”. Art is “so crucial, because it counteracts that”.Many of the poems in Wellwater centre on plants and animals. What quickly becomes clear is that Solie is fascinated by the creatures we take for granted, and, as she puts it, “things that are so ubiquitous as to disappear in one’s landscape”. There are poems about climbing vines, rats, “the mash” – a Newfoundland term for bogs. “They’re so common, and that interests me,” says Solie. “To look again at some of those things and to make them remarkable again.” Much of this transformation is a humanisation: grasses “pass teaspoons of silence” up a slope, sheep “find a nave // in which to say / their panicked rosaries”.Solie believes her sympathy for nature’s overlooked species “might have something to do with where I’m from, which is a place that is very beautiful, but not in an overt way”. She grew up in a part of Saskatchewan where there are “no mountains” – “it’s mostly fields, crops, and it’s quite flat”, but still “very beautiful”.As a child, Solie was a big reader. She attended a small rural school, with eight people in her class. “Its resources were not the best, but there were always books in the house – not poetry but novels and short stories.” Her father, to whom Wellwater is dedicated, and who died in 2024 before she completed the collection, owned a book called A World of Great Stories. “I read this many times as a kid, even though it contains some things that are not entirely appropriate for children, and that’s really where it started.”Solie didn’t get into poetry until much later, at university in her mid-20s, after working as a reporter for several years. She studied at the University of Lethbridge, in Alberta, and took a contemporary poetry course in her third year. The feeling she had experienced with short stories – “the magic of reading a sentence, and it’s just a sentence, but it evokes this physical response” – she found with poetry too.The “whole crowd” she encountered in that first class – WH Auden, Wallace Stevens, Elizabeth Bishop, Sylvia Plath, Marianne Moore – made a lasting impression. A writer who “cracked something open” for her later on was Tomas Tranströmer. Anne Carson has “always been important”. And the work of younger poets, including two shortlisted for this year’s TS Eliot, Isabelle Baafi and Catherine-Esther Cowie, has been “revitalising”.Before Wellwater, Solie had published five collections: Short Haul Engine, Modern and Normal, Pigeon, The Road in Is Not the Same Road Out and The Caiplie Caves, for which she was nominated for the TS Eliot prize in 2019. She has for several years taught in the UK, at Manchester Metropolitan University before moving to St Andrews. The “financial cushion” that the TS Eliot prize brings will make it possible to focus on writing, says Solie. “And I’m going to be a very happy person when I pay off my credit card and see that zero balance, that’s going to be great.”Winning the award – among the world’s most prestigious for poetry – is “incredibly encouraging”, she says. As a writer, “you spend a lot of time alone, and looking at the screen, and thinking of all of the ways that things could be better. There’s a lot of self-doubt – there has to be, in order to produce anything good.” So having the book recognised is “just lovely”.Of her practice, Solie says that she is not someone who can “just write things out quickly”. “I’m a word-by-word person,” she says. “Things take me a lot of time, I’m very slow. So sometimes things evolve through many, many revisions.”In Wellwater, slotted between poems about nature are others about urban spaces, malls and bad apartments. In the opening poem, Basement Suite, Solie tells us: “In the basement one is closer to God because / closer to consequence, to creatures no one loves / but the specialists”. In another, Toronto the Good, she writes of “The parade / of baffling flats we viewed, advertised as ‘funky,’ ‘quirky,’ // were tiny museums of illegality / we convinced ourselves weren’t bad.” “The backdrop to all this is how unaffordable Toronto has become,” says Solie. Many people “have been pushed into this succession of temporary accommodations”. It’s “infuriating to see the direction that so many cities have gone”, and difficult to see a realistic way back, she says.Wellwater by Karen Solie – landscapes in distress captured with raw candourRead moreWhether environmental or personal, there’s “a lot of loss in the book”, says Solie. “But I hope as well there’s some kind of gesture past all of that.” The penultimate poem, Starcraft, written after her father’s death, reaches for this, imagining “compartments of another world sliding past / this one. Or another dimension. I like that better. / … / … It would mean / you aren’t gone, just out of frame.”Wellwater by Karen Solie is published by Picador.

Vigil, his first novel since 2017’s Booker prize‑winningLincoln in the Bardo, returns to that indeterminate space between life and death, comedy and grief, moral inquiry and narrative hijinks. Once again, the living are largely absent, and the dead are meddlesome and chatty. They have bones to pick.They converge at the deathbed of an oil man, KJ Boone. He’s a postwar bootstrapper: long-lived, filthy rich and mightily pleased with himself. “A steady flow of satisfaction, even triumph, coursed through him, regarding all he had managed to see, cause and create.” Boone is calm in his final hours, enviably so. He seems destined to die exactly as he lived, untroubled by self-reflection. But as his body falters, his mind becomes permeable to ghosts, and they have work to do. The tycoon has profited handsomely from climate denial, and there is still time for him to acknowledge his fossil-fuelled sins before the lights go out.Our narrator, Jill Blaine, is a spectral death doula. She has helped hundreds of souls ease their way out of their bodies, and she’s good at it, in part because no one did the job for her (her own ending was … explosive). But Boone is a thorny, unrepentant fellow; certain of his own brilliance, and his exemption from the petty scruples of “mere earthlings”. What is the doula’s role here: to comfort the dying man, or correct the moral record? When does mercy become complicity?The ingredients here are Dickensian: a crotchety old bastard, ghostly visitations and a soul (or two) on the lineReading Vigil in the wake of Christmas does it no favours. The ingredients here are unavoidably Dickensian: a crotchety old bastard, ghostly visitations, and a soul (or two) on the line. Is KJ Boone an Anthropocene version of Ebenezer Scrooge? If so, Saunders has forgotten something elemental about that Victorian wretch: we end up rooting for him. That was the wager of A Christmas Carol, and the source of its enduring and radical comfort. If Scrooge could change, maybe we could too.Boone is different. He can’t undo his damage with a roast turkey and a pay rise. He has helped to damn the planet, and so we watch in the hope – the expectation – that he’ll be damned in return. That is our vigil.We will meet his sneering daughter (“recovered from her brief, friend-induced flirtation with libtarditude”); we will meet his cowed wife. By the time Boone takes his final breaths, we will have no doubt that he is what we think he is: “a bully, a ruiner, an unrepentant world-wrecker”. Comeuppance is an empty, ghoulish business and that may be Saunders’s point. But there is little moral work to do here: Boone has earned his fate (the arrogant brute is likely to agree), and compassion is its own kind of punishment. Whatever Jill decides – whatever we decide – can be made to feel righteous.It is a vigilantist fantasy: that if we could just identify and eliminate the right corporate monsters, the ledger might balance. Billionaires and CEOs make excellent villains; some even seem to relish the role. But cut one down and another couple sprout in their place; an economic hydra. That’s the real monstrosity. The climate crisis doesn’t have a satisfying antagonist because the violence is structural, pervasive and monstrously ordinary. Vigil circles this idea, but never escapes Boone’s gravitational pull.Yet Jill “Doll” Blaine is the far more interesting creature. In order to tend to others – 343 charges to date – the death doula has forgotten herself: her past, her end, even her name. As Boone is dying, a wedding is under way next door, and the merry noise of it unsettles her careful amnesia. Her own love story returns, but to remember it is to relive its end. Somewhere in a lonely attic, the doula’s own wedding dress moulders. How terrifyingly lonely it is to be forgotten. Much easier to do the forgetting yourself.This is where Saunders’s ghosts do their most persuasive work. Not as blunt moral instruments, but as unfinished souls. Lincoln in the Bardo narrowed history to a single, intimate calamity: Abraham Lincoln holding the body of his dead son through one last long night. By staying with the specificity of loss – the weight of the boy in his father’s arms – the book let Lincoln be more than a grand American allegory. He was pried loose from symbolic duty and returned to the human realm of love and loss. History was watching, but Saunders did not allow it a final say. The archival scraps he included contradicted one another. The only truth left standing was the grief itself: private, incontrovertible, sufficient.In Vigil, the spectral shenanigans are starting to feel like a gimmick: the polyphonic jibber-jabber, the Beckettian riddling, the poo and fart jokes (Saunders loves a bawdy, gassy ghost; a pile of phantom faeces). What once felt anarchic has hardened into habit; a repertoire of tricks and tics. They’re being used to stage a lesson for us – and it grates, to be trapped in someone else’s morality play.

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 21 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 08.02 ESTShareNintendo’s pandemic-era hit Animal Crossing: New Horizons got another major update last week, along with a £5 Switch 2 upgrade that makes it look and run better on the new console. Last year, Ithrew a new year’s partyfor my children in the game, but apart from that I have barely touched my island sincethe depths of lockdown, when sunny Alba was my preferred escape from the monotonous misery of the real world. Back then, I spent more than 200 hours on this island. Stepping out of her (now massive) house, my avatar’s hair is all ruffled and her eyes sleepy after a long, long time aslumber.I half-expected Alba to be practically in ruins, but it’s not that bad. Aside from a few cockroaches in the basement and a bunch of weeds poking up from the snow, everything is as it was. The paths that I had laid out around the island still lead me to the shop, the tailors, the museum; I stop by to visit Blathers the curatorial owl, and he gives me a new mission to find a pigeon called Brewster so that we can open a museum cafe. “It’s been four years and eight months!” exclaims one of my longtime residents, a penguin called Aurora. That can’t be right, can it? Have I really been ignoring her since summer 2021? Thankfully,Animal Crossingcharacters are very forgiving. I get the impression they’ve been getting along perfectly fine without me.I take myself on a little tour of Alba, investigating all the things I’d forgotten I made. Atop the highest cliffs on the island I find a half-finished bamboo zen garden. Down by the beach there is a playground; I had a baby and a toddler back in 2020 and I was spending alotof time in playgrounds. The whole place is testament to the extent of my homesickness during the pandemic, during which I was stuck in a suboptimal basement flat in Brighton: the island flag is a saltire, the island tune is the first couple of bars of Scotland the Brave.I check my bank account and find over 2 million bells in there. How the hell did I accumulate 2 million bells from selling fish and fossils? With the help of a further 99,000 bells of interest, I pay off the final instalment of my home loan, forgetting that there’s no real point in doing this except personal satisfaction. I am now penniless, but at least I am out from under the thumb of the Tom Nook financial empire. That loan-shark raccoon has got nothing on me now.View image in fullscreenDoing the rounds in a little boat in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.Photograph: NintendoThere’s a new building: a hotel perched on the end of the pier, run by a family of pirate kappa. Home decoration was never my favourite part of Animal Crossing so I am not exactly thrilled to be asked to put together new rooms for the guests, but there have been a lot of improvements to this activity since I last played – placing cute little furniture items and paintings on the floor and walls is much easier than it was, especially using the Switch 2 controller as a mouse. I throw together a nautical theme for the first room and discover that the rewards for this work are tiny versions of old Nintendo toys and consoles. I start mentally planning out a games room back at my house.Rather than face all the tidying up, some of my friends have ditched their pandemic-era islands and started again, which involves a level of dedication to the game that I can only respect. There’s a new service – run by Mr Resetti, the angry mole who used to yell at you for turning off the game without saving in the early-00s era of Animal Crossing – that lets you wipe everything off the ground of your island, leaving it clear for terraforming and redecorating. It’s also now easier to make those outdoor transformations, as you can hold L to stick your character to the island’s invisible grid, making it much easier to place things like walls and roads. And crops, I discover. Did you know Animal Crossing has farming now? And food recipes? This was news to me. Now I make my mini-me a smoothie before my morning rounds of Alba.I am surprised at how quickly I fall back into the rhythm of Animal Crossing. It’s such a soothing game, with so many outlets for creativity. Much of this update’s new stuff is for people with more time than me – for instance, you can decorate entire new Slumber Islands with friends while your avatar sleeps, but what was always great about this game is that it doesn’t require much from you. You can spend a peaceful half hour every day checking in on your small world, or you can spend many hours creating custom fashions for your residents and tourists, and designing every square metre of the island to your specifications.Back in the 90s, Animal Crossing was a game born from loneliness: Nintendo’s Katsuya Eguchi came up with the original idea for the game because moving to Kyoto had separated him from his friends and family in Chiba, near Tokyo. He envisioned a game that fostered a sense of community, that families could play together. (You can read a lot more about this series’ origins inmy book about Nintendo, by the way – it’s out in a couple of weeks.) So it feels very poetic that Animal Crossing ended up saving the whole world from loneliness in 2020. It’s taken me a long while to feel good about returning to Alba, and it’s been a surprise to discover that this game is now better than it’s ever been.What to playView image in fullscreenRobert Robertson III trying to wrangle superheroes in Dispatch.Illustration: SteamMan was I sleeping onDispatch. I played all of its eight episodes over the course of a week and I have never laughed aloud so often at a video game.A narrative gamein the vein of the old Telltale adventures The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, and made by many of the same people, it tells the story of washed-up superhero, Robert Robertson III, who is sent to work at a call centre and put in charge of a team of mardy former supervillains on a rehabilitation programme. The animation is superb, the characters and acting memorable, and the dialogue quick-witted. It would have made a great animated series, but it makes an even better choice-centric video game. Anything with superheroes is usually an instant “no” from me, but this is clever and funny without the boringly self-referential humour that usually infests the genre.Available on:PS5, PC; Nintendo Switch/2 versions coming 28 JanuaryEstimated playtime:8-9 hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenSophie Turner as Lara Croft in the new Prime Video series, Tomb Raider.Photograph: Jay Maidment/Prime Video/PAAmazon MGM Studios released a first image of Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner as Lara Croft in the forthcomingTomb Raider TV series.

Their combined contents threaten to crack the code of realityLewis GordonWed 21 Jan 2026 06.15 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 07.17 ESTShareBletchley Park: famed home of the Enigma machine, Colossus computer, and, according to the premise of TR-49, an altogether stranger piece of tech. Two engineers created a machine that feeds on the most esoteric books: treatises on quantum computing, meditations on dark matter, pulp sci-fi novels and more. In the mid-2010s, when the game is set, Britain finds itself again engulfed by war, this time with itself. The arcane tool may hold the key to victory.You play as budding codebreaker Abbi, a straight-talking northerner who is sifting through the machine now moved to a crypt beneath Manchester Cathedral. She has no idea how it works and neither do you. So you start tinkering. You input a four-digit code – two letters followed by two numbers. What do these correspond to? The initials of people and the year of a particular book’s publication. Input a code correctly and you are whisked away to the corresponding page, as if using a particularly speedy microfiche reader. These pages – say, by famed fictional physicist, Joshua Silverton – are filled with clues and, should you get lucky, further codes and even the titles of particular works. Your primary goal is to match codes with the corresponding book title in a bid to find the most crucial text of all, Endpeace, the key to understanding the erudite ghosts of this machine.Hidden within this rhizomatic network of information is a mystery so intriguing and elegant that it can unfold naturally from any individual player’s investigations – no matter which titles or authors you see first, or where your particular curiosities lead you thereafter. Connections can cascade, tumbling like a waterfall, before swerving in unexpected directions, defying the traditionally linear logic of mystery fiction. TR-49 gives you an in-game notepad to keep track of everything; I recommend also keeping an actual pen and paper beside you.View image in fullscreenPaper trail … TR-49.Photograph: inkle LtdYou might imagine TR-49 as a comment on the rise of AI large language models (LLMs) which “scrape” data as this game’s machine feeds on writing. Actually, its concerns are broader and more ambitious, recalling the heady recent books of Chilean author Benjamín Labatut (When We Cease to Understand the WorldandThe Maniac). Like Labatut, TR-49 brims with awe, scepticism and horror at the reality-shredding possibilities of scientific and technological advances made in the 20th century, all while pushing these concepts into a playful, fantastical space.Less compelling are conversations that play out between Abbi and her companions on the other end of a radio transmission. Where the mystery told through the machine itself is lavishly detailed, what happensoutsideit feels too thin: Abbi’s reasons for being there; the nature of the conflict raging above, which is sketched in frustratingly vague terms.Still, the interactive heart of TR-49 resides in trawling this codebreaking device for secrets. And in this regard, the game is an unqualified success; TR-49’s database mystery rivals Sam Barlow’s gamesHer StoryandImmortality, though it is of an unashamedly literary nature compared to those more filmic works.Closer to TR-49’s beginning, you may feel crushed by this mass of inscrutable writings. Quickly, you will swim elegantly amid it, conversant in its many,manypeculiarities. Across a handful of evenings, I relished disappearing into this archive, cavorting from log to log, title to title, following threads and losing track of time. Each scrap of paper, water-damaged periodical and rare first edition threatened to solve this mystery, yet none could in isolation. Just as the fictional maker of the archive fell under the spell of these records and materials, I too was seduced.TR-49 is out today, 21 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsGamesPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

The nerves, the tantrums – sometimes even charges of“inappropriate” first dances. Isn’t it all part and parcel of the apparently perfect day?That emotional messiness is laid bare inDante or Die’s utterly gorgeous site-specific show, first performed in 2013, now reprised at a number of Malmaison hotels, including this one in London as part of the Barbican’sScene Changeseason.Created by Daphna Attias and Terry O’Donovan, it captures the final 10 minutes before the ceremony is due to begin. The audience is divided into groups and shuttles between six rooms, each in a different order, which encapsulate these final moments before Georgie (Carla Langley) and Tunde (Dauda Ladejobi) tie the knot.Initially, it seems like an exercise in carefully coordinated – albeit funny and fascinating – voyeurism, with the usual wedding day tropes at play: spirited bridesmaids dancing on a bed, surreptitious shags and “call it all off” nerves for the bride and groom. But it becomes more and more moving, intimately revealing anguish and insecurity, turning a snapshot into a world.Each room brings a new scenario, from an encounter between Georgie’s mother, Helen (Johanne Murdock), and her unfaithful ex-husband, David (Jonathan McGuinness), which brings a devastating moment of regretful tenderness, to same-sex passion involving the fabulously antsy best man Joe (Manish Gandhi).View image in fullscreenFabulously antsy … the best man (Manish Gandhi) in I Do, watched by the audience.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAnd each scenario captures a kind of love. In one of the most painful scenes, we enter into the room of Georgie’s grandparents, Gordon (Geof Atwell) and Eileen (Fiona Watson), who is dressing him. He is sitting in a wheelchair, unable to talk or move, perhaps as the result of a stroke. Her frayed love and his red-faced frustration are captured with such economy by writer Chloë Moss, all the more so when Helen comes in, to find her father half-dressed in his wheelchair. “I miss you,” she says, more to herself, while he looks on with desperation. The depth of this small tragedy is caught so keenly in those few words.The set design by Jenny Hayton perfectly replicates the corporate kitsch of this hotel-wrapped wedding package world (rose petals scattered on a bed, towels crafted into love hearts) alongside the personal detritus of the characters, from TCP in the bathroom to the table plan in Helen’s bedroom and the champagne bottles in the bride’s.There are searing performances all round and immaculate direction by Attias, allowing for stillness in which emotions evolve through looks between characters, touches, tiny shifts in expression.The story gathers shape gradually. It is sequenced so we join up the intrigues ourselves, at our own pace. There is a corny – even cliched – element in the returning figure of a cleaner who enters rooms and travels through the corridors in a backward motion, as if rewinding the drama. But even he brings a surreal charm.You care for almost every character by the end. It’s as big, heart-wrenching, ridiculous and wonderful as any wedding day.AtMalmaison hotel, London, until 8 February.Then touringExplore more on these topicsTheatreHotelsWeddingsreviewsShareReuse this content"

There is the Whitehall contingent, speaking in clipped tones aboutKurdshiding in the mountains, at the mercy of Saddam Hussein’s armed forces. There’s Iraqi diplomat Al-Tikriti, Saddam’s half-brother, and there is also Chris Bowers, the play’s writer and a former British diplomat in Iraqi Kurdistan.Bowers infuses the debates and wrangles at the heart of this crisis with an authenticity that carries weight, but it does not make for good drama in itself.The heroes are the diplomats here, Clive (Richard Lynson) and Catherine (Beth Burrows), who give us the political detail of their world (“what with the transition from Margaret Thatcher to John Major”). But, diplomacy being diplomacy, sensible discussion reigns over sparks in dialogue or action. Instead there is planning, manoeuvring, strategic resourcefulness. These elements might make for an effective political drama, especially when a blustering American general (Stephen Cavanagh) attempts to block their idea to create a safe haven for the Kurds (eventually resulting in Operation Safe Haven) but the pace, complexity and depth are just not there.Under the direction of Mark Giesser, brief scenes switch from Whitehall to numerous press conferences, Clive’s garden and occasionally the Iraqi mountains. They all feel too functional, delivering information and exposition above human drama.View image in fullscreenSnatched scenes of fear and resilience .. Eugenie Bouda and Lisa Zahra in Safe Haven.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianCharacters are paper thin, some performances stilted. Clive is, unfortunately, as dull as one of Major’s grey suits, speaking in predictable cricketing metaphors, and Catherine is generic. Al-Tikriti (Mazlum Gül), when he briefly pops up, is a mouthpiece. It is Clive’s Middle England wife, Anne (Lisa Zahra), who is left to bring what drama there is with her insistence that he take responsibility for the plight of the Kurds when he is initially reluctant to do so.The terror faced by the Kurdish population is represented mainly by a pregnant woman, Najat (Eugenie Bouda) and her companion (also played by Zahra), hiding in the mountains while the coalition forces um and ah about protecting them from massacre. There is also Najat’s brother, a doctor, refugee and, it seems, activist who manages to reach the British diplomatic corps and appeal directly to Catherine about what his people face.You want more focus on the Kurdish experience rather than snatched scenes of fear or resilience. What about the debates, manoeuvring and resourcefulness on the mountain tops?This is an overlooked part of Iraq’s history, from a western perspective, eclipsed by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and later the US’s invasion of Iraq. It deserves more drama, emotion and political complexity on the ground.AtArcola theatre, London, until 7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreIraqKurdsArcola theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The songs we dance to, cry to and rock out to,” culture correspondent Anthony Mason said on CBS Mornings before announcing the inductees.Established in 1969, the Songwriters Hall of Fame requires that inducted songwriters have a notable catalog of songs to qualify for induction 20 years after the first commercial release of a song.The Bad Blood singer has won four Grammy album of the year awards. Her latest release, The Life of a Showgirl, sold more copies than any other album in the modern era during its first week of release, according to Billboard, which cited data from Luminate, a firm that tracks music sales.In May 2025, Swift announced that she bought her music rights, officially reclaiming ownership of all her master recordings, including her first six albums.Later that year, Swift’s record-breaking Eras tour spawned a concert film and a six-part documentary series that chronicles the success of the tour on Disney+.Her 2024 The Tortured Poets Department album, which debuted at No 1 on the Billboard 200 album chart, sold the equivalent of 8m albums in the US, according to Luminate.Explore more on these topicsTaylor SwiftStevie WondernewsShareReuse this content"

Dean is nominated for artist and album of the year, pop act, and has two chances at winning song of the year for Man I Need and Rein Me In, the latter thanks to a guest spot withSam Fender.The 26-year-old Dean already had a good measure of success from her 2023 debut album Messy, but the follow-up The Art of Loving – featuring songs about the confounding and joyous business of being in love, in a sophisticated range of styles from bossa nova to neo-soul – has been a global sensation, topping the UK charts and currently sitting at No 3 in the US. Lead single Man I Need has barely been out of the UK Top 10 since its release in August and reached No 1.Dean is the first announced performer at the awards ceremony, held for the first time in Manchester, at the city’s Co-op Live arena on Saturday 28 February and broadcast on ITV, with Jack Whitehall hosting.Young, 25, is up for artist of the year, breakthrough artist (renamed from best new artist) and appears in two of the genre categories, for alternative/rock and pop, reflecting her deft grasp of different styles on 2025 album I’m Only F**king Myself: a charismatic and magnificently sweary portrait of addiction, romantic frustration and more. She is also nominated for song of the year for Messy, which was released back in May 2024 but continued its commercial success right through the awards’ eligibility period: it spent four weeks at No 1 and 60 weeks on the chart in total. Both Young and Dean are up for best new artistat next month’s Grammy awards.As well as the nod for Rein Me In with Dean, Sam Fender is nominated three more times, including for artist and album of the year, thanks to his social-realist portraiture on UK No 1 album People Watching which won the 2025 Mercury prize.Lily Allen caps one of the most remarkable re-entries into British pop with three nominations, including artist and album of the year. After four albums which had earned nine Brit nominations between them (including a 2010 win in the now-defunct British female solo artist category), she stepped away to focus on acting and podcasting, but returned in 2025 with West End Girl: a portrait of a failing open marriage, including huge resonances with her own personal life. The ultra-candid lyrics – featuring sex toys, hook-up apps and heartbreakingly toxic relationship dynamics – ensured it became massively discussed, and a commercial hit.View image in fullscreenRapper, singer, songwriter and producer … Jim Legxacy.Photograph: Igoris TarranAlso with three nominations each are two of the brightest talents in British rap. Dave is up for artist and album of the year, after releasing the typically self-searching The Boy Who Played the Harp in October, which went to No 1, as did its single Raindance. One of Dave’s regular collaborators rises out of the underground to join him:Jim Legxacy, a rapper, singer, songwriter and producer who co-produced Dave and Central Cee’s huge Brit-nominated hit Sprinter in 2023, and returned to work with him on The Boy Who Played the Harp. He is nominated for his own work, the mixtape Black British Music (2025), earning nods in the rap, R&B and breakthrough artist categories.Rockers Wolf Alice round out the album of the year nominations on their way to three nods overall, and dance starFred Again, who had a major hit with Skepta and PlaqueBoyMax collaboration Victory Lap and continued his sweatily received live sets, was also nominated three times.Also in the running for artist of the year are Jade, Little Simz, PinkPantheress and Self Esteem: one demonstration of how well represented women are in this year’s nominations. There has been consternation in previous years at how male-dominated the Brit awards could be, includingas recently as 2023when all the artist of the year nominees were men. But this year, 70% of nominees are female or non-binary, or mixed-gender groups.That representation arguably disguises a deeper malaise in British music, however. Of the 116 albums eligible for British album of the year – those that reached the UK Top 30 – only 41 were by female acts or mixed-gender groups, and of those 41, only 25 were solely female.In the international categories, the established likes of Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga and Haim are joined by breakthrough acts such as Geese and Sombr, plus the international group category’s first ever animated act: Huntr/x, the trio from Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters.View image in fullscreenHuntr/x in a scene from KPop Demon Hunters.Photograph: APArtists smarting from a snub this year include Ed Sheeran, who released his album Play last year but was nominated only in the song of the year category, which is based on commercial performance, not votes by theBrit awardsvoting academy. Florence + the Machine, a 12-time nominee, wasn’t recognised this year, even in the alternative/rock category; nor were Yungblud, Mumford & Sons and Biffy Clyro, who all topped the UK album chart last year. Major stars such as Drake, the Weeknd, Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Addison Rae, Lorde and Tate McRae were left out of the international categories.Central Cee was passed over in the British artist and album categories, while UK rap’s biggest new name,EsDeeKid, was not nominated in the rap category – though he did get recognised for breakthrough artist, up against Young, Legxacy, dance producer Barry Can’t Swim and pop-R&B singer Skye Newman.The awards are voted on by the Brits academy, made up of more than 1,200 individuals across the music industry, except the two song awards, which are voted for by the public via WhatsApp – meaning that songs with heavily invested fanbases, such as Defying Gravity from the musical Wicked as performed by Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, could cause an upset.One award has already been handed out: the critics’ choice award, renamed from the rising star award, is given to Scottish singer-songwriterJacob Alon. “In the wee town where I grew up in Scotland, it often felt like there was a limit to how high you could dare to dream,” they said. “So being part of something like this makes me feel like I’m floating far above the sky.”View image in fullscreenJarvis Cocker’s infamous incident at the 1996 Brit awards.Photograph: BBCCome 28 February, the ceremony’s security guards may be keeping an eye on one person in particular: Jarvis Cocker, whose band Pulp are nominated for group of the year their first nomination since their four in 1996. At that ceremony, Cocker caused a storm by bending over and presenting his clothed bottom towards the audience as a distraction from Jackson’s performance of Earth Song, resulting in Cocker being questioned by police.At the time, Cocker called his actions “a form of protest at the way Michael Jackson sees himself as some kind of Christ-like figure with the power of healing”. Cocker laterdescribedhis own behaviour as “quite out of character” and said he struggled with the extra fame it afforded him. “That’s when it became really difficult to handle because I just couldn’t go out any more.

Now they’re going globalWed 21 Jan 2026 06.20 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 09.22 ESTShareStuart McKenzieturns towards a fan on a makeshift stage so his long brunette hair blows in the wind. The artist is dressed in a power suit with thick rimmed glasses, flamboyantly smoking a cigarette as he performs the confessional poetry he’s been writing since the 80s. “Stuart is this fantastic London staple who is just coming out of the woodwork now,” says Emily Pope, the director ofMontez Press, who hosted the fundraiser where McKenzie performed to support their queer, feminist press and radio.McKenzie is a typical Montez Press collaborator: an experimental artist who doesn’t fit neatly into either art, literary or music spaces (although he did recently support the indie band Bar Italia). He’s later in his career than some of the emerging artists they collaborate with but he has Montez Press’s “desire to push boundaries and ask questions,” as Anna Clark, one of the organisation’s founding members, puts it.Established in 2012 by a group of exchange students from Goldsmiths College of Art at Hamburg School of Art, Montez Press was formed to counter a publishing landscape dominated, they say, by heteronormative journalists and academics. Instead, they wanted to celebrate more experimental forms of writing, led by artists who championed feminist and queer perspectives. Their first book wasChubz by Huw Lemmey, a nightmarish, homoerotic satire about the protagonist, who dates a leftwing journalist, inspired by Owen Jones, whom he meets on Grindr in the summer of 2011 as Nigel Farage rises to power as prime minister. It’s a story about class struggle, populism, and our dependence on technology – tied together with a lot of sex.The press commissions a novel each year, written by a younger artist doing something “we perceive to be particularly groundbreaking in the realm of auto-speculative or fan fiction,” says Pope. That’s literature rooted in personal experiences explored through a futuristic or fantastical lens, often inspired by existing characters, settings, or plots from copyrighted media. Their latest release wasJaw Filler, written by Maz Murray and Charlie Markbreiter. It’s a pulpy neo-noir detective novel about the disappearance of Character as he enters Sim World’s First Trans Commune, a virtual reality community constructed by an influencer and paid for by a dark tech company.The team themselves often write books: Stacy Skolnik, who is the co-director of Montez Press Radio, wroteThe Ginny Suitein 2024, a mystery centred on a global condition affecting women that causes submissiveness and aphasia; while assistant editor Elida Silvey is in the process of writing her vampire story.View image in fullscreenStuart McKenzie performs at the Montez Press London fundraiser at Ormside Projects, 2025.Photograph: Miranda ShutlerExtracts from these books and plays are streamed onMontez Press Radio, alongside more bizarre transmissions. Artist Lux Pyre can be found popping bottles on the airwaves incorporating ASMR with readings from his fan fiction fantasy about sexual desires. “He’d never done this before. Neither had we actually, so we had to build this little DIY soundproof box,” says Miranda Shutler, who’s in charge of the London programming. “It’s a really great space for experimentation in the same way that the press is.”On the station, Irish noise artistVivienne Griffinsings into the back of an “augmented self-playing harp”, called the New Note, aclarsach(Celtic harp), they’ve made using a modular synthesiser: “I’m a gin and tonic drank by an alcoholic,” they sing, as the harp plays, “day after watching the news, shit storms strolling, extremist flowing, the colour of rage.” They also host their show, Hell Sister, in which they interview countercultural icons such asAdele Bertei, a prominent figure in New York’s late 70s no wave scene.Anna Clark, Stacy Skolnik and Thomas Laprade started startedMontez Press Radioin 2018, broadcasting an alternative programme that captures underground art, literature, nightlife and music scenes, from an art gallery in Manhattan’s Chinatown. “The radio made a lot of sense,” says Clark, “providing a space where people could have experimental projects, have intimate conversations and be able to disseminate that to an even wider audience.”View image in fullscreenVivienne Griffin at a Montez Press event in 2024.Photograph: Miranda ShutlerIt’s all very lo-fi with the energy of a community radio station, where you might catch music curated by an East Village record shop and queer London-based DJs; jam sessions-slash-performances; or 12 hours of lectures, songs, and poetry related to Palestinian liberation in collaboration withRadio Alhara. One conversation between researchers fromForensic Architecture– who use architectural evidence in cases of human rights abuses and war crimes – advocated for land restitution and reparations in Namibia by re-enacting the colonial violence perpetrated at the time.It’s an attractive alternative to public radio, which in the US has “been completely slashed and undermined,” says Clark. “That just makes me feel even more impassioned in continuing to find ways to reach our audience and the people who want to support democracy and independent media.” Clark, who is living in America under Trump, adds: “the rise of fascism is really challenging and makes the work that we do both even more important, doubling down on our commitment to support trans people, feminist perspectives, underrepresented voices, as that becomes more and more under attack.”Unlike community radio that was once rooted in one particular scene and city, Montez Press is completely international, operating between bases in Hamburg, New York and London. The radio has offshoot programming in Mexico, has put on events in Vietnam and Korea, while itsInterjection Calendar, which commissions 12 emerging and established artists and writers to map the year in contemporary art writing, is being edited in Taiwan. The previous calendar was curated by Irish artistRacheal Crowther, who looks at surveillance, governance and institutional power in London. “We’re really interested in how to connect hyper-local, grassroots, counter-cultural scenes in contemporary art, writing and music, and how to foster a global community,” says Pope.Over the decade that Montez Press has been publishing “we’ve shifted from being on the periphery to being a pillar in new ways of thinking about independent publishing,” Pope says. The queer, feminist publishing landscape in London has evolved into a diverse ecosystem of small independent presses, artists self-publishing, alternative book and zine fairs, and dedicated shops. “A really interesting question is how to remain relevant when something that you were doing was countercultural and then there seems to be more of it.”This article was amended on 21 January 2026. An earlier version omitted Anna Clark from the founders of Montez PressRadio, and to correct Thomas Laprade’s first name.Explore more on these topicsArt and designArtPublishingFeminismRadioLGBTQ+ rightsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

His 1979 novel, Kane and Abel, was hisbiggest hit, selling more than 34m copies in 119 countries and 47 languages, and being reprinted more than 130 times.£50,000 ‘reader-led’ writing prize launchedRead moreArcher’s 31st and final novel, Adam and Eve, described as “a powerful story which weaves together love, betrayal and the stark realities of a world at war” by publisher HarperCollins, will be out in English in October.In a statement, Archer said, “When I came across the idea for this novel a few years ago, I knew it was bigger in scope than anything I’d done before and I accepted that the research alone would be more demanding than anything I’d tackled in the past. When I finally sat down to write Adam and Eve I also realised, by the end of the first draft, that this was going to be my final novel, as at the age of 85 I could never hope to equal it again.”“I can’t quite imagine putting my pen down for good,” he added, saying that he might continue writing short stories. “But I can think of no more fitting way to bring my novel-writing career to a close.”View image in fullscreenJeffrey Archer has sold more than 300m books around the world since his first novel, Not a Penny More Not a Penny Less, was published in 1976.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianDespite selling hundreds of millions of books, which were often praised as compellingly readable, Archer failed to win over many critics over the decades. “To open one of his books was to risk being assaulted by a hectic claque of cliche, mixed metaphor, implausibility, solecism and sheer, unadulterated stodginess sufficient to send most readers screaming in breathless delirium to the mature, lucid and urgent pages of Barbara Cartland or Enid Blyton,”Robert McCrum wrote in 2009.Archer’s career as a novelist was often overshadowed by his colourful, if controversial public life.The rise and fall of Jeffrey ArcherRead moreHe was elected a Conservative MP in 1969 at the age of 29, but resigned from parliament in 1974 when he lost his life savings in a fraudulent investment scheme.In 1986, he resigned as deputy chair of the Conservative party after the Daily Star reported he had paid a sex worker for sex. The following year hesuccessfully sued the newspaper,claiming he’d never met the sex worker but had later paid her £2,000 to help her escape the press attention. Archer won £500,000 in damages in a trial where the judge famously lauded Archer’s wife’s “fragrance” in his instructions to the jury.Archer won the Tory candidacy for London mayor in 1999 but was forced to stand down after reports emerged he had persuaded a friend to lie to the court in the 1987 libel trial. Archer was suspended from the Tory party for five years and a perjury investigation began. At the same timehe was starring in a production of his own courtroom play The Accused, about the trial of an alleged murderer in which the audience voted on the guilt of Archer’s character each night.In 2001 Archer was found guiltyof two counts of perjury and two of perverting the course of justice, and sentenced to four years in prison, and was made to pay back the damages and costs. While in prison he wrote his three-volume prison memoirs, which were all bestsellers. He was released after serving two years, and spent subsequent decades focused on his writing career, which spans 50-odd works, and his extensive charity work.Archer remained a member of the House of Lords until his retirement in 2024.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey ArcherFictionPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

Guests including the actors Robert Pattinson and Mia Goth, and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton wandered past Auguste Rodin’s The Thinker as they made their way to their seats on Wednesday afternoon.Speaking backstage before the show, Anderson, dressed in his signature faded Levi’s jeans and a navy cashmere sweater, described the collection as “another character study”, explaining that this time he set out to explore “the idea of a new aristocracy”, questioning “what it means today” and “what can it be?” The-41-year old designer said when it came to the social hierarchy he wanted to “ignore the aspect of money” and instead home in on “their eccentricity”.A triumvirate of models opening the show captured the mood, dressed in sequin camisole tops, skinny jeans and snakeskin boots. Every model wore an obviously synthetic wig, either scruffy and faded or in a bright canary yellow.It was on a daily stroll down his sandbank, Avenue Montaigne, that Anderson first began to muse on the idea of “dressing versus dressing up” after he spotted a mosaic dedicated to Paul Poiret near the Dior store. The French designer, who died in 1944, was known for abolishing traditional couture techniques including the corset and instead leaning into the theatrics of the belle époque era. Anderson said he liked the idea of playing with Poiret’s sense of “ease”, something Christian Dior famously rejected with his New Look collection that caused a global ruckus owing to its hourglass silhouettes in 1947.Anderson said he didn’t want “normality”, instead he wanted to push the idea of his “Dior characters”, describing the result as “punk-iness meets Poiret”.View image in fullscreenSequin tops, skinny trousers and snakeskin boots captured the mood.Photograph: Blanca Cruz/AFP/Getty ImagesThere were still bar jackets, but this time around instead of hems sitting at the traditional top of the thigh they were cropped to above the hip with some showing slivers of bellies. Suiting that Anderson described as “slightly fucking with the proportions of” either drew on prewar references or 60s cuts. Anderson said he chose the eras as they were “moments just before the world sort of slightly changed”, musing that “clothing can kind of sometimes tell you something before the bang”.Known for his eclectic references, his mood board also featuredthe New Jersey musician MK Geewhose influence could be seen in roomy parka jackets, some with Poiret-esque frou-frou sleeves that came slung over neat tailoring, alongside the British comedy Withnail and I where Richard E Grant’s lived-in aesthetic informed faded and distressed fabrics.Anderson, whoin June 2025became the first solo creative director of menswear and womenswear since Dior himself, said his design approach was about “collaging things together”. Pointing to a powder-blue polo shirt, the kind usually found on a golf course, that he had adorned with sparkly epaulettes and paired with floral printed trousers, Anderson said he liked when a look has “a bit of kind of wrongness” to it.For a brand that has previously played it safe, it’s an ambitious new approach, especially in a fragile luxury market. This week new tariff threats from Donald Trump as he pursues Greenland caused shares at Dior’s parent company LVMH todrop 4%. However, a unique point of view and focus on quality is what Dior thinks can set themselves apart from competition and justify a higher price point. Anderson had just a month to prepare for his menswear debut last June and three weeks to plan for the women’s so is now enjoying playing with the development of new fabrics, especially for his couture debut next week.Naomi Osaka’s jellyfish-inspired outfit steals the show at Australian OpenRead moreItems from his debut shows have only started to arrive in stores so it will take another couple of weeks before his commercial impact can be calculated, but Anderson mentioned female customers are already buying the men’s bar jackets “because it’s a bit more kind of anti-fitting”. He is now trying to “bridge the two ateliers”, explaining that is “how we shop today”.“That type of [siloed] thinking is no longer there,” he added. He compared it to a dessert menu where “you leave the consumer to kind of make the decision for themselves. They can mix it up and find their own personal style. I am not Christian Dior and I am not Dior the brand, but I am here to add a chapter to it.”Elsewhere, on Monday night, Pharrell Williams, the creative director of Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s biggest brand, also toyed with the idea of the future of luxury. Riffing on his now signature dandy aesthetic, Williams described the collection as “retro-futuristic”, with a focus on technical tailoring. Double-breasted suits in houndstooth and herringbone checks became reflective under lights, shirts came purposefully crinkled, designed to sculpt to the wearer while jackets featured temperature regulating tech. Guests including Adolescence star Stephen Graham and the musician Skepta sat in front of the catwalk which snaked around a giant prefabricated home also designed by Williams.Explore more on these topicsParis fashion weekDiorFashion weeksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How’s your neck feeling?The way we sit, scroll and work means we often hold static positions for too long, creating tension and stiffness that radiates through the upper body.Experts say we can change how we move to counteract the strain and protect your neck.Take ‘micro breaks’ to resetIf you work at a desk, aim to break up sitting every 30 to 45 minutes, says Dr Rocco Cavaleri, senior lecturer in physiotherapy at Western Sydney University. Simply standing up for 60 to 90 seconds is enough to reset.“Regular ‘active breaks’ can reduce neck and back discomfort and reduce office stress,” he says.While you are standing, he suggests taking a few deep breaths while rolling your shoulders back. Gently turn your head from side to side. Stretch your chest.Can adult tummy time undo the dreaded ‘tech neck’ from hunching over a screen? | AntiviralRead moreRegular posture corrections every half hour can help, says Julia Treleaven, an associate professor at the University of Queensland School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences.She suggests a 10-second hold to correct your posture every half hour, where you elongate the back of the neck and “set” your shoulder blades apart. Try adding a quick 30-60 second walk during these breaks.Vary your tasks“Do not ignore your body’s signals, if you feel tension or discomfort, take it as a cue to move,” says Dr Poonam Mehta, senior lecturer in physiotherapy at the University of Technology in Sydney.If you can’t move away from what you’re doing, try varying your tasks every hour, says Dr Peter Stubbs, physiotherapist and lecturer at University of Technology Sydney. So, if you have been typing for an hour, switch to a task that doesn’t require a screen – like a phone call, or making a cup of tea.Bring the device to you“Tame tech neck” by bringing your screen closer to eye level, Cavaleri says.He says small habits, like using a laptop riser or propping your phone on a stand, can significantly reduce the load on your neck.Treleaven agrees, suggesting you check that elbows and knees are at 90 degrees, screen at eye height, with keyboard and mouse close. If you use dual screens, ensure they are at the correct height and position with the main screen directly in front to avoid being in a twisted position.You can also occasionally move your monitor slightly to the left or right, which forces your neck to rotate gently and prevents getting “stuck” in a fixed gaze, Stubbs says.View image in fullscreen‘Tame tech neck’ by bringing your screen closer to eye level, says Dr Rocco Cavaleri, a senior lecturer in physiotherapy.Photograph: Westend61/Getty ImagesGentle stretches“Don’t crack your neck, do strong stretches or repetitive self manipulating,” Treleaven says. While this may feel good temporarily, it is risky and doesn’t help, Stubbs says.Instead, the experts recommend gentle mobility exercises a few times a day, even while sitting.Treleaven suggests a move called the “bow and arrow”. To do it, sit with arms extended in front of you, palms touching. Slide one hand back along your other arm, pulling your elbow back as if drawing a bowstring. Let your head follow the moving elbow, rotating gently to look behind you. Slowly reverse the motion to the start and repeat on the other side.Stubbs recommends exercises with a small range of motion and no jerky movements such as slow, controlled neck nods.Other effective micro-stretches he suggests are side rotations (keep your shoulders still and slowly turn your head to look over your left shoulder, then slowly to your right) and the ear-to-shoulder, in which you drop your ear down towards your shoulder without lifting your shoulder up to meet your ear.

He suggests choosing walking meetings, taking the stairs, a brisk walk at lunch, or cycling to and from work.Accumulating 30-60 minutes of moderate activity most days is a good goal, he says.Stubbs adds that even if you have mild pain, keep up gentle movements so your neck does not freeze up.Check your stress and sleep“People carry stress in their neck,” Treleaven says.‘We stick them in shoes and forget about them’: how to really look after your feetRead moreStubbs says a significant part of neck pain comes from unconscious muscle tensing, particularly in the trapezius – a pair of large triangular muscles extending over the back of the neck and shoulders.He suggests taking a moment of mindfulness during your breaks. Ask yourself: “Am I tensing my shoulders?” then consciously drop them and relax your jaw.Cavaleri says managing stress and sleep is key. Routines like a short wind-down stretch before bed, breathing exercises or a walk helps lower muscle tension and improve sleep quality, he says.Sleep posture also matters, says Mehta, who recommends keeping your neck supported and in a neutral, comfortable position to help prevent unnecessary strain.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingThe way you moveAustralian lifestyleFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Over the past 18 months, I’ve put 17 bestsellers through their paces – including three new models in the past few months – to find out whether they’re the best thing in laundry since the clothes peg, or destined for the loft.At a glanceBest heated clothes airer overall:Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer and cover£244.98 at LakelandBest budget heated airer:Black+Decker heated winged clothes airer£47.99 at AmazonBest heated airer for fast drying:Minky SureDri heat pod drying system£49.99 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’ve spent three decades testing products from Sky boxes to mattress toppers, and it’s made me professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically solve domestic problems. I also have a solid background in procrastinating by doing laundry, hanging laundry and folding laundry, so I couldn’t resist the Filter’s offer to pay me to watch clothes dry.How I testedView image in fullscreenWe tested the temperature of the heated clothes airers with an infrared thermometer.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianHeated airers all do much the same thing in much the same way. There are small differences in design – some have triangle frames, some are winged and some have covers – but they’re basically all clothes horses that you plug in. I had to find clear distinctions between them, and this chiefly meant devising fair, quantifiable tests to measure how quickly, evenly and cheaply each airer dried clothes.The key test was a half-hourly laundry weigh-in to measure how quickly each airer dried an identical load. Actually, two identical loads – one small (4kg) and one big (8kg) – 17 times, once for every airer. I removed and weighed the clothes every 30 minutes to see how much moisture had evaporated until the fabric was dry, and this gave me an overall drying time. Room temperature remained at a steady 19-20C throughout. For more behind-the-scenes insights into weighing knickers, check outthe Filter’s newsletter.I took other measurements too, not least to give me something (anything) to do while the laundry dried, such as the dimensions of each airer and the length of its heated bars. I used an infrared thermometer to take the bars’ temperature every 30 seconds to compare heat-up times, and a wattage meter to check power usage. I then used the January 2026 default energy tariff (27.69p a kWh) to work out running costs an hour.Some brands didn’t want the airers I’d tested returned, so those were donated to two organisations that do important work in and around Southampton. The first isScratch, which provides services and furniture for families and individuals experiencing poverty, and the other isStop Domestic Abuse, a charity offering support for survivors of abuse and stalking.Here’s my guide to the 11 best heated clothes airers based on my tests.The best heated clothes airers in2026View image in fullscreen‘The most efficient barred airer I tested’: the Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBest heated clothes airer overall:Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer and coverLakelandDry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer and cover£244.98£244.98 at LakelandWhat we loveDries almost as fast as a tumble dryer; has a timer and coverWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive – and we’d like a much longer cablePhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£244.98 at LakelandThis airer is for anyone who’s fed up with choosing between the expense of a noisy tumble dryer, the mess of clothes on radiators, and the rank stink of laundry slowly drying on a conventional clothes horse. With its ventilated heat-retaining cover in place, it’s the most efficient barred airer I tested.Why we love itLakeland’s Dry:Soon Deluxe three-tier heated airer arrives ready to use. It took me only two minutes to unfold the tiers, position the cover, plug in the cable and switch it on. The airer is a handsome chrome rack on its own, but the light grey embroidered cover makes the whole thing look rather gorgeous.The bars warmed up faster than most of its rivals, reaching 27C within 30 seconds before maxing out at 50C. When I laid a 4kg load of damp T-shirts across them and closed the cover, the lot was dry in two hours. That’s no faster than a tumble dryer, but it’s much more energy-efficient, costing about 9p an hour compared with £1.11 for my tumble dryer.The Dry:Soon Deluxe has some excellent user-friendly details. In particular, a timer lets you set it to switch off in hourly increments up to 12 hours ahead, which is handy for leaving it on overnight without the risk of forgetting it in the morning. All Lakeland’s airers come with a three-year warranty compared with the basic statutory guarantees for most heated airers.It’s a shame that …this airer costs almost as much as a tumble dryer. Deluxe by name, deluxe by price. But it’s many times cheaper to run, and withenergy costs rising, £200+ may be worth spending to keep your bills down.Suitable for:families who want to give up their expensive tumble dryer habitAvailable drying space:21m (up to 36 hanging T-shirts)Dimensions (open):73 x 75 x 137cm (DWH)Dimensions (folded):10 x 75 x 137cm (DWH)Max capacity:15kgTime to dry small load:2 hoursRunning cost:9p/hourLakelandDry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer and cover£244.98£244.98 at LakelandWhat we loveDries almost as fast as a tumble dryer; has a timer and coverWhat we don’t loveIt’s expensive – and we’d like a much longer cableBest budget heated airer:Black+Decker heated winged clothes airerBlack+DeckerHeated winged clothes airerfrom£47.99£50 at B&Q£47.99 at AmazonWhat we loveCheap to buy and run; light to carry and easy to moveWhat we don’t loveNot big or powerful enough to dry a full load£50 at B&Q£47.99 at AmazonThe Black+Decker doesn’t get particularly hot, which helps if you have curious toddlers and delicate clothes. It still managed to dry my small load of T-shirts in an afternoon, and at £50 with a 10p-an-hour running cost, it’s a decent budget buy. It’s also one of the easiest airers to fold down and slip under the sofa when not in use.Why we love itThe Black+Decker winged airer has the smallest footprint in my test, taking up about 50 x 50cm on its beam supports, yet it boasts a capacity of 10kg when unfolded, thanks to its ironing board-style shape. It warmed up to 33C in its hottest spots and dried my small load of T-shirts in just over four hours, with a little help from me flipping them and moving them around.I also like that the wings fold inwards to double up the heat when drying thicker garments, albeit not very large ones, and the dryer is so light (about 3.5kg) that I could move it around using one hand.It’s a shame that …it warmed up slowly and failed to get hotter than 33C even after three hours. That’s great for delicates and damp towels, but not hot enough to dry thick fabrics.Suitable for:drying light fabrics and warming up towelsAvailable drying space:11m (up to 20 hanging T-shirts)Dimensions (open):54 x 148 x 93cm (DWH)Dimensions (folded):approx 54 x 100 x 20cm (DWH)Max capacity:10kgTime to dry small load:4 hours 15 minutesRunning cost:10p/hourBlack+DeckerHeated winged clothes airerfrom£47.99£50 at B&Q£47.99 at AmazonWhat we loveCheap to buy and run; light to carry and easy to moveWhat we don’t loveNot big or powerful enough to dry a full loadBest heated airer for fast drying:Minky SureDri heat pod drying systemMinkySureDri heat pod drying systemfrom£49.99£90 at Argos£49.99 at AmazonWhat we loveWorks with your existing clothes horse to speed up dryingWhat we don’t loveIt’s noisy and the unit is cumbersome to set upPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£90 at Argos£49.99 at AmazonHeat pods turn your old unheated airer into a heated version. This one has a waterproof cover that fits a standard three-tier clothes horse, plus an electric heater that sits underneath to fill the space with hot air.Why we love itMinky’s pod system is a damp-blitzing machine. Even on its lowest 360W setting, it was one of the fastest dryers in my tests, because the heater and cover combo kept in the hot air. I measured the highest setting as using 915W, which cost 25p an hour, and it dried a large 8kg load within three hours. That’s as fast as a tumble dryer, but with less damage to your electric bill, or indeed to your clothes.At £90 RRP, the Minky isn’t quite a bargain buy, but I love that it brings hot new life to your existing clothes horse. If the cover doesn’t fit yours, you can use a sheet with the Minky heater unit to much the same effect.It’s a shame that …drying clothes with the Minky is more of a faff than with barred heated airers. First, you have to set up the pod, then you have to put up with the noise. The cover also makes it fiddly to check your clothes while they’re drying.Suitable for:work clothes and school uniforms that need a fast laundry turnaroundAvailable drying space:about 18m, depending on your clothes horseDimensions (heat pod unit):28 x 17 x 33cm (DWH)Max capacity:about 10kgTime to dry small load:1 hour 40 minutes (setting 1); 45mins (setting 3)Running cost:10p/hour (setting 1); 25p/hour (setting 3)MinkySureDri heat pod drying systemfrom£49.99£90 at Argos£49.99 at AmazonWhat we loveWorks with your existing clothes horse to speed up dryingWhat we don’t loveIt’s noisy and the unit is cumbersome to set upThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘A smart pick if you’re short on space’: the Aldi Ambiano winged heated airer.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDunelm XL 3-tier square heated airerDunelmXL 3-tier square heated airer£125£125 at DunelmWhat we loveOne of the few airers that’s big enough to dry a full loadWhat we don’t loveTakes up a sizeable chunk of space when unfoldedPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£125 at DunelmBest for:a never-ending cycle of laundry that needs constant accessThis huge, uncovered airer lets you get at your washing as it dries, so you can check, rearrange and replace items easily. It’s so big that I could lay an entire 4kg load of 10 T-shirts across the bars, and they dried in two hours at a cost of 22p. To save space, you can fold down half of the airer while it’s drying.It didn’t make the final cut because …this airer will be too big for many homes to accommodate.Available drying space:25m;dimensions (open):73 x 85 x 136cm (DWH);dimensions (folded):10 x 85 x 136cm (DWH);max capacity:25kg;time to dry small load:2 hours;running cost:11p/hourDunelmXL 3-tier square heated airer£125£125 at DunelmWhat we loveOne of the few airers that’s big enough to dry a full loadWhat we don’t loveTakes up a sizeable chunk of space when unfoldedDunelm 3-tier A-frame heated airerDunelm3-tier A-frame heated airer£100£100 at DunelmWhat we loveSmall but sturdy, with clever stands to dry soggy shoesWhat we don’t loveLacks the power to dry thick fabricsPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£100 at DunelmBest for:runners and dog walkers who need to dry soggy shoes and socksHeated shoe stands are a simple addition and work well on this airer, drying my thick walking socks faster than if I’d laid them across the bars. The A-frame design also makes this among the sturdiest smaller airers I tested, and it stood firm even when I threw a large load of washing at the top tier.It didn’t make the final cut because …my small 4kg load needed an unusually long five hours, even after I’d moved things around and flipped them over. I also hated risking my fingers in the metal-hinged supports each time I folded and unfolded the airer.Available drying space:17m, including shoe stands;dimensions (open):54 x 91 x 146cm (DWH);dimensions (folded):18 x 91 x 146cm (DWH);max capacity:15kg;time to dry small load:4 hours;running cost:10p/hourDunelm3-tier A-frame heated airer£100£100 at DunelmWhat we loveSmall but sturdy, with clever stands to dry soggy shoesWhat we don’t loveLacks the power to dry thick fabricsArgos Home 3-tier heated airerArgosHome 3-tier heated airer£105£105 at ArgosWhat we loveSurprisingly powerful for one of the smallest airers on testWhat we don’t loveToo dinky for a family load, and a little unsteadyPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£105 at ArgosBest for:solo households and small living spacesArgos’s three-tier airer took several minutes to heat up and maxed out at a reasonable 45C – hot enough to dry my small load in four and a half hours (after a bit of rearranging). The pivoted frame makes it feel less sturdy than airers with feet at each corner, but it’s a breeze to fold and unfold.It didn’t make the final cut because …the Argos Home airer feels less robust than similarly priced rivals.Available drying space:17m;dimensions (open):73 x 70 x 144cm (DWH);dimensions (folded):13 x 70 x 144cm (DWH);max capacity:15kg;time to dry small load:4 hours 20 minutes;running cost:9p/hourArgosHome 3-tier heated airer£105£105 at ArgosWhat we loveSurprisingly powerful for one of the smallest airers on testWhat we don’t loveToo dinky for a family load, and a little unsteadyAldi Ambiano winged heated airerAldiAmbiano winged heated airer£34.99£34.99 at Aldi (in store only)What we loveIdeal for drying underwear, then folding away quicklyWhat we don’t loveNot big or powerful enough to dry a full loadPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£34.99 at Aldi (in store only)Best for:small living spaces and limited budgetsAldi’s Ambiano-branded airer is the cheapest I tested and well worth a trip to the shops – but Aldi isn’t kidding with that “while stocks last” label. After waiting for a restock, I finally tested this bargain airer on the coldest days of January, and it performed almost as well as the more widely available Black+Decker winged airer. With the free cover in place and a bit of rearranging halfway through, it dried my small load in just over four hours. It’s a smart pick if you’re short on space because it folds down easily to merely 6cm high for slipping under a bed or chest of drawers when not in use.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s not powerful enough to dry a full load on a cold day without resulting in stinky slow-dried clothes, as with the Black+Decker and Argos three-tier models here. However, it will dry a few items laid flat – especially if you fold in the wings to double up the heat.Available drying space:12m;dimensions (open):54 x 148 x 83cm (DWH);dimensions (folded):54 x 94 x 6cm (DWH);max capacity:10kg;time to dry small load:4 hours 15 minutes;running cost:6p/hourAldiAmbiano winged heated airer£34.99£34.99 at Aldi (in store only)What we loveIdeal for drying underwear, then folding away quicklyWhat we don’t loveNot big or powerful enough to dry a full loadGlamHaus digital electric clothes airerGlamHausDigital electric clothes airerfrom£129.99£131.99 at Robert Dyas£129.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThis large airer’s open design gives you easy accessWhat we don’t loveTouch display is fiddly, and initial setup could be easierPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£131.99 at Robert Dyas£129.99 at AmazonBest for:sizeable wardrobes that contain delicate fabricsThis is one of the biggest and most feature-rich airers I tested, with a ventilated cover, timer and digital temperature controls that I found fairly easy to use. The top setting reached nowhere near the claimed 70C but did manage 52C in places, and I love having the lower-temperature settings for drying flimsy fabrics on the bars. You can attach peg hangers to dangle your smalls in the heat, but they don’t allow much dangle room. As with all the airers I tested, you get a much quicker dry if you lay items across the bars.It didn’t make the final cut because …it doesn’t dry clothes quite as fast as the Dry:Soon Deluxe, and it’s a right old jigsaw to put together the first time you use it. After that, though, I found it easy to open and close.Available drying space:30m;dimensions (open):73 x 70 x 147cm (DWH);dimensions (folded):15 x 70 x 147cm (DWH);max capacity:25kg;time to dry small load:3 hours 30 minutes;running cost:9p/hourGlamHausDigital electric clothes airerfrom£129.99£131.99 at Robert Dyas£129.99 at AmazonWhat we loveThis large airer’s open design gives you easy accessWhat we don’t loveTouch display is fiddly, and initial setup could be easierBlack+Decker X-frame heated airerBlack+DeckerX-frame heated airer£84£84 at DunelmWhat we loveUnfolds in seconds and looks smartWhat we don’t loveThere’s not enough room to dry a full loadPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£84 at DunelmBest for:good looks, and super-quick folding and unfoldingAll the other airers I tested required some kind of setup, either when you get it out of the box or – in most cases – each time you want to use it. But this stylish Black+Decker model unfolds in an instant, and is ready for action straight out of the box. Open up the hinged “X” shape, plug it in, press the red button and load it with laundry. It then takes five minutes to reach its maximum heat of 38C, certainly not the hottest in my test, but warm enough to dry a small load of T-shirts in two hours. It’s then supremely quick and easy to fold away again.I didn’t find much use for the little hammock attachment, which is supposed to be for your underwear. All my undies dried much faster when I dangled them from the bars. Fast-drying items, such as tea towels, also dried fast enough when dangling, but T-shirts and other clothes had to be laid across several bars to get them dry.It didn’t make the final cut because …it looks quite big, but this airer has much less flat drying space than tiered airers, so it won’t dry a full load of washing.Available drying space:11.5m;dimensions (open):57 x 71 x 126cm (DWH);dimensions (folded):57 x 7.5 x 144cm (DWH);max capacity:10kg;time to dry small load:3 hours 30 minutes;running cost:10p/hourBlack+DeckerX-frame heated airer£84£84 at DunelmWhat we loveUnfolds in seconds and looks smartWhat we don’t loveThere’s not enough room to dry a full loadBeldray winged heated clothes airerBeldrayWinged heated clothes airerfrom£49.99£49.99 at Beldray£49.99 at AmazonWhat we loveDries all your socks and pants in a couple of hoursWhat we don’t loveNot powerful enough to dry large itemsPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£49.99 at Beldray£49.99 at AmazonBest for:drying a week’s worth of undiesBeldray’s 230W winged airer is a good buy at £50, but don’t expect it to dry a week’s worth of laundry. Hanging clothes from its 18 bars doesn’t dry them fast enough to avoid mild stinkiness, and there wasn’t enough room to lay more than four of my T-shirts across the bars. It blazed through underwear, though. The bars get surprisingly warm given the airer’s modest 230W power rating, so it made fast work of my damp socks, knickers and boxer shorts, as long as I gave each item its own spot on the bars. It folds up small for storage, too, although you have to wrestle the heated bars off the X-frame stand – not something I managed without a little light swearing.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s a great helper, but not big or powerful enough to dry a load of clothes.Available drying space:12m 40cm;dimensions (open):54 x 148 x 91cm (DWH);dimensions (folded):54 x 105 x 7.5cm (DWH);max capacity:15kg;time to dry small load:3 hours 30 minutes (all small items);running cost:6p/hourBeldrayWinged heated clothes airerfrom£49.99£49.99 at Beldray£49.99 at AmazonWhat we loveDries all your socks and pants in a couple of hoursWhat we don’t loveNot powerful enough to dry large itemsDunelm heated ladder airerDunelmHeated ladder airer£40£40 at DunelmWhat we loveCheap to run and looks rather handsomeWhat we don’t loveFar too small for a laundry load, or even large itemsPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian£40 at DunelmBest for:keeping in the hallway to dry damp socks, shoes and glovesThe smallest airer in my test and by far the cheapest to run, Dunelm’s 90W aluminium ladder uses a mere 2p an hour under the 1 January energy price cap, and takes up very little space. Its plastic feet are a pain to attach and add about half a square metre to its footprint, so I used it without the feet, and found that it worked perfectly fine (and looked better, to my taste) when leaning up against the wall. A great little gizmo for taking the soggy edge off hand towels, tea towels or even rained-on hats and gloves.It didn’t make the final cut because …feet on or off, it’s not big or powerful enough to dry a load of washing.Available drying space:3m;dimensions (with feet):53 x 34 x 87cm (DWH);max capacity:5kg;time to dry small load:3 hours 30 minutes;running cost:2p/hourDunelmHeated ladder airer£40£40 at DunelmWhat we loveCheap to run and looks rather handsomeWhat we don’t loveFar too small for a laundry load, or even large itemsWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianHeated clothes airers are such a simple and smart idea that it’s weird they haven’t been around longer. They’re wildly popular, too: I waited four months to testAldi’s winged heated airerbecause there were none left in the warehouse within days of it going on sale last September. But do they deserve the hype – and how can you get the best out of yours?How much do heated airers cost to run?Minimal running cost is the biggest selling point of heated airers. Their packaging bears promises that they’ll dry your clothes for as little as 6p an hour, dramatically undercutting all rival methods other than blazing sunshine. Really? Yes, in some cases, at least until jumps in energy prices piled on the pennies.Even under energy prices of autumn 2024, when I first tested most of these airers, 6p an hour was a little optimistic. I found that standard barred airers, running at about 320W, worked out at 7p an hour in September 2024 and 9p an hour now.Most heated airers take a full afternoon or more to dry a load of washing, and those 9p hours will add up. Airers that dry clothes faster, such as the fan-heater-based Minky SureDri, cost more to run. At 915W, the SureDri now costs about 25p an hour, adding up to 75p to dry a load.That’s still significantly cheaper than running a tumble dryer or, indeed, a washing machine. Under January 2026 energy prices, a tumble dryer running at 3kW costs 83p an hour to run, and it can cost even more to switch on the central heating.How long do clothes take to dry with a heated airer?A standard T-shirt, laid flat and unfolded across several bars of a 300-320W barred heated airer, should dry in about two hours. If you’re drying a whole load of clothes, though, it’ll take a whole afternoon – or about eight hours if the air feels cold or humid. You will need to flip and rearrange items during this time to give the fabric equal access to the bars.Airers that contain a fan heater dry clothes more quickly. The fastest-drying airer in my test, the Minky SureDri, blew out enough hot air to dry my small load of washing in less than two hours. With a large load, I found it easier to halve it and dry it in batches.Can you leave them on all night?An hour or two on a heated airer won’t make a dent in the dampness of your jumpers or thick towels. Overnight would do it – but is it safe? The good news is that a 300W airer uses about the same amount of electricity as a fridge freezer, so yes, you can leave your clothes to dry while you snooze. Gentle warmth in the room is a lovely bonus.But while barred airers are safe to leave on overnight, as confirmed by brands including John Lewis, Lakeland and retailer Direct365, be more cautious with the fan heater type. The 915W Minky SureDri packs just below half the wattage (and noise) of a tumble dryer, and I certainly wouldn’t leave one of those on overnight or while I’m out.How can you make clothes dry faster on a heated airer?There are ways you can speed up the drying process. My best tip is to ignore the marketing photos that show airers draped like Christmas trees, with clothes hung from every bar. As I discovered while running this test, your clothes simply won’t dry that way unless it’s a warm day, which rather defeats the point. Instead, lay individual items across the bars.Covered airers cut drying times by almost half, but you can achieve a similar result by throwing a fitted sheet over the top, as long as there’s a gap for moist air to escape. Whatever cover you use, I’d recommend removing it as soon as your clothes are dry. Covers are vented to avoid condensation, but I found that some moisture crept back in if I left my clothes inside.However powerful your airer, always spin your clothes to remove as much water as possible before laying them on it. Wet clothes won’t dry, and water and electricity are not a happy combination.On that note, don’t use a heated airer in the bathroom. Electric peril aside, bathroom air is notoriously damp. I had the best results when using my test airers in the bedroom with the window ajar – and the faint fabric softener scent was a sweet bedtime bonus.Do heated airers make your house damp?When you dry clothes on any warm surface, whether it’s a heated airer or a radiator, the moisture rises from the clothes – to where? I asked a range of experts about this, and they broadly agreed that the key is to let the moist air escape from your home.“It’s not the drying method alone but the combination of moisture and lack of ventilation that leads to damp problems,” says Dr Anastasia Mylona, technical director at the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. “You can manage this by ensuring good ventilation when drying clothes indoors; for example, by opening windows or using extractor fans.”A dehumidifier can help avoid damp, as well as speed up the drying process, says cleaning expert Nancy Emery of bathroom retailerDrench. “If you’re investing in a heated airer, my advice is to invest in a dehumidifier as well, and always run them together.”The best dehumidifiers: 14 favourites to beat damp and cut bills, testedRead moreI’ve found heated airers much less likely than radiators to cause damp walls, and property expert Phil Spencer explains why. “Airflow is key, so if you want to use a heated airer, put it in the middle of the room rather than next to the wall,” says Spencer, who, among other things, has founded the property advice websiteMove iQ. “This is why heated airers are preferable to wall-mounted radiators.”However, radiators can heat up the room, and heated airers can’t, at least not significantly. That’s an important factor in the battle against damp, says Emery. “Maintaining your home’s temperature above 18C helps because condensation can’t settle on warmer surfaces.”I put these tips to the test usingan affordable humidity meter. I measured the moisture in my spare room’s air before doing any laundry, and then again at various stages of drying a medium load on a large heated airer – with and without opening the windows and using a dehumidifier.It had rained all week, so perhaps it’s no surprise that my house boasted a base humidity level of 70%, 10% higher than the recommended UK maximum. Iwassurprised, though, when this only rose to 72% once I’d loaded the airer with damp clothes. Running my dehumidifier brought the room’s humidity down to 70%. When I opened the windows, it dropped to 65% – even before the load was completely dry. I’ve now defaulted to leaving the windows open whenever possible, whether or not I’m drying clothes.“Opening windows regularly is the best way to allow humid air to escape, though it may seem counterintuitive in colder weather,” says Nicholas Donnithorne, UK technical services manager at Rentokil Property Care. “Leave quarterlights ajar or trickle vents open. Dehumidifiers can help, but they require regular emptying and aren’t a substitute for proper ventilation.”For more autumn and winter home essentials, read the Filter’s guides to:The best electric blankets and heated throwsThe best electric heaters, testedJane Hoskyn is afeatures journalist and WFH pioneer with three decadesof experiencein rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.

It’s not for everyone, I know, and it’s important to talk to your doctor first, but the benefits are well researched and include improveddigestionand immune function, and loweredblood pressure. When we fast, the body goes into ketosis, which breaks down fat for energy, and to stay in ketosis afterwards it helps to reduce carbs and increase protein, which is where today’s low-carb, zero-waste recipe comes in.Grain-free cauliflower and almond “risotto” with crisp cauliflower leavesThe humble cauliflower has had a rebrand over the past decade, as chefs and home cooks get more inventive with our seasonal produce. The leaves are incredibly nutritious and one of my favourite ingredients, not least because I always try to include a leafy green in our main meals for the health benefits. I’ll often steam or boil cauliflower greens along with any tough stems finely sliced. They’re also delicious fried or roasted to make cauli chips, as I’ve done here.The “risotto” is made by ricing the cauliflower first by shaving it with a knife so the florets crumble into rice-like pieces. You can also pulse-blend the florets and stem into a rice-like consistency, but I find the process of shaving quite therapeutic. There’s something satisfying about gliding a knife over the soft edge of the cauliflower. To add crunch and extra protein, I’ve added lots of flaked almonds. To keep the texture interesting, I fry the cauliflower quickly so it doesn’t get too soft. Serve topped with more toasted almonds and the crisp cauliflower leaves, leaving nothing to waste.Serves41 whole cauliflower(about 700g), including leaves4 tbsp olive oil1 onion, peeled and finely diced2 celery sticks, trimmed and finely diced200g flaked almonds300ml vegetable stock, or water200ml double cream, or 200ml extra stock (or water)100g grated hard cheese(grana padano, parmesan or similar), plus extra to servePull the leaves off the cauliflower, then cut off any thick stems and finely slice them across the grain. Put two tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat, then fry the cauliflower leaves, sliced stems and 50g flaked almonds for a few minutes, until crisp and golden brown. Lift out with a slotted spoon.Using a sharp knife, shave off the cauliflower florets a few millimetres at a time, so they fall off looking a bit like rice. Work all the way down to the stalk, then finely chop the stalk and add to the cauliflower “rice”.Return the pan to a medium heat, add the remaining two tablespoons of oil, then saute the diced onion and celery until translucent. Add the remaining flaked almonds and stir for a minute, until lightly toasted. Tip in the cauliflower, stir-fry for three minutes, then add the stock and cream, turn up the heat to high and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook, stirring, until the cauliflower absorbs all the liquid. Stir in the grated cheese, season to taste and serve topped with the crisp cauliflower leaves and almonds and with extra grated cheese on the side.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteVegetablesMain courseWinter food and drinkCheesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I also love matcha (and not only for its health-supporting benefits). Though my partner doesn’t enjoy drinking matcha tea, when I mix it into the sweetness of the coconut filling, even he’s on board. Then, a very munchable and grabbable savoury granola, and flapjacks that you can throw together in minutes for a week’s worth of on-the-go snacks.Bounty bars with matcha (pictured top)If I’m in a rush and don’t want to be individually dipping 24 chocolate bars, sometimes I put the coconut matcha mix in a large, wide tin to set, then simply drizzle the melted chocolate layer on top and chill. Once that’s set, cut into squares. Well, it saves time!Prep5 minCook30 minChill30 min+Makes24 bars200g barcreamed coconut6 tbsp coconut oil3 tbsp maple syrup, or runny honey1 tsp vanilla extract1½ tsp good-quality matcha powder1 pinch sea salt150g desiccated coconut200g dark chocolate(more than 65% cocoa is ideal), roughly brokenFlaky sea salt, to sprinkle (optional)Line a 20cm square baking tin with baking paper. If it’s a cold day, put the unopened bar of creamed coconut in a bowl of warm water (massage the packet to help it melt). Once it’s soft all the way through, pour into a bowl and mix with the coconut oil, which, if it’s hard, will melt once it connects with the warm creamed coconut. Add the maple syrup, vanilla, matcha, salt and, if you prefer a softer centre, two to four tablespoons of water.Stir in the desiccated coconut until the mix comes together into a doughy consistency, then pour into the lined tin, pressing it down with the back of a spoon so it sits evenly. Put in the fridge for 15-30 minutes until set (alternatively, if you’re in a rush, pop it in the freezer for 10 minutes).Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of barely simmering water.Turn out the set coconut-matcha mix on to a board and cut into 24 bars. Using two forks, dip each bar in the melted chocolate, then transfer to a large oven tray lined with baking paper. Put in the fridge for 15-30 minutes, until the chocolate sets. Sprinkle each bar with a little flaky salt if you like, and enjoy. Once made, the bars will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks, or freeze (defrost before eating, so you don’t chip a tooth!).Savoury granola with soy sauce, rosemary, nuts and seedsView image in fullscreenThis is delicious in sandwiches or wraps, such as hummus and roast veg, or on top of avocado toast; you could also sprinkle it on shop-bought salads or soups for extra fibre and good fats.Prep5 minCook25 minMakesAbout 450g2 tspsmoked paprika, or ground harissa spice blend4 tbsp olive oil200g rolled porridge oats1 tsp dried rosemary, or 2 tsp fresh rosemary leaves, chopped100g mixed nuts(I use cashews and almonds), roughly chopped100g mixed seeds(I use pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds)1 good pinch sea salt1small pinch chilli flakes1 tbsp soy sauce, or tamari1 tbsp maple syrupTo make this in the oven, heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5.Mix all the ingredients in a bowl, spread them out on a large baking tray, and bake for 15-20 minutes, stirring once halfway. Remove and leave to cool completely – don’t stir the granola yet.Alternatively, cook it in a frying pan. Put a large, deep-sided frying pan on a medium heat and fry the paprika in the olive oil for a minute. Add all the remaining ingredients apart from the soy sauce and maple syrup, give everything a good stir and fry for 10 minutes more, stirring once halfway. Keep an eye on the pan, and if need be give it a stir or lower the heat.Pour in the soy sauce and maple syrup, which will get the mixture bubbling, then stir and fry for a final few minutes. Take off the heat and leave the granola to cool for 10 minutes. Have a taste and see if you want to add more sea salt. Once you’re happy, transfer to a jar with a lid or to smaller snack-size containers to pop in a gym bag or to take to work. Once made, the granola will keep in a container with a tight-fitting lid for two weeks.Five-ingredient flapjacksView image in fullscreenThese take about eight minutes to put together and are super-satisfying as an on-the-go afternoon snack. You could swap the almond butter for cashew butter; peanut butter is great, too (and tends to be less expensive, if slightly drier). You could also swap the raisins for sultanas, dried cherries, dates, figs or apricots – just chop them small.Cook25 min, plus coolingMakes8100g smooth almond butter120ml maple syrup, or runny honey200g porridge oats2 tsp ground cinnamonA large handful of raisinsHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.In a medium saucepan on a low heat, combine the almond butter and maple syrup, then take off the heat and stir in the oats, cinnamon and dried fruit.Line a small, roughly 12cm x 12cm baking dish with baking paper, allowing for some overhang. Use a spatula to transfer the flapjack mix to the dish, then use the overhanging paper to press it down to make sure it’s smooth and even. Be sure no dried fruit is poking out of the top, as it may get crisp or burned in the oven.Bake for 15 minutes, until lightly golden on top (remember it will continue to cook as it cools), then remove and leave to cool for 15 minutes. Slice into eight flapjacks and enjoy, or store in a container with a tight-fitting lid for up to a week.Melissa Hemsley is the author of Real Healthy: Unprocess Your Diet with Easy, Everyday Recipes, published by Ebury Publishing at £26.

But one unusual case prompted me to reconsider the role of memory, and a traumatic experience that had affected me for yearsMalcolm KemptWed 21 Jan 2026 01.55 ESTShareIspent nearly 20 years working as a criminal defence lawyer in the remote communities of the CanadianArctic. Nunavut – roughly the size of western Europe – is home to fewer than 40,000 people, most of whom are Inuit. The brief summers boast endless days, while polar night descends over long winters where temperatures occasionally drop as low as -50C. Despite the lack of urban centres and a small, homogenous population, the territory records one of the highest violent-crime rates per capita in the world.There are no roads connecting Nunavut’s 26 communities. Aircraft is the only option, except for a brief ice-free window in late summer when supplies and fuel can be delivered by boat. Several times a year, the justice system arrives: a travelling circuit court sets up a temporary courtroom in local gymnasiums or community halls for three to four days.I handled many tragic and strange cases over the course of two decades, but one stands out. Early in my career, I represented a young Inuit man charged with firing a rifle at a parked car filled with innocent passengers. Several sober, reliable witnesses gave articulate, seemingly unembellished statements. They said they had seen the accused leave his house with a rifle, walk towards the vehicle, and open fire – shattering several windows and terrorising the people inside. Miraculously, no one was seriously injured.When I interviewed him in a holding cell, my client adamantly denied firing a gun, despite all the evidence against him. Police reports suggested that the car’s glass bore damage consistent with bullets, and further witness statements detailed loud gunshots and the pungent odour of gun smoke. It looked to be an open and shut case. Things were not, however, as they appeared.It is standard practice in firearms cases in Canada for the weapon to be sent for forensic analysis. The report arrived late, shortly before the hearing. It revealed that not only had the gun not been fired recently, it had never been fired at all. It was completely inoperable. It turned out that the accused had actually used an old, broken rifle from his porch like a baseball bat to smash out the windows. The more serious charges of discharging a firearm and endangering lives, which carried lengthy jail terms, were dropped.We rely on our senses and memory to define ourselves, but the brain is not a perfect instrumentI realised that day just how malleable our reality can be. We rely on our senses and memory to define ourselves and navigate our lives, but the brain is not a perfect instrument. Confidence does not always equal accuracy. The witnesses had not fabricated their accounts; they truly believed they had seen an angry man point a gun at them and shoot. Their fear was very real. Yet that fear impaired their senses and, over time, their memories were reshaped by a yearning to make sense of their trauma, and the subtle influences of others.Over the years I spent doing criminal trial work, I saw genuine belief at odds with reality again and again. But this was the first time it shook me. It not only caused me to be wary of the reliability of eyewitness evidence, but it also made me question my understanding of my own life.When I was much younger, I had survived a near‑drowning. Two malicious older boys prevented me from getting out of a deep area of a pond, forcing me to tread water for too long. I went under, inhaled a large amount of water, and had to be rescued. I never spoke about the incident with anyone.View image in fullscreenMalcolm Kempt in Nunavut, Canada, by the remains of a ship built for Roald Amundsen’s second expedition to the Arctic.Photograph: Courtesy of Malcolm KemptThroughout my life, I would occasionally wake in the middle of the night gasping for breath, tangled in sweaty sheets and seized by panic and lingering sensations of drowning. Instead of confronting it through therapy, I spent my life defiantly challenging water. I scuba‑dived around the globe, surfed in South America, swam long distances on reckless dares, and free‑dived in the frigid North Atlantic until the darkness and cold became unbearable. Water became an adversary. Whenever I was alone and saw a large body of water, I stared into its depths, feeling its pull, and then dared it to take me a second time. I told myself I was being resilient, but ultimately, it was an unhealthy approach.It wasn’t until a particularly dark period just before the pandemic that I sought help. With a psychiatrist, I revisited the drowning episode from countless angles over many months. Through these sessions, I began to see the same frailties of eyewitness recollection also at work inside me. The details of the near drowning were a blurred mess of intense emotions, physical sensations and visual flashes, and yet I had let them negatively impact my life as if they were immutable.During one session, I sat with my eyes closed, describing the incident – the crushing pressure in my chest and the sensation of my feet flailing for solid ground. The psychiatrist noticed that my shoes rested on the chair’s rungs and gently told me to place them on the floor. I rarely cried in my life, but in that moment, I sobbed uncontrollably.Following that session, I emerged as a new person. I spent months doing breathwork and consciously editing the traumatic experience into a version where I could always breathe and my feet were firmly on the ground. The night terrors ended, and my overall mental health improved dramatically.William Burroughs, a teenage hero of mine, once said: “Everything is recorded, and if it is recorded, then it can be edited.” Just as the forensic report forced me to question the reliability of human memory and perception, therapy forced me to question what I thought I knew about my own trauma. I learned that we can rewrite the terrible parts of our history. We can learn to react differently to triggers and move beyond self-imposed limitations. We can be the authors of our own lives.A Gift Before Dying by Malcolm Kempt is published 22 January by John Murray Press (£22). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

This is, essentially, the total cost of borrowing over 12 months, shown as a percentage of the amount you have borrowed. It takes fees into account, as well as interest. The rate should give you an idea of how much you will have to pay back on top of the money you want to borrow.Usually, the APR is described as “representative”. This means the advertised rate is given to at least 51% of people who are approved. However, the rate you are charged may be different depending on your credit score. In December, the average credit card purchase APR stood at 35.7%.Get a 0% transfer dealIf you have debt sitting on acredit card, a 0% balance transfer deal offers a way to cut the interest you pay. You use the new card to pay off an existing card, and the transferred balance sits on the new card at 0% interest for a set period.The average 0% balance transfer term hit a three-year high of 585 days (19 months) in December, according to the financial data firmMoneyfacts. There were 64 credit cards offering introductory 0% balance transfer deals.Cards offering longer interest-free deals tend to have an upfront fee. The average charge is 2.51%, but you can typically expect to pay more for a lengthy 0% term.Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts, says: “The market has seen a stark improvement to interest-free terms, now about 70 days longer than a year ago.”But it is not all good news. “Over the past 12 months,” she says, “the average balance transfer fee has risen from 2.44% to 2.51%.”View image in fullscreenTSB is offering a 0% transfer deal for 38 months with a 3.49% fee.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianA recent survey by the banking trade bodyUK Financefound that nearly half of credit card users were paying interest. With the average debt put at £2,660, this could be cleared using a 0% balance transfer card in two years if someone repaid £115 every month. However, based on the current average fee of 2.51%, the cost of moving £2,660 on to an interest-free card would be £66.77.At the time of writing, Compare the Market’s best deal was a TSB card offering 0% for 38 months (then 24.9% APR) with a 3.49% fee. If you don’t need that long, it had an exclusive deal with Barclaycard with 15 months at 0% (then 24.9% APR) with no fee and £20 cashback. For individuals with a poor credit history, Capital One had 23 months at 0% (then 27.9% APR) with a 2.9% fee.Check your creditA good place to start is an eligibility calculator. These can be found on sites such as MoneySavingExpert or Compare the Market and will show products you are likely to be accepted for, before you apply, so your research won’t affect your credit score.Charlie Evans, a money expert at Compare the Market, says: “Acceptance could be tougher to secure if your credit score has dipped, but an eligibility checker can help you see offers you’re likely to be accepted for.”Experts advise that you pick the card with the lowest fee, with an interest-free window long enough to clear the debt. “Clearing the balance before the 0% period ends is important, as rates can jump sharply afterwards,” says Evans.Spread the costIf you want to borrow for a big purchase, such as a sofa, or to help with a house move, weigh up the merits of using a credit card over a personal loan. A loan is likely to have a lower interest rate, though most banks won’t lend less than £1,000, or for fewer than 12 months.A credit card with an introductory interest-free period on new spending can keep costs down. But when the deal ends, if you still owe money, it will attract interest at the card’s standard rate.View image in fullscreenIt is worth considering whether to buy big items such as sofas using a personal loan.Photograph: Laura Fish/AlamySarah Coles, the head of personal finance at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, says you need “a foolproof plan for repaying it in full, and on time, to avoid racking up interest”.Moneyfacts data shows that the average interest-free purchase term has lengthened in the past year – by about 30 days – to 291, and there are about 60 credit cards to choose from. Again, use an eligibility checker and opt for the longest 0% period available. At the time of writing there were 0% purchase cards from TSB, Lloyds and Marks & Spencer that offered a 25-month promotional period.Choose travel perksReward cards offer a way to bank air miles, loyalty points or cashback. On travel-focused cards, you earn air miles that can be converted into money off flights (although you will still need to pay taxes and charges).Nicky Kelvin, the head of the travel advice website The Points Guy, says people need to read up on welcome bonuses, rules and benefits offered as they differ greatly: “There are significant bonuses on cards like American Express Platinum, which comes with travel insurance and hundreds of pounds in credits.” It has a £650 annual fee, but may still “make sense for those who travel often”. American Express Gold card is a good starter, as it is fee-free for the first year.View image in fullscreenSome British Airways American Express cards offer discounts on the number of Avios points needed to book flights.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesDespite a £300 annual fee and 136.4% APR, British Airways American Express Premium Plus is popular due to the valuable companion voucher which, he says, is “one of the best benefits in the UK credit card rewards world”. When you cash in your Avios to book a flight, the voucher effectively enables you to book two seats for the points of one. If you go solo, it entitles you to a 50% discount on the Avios required for a flight.For those who shop in places that do not accept Amex, Virgin Money and Barclays offer Mastercard products that earn Virgin Points and Avios, respectively.View image in fullscreenTesco Clubcard points can be converted into Virgin points.Photograph: True Images/AlamyTesco Clubcard points can be converted to Virgin points, and Nectar to Avios.MoneySavingExpertsays air miles cards are suited to higher spenders – an annual spend of more than £10,000 means you get the most out of it. If you are not a high roller, or don’t clear the balance each month, “high interest and account fees can dwarf rewards or sign-up bonuses”, it warns.Cashback or vouchers?If you would rather get cashback or vouchers, size up other reward cards. Lloyds Ultra credit card offers 1% cashback on all purchases in the first year (0.25% thereafter) and, unlike most cards, the amount you can earn is not capped.Coles injects a note of caution: “You need to be honest about your approach to debt. Some people are tempted to overspend because they see their credit limit as their own money rather than considering it as a liability. Some will overspend because they see the points as rewards, and want the quick win.”Explore more on these topicsCredit cardsMoney hacksConsumer affairsConsumer rightsCredit card feesBanks and building societiesBorrowing & debtBankingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the start of the year, the most activity I can manage is to pop on a podcast and haul myself into a bubble bath.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s a comfort that has made me an expert in every bath cream, foam and salt on the high street. I am practically incapable of passing a shelf without popping a new one in my trolley. And while I love a posh soak, there is something extra satisfying about using lavish amounts of product and enjoying a luxury-feeling bath without a drop of spender’s remorse.TakeBadedasBathGelee(£14.69), for example. Just under £15 for a 750ml bottle is not nothing, but you get a huge amount of bubble for your buck. And the aroma – room-filling, botanical – is so bracing as to be momentarily “ouch-y” in the most gratifying way. I’m never without a stock of it.There is something extra satisfying about using lavish amounts of a product without spender’s remorseIf sensitive skin means you prefer your fragrances a lot further from pine floor cleaner, I enthusiastically recommend my latest crush:M&S’s2-in-1 Shower Cream& Bath Milk(£7.50 for 400ml), from the consistently good Skinkind range. It is dermatologically tested and suitable for sensitive skin, and should calm and soothe fractious, itchy winter skin. This is also for you if you like a soft soak, moderately high on bubbles and low on fragrance (it smells like milky baby’s scalp to me, but you may not get a whiff of anything).A smell that could possibly be detected from a neighbouring town isImperial Leather’sCherry Blossom& Almond Oil Ultimate Moisture Bath Soak(just £3, or even less on offer, for 450ml). Millilitre for millilitre, this is astonishingly good value. I wouldn’t quite agree with the “ultimate moisture” tag, but I will gladly concede that it is no more drying than some bath creams that are five times the price. It has a marzipan and floral fragrance set against the retro and endlessly comforting Imperial Leather scent, and foams up sufficiently to craft a bubble beard that holds (my own highly scientific test of a bath foam’s performance). There’s a vanilla version too, if you prefer that.A golden oldie isSuperdrug’sVitamin E and Almond Moisturising Shower and Bath Cream(£3.89 for 500ml), in a helping so generous that you can pour it out with abandon for extra decadence. Foam here is generous, but not so abundant as to feel cheap or childish, and the fragrance – creamy, clean, ambrosial – is an unfailing crowd pleaser.Explore more on these topicsBeautySali Hughes on beautyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is home to90 of India’s billionaires, but also to more than six million slum dwellers,about 55% of central Mumbai’s population.Now Mumbai has a new symbol of the gulf between rich and poor: ahigh-speed, eight-lane motorwayon its western coast, which critics say serves only the wealthy despite being built with taxpayers’ money.The road was intended as a solution to the gridlocked roads of India’s commercial capital. ButMumbaiis a densely populated peninsula, 25 miles (40km) long and 6 miles wide, where land is as scarce as snow.The new coastal road had to be built on land reclaimed from the Arabian Sea. An engineering marvel, it connects north and south, and is a dream for car owners, who used to average about 5mph through Mumbai’s congestion.View image in fullscreenThe first phase of the Mumbai coastal road, which links the south and west of the city via the three-mile Bandra-Worli bridge.Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPAAt Marine Drive in the south where it starts, cars now dip down into an undersea tunnel for more than a mile and, after making great loops across the shimmering sea where the road is built on stilts, they emerge 6 miles away in Worli in 10 minutes instead of the 45 minutes it took previously.Butan estimated 64%of theMumbai metropolitan region’s 22.5 millionresidents travel by overcrowded buses and trains. Those unable to push inside cling to the outside as best they can. Seven to10 passengers die daily on the local train network.A map of Mumbai showing the recently-opened and under construction parts of the new coastal road plus other newly-built motorways in the networkThe new coastal motorway is part of a network of new roads across Mumbai“The road is exclusively for the elite,” says Avlokita Shah, an environmental activist. She adds that the billions it cost “should have been spent on public transport to benefit the majority – repairing roads, adding more buses with more stops and routes, and expanding the metro”.Hussain Indorewala teaches at the Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute for Architecture and Environmental Studies and calls the coastal road “welfare for the well-to-do”. “It represents a massive transfer of wealth to the rich and imposes costs on the rest,” says Indorewala.Praveen Shastri, who shines shoes at Churchgate railway station, shrugged when asked what he thought of the road. “What do I know about it?” he said.It’s lunchtime and the station is quiet. Come rush hour, the platforms will teem with commuters.“It’s not for people like me. My commute remains the same – never getting a seat on the train to Borivali where I live. At the end of a long day, it’s even more tiring getting home,” says Shastri.View image in fullscreenPeople gather on the coastal promenade after it opened to the public last August.Photograph: Nirmal G/GuardianVivek Tiwari, an investment banker, loves the new road for taking 45 minutes off his travel time. His office is in Nariman Point, the southernmost tip of the city, and home is 12 miles north in Bandra.“It’s an amazing piece of infrastructure and driving on it is glorious,” he says. “Not all infrastructure can be equally parcelled out among the rich and the poor. Yes, only a minority like me use the road but maybe it’s going to help us generate more economic growth ultimately, which will benefit everyone.”For Nikhil Anand, an environmental anthropologist at Pennsylvania University in the US, the idea of a motorway connecting different parts of Mumbai as a response to heavy traffic is not only elitist but outdated; “a 20th-century response to a 21st-century problem”, as he puts it.View image in fullscreenPedestrians on one of the few underpasses created to allow access to the coastal promenade for walkers, cyclists and joggers.Photograph: Nirmal G/GuardianUrban motorways are a discredited solution to traffic congestion, dating back to the 1960s when roads were built to connect different parts of congested American cities, ignoring the need for public transport infrastructure and forcing more people to buy cars.“This only served private car owners instead of building public transport and led to ‘induced demand’ for cars, resulting in more traffic,” Anand says. “More roads and cars benefit only a few, unlike public transport.“They worsen carbon emissions and, by removing the mangroves in the intertidal wetlands that line the coast, make Mumbai even more vulnerable than it already is to flooding.”During construction, critics and experts shouted themselves hoarse saying the reclamation would destroy the livelihoods of theKoli fishing community,theoriginal inhabitants of Mumbai’s coast. For generations, they have parked their boats on the beaches, dried their catch there, and repaired their boats and nets.View image in fullscreenConstruction of the new highway seen from the fishing village of Khar Dhanda.Photograph: Nirmal G/GuardianOn a grey, polluted evening, Deepak Namaposhe, 45, sits in his fishers’ shack on the beach at Khar Danda, his weather-beaten face lined with tension. In the pleasant sea breeze, boys fly kites or play cricket while men squat under tarpaulin sheets repairing green nets.In other parts of the coast where the road has been built, Namaposhe has seen how traditional fishing sites and breeding grounds have been lost, daily earnings halved, and costs almost doubled.How renamed streets in Mumbai’s slums are encouraging children to studyRead moreNow, the second phase of the road, which will connect it with the western suburbs farther north, is coming up. Through the distant haze, the piles being constructed are visible. His anxiety is that Khar Danda will suffer the same effects.“By what right can they take land where my father, grandfather and great-grandfather lived and fished? It’s our land. When the road is finished, we won’t be able to access the sea. We will have to go out the long way round, use double the time, double the diesel and still ending up with smaller catch,” he says.Waving his arm in the direction of the beach, Namaposhe says: “All this open space will go and builders will construct fancy apartment blocks for the rich.” He refuses to be photographed, saying the “builders’ lobby” is active in Khar Danda and he does not want to be labelled a troublemaker.View image in fullscreenDrivers have welcomed the motorway for slashing the time it takes to commute into the city, but most of its inhabitants do not use a car.Photograph: Nirmal G/GuardianThe coastal road is a godsend for builders and property developers who had fought over the scraps of land that become so rarely available in Mumbai. The reclaimed land for the road opens new large tracts for building the glass towers and luxury apartments worth billions of rupees.The road has distanced people from the ocean and the ocean is Mumbai’s most beautiful assetAnil Gaitonde, shopkeeperToday, Mumbai resembles a big construction site. Tower cranes fill the skyline. The unusually high levels of pollution are in part the result of the frenzied construction of high-rises, either on land freed up by demolishing old, low-rise buildings or land created along the coastal road.A “billionaires’ row” has risen up on the Worli seafront, with stunning, unobstructed views of the sea. The richest families have been buying up new homes at this desirable location.At Versova, Shah explains how the second phase of the road will connect Versova to Bhayander, farther north. Despite protests, the Bombay high court ruled in December that45,000 mangrove trees could be removedfor the project.“These mangroves act as a natural barrier against tidal surges and erosion. As it is, Mumbai is flooded every monsoon. Destroying mangroves that have developed over decades will also ruin the fragile ecosystem,” she says.View image in fullscreenThe new coastal road seen from the shoreline near Chimbai Village and Jogger’s Park in Bandra. The highway has made access to the beach more difficult for many.Photograph: Nirmal G/GuardianFor ordinary people, the road has led to another, less publicised, less visible and less tangible loss: easy access to the shoreline. The beauty of the ocean and the tranquillity it offered were invaluable and a rare free pleasure enjoyed by all classes in a thronged metropolis.After a long day at work, labourers, office workers, families and young couples could cross the road at various points – Haji Ali, Breach Candy, Worli – to walk the shore.Now, an eight-lane thoroughfare blocks the way. A few subways have been created to allow pedestrians and cyclists to access new promenades that have been created for walking, cycling and jogging but these are too few and involve long walks, especially for those already tired after a day’s work.“The road has distanced people from the ocean and the ocean is Mumbai’s most beautiful asset,” says Anil Gaitonde, a shopkeeper in Colaba.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentInequality and developmentMumbaiRoad transportIndiaInequalitySouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fossil is embedded in a limestone wall on Plantation Lane, sitting alongside the remnants of ancient nautiloids and squid-like belemnites. It’s a mineralised aquarium hiding in plain sight, a snapshot of deep time that few even glance at, a transtemporal space wherepatatas bravasmeet prehistoric cephalopods.How often do you give thought to the stones that make up our towns and cities? To the building blocks, paving slabs and machine-cut masonry that backdrop our lives? If your name’s Dr Ruth Siddall, the answer to that question would be yesterday, today and every day for the foreseeable. Her passion is urban geology, and it turns out that the architecture of central London – in common with many places – is a largely unwitting showcase of Earth science through the ages.View image in fullscreenRuth Siddall admires a wall made from 2bn-year-old dolerite from Zimbabwe in Euston, London.Photograph: Julie Hill“This is York stone,” she says, pointing at the slabs beneath our feet as we wander the pavements of Eastcheap. An e-scooter swishes past. “It’s a fine-grained sandstone, around 310m years old, quarried in the Peak District. It was once a prehistoric riverbed – you can still see the ripples in the surface – although to picture the world back then you need to imagine Sheffield looking like the Brahmaputra [river, which spans China, India and Bangladesh].”For Ruth, the city’s walkways, shop facades and statue plinths aren’t merely civic structures. They have epic stories to tellI’ve joined Ruth, a distinguished geologist and very affable company, on one of the walking tours she offers around different parts of the capital. Her own enthusiasm for street-level geology kickstarted in Athens in the early 1990s where, post-PhD, she was tasked with cataloguing a collection of rocks from Greek ruins. “It was essentially a big pile of rubble,” she smiles, “but it was an absolutely fascinating project. It got me hooked.”In the decades since – and drawing inspiration from her former colleague Eric Robinson, a pioneer of urban geology – she has seen her adopted home of London in a new light. For Ruth, the city’s walkways, shop facades and statue plinths aren’t merely civic structures. They have epic stories to tell, not only in terms of their social history but their material origins, too. “London is huge, but unlike some cities it has no local building stones of its own,” she says. “It’s basically in a basin of clay, so all the stones you see around us have had to come from elsewhere.”View image in fullscreenA column of anorthosite on Great Tower Street in the City.Photograph: Ben LerwillIt brings fresh meaning to the idea of a rock biography. Around 10 years ago, in partnership with a fellow geologist, Dave Wallis, Ruth helped to establishLondon Pavement Geology, a website and app that gives a free comprehensive list of sites of geological interest around the capital, and increasingly in other UK towns and cities too (my wishlist is currently topped by the lobe-finned fish suspended in Edinburgh’s Caithness flagstones). Her guided walks, offered through the longstanding tour companyLondon Walks(search for “geology”), will this year run on a roughly monthly basis, starting in spring.It’s a time-travelling, mind-boggling tour. We attract looks – if you peer at something considered unremarkable, people stare at youOver two hours, we come across sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks from places as disparate as Australia, Brazil and China, each stone type having been selected for its aesthetic value by the architects of the day. Outside a travel agency, Ruth identifies serpentinite, a Cretaceous stone from the Italian Alps. A pillar outside a pub turns out to be made of smooth 290m-year-old larvikite from Norway (magma that cooled kilometres beneath the surface of the planet, and, conveniently, easy to wipe down after a heavy night). And we linger over the Monument column, its Portland stone base crammed with Jurassic oyster shells and pitted with prehistoric shrimp burrows.It’s a time-travelling, mind-boggling tour. We attract looks – it transpires that if you peer at something usually considered unremarkable, people stare at you – but frankly, when you’re hurdling geological epochs at every corner, who gives a schist? The Monument itself, of course, commemorates the Great Fire of London, which more than any other event accelerated the use of stone architecture in the capital. The Romans were the first to import stone building blocks here, but it wasn’t until the restructuring of London began in the late 1660s that natural, hard-wearing materials became more commonplace.View image in fullscreenRuth Siddall points out an ammonite on Plantation Lane.Photograph: Ben LerwillThere’s nothing commonplace, however, about many of the stones we stop at. Near St Paul’s Cathedral – the steps of which hold 30cm-long fossilised orthocones (“They looked a bit like swimming carrots,” says Ruth) – the limestone exterior of a wine bar displays an even rarer find: a small vertebrate bone from 150m years ago. “Possiblya pterosaur,” she explains, “but we might never know.”Best of all, perhaps, is the co-working space we pass on Houndsditch, its exterior constructed of gneiss from a meteorite impact crater in South Africa. About 6,000 miles from its place of origin, the stone’s surface is still patterned with crack-like veins of black impact glass, which also contain traces of the meteorite’s extraterrestrial minerals. Oh, and it crashed to earth a mere 2bn years ago. Now there’s something to mull over when January feels like it’s going slowly.The walk was provided byLondon Pavement Geology.

But my life soon started to changeEmma RussellWed 21 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareWhen two balaclava-clad men on a motorbike mounted the pavement to rob me, recently, I remained oblivious. My eyes were pinned to a text message on my phone, and my hands were so clawed around it that they didn’t even bother to grab it. It wasn’t until an elderly woman shrieked and I felt the whoosh of air as the bike launched back on to the road that I looked up at all. They might have been unsuccessful but it did make me think: what else am I missing from the real world around me?Before I’ve poured my first morning coffee I’ve already watched the lives of strangers unfold on Instagram, checked the headlines, responded to texts, swiped through some matches on a dating app, and refreshed my emails, twice. I check Apple Maps for my quickest route to work. I’ve usually left it too late to get the bus, so I rent a Lime bike using the app. During the day, my brother sends me some memes, I take a picture of a canal boat, and pay for my lunch on Apple Pay. I walk home listening to music on Spotify and a long voice note from a friend, then I watch a nondescript TV drama, while scrolling through Depop and Vinted for clothes.I’m constantly contactable, I have no personal boundaries, and my attention span disappeared a long time ago. Since the first iPhone in 2007, smartphones have become indispensable to modern life, with the average person in the UK spendingfour hours and 20 minutesonline per day. “Social media provides frictionless access to an infinite universe of mostly free digital drugs,” says Anna Lembke, author of Dopamine Nation. “And the algorithm tailors the experience for each unique brain, making it very reinforcing, while also injecting just enough novelty in the infinite scroll to overcome boredom and tolerance. All these features combined keep us clicking and swiping long after we want to.” Over time we develop tolerance, which means “we need more of it and a more potent form to get the same effect.”Increased screen time has been associatedwith depression,anxietyandpoorer sleep. But is it possible to live lo-fi in a hi-tech world? For a month, I tried: swapping my iPhone for a Nokia which I can only use to text, call and play Snake; also, a Walkman and a film camera. I picked up physical copies of books, newspapers and magazines; I used a London A-Z for directions, and hunted down my physical bank cards or tried to use cash. The only screen time exception was for work, where from 9-5 I used my laptop to respond to emails and write.Day 1“You’re going to look like such a performative hipster,” my flatmate Ben says, as I’m setting up my new devices. He’s right. I leave the Walkman behind, but my bag is still heavier than usual with my book, notepad, A-Z and wallet. I haven’t taken the bus into work yet from my new home so I follow a hand-drawn map to the stop and run for a bus. I stupidly didn’t write down the bus number but that one sounds familiar. It’s not the one, two friendly strangers tell me, but I can swap on to another at Angel.“We’ve outsourced our memory to our phones,” says Nicholas Kardaras, author of Digital Madness and a former assistant clinical professor of psychology at Stony Brook University, New York. “And unfortunately the ease and comfort of being lubricated by technology just means our human skills atrophied. It is use it or lose it.”The bus is crawling. Normally, I would have looked up a different route. I try to message a friend back but it’s difficult having to click each button multiple times for the letter I want. “Hard work,” I manage. I read for the rest of the journey.Day 3On my lunch break, my sister and I go for a walk around the park. When she leaves me to do another lap, I have an urge to check Instagram and my emails but I’m only getting the odd SMS. I’m craving the back-and-forth WhatsApps with friends telling me fun facts about their day. I feel a little unsettled, but I try to focus on the changing leaves on the trees. I have thoughts that wouldn’t usually have the time to surface. How stressful.After work, I go to see the saxophone player cktrl at the ICA. I’m a little worried about collecting the tickets without access to the Dice app I bought them on, but I show them my passport instead. I would normally join the throngs of people filming a song or two, so I could upload some blurred clips with poor sound to social media to show that I had a great time. But I can’t, so I watch him play, undistracted. Then a flashlight glares behind me, as someone films an entire track. I vow never to be that annoying person again.Day 6My digital detox is starting to stress out my friends. Nicole finally gets through to me, saying: “I hate your dumb phone.” She’s been texting, but didn’t realise you had to click twice to make it send as an SMS not an iMessage. Another friend wants to share a dating story and texts: “Omg this is a terrible time not to access voice note.” And, when my landlord messages asking us to send pictures of the new carpet on WhatsApp, which I can’t do, Ben texts: “You’re going to be such a liability this month.”In the evening, my date sends me the address of a pub to meet him at “for your A-Z”. I allow lots of time to decipher its tiny font and navigate my way there. He’s running late, so I sit by the fireplace in the pub and read my book. I look like I’m waiting for someone to chat me up. When he arrives, he shows me how to turn on predictive text, which is a relief for my very tired thumbs.Day 8At lunchtime, I put on the terrestrial TV and watch Escape to the Country, where I learn about the housing market in Herefordshire. I want to cook myself an elaborate meal – for dinner, and also for entertainment, but when I get to the shops, I remember that I can’t look up a recipe on my phone, so I settle for tomato pasta.View image in fullscreen‘I hunted down my physical bank cards or tried to use cash.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDay 9My flatmate picked up a Nina Simone CD for me in a charity shop. I try to play it on my Walkman, but realise it needs batteries. On my lunch break I buy some (who knew there were so many sizes?) and walk home from the office listening to it. Spotify can be overwhelming with its hundred million tracks, so it’s nice to remove the element of choice and focus on the album as it was intended, not scrambled by shuffle mode. Rosanna Irwin, who runsSamsú– a collection of digital detox cabins in Ireland – knows the importance of analogue listening: she leaves her guests with cassette tapes she makes with her father. After reaching a state of burnout, working long hours in tech – first at Meta and later for a climate tech company – she visited the Danish island of Samsø with her husband in 2023, and found peace amid the scrappy phone service and incredible nature.“My mental health was very poor,” she says. “I was spending a lot of time online and I did an accidental digital detox on this island and came back invigorated from the experience.” She recommends a three-day retreat. “There’s a lot of science to show that it’s around 72 hours in nature where the true magic starts to happen.”Day 12I meet my friend at Vauxhall station, and we walk to a cafe for breakfast, then to Tate Britain. Camilla is pretty offline: she’s a doctor and doesn’t have social media. She rarely responds to texts and is maybe one of the most joyful people I know. But she says she feels so much guilt about not replying sooner and hates the fact that phones are like this ever-present person in the room, distracting you from being totally engaged with the real-life friends around you.The sentiment resonates with me; we both want to be more spontaneous.Inspired by our conversation, I call Aakriti, who doesn’t live too far away. I meet her and two of her friends and we eat empanadas. On the way home, I have to ask the only man on the platform for help. The overground isn’t due for 24 minutes, so I wonder if there is a faster route. There isn’t, so I shiver at the outdoor station wishing I could book an Uber.Day 13It’s tipping down with rain when I arrive at Canada Water, and I don’t want to ruin my A-Z to search for Rotherhithe Street. I know The Mayflower pub is on the river and ask a man at a convenience store to point me in the right direction. I’m early, so I squint at my book in the candle-lit pub, feeling very Victorian. There’s a hilarious waiter, who is telling dating stories from Grindr, and it’s much better than my book. This no-technology thing is making me nosy. I pay for my roast with cash, which feels almost fake now, like I’m in a game. Then my friend and I go to the cinema – the Picturehouse in central London, because it’s in between where we both live. They charge us £20 for a ticket, which I would never have paid had I known before we made the trip. I’m left fuming, but luckily the movie is good.Day 14I need to call the bank. My flatmate has sent rent money to my Monzo account, which I can only access on the app, and I get a text saying that I’ve gone into an unarranged overdraft. When I get to the tube in the morning, my Oyster card has run out, so I top up the credit and miss my train – I would usually have used a payment card on Apple Pay instead. I have to wait eight minutes for the next one.I’m flustered by the time I get to the office and feel stressed about not being able to check how much money is in my account or transfer money between accounts.Day 18There’s a group of children on a school trip on my train. The teacher is trying to keep them entertained by getting them to play a word association game. “When I say ‘bread’,” she says. “You could say, ‘sandwich’. Let’s have a go. ‘School,’” the teacher says. “Prison,” a child shouts back. When I arrive in Notting Hill, I study the map at the station to make sure I surface from the correct exit. I memorise key landmarks so I know where to turn – the Gate Cinema is by the road I need to get to Uxbridge Street. I’m late, and don’t have time for mistakes, so I start walking down the street quickly, scouring every restaurant until I find the Palestinian cafe I’m looking for.Day 21The worries I felt at the start of the experiment about getting lost and not being able to communicate with friends seem to have diminished. I’m calmer, and present when I’m with people. I look around the train on my morning commute and notice that everyone except one person has their eyes glued to their phones. The man opposite me doesn’t have earphones, a phone or a book. I try not to catch his eye, as I’m worried I’ve been staring. Things are less relaxed when I try to meet my friend Navid after work. We can’t pick a place to meet and he is frustrated because he can’t send me links: “Please return to WhatsApp you Neanderthal.” He’s late, so I wait outside the station for 45 minutes. He arrives with a big grin, knowing I’m a bit irritated, but I get my own back by torturing him with two hours of experimental jazz.View image in fullscreenEmma swapped her iPhone for a film camera.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDay 23After work, I go to see my friend Scarlett, who is being held captive by a corgi puppy. It’s dark and damp when I arrive in south-east London but I’ve written out the directions to the house as carefully as I can. I didn’t bring my A-Z because my bag was too heavy, but I’m certain I can’t mess up the 10-minute walk. I call my mum and we natter for 20 minutes before I realise I haven’t spotted the turning. In a panic, I ask her to look up my location on Google Maps, which is obviously cheating, but I’m now late and in the middle of a cemetery. I’ve gone completely the wrong way and she has to narrate the route to my destination.Day 27It’s been a busy weekend so far and I feel like having a lazy day. I walk to a yoga class and then go for a wander. As I’m walking, and listening to my one CD, I get a call from the guy I’m dating who has just finished work. We try to hunt down a board game to play, but when the local charity shops fail us, we pick up some newspapers and magazines and the ingredients for a roast chicken instead. We then sit on the sofa playing music and reading in the old fashioned way. It feels like we’ve retired.Day 30I finally get around to calling the bank to pay my rent, which is late for the first time. I’ve been putting off the inevitable 20-minute call that includes reading out lots of sort codes and bank numbers and spelling the names of my landlord along with the various friends I owe money to. It’s quite unnerving transferring money without checking the details with my own eyes, and the woman on the phone keeps telling me that it would be much easier to do this online.Day 31For all the frustrations of the month, I’m sad the experiment is over. I’m left with the feeling that living offline puts other people out: if we’re looking for a place to eat or a pub to go to it’s down to them, they’re on map duty, and I’m not able to book Ubers. But I was happier and calmer – relieved of the endless scrolling, waiting for texts back, and the need to communicate with people all the time. After about a week, I wasn’t reaching for my phone and I had the patience to read. It was nice not to be able to look at my work emails in the evening. I’m determined to delete my main distractions: Depop, Hinge and Instagram. Scouring charity shops for clothes is much more satisfying; dating with no distractions is so much easier; and I can live without reels about botched Botox and AI animals.“Big tech platforms are not addictive accidentally, they’re addictive by design,” says Kardaras. “They’re selling their product by targeting the vulnerable: if the algorithm detects that a young person has a body image issue or is struggling with self-harm or depression, then they bombard them with content on that subject that exacerbates their mental unwellness.” On my last day, I get an email from Scarlett: “Splashed my phone with water whilst listening to the Lily Allen album in the bath, now phoneless and actually want to copy you.” It seems I’m not the only one keen to disconnect.Explore more on these topicsSmartphonesMobile phonesSocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

A helicopter will not winch me out because my only injuries are the agonies of dodgy hips, screaming arm muscles and deeply wounded pride.And there are miles and days to go before I sleep again on a mattress with clean sheets and a pillow and luxuriate in a hot shower and can be propelled forward in ways that do not require the use of my arms.But I am stubborn too. And I have wanted to be here on the Franklin River for so long. In 1982, in the midst of the angry campaign to stop the damming of the Tasmanian river, my father took me to see Bob Brown talk. He screened a film about the river and I was captivated.The place that stayed with me: that afternoon in Orford, I belonged to the bush for the first timeRead moreI was a teenager, barely grown out of the free-range childhood I’d spent scrambling around the creek below my family home on the edge of the range in Toowoomba, Queensland, following it to a sheer-drop waterfall, maybe 10 metres high, which I scaled in bare feet. My kingdom: the moss and lichen and ferns, the tadpoles, the bowerbird’s nest. I whispered into tree hollows (too much Enid Blyton), climbed trees and jealously guarded the location of a secret cave.But somewhere along the way I lost myself. I forgot the moss and the ferns. High school, university, city living, holidays in foreign cities, years spent wearing a silly degree of pretence and affectation.I still hadn’t found myself when an image of a misty stretch of the Franklin River flashed past me on social media. I emailed the rafting company to ask if middle-aged women with average (really, less than) fitness and no paddling skills could join its eight-day group journey down a river famous for its perilous, roaring white water. Why yes, they said. With barely a thought I clicked “confirm payment”.View image in fullscreen‘While our guides tell stories of the merciless water … I do not dwell on them.’Photograph: Supplied by Stephanie WoodAnd so here I am, pre-dawn, day two, shivering and entombed in a sleeping bag on a thin foam pad on a sandy patch of a pebbled river beach beside a fallen Huon pine with a stranger snoring nearby. As the sun rises and I drag on my wetsuit I see the shape of my body indented in the sand and think, in a day, a week or a month, the river will rise and my form will be erased.“Who do you think is older, you or me?” the snoring stranger asks and I am affronted because of course he is, with his thatch of grey hair and wispy white tendrils poking up around his neck from his dry suit and his tall tales of retirement adventures. But it is quickly apparent that he is immeasurably fitter than me and practised at identifying good campsites and stringing tarps between trees. As the days go on, he expands into his strength and confidence and maleness while, in the privacy of my own thoughts, I struggle.But I am persistent and will not be defeated. I learn there is a fine line between fear and thrill: I had dreaded most the drops on the river, those few moments when a raft goes over an edge and briefly is near-vertical before it rights itself again. But those moments turn out to be intoxicating, a fun park ride. And while our guides tell stories of the merciless water and its seething cauldrons and deep holes that can catch a person and pull them under ortrap a man’s legin a vice-like grip for days until the leg must be removed and he is half dead, I do not dwell on them.View image in fullscreen‘But as we collaborate to negotiate the Franklin’s wilderness … I find myself too.’Photograph: Supplied by Stephanie WoodThe more difficult things are my private battles: my overloaded pack (because you never know what you might need, do you?) and the cliff that must be scaled along the river’s edge carrying that pack while our guides manoeuvre the rafts over patches of low-water. The exhausting days when we are in and out of the raft, helping to portage them through dangerous or shallow sections: “One, two, three, pull!” The indignity of my Michelin man appearance. The mortification when I tumble from the raft into a logjammed whirlpool at the bottom of a drop and the guide grabs me by my lifejacket straps and hauls me back in.The kindness of strangers: I needed a place to take my burnout and my dog, then a woman I’d never met sent me an invitationRead moreBut as we collaborate to negotiate the Franklin’s wilderness, “Nasty Notch” and “the Great Ravine”, “the Corkscrew” and “Deception Gorge”, I find myself too. In the knowledge that strength of mind can be as valuable as strength of body. Beating on, a boat against the current.And new thoughts are occurring to me, new possibilities apparent. I know now that I have the strength for almost anything, for expeditions I had not previously considered: treks in Alaska or through wild Canadian forests, pilgrimage walks across Japan, adventures in Costa Rican rainforests. Or to search for what matters: streams tumbling over stones in rainforested gullies, mist layered on a river at dawn, the water’s roar over boulders the size of houses, towering trees born during the Roman empire, eagles dipping and soaring, moss and lichen and ferns.Explore more on these topicsTravelThe place that stayed with meTasmania holidaysAustralia holidaysFitnessAdventure travelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Al-Saei said he heard the man warning others “don’t take a photo, don’t take a photo” as they attacked.He bled from his rectum for more than three weeks after the assault, which happened soon after he was detained in February 2024. He described sexual torture that lasted more than 20 minutes including beatings on his buttocks, a guard applying extreme pressure to his genitals, and forced anal penetration with two different objects.“I tried to prevent them by clenching my muscles (in my anus), but I could not. They forced it in very deep, it was extremely painful,” he said in an interview about his ordeal. “I don’t know how loudly I screamed from the pain.”It left him in so much pain that he collapsed twice when ordered to stand up and walk afterwards. Moved to an overcrowded cell, al-Saei said he received no medical treatment and was forced to use wads of toilet paper to staunch the blood.The 47-year-old father of six was held without charge or trial until June 2025. About 40 days after his release, he posted a video on TikTok detailing the attack, defying the extreme social stigma and Israeli warnings against going public about abuse in jails.“I could not stay silent. I have a moral responsibility to say what happened to me and other prisoners,” he said.‘A network of torture camps for Palestinians’Extensive and extreme sexual violence in Israel’s civilian and military jails has been documented by domestic and international observers includingdoctors, Israel’smilitary prosecutor, and theUN committee on torture.The human rights groupB’Tselemdescribed a “grave pattern of sexual violence in detention facilities and prisons”, ina reportreleased on Tuesday detailing abuse of Palestinians in Israeli jails.It ranges from “threats of sexual assault, through forced stripping, to actual sexual assaults”, the report found. “These include beatings to the genitals that caused severe injuries, setting dogs on prisoners, and forced anal penetration with various objects.”A spokesperson for the Israeli prison service said it “categorically rejects the false allegations presented in the [B’Tselem] report”, and was “not aware of the claims described” by al-Saei and other survivors of sexual violence.“All inmates are held in lawful custody, with due regard for their rights, including access to medical care as required and the provision of living conditions in accordance with the law,” the spokesperson added.View image in fullscreenPrisoners with their hands and legs restrained in the yard at the Sde Teiman military prison in southern Israel.Photograph: APTamer Qarmut, 41, was detained by Israeli soldiers in November 2023 when they raided Kamal Adwan hospital in northernGaza, where his family had taken shelter.He said that in the first 24 hours he was accused of being a militant – even though he had been disabled by a leg injury in his teens – and was beaten so badly he sustained permanent damage to his hearing, attacked by a dog and then raped by a soldier.“He shoved a wooden stick up my anus, left it there for about a minute, and pulled it out. Then he shoved it back in, even harder, and I screamed at the top of my lungs,” Qarmut said in testimony given to B’Tselem. “After a minute, he pulled the stick out again, told me to open my mouth, pushed the stick into my mouth and forced me to lick it.”He was held for nearly two years, but never charged or put on trial before his release in October last year under the deal brokered by the US president, Donald Trump.The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to requests for comment.B’Tselem’s report is its second on conditions in Israel’s civil and military prisons. After 7 October 2023, the detention centres were transformed into a network “dedicated to the abuse of inmates as policy”, where torture was an “accepted norm”, the report said. “A space of this kind, in which anyone who enters is condemned to deliberate, severe, and unrelenting pain and suffering, functions de facto as a torture camp.”The abuse of Palestinians is not hidden. Prison authorities boast of mistreatment, which is publicly backed by Israeli politicians and the judicial system, reported with approval in Israeli media, and has been normalised in Israeli public opinion, B’Tselem said.In 2024 Israeli military prosecutorschargedseveral soldiers over a violent rape at the Sde Teiman military detention centre, the only attempt to prosecute Israeli guards for sexual violence in detention centres after October 2023.Members of the government and Knesset backed the suspects and when video of the alleged attack was leaked, it produced little outcry in Israel about the abuse itself. Instead it led to the resignation and then arrest of the chief military lawyer. A single soldier has beenconvictedof abuse of Palestinian prisoners in that period.View image in fullscreenYuli Novak of B’tselem: ‘The international community continues to grant this regime full immunity.’Photograph: Enrique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianTorture of Palestinian prisoners must be understood in the context of dehumanisation and a broader campaign of extreme violence, said B’Tselem’s executive director, Yuli Novak.“The Israeli regime has turned its prisons into a network of torture camps for Palestinians, as part of a coordinated onslaught on Palestinian society intended to destroy their existence as a collective,” she said.Beyond Israel there had been condemnations of torture but no effective intervention, she added. “The international community continues to grant this regime full immunity.”In addition to sexual violence, the report details other forms of torture including electric shocks, use of teargas and stun grenades, jailers burning prisoners with boiling liquids and cigarettes, and setting dogs on them.Prisoners are also systemically denied medical care, leading to irreversible harm including amputations, loss of sight and hearing, and in dozens of cases, loss of life. At least 98 Palestinians havedied in Israeli jailssince 7 October 2023, and the real toll is probably substantially higher.‘Brother, come help me, I’m being tortured’Many of the dead were young and had no prior health conditions. Abdul Rahman Mirie, 34, was a carpenter who died in November 2023, leaving behind three young sons and a daughter.He was detained on his way back from work in February 2023 and held without charge or trial. He was probably beaten to death, according to details from a prison autopsy and testimony from other prisoners. Men held in cells near him during his final hours told his mother, Aziza, that they heard him calling out in agony: “Brother, come help me, I’m being tortured.”His family cannot confirm the cause of death, or move on without a burial, because Israel is holding his body hostage.Ahead of the ceasefire deal for Gaza brokered by Trump last year, Aziza Mirie got a call from authorities asking if she wanted her son’s remains. “We said definitely yes, but never heard any more,” she told the Guardian at the family home.View image in fullscreenAziza Mirie, the mother of Abdul Rahman Mirie, who was beaten to death in an Israeli prison.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianMirie’s broken-hearted father died soon after losing his son, Aziza said, and the rest of the family is struggling. “At night I keep imagining how they tortured Abdul Rahman, and what condition he was in before his death,” she said. “Sometimes I find his daughter crying alone, and she asks me, ‘why don’t I have a father?’.”Israel last provided totals for Palestinian prisoners in detention before Trump’s ceasefire deal, but they indicate that by January Israel was detaining about 9,000 Palestinians from Gaza, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. About half of them are jailed indefinitely without charge or trial.Inhuman living conditions, including starvation rations, crowding and deprivation of basic hygiene needs such as showers and clean clothes, exacerbate the impact of violent assaults.There is no independent oversight, with International Committee of the Red Cross visits halted from October 2023, and prisoners are denied contact with their families or any news from the outside world.Al-Saei has paid a high price for speaking out. Forced to move away from gossiping neighbours, he has struggled to find work and is haunted by vivid nightmares about his children’s future.But he does not regret his decision to become a voice for those who cannot face adding new pain to deep trauma. “It was my choice,” he said, adding that during 16 months in jail he saw clear evidence in the overcrowded cells that many other prisoners had been assaulted. “Even if the others didn’t speak about it, it was obvious they also had this experience.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelPalestineHuman rightsTortureGazaMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photographs byXimena BorrazasSupported byAbout this contentWed 21 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTShareAlexei clears his throat without showing the slightest expression on his face. Squatting and wearing gloves, he shakes the military uniform that once belonged to a man. The jacket and trousers still hold their shape, but inside there is nothing. Just air.Alexei pulls out a worn, stained piece of paper from one of the pockets. “Andrei. Moscow,” he reads aloud. “There’s a phone number written here. Good. It helps us trace his origin.” Whoever he was, he was a Russian soldier.Alexei and his group of Ukrainian search volunteers face a complex, delicate task. They must identify the four bodies they have recovered from the front in the Donbas region. “If I were to die, I would want someone to search for me. To bring me home,” he says.Aside from the note, a rusty belt and a pair of blackened boots partly blown apart by a mine, everything else of the man has vanished. “Vlad, please,” Alexei calls to his fellow volunteer, who approaches with a small whiteboard on which to write the extracted information with a marker.Alexei lists the details. Vlad writes them down and a third volunteer photographs the sections of the remains valuable for identification, illuminating them with a flash. For now, the identity of the corpse is reduced to a handful of scattered words and a card assigning it a number. The number of fallen soldiers recovered by the search group has now passed 1,500.View image in fullscreenFinding bodies from both sides is common at the front – the remains pile up after a battleThe other three bodies, somewhat more intact, also belong to Russian soldiers. A pack of ibuprofen, a pair of glasses missing the left lens, a credit card, a tattoo on the back, a grimy St George’s ribbon – nostalgically symbolising the patriotism of “Mother Russia” – reveal their origins.Still, doubt always plays a key role. The feet of the last corpse are still covered in socks from the Ukrainian army. Alexei whispers something to his partner in Ukrainian, and they exchange thoughts until they partially solve the puzzle: “Yes, he’s Russian. He must have been part of a sabotage team. He probably occupied a military base and put those on,” he says.For me, it’s very important that all these souls have a final dignified rest. That their families can say goodbyeSometimes, if they’re not sure, they write “unknown” so DNA testing can be backed up with further checks. It is common for both Russian and Ukrainian soldiers “to disguise themselves to gain ground”, says Alexei.Finding bodies from both sides is common at the front. The remains pile up after a battle. “Before identification,” says Alexei, “our job is to clear the combat perimeter – woods or barren land where their lines and ours become entangled. We comb the area from the first tree to the last.”His worst experience was in the village of Klishchiivka, in easternUkraine. “I had never seen anything like it. So many bodies scattered everywhere. I’ve seen a lot, but never this. The entire hillside was covered with corpses. There wasn’t even space to set a foot down. Bodies of fighters from 2022, 2023 and 2024, accumulated.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenSearch volunteers face a complex, delicate task in recovering the bodies, and everything is meticulously detailed; recovered items are photographed and recorded to help with identification, left; bones are placed on a diagram of a skeleton to help piece a body together, rightThe search group, Platzdarm, goes where no one else goes, carrying the bodies of fallen soldiers for miles under the lethal dome that envelops the war front, guarded by legions of executioner drones. The so-called kill zone covers more and more ground, says Alexei, and there are barely any safe areas left. They now rely on fog to work, as it somewhat hinders the drones’ visibility. Almost making a pact with the haze, waiting for a moment to go in and retrieve the bodies, he says.View image in fullscreenA pair of blackened boots, one blown apart by a mine, belonging to a Russian soldier recovered by the Platzdarm search teamAlexei and his team file away their anguish and shock into a deep compartment of their minds – one they only open when alone with their thoughts. That is what has kept them going. “For me, it’s very important that all these souls have a final dignified rest. That their families can say goodbye at a funeral, speaking the words they may never have been able to express in life, and that they can visit a sacred place to honour their memory,” Alexei says.Alexei has spent more than two decades as a “body seeker”, starting out as a 20-year-old doing something, he says, he has always felt a duty to do. “Until 2014, we dedicated ourselves to searching for those who fell in the first and second world wars and the victims of political repression,” he recalls. “We found mass graves where people had been shot by the Nazis or by theNKVD, the USSR’s secret police. They were Soviet, German and allied soldiers. We buried them, sent their remains to funeral associations, or repatriated them if we managed to contact their families. We brought them home,” he says.It is no easy task, says Alexei. “It is very painful. To see a destroyed destiny. A human destiny. You feel something for the dead that you never thought you could feel. It’s hard to explain and also depends on who the deceased is – especially if you’re the one who finds him after having direct contact with his parents and having known that person’s path from the beginning to their last breath. The grief passes through you, because you become part of that family.”View image in fullscreenA member of the Platzdarm team takes a break from his painstaking workView image in fullscreenBelongings recovered from a dead Russian soldierAlexei says he and his team feel like a link between life and death. “You are the bearer of misfortune – of a terrible truth that families will have to live with for ever. They will have to understand that they will never again see or embrace the person who is gone.”But over the years, Alexei says he has managed to find some solace. “It’s an honour for us if we can return someone’s son, husband, brother or father to their family. It means the effort was worth it.” Nationality does not matter, he says, nor the side on which they fought. Whether Ukrainian or Russian, all souls are the same.Above all, Alexei defends the importance of keeping their humanity intact, for that is something taken away by wars. “War has taught me to what extent a person can become a non-human. Something worse than an animal. Because in war, human life is worth nothing. War shows black and white, without shades.”Perhaps, he says, “I’m too stupid. And I don’t fully understand it, or I don’t want to. But until people realise that we are all inhabitants of the same planet, nothing will change.” His dream, he says, is that “it all ends. For everyone. The consequences are terrible. The physical and psychological wounds will last for ever. And many – far too many – will never return.”Explore more on these topicsUkraine in depthUkraineEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

And the question is: ‘Is Sheinbaum willing to go after them?’ Because some of these people are going to be from her own party.”Explore more on these topicsClaudia SheinbaumMexicoDrugs policyDrugs tradeAmericasTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

They should be grateful, also, but they’re not. I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn’t so grateful,” Trump told the audience. “Canada lives by the United States. Remember that, Mark, next time you make your statements.”In the rambling and peevish speech, Trump repeated his intention to seize control ofGreenlandin order to build his proposed Golden Dome missile defence system, which Canada is hoping to join. Trump said the Golden Dome was “going to be defending Canada”.‘The powerful have their power. We have the capacity to stop pretending’: the Canadian PM’s call to action at Davos | Mark CarneyRead moreThe prime minister’s office said it had no plans to comment on Trump’s remarks, adding that there were no plans for the two leaders to meet.Trump’s jab at Carney came a day after a closely watched speech in which the prime ministerlamented the erosion of international institutionsand called for new global to combat the rise of “hegemons” upending global norms.“Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu. Great powers can afford to go it alone. They have the market size, the military capacity, the leverage to dictate terms,” said Carney. “Middle powers do not.”Without naming Trump, Carney said an “old order” of alliances and rules-based order was not returning. “We should not mourn it,” he said. “Nostalgia is not a strategy.”Trump has used his second term to extract concessions from allied nations when negotiating trade deals and has increasingly cast doubt on the value Canada holds for their relationship.Touring a Michigan car plant in mid-January, Trump said his country “didn’t need” products from Canada, adding that the USMCA free trade deal between the two countries and Mexico – which he helped renegotiate in his first term – was “irrelevant” to him.Increasingly, Canada is also looking for new trading pacts to decrease its reliance on the US.“When you talk about the Americans, they’ll always remain important to Canada. Our geography is not going to change,” Canada’s international trade minister, Maninder Sidhu, told reporters from Davos. “But you look at who else we want to deal with: China is our second-largest trading partner. India is going to be the third-largest economy. We’re looking across the world for areas of opportunity.”Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, who oversees the country’s largest provincial economy, said the US president’s remarks at Davos were “disappointing” but “typical” of Trump.“Over the last few days, we have watched as president Trump has threatened Greenland, he has threatened Canada and he has threatened Nato allies,” Ford said. “President Trump remains relentless in his campaign to create a more unstable unsafe and uncertain world. There has never been a more important time for Team Canada to stay united.”Ford also referenced a social media post from Trump which featured an altered image in which the US flag was shown covering Canada, Greenland and Venezuela.“It is disappointing to see him on a full attack,” said Ford. “Putting the American flag over Canada, over Greenland, it is unacceptable.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpMark CarneyTrump administrationCanadaUS politicsAmericasUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Fernando Barros, 68, who will become defence minister, defended Pinochet when he faced extradition from London in 1998. The new justice minister, Fernando Rabat, 53, represented the former dictator in a vast embezzlement case which began in 2004.Chile voted to remove Pinochet from power and democracy returned in 1990.The former dictator died in 2006 at the age of 91 without facing trial for the litany of human rights violations perpetrated under his dictatorship or the public finance scandal which followed him towards the end of his life.Kast, who won the presidency in December at his third attempt, is a renowned supporter of the former dictator, and campaigned to keep him in power before a 1988 referendum on the continuation of the dictatorship. During his first run for the presidency in 2017, Kast said that the former dictator would have voted for him if he were still alive. He will be sworn in on 11 March to serve a four-year term.Explore more on these topicsChileWomenAbortionAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Their trial is one of the most high-profile national security cases to be heard in Hong Kong since Beijingimposed the law in 2020. The defendants face a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment if convicted. The law has a near-100% conviction rate.The three defendants were key members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, the group that for decades organised the annual vigil for the victims of the1989 Tiananmen Square massacrein Beijing.Until thevigil was bannedin 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, amid a crackdown on free expression in Hong Kong, it was the only mass memorial event for the massacre on Chinese territory. For decades, it was a symbol of Hong Kong’s autonomy from mainland China, an identity that persisted even after Hong Kong was returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997.View image in fullscreenAlbert Ho, seen here in May 2021 being escorted to a prison van to go to a court in Hong Kong, has said he was on ‘the right side of history’.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APChow, an internationally lauded human rights barrister, has been detained for more than four years awaiting trial. Lee and Ho, former Hong Kong legislators, have also been previously sentenced for convictions of unauthorised assembly in relation to protests and vigils held during the 2019-20 pro-democracy movement.In 2021, speaking before his sentencing for his involvement in the 2020 Tiananmen Square vigil,Ho saidthat he was on “the right side of history”.Ho was part of a group of activistswho were convictedfor organising and participating in an unauthorised assembly in August 2019. In 2024, that conviction was upheld by judges on Hong Kong’s top court,a panel which includedthe British judge David Neuberger.The annual vigil organised by the Hong Kong Alliance attracted tens of thousands of attenders each year. Organisers estimated that 180,000 people attendedthe 2019 vigil, which was held days before Hong Kong erupted in a series of protests against the Chinese Communist party’s tightening grip on the city.Under increasing pressure from the authorities, the Alliancedisbanded in 2021.View image in fullscreenLee Cheuk-Yan, photographed here in June 2018, has been previously sentenced for convictions of unauthorised assembly.Photograph: Helen Davidson/The GuardianThursday’s trial will be heard in front of three judges handpicked by the government to hear national security cases, rather than a jury.One of the judges, Alex Lee, recently presided over the trial of Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy former media mogul who wasconvicted on national security chargesin December. The British citizen is awaiting sentencing and faces spending the rest of his life in prison.Other national security cases are making their way through the courts. Wong Kwok-ngon, a political commenter,appeared in courton Tuesday, accused of allegedly divulging details of a national security police investigation in the days after theWang Fuk Court firein November that killed more than 160 people. Wong is charged under Hong Kong’s homegrown national security law, known as article 23, which is separate from the Beijing-enacted security law.Sarah Brooks, Amnesty International’s deputy regional director for Asia, said: “This case is not about national security – it is about rewriting history and punishing those who refuse to forget the victims of the Tiananmen crackdown.”Mark Clifford, the president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, said: “The Chinese regime will stop at nothing to erase history and silence those who seek to keep the truth of Tiananmen alive. Chow Hang-tung, Lee Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho are courageous patriots who have devoted their lives to representing Chinese people denied basic rights. Sadly, they are also symbols of how far Hong Kong’s once-respected justice system has fallen, persecuted for demanding that Beijing keep its promises to the people of Hong Kong.”Explore more on these topicsHong KongAsia PacificProtestChinaTiananmen Square protests 1989newsShareReuse this content"

It’s an intimate window into the past, and an intimate window into these people’s minds.”An enhanced image showing the narrow, pointy fingers of the stencil.Photograph: NatureFieldwork led by Aubert and Prof Adam Brumm, also at Griffith, has revealed a rich history of cave paintings in Sulawesi, mostly on the island’s south-western peninsula. In one cave, a narrative scene depicting three human-like figures and a wild pig was dated to at least 51,200 years ago.The latest hand stencil was spotted at Liang Metanduno, a cave on Sulawesi’s south-eastern peninsula. Though faded and partially obscured by a more recent motif on the wall, it was ascribed a minimum age after the team dated tiny calcite deposits that had formed over the top. Humans have painted in the cave for millennia, with fresh images adorning the walls for at least 35,000 years.It is unclear how humans first migrated from Sunda, the south-east Asian landmass that once connected Borneo, Sumatra and Java, to Sahul, which connected Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania. But the rock art suggests some humans travelled on a northern route that crossed Sulawesi.View image in fullscreenThe fieldwork to date the cave art was led by a team from Australia’s Griffith University.Photograph: NatureBecause sea levels were much lower at the time, land bridges opened up between some neighbouring islands, but humans would still haveneeded to island hopto spread across the region. Researchers contest when humans reached Sahul, but Brumm believes the rock art supports evidence that northern Australia was settled at least65,000 years ago.The hand stencils were made by spraying mouthfuls of ochre mixed with water over a hand pressed to the cave wall. Like some others on Sulawesi, the Liang Metanduno stencil has narrow, pointy fingers, which the researchers believe was an intentional modification.Brumm said: “Whether they resemble animal claws or more fancifully some human-animal creature that doesn’t exist, we don’t know, but there’s some sort of symbolic meaning behind them.”View image in fullscreenProf Maxime Aubert working in the cave.Photograph: NatureWriting inNature, the authors argue that the tweaks to the hand stencil make the rock art “complex” and so probably the work ofHomo sapiens, but other long-gone human species cannot be ruled out. Archaeologists working in Spanish caves have dated ochre wall markings, including hand stencils, toat least 64,000 years ago, making them the work of Neanderthals. The related but little known Denisovans occupied a vast area of Asia and reached as far as Indonesia.Prof Paul Pettitt, of Durham University, who worked on the Spanish cave markings, said it was not clear whether the pointy-fingered hand stencils in Sulawesi were made on purpose or simply caused by the creator moving their fingers. “To call this complex is rather over-interpreting the hand stencil,” he said.“In any case, Neanderthals were modifying hand stencils, so why this should be a behaviour restricted toHomo sapiens, and why other potential human groups such as the poorly understood Denisovans couldn’t have created it, is unclear,” he added. “Before writing grand narratives about the complexity and success ofHomo sapiens, we really should consider other, potentially more interesting explanations of this fascinating phenomenon.”Explore more on these topicsArchaeologyIndonesiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Han has the right to appeal.The court found that Han had actively created the appearance of a legitimate cabinet meeting to rubber-stamp an unconstitutional decree.South Korean prosecutors demand death penalty for former president Yoon Suk YeolRead moreProsecutors had sought a 15-year sentence.However, the judge rejected using precedents from past military coups as sentencing guidelines, calling this a “self-coup” by elected power that posed unique dangers to democracy.Lee said Han, as prime minister, had a constitutional duty to prevent the insurrection but instead “chose to join” it.The court found no genuine remorse, noting that Han had continued concealing evidence and lying throughout the trial.Among the most damaging evidence came from an 8 December phone call when Han told a presidential aide to destroy a backdated martial law document, saying: “Let’s make it as if my signature never existed.”The court noted that Han, 76, knew about the martial law plan hours before Yoon’s televised announcement at 10.28pm on 3 December.CCTV footage showed him nodding as Yoon explained the plan and receiving documents including the martial law proclamation.Only six cabinet ministers were summoned in advance to the presidential office. The court found that Han had helped ensure the meeting had the minimum quorum needed while preventing meaningful deliberation.The court also found Han guilty of creating false documents, destroying presidential records and perjury during Yoon’s impeachment proceedings.Prosecutors demanded 15 years by arguing that Han bore unique responsibility as the only person constitutionally positioned to block the decree by refusing to countersign it or to convene a cabinet meeting.Han is a career diplomat who served five presidents across conservative and progressive administrations.Yoon appointed him the prime minister in May 2022, making him the longest-serving prime minister under any single president in South Korean democratic history.He maintained throughout the trial that he privately opposed martial law and was in psychological shock. “I never supported it or tried to help it,” he told the court in November.Unlike Yoon and other co-defendants, Han remained free throughout his trial after a judge rejected his arrest warrant in August, citing “room for legal dispute” over his culpability.The verdict was deliveredfive days aftera separate court sentenced Yoon to five years’ imprisonment for obstructing his own arrest.Yoon’s verdict over his insurrection trial is scheduled for 19 February.

The same firms, which include BP, HSBC, Intercontinental Hotels Group, Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls-Royce were also said to be among those who will join a revamped “UK-China CEO council”.There was no comment from Downing Street early on Wednesday. However,Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser, went to Beijing in November for talks with China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, before an anticipated trip by Starmer.The developments come amid turbulence surrounding the move towards building ties with China again, including a furore last year around the abandonment last year ofcharges against two men accused of spying for Beijing.The path for Starmer’s visit was also cleared last week when Britain’s communities secretary, Steve Reed,gave permission for China to build its new embassynear the Tower of London after spy chiefs told him that the risks to UK national security could be controlled and dealt with.However, local residents near the Royal Mint Court site have raised the £145,000 required to pay for lawyers to seek a challenge to the planning decision. They are expected to file an application for judicial review in the next six weeks, most likely alleging that Reed had already made up his mind without properly considering all the evidence.China’s foreign ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday that Beijing had handled planning for a new UK embassy in full compliance with international diplomatic practices and relevant laws and regulations. Providing support and construction of diplomatic premises is the host country’s international obligation, Guo Jiakun told reporters at a regular press conference.Britain’s delicate handling of relations with China also comes against the backdrop of the ongoing diplomatic crisis surrounding Greenland. The US president, Donald Trump, has claimed that the territory needs to become American to protect against a security threat in the Arctic from China and Russia.The UK-China CEO council was originally conceived by Britain’s then prime minister Theresa May and China’s then premier Li Keqiang in 2018, during a period of relations which May and others described as “a golden era”.The Chinese side should be represented by Bank of China, China Construction Bank, China Mobile, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and others, Reuters reported.The last UK prime minister to visit Chinawas May in 2018. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor,travelled to Chinawith a business delegation in January and unveiled £600m in investment. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, and Peter Kyle, the trade secretary, have also visited China for talks over the past year. Senior Chinese government figures made several visits to the UK in the same period.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyKeir StarmerChinaInternational tradeTrade policyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Some have been seen “walking around in search of assistance – and we also know that some people have managed to get to safe houses,” she said.Without support there is a risk of workers simply being moved to a new scamming location – a trend in previous releases. “We’ve seen people who are forced to move to other compounds, and it’s possible that if people have escaped but don’t know where to go, don’t know what to do next, [then they] end up in another compound.”The online scam industry hasflourished across parts of south-east Asiaover recent years, including in Cambodia, where the UN estimates 100,000 work inside compounds. Many workers have been duped into accepting jobs in the compounds, and are then held against their will and forced to carry out online scams, including romance-investment scams and crypto fraud.Jacob Sims, visiting fellow at Harvard University’s Asia Center, described the recent releases as unprecedented in Cambodia. “It is extremely clear that this is all being precipitated by escalating international pressure, which has been mounting for years, but really started exponentially increasing with the historic UK and US October 14 action against Chen Zhi.”Chen Zhi, a Chinese-born Cambodian tycoon, was sanctioned by the UK and the US in October last year, with the US accusing him of operating a “transnational criminal empire through online investment scams targeting Americans and others worldwide”.Chen, who chairs Prince Group, was arrested and extradited toChinaearlier this month, the strongest step yet to be taken against criminal syndicates inside Cambodia.The Cambodian government did not respond to a request for comment regarding the recent releases.Prime minister Hun Manet has pledged on Facebook to “eliminate … all the problems related to the crime of cyber scams”.Sims said that while the latest releases are promising, the problem will simply re-emerge if international pressure is not maintained. “This industry obviously has gotten to the point where it’s sort of too big to fail. It’s a major regime patrimonial resource,” said Sims, who is also a senior adviser on transnational crime at Inca Digital, an open-source intelligence company.“What happens from here, a lot of that is going to depend on how sustained and durable this pressure remains against the regime,” he added.The Cambodian government has repeatedly been accused of being complicit in the scam industry.The US Trafficking in Persons Report for 2024warned of Cambodia: “Some senior government officials and advisers owned – either directly or through businesses – properties and facilities known to be utilized by online scam operators used to exploit victims in labor trafficking and financially benefited directly from these crimes.”The involvement of “officials and economic elites resulted in selective and politically motivated enforcement of laws, inhibiting effective law enforcement action against trafficking crimes,” it said.Cambodia has denied suggestions its government is complicit, saying it has “never supported, nor will it ever tolerate, cybercriminal activity” and that it “remains fully committed to integrity, transparency, and adherence to the rule of law and international norms.”According to estimates by United States Institute of Peace, in Cambodia, the return on cyber scamming is estimated to exceed$12.5bn annually, half the country’s formal GDP.Explore more on these topicsCambodiaScamsIndonesiaChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Vegastars’ promotion did not mention betting, but the local peak body has said Australian companies would not be permitted to run such a giveaway.Sportsbet, Bet365, Betfair, PointsBet and Unibet are represented byResponsible Wagering Australia(RWA). Its chief executive, Kai Cantwell, said branding and giveaways could mislead consumers into believing offshore platforms were legal.“The fact this is happening openly during Australia’s biggest sporting events shows how far enforcement is lagging behind the reality of offshore gambling,” Cantwell said.The gaming regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma), can ask internet service providers to block website access to unlicensed gambling services.Addicts who opted to be banned from gambling in Australia targeted to bet with overseas firmsRead moreAn Acma spokesperson said the regulator had found Vegastars was illegal and would request the site be blocked. It said it would also investigate each company identified by Guardian Australia.The Vegastars website tells players: “Depositing real funds and playing for real money is subject to the laws of your country, and it is your sole responsibility to abide by your native regulations.”Another offshore operator, Rainbet, has featured in an Instagram video promoting its live in-play betting by Australian influencer Jon Redman, which has been viewed more than 40,000 times.Acmawarned influencers against promotingillegal, unlicensed services in June. A spokesperson said Acma was investigating Redman’s conduct and had contacted Instagram’s parent company, Meta Platforms, over the video.Redman’s video was taken down two days after Guardian Australia contacted him. He did not respond to questions. Rainbet’s terms and conditions warn Australian users they must not use the site, but users have said they can access it with VPNs.Acma’s spokesperson said website blocking was effective, cutting off 220 illegal services across 1,455 sites in Australia since November 2019.Lauren Levin, a consumer advocate, said the offshore issue could be eliminated with a block on payments to and from unlicensed gambling providers, modelled on similar systems in Germany and Norway.“It works better than the current whack-a-mole approach where Acma [blocks] an overseas URL and five minutes later the business has just changed the URL to a slightly different one,” Levin said.A quick fix for offshore providers would allow the government to focus on the dominant local gambling industries, which account for the majority of gambling losses, Levin said.Australians gambled $254bn in 2023-24, at a net loss of $32bn across all local gambling industries, according to a Queensland Treasury estimate.Meanwhile,RWA-commissioned researchin November estimated Australians online gambled nearly $3.9bn through offshore companies in 2024 and $7bn locally in the same period.Vegastars and Rainbet were contacted for comment.This article was amended on 22 January 2026 to clarify that the $32bn net Australians lost gambling was across all local gambling industries.Explore more on these topicsAustralian OpenGamblingAustralian Open 2026Australia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

And which ones are ‘damaging’ Australia’s economy?Read moreIn its report, the OECD urged the Albanese government to do more to put the budget on a more sustainable footing, calling for “expenditure restraint and revenue enhancing tax reforms”.Among those tax reform measures were a longstanding recommendation to broaden theGSTand to consider lifting the rate above 10%, with the proceeds used to reduce Australia’s overreliance on personal income tax.The OECD estimated this tax reform would add 1.6% to the size of the economy in a decade’s time.It also said Australia was “broadly on track” to meet its 2030 emissions reduction ambitions, but that “further efforts will be needed to reduce transport emissions, manage a higher share of renewables in transport and tackle agricultural emissions”.“Australia was for many years an international laggard on climate action and still has among the highest per capita carbon emissions of any country in the world and among the lowest implicit prices of carbon,” the report said.“In recent years, however, Australia has made relatively rapid progress on the energy transition, with a growing proportion of climate policy instruments adopted in most areas.”The report advocated for a “gradual” lift in petrol taxes, which it said were “well below European levels”, which was “contributing to the low take-up of low emission vehicles”.Explore more on these topicsAustralian economyOECDAustralian politicsTaxGreenhouse gas emissionsHousingBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

Power plants burning coal, oil and gas generated 29%.Beatrice Petrovich, an analyst at the Ember thinktank and the lead author of the report, said it was a “major tipping point” that was of strategic importance to the EU, which has grown increasingly panicked about its reliance on other countries for energy.“The importance of this goes beyond the power sector,” she said. “The danger of relying on fossil fuels looms large in destabilised geopolitics.”Europe faces growing tensions with the US – its chief supplier of liquefied natural gas – over Donald Trump’s desire to take over Greenland. At a summit in Davos on Tuesday, the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, criticised Europe’s adoption of solar and wind, arguing that its lack of domestic battery factories risked making it “subservient” to China.“If you are going to be dependent on someone, it had better be your best allies,” he said in a justification of the “America first” approach that he encouraged other countries to emulate.A graph showing the percentage of electricity generation by means of productionAnalysts said the trend was driven by a boom in solar, which generated a record 13% of EU power. In five countries – including the Netherlands, which is not known for its sun – it provided more than 20%.Wind turbines generated slightly less than the previous year, the report found, but remained the second-largest source of electricity, responsible for 17% of EU power.The role of fossil gas increased by 8% – largely because of a weather-related drop in hydropower output – but remained well below its most recent 2019 peak, the report found. Coal-burning fell to a new historic low, accounting for less than 10% of EU power, most of it in Germany and Poland.Solar and wind were “becoming the backbone” of Europe’s power system, said Petras Katinas, an analyst at the Centre for Research onEnergyand Clean Air, who was not involved in the report.“Solar alone grew by more than 20% in a single year, proving that clean power can scale faster than any conventional technology,” he said. “The challenge now is not generation, but how quickly Europe can deploy grids, batteries, and flexibility.”Climate scientists and energy modellers have stressed that most of the electricity needed to power a carbon-free economy will come from rays of sunlight shining on panels and gusts of wind spinning turbines.But European countries have been slow to modernise electricity grids to incorporate large volumes of renewable energy, which varies during the day and is delivered by a distributed network of machines.However, the report found early signs that evening peaks in electricity demand – which typically require burning gas at great cost to bill payers – are starting to be met by batteries.The analysts suggest that Italy, which hosts one-fifth of the EU’s operating battery capacity and has a large pipeline of planned projects, may be about to follow the same trajectory as California, where batteries routinely cover 20% of evening demand peaks and are crowding out gas.Petrovich said this could smooth price spikes. “If I were a policymaker or investor, I would seriously start questioning if plans for new gas plants are inflated – and act to avoid a burden for taxpayers and risk of stranded assets.”Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyWind powerSolar powerEnergyEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Hemocked Emmanuel Macron’s aviator sunglasses, chided Mark Carney (“Canada lives because of the United States”), asserted that the Swiss are “only good because of us” and had a dig at Denmark for losing Greenland “in six hours” during the second world war.But beyond the fractious rhetoric, the US president brought a deeper message on Wednesday that sought to unify the west rather than divide it. It was his most dark, insidious and sinister project of all.Trump surmised: Yes, we might have our internal squabbles, but I am bringing tough love because we are all in this together. We are the standard bearers of western civilisation. We must resist the barbarian hordes. We must save the white man.The ageing president, who in 2024 complained, “We got a lot of bad genes in our country right now,”told the World Economic Forumthat he was “derived from Europe”, namely: “100% Scotland, my mother; 100% German, my father. And we believe deeply in the bonds we share with Europe as a civilisation.”Speak hysterically and carry a big stick: Trump’s foreign policy threatsRead moreHe lamented that “certain places inEuropeare not even recognisable, frankly, any more”, blaming culprits that included “unchecked mass migration”. Trump said: “It’s horrible what they’re doing to themselves. They’re destroying themselves, these beautiful, beautiful places. We want strong allies, not seriously weakened ones.”What came next was pure racism as Trump reflected on immigration to his own country, where he has made the Somali community aspecial targetof his deportation rhetoric after recent governmentfraud casesin Minnesota in which a majority of defendants had Somali roots.“We’re cracking down on more than $19bn in fraud that was stolen by Somalian bandits,” he said. “Can you believe that Somalia – they turned out to be higher IQ than we thought. I always say these are low-IQ people. How did they go intoMinnesotaand steal all that money?”Then he got to theheart of the matter: “The situation in Minnesota reminds us that the west cannot mass-import foreign cultures which have failed to ever build a successful society of their own. I mean, we’re taking people from Somalia, and Somalia is a failed – it’s not a nation. Got no government, got no police, got no nothing.” (Somalia does, in fact, have a government, though not democratically elected.)He launched a bitter tirade atIlhan Omar, a Somali-born Democratic congresswoman who is a US citizen. Then he insisted: “The explosion of prosperity and conclusion and progress that built the west did not come from our tax codes. It ultimately came from our very special culture.“This is the precious inheritance that America and Europe have in common, and we share it. We share it but we have to keep it strong. We have to become stronger, more successful and more prosperous than ever. We have to defend that culture and rediscover the spirit that lifted the west from the depths of the dark ages to the pinnacle of human achievement.”Trump’s speech had the fingerprints ofStephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and architect of his draconian immigration policy, all over it. It chimed with an entire discourse of white identity politics festering on the US right.It is there in the“great replacement” theory,a conspiratorial notion that demographic change is engineered to replace white majorities with non-white populations, undermining traditional culture. It is there in Trump’s decision to grant asylum to white South Africans because of a fictitious “white genocide” said to be taking place in their country. It is there in the rabid ideology underpinning Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) thuggish assault on immigrants in Minneapolis.It is also there in Miller’s worldview, which haslong promotedracist fears of demographic replacement of white people and civilisation decline. He has become the editor who turns Trump’s pub chatter into “Make America great again” scripture.Speaking at the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk’s funeral last year,Miller said: “Our lineage and our legacy hails back to Athens, to Rome, to Philadelphia, to Monticello. Our ancestors built the cities. They produced the art and architecture. They built the industry. We stand for what is good, what is virtuous and what is noble.”Only Miller could have spent last Christmas watching a Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra family TV show from 1967 and had this takeaway: “Imagine watching that and thinking America needed infinity migrants from the third world,” hetweeted. (There was an instant backlash from X users noting that both Martin and Sinatra were the sons of immigrants.)Elon Musk, a white manborn in apartheid in South Africaand now the richest person in the world, has amplified such ideas. His feed on X, the social media platform that he owns, is still replete with dire warnings of white civilisation under siege. Earlier this month he retweeted with a “100%” endorsement a post declaring that: “If white men become a minority, we will be slaughtered … White solidarity is the only way to survive.”Trump’s far-right allies have been worrying of late that he has become distracted by global conquest – Iran, Venezuela,Greenland– and losing sight of his creed of “America first”. On Wednesday he may have been addressing the wealthy elites in Davos but, as ever, his true target audience was the one back home. The message: I am still the great white hope.Explore more on these topicsDavos 2026Donald TrumpRaceDavosSomaliaFar right (US)Ilhan OmaranalysisShareReuse this content"

I won’t use force. All the US is asking for is a place called Greenland,” he said. “You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember.”The remarks elicited a cool reaction from the foreign minister ofDenmark, the Nato country of which Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory. Lars Løkke Rasmussen said it was “positive” that Trump had ruled out an invasion but the US president’s ambitions for the territory were “intact”.“It is, in isolation, positive that it is being said that military force will not be used, but that does not make the problem go away,” Rasmussen said. “The challenge is still there.”Norway’s finance minister and formerNatosecretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, told CNN that Trump had delivered an “important message … because up to now many were afraid that he actually was going to threaten to use force to acquire Greenland”.Later on Wednesday, Trump announced a U-turn on his plans to impose sanctions on eight European countries over Greenland as a result of progress in bilateral talks with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte. He said they had developed the “framework of a future deal” on Greenland and “the entire Arctic region” that “if consummated, will be a great [solution] for the United States”.As a result, Trump wrote, he would not be imposing tariffs scheduled to go into effect on 1 Februrary. The US was to have imposed 10% tariffs against Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland.Trump did not give further details of the agreement, but said talks were ongoing concerning a US missile defence shield that would be in part based in Greenland.“It’s a deal that people jumped at, really fantastic for the USA, gets everything we wanted, including especially real national security and international security,” he told reporters inDavos.He said the deal would be in force “forever” and more details would be given “down the line”.When Agence France-Presse asked Rutte for comment on the preliminary deal, he declined.It is not known if the leaders of Greenland or Denmark have seen or were involved in the plan, but the latter’s foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said: “It is a signal, I hope, that we can now have talks with Trump’s people … What is important for us is that we end this in a way that respects the Greenlandic people.”During his earlier speech,Trump at times sought to needle his global audience, saying it was “stupid” for the US to cede Greenland to Denmark after the second world war, and that “without us, now you’d all be speaking German, or a little Japanese perhaps”. Davos is in the German-speaking part of Switzerland.He said Denmark had been overrun by Germany “after just six hours of fighting”, prompting the US to intervene “at great cost and expense”. He insisted only the US was now fit to defend “this enormous, unsecured island”.Greenland’s position between the US, Russia, and China would make it a critical base for a proposed US missile defence shield called Golden Dome, Trump said, and the US had to take “ownership” of a fellow Nato member’s territory in order to provide for its defence.“You need the ownership to defend it,” he said. “You can’t defend it on a lease. Who the hell wants to defend a licence agreement, or a lease?”At several points,Trump appeared to confuse Greenland with Iceland, claiming “Iceland” had caused a drop in stock prices on Tuesday – whenmarkets fell as a result of his threat to impose new tariffson eight European countries.Handing over Greenland to the US would not represent a threat to Nato, he said, praising its “excellent secretary general” and greeting Mark Rutte in the audience.But Trump repeatedly returned to his argument that the US has had a raw deal from Nato, funding the protection of other European countries. “We give so much, and we get so little in return.”He suggested that while the US was ready to defend Nato allies, this backing might not be returned. “We’re there for Nato 100%. I’m not sure if they’d be there for us.” Mutual defence is a founding principle of the transatlantic alliance.Some European officials were less restrained in their responses to Trump’s speech. The European Green party co-chair Vula Tsetsi urged European leaders to “stand united against Trump’s bullying” over Greenland. Mark Carney, the prime minister of Canada, haddelivered a stirring speech before Trump’s on Wednesday in which he urged smaller countries to present a united front and said that “compliance [with the United States] will not buy safety”.Trump’s remarks on Greenland have unsettled members of his own party. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told CNN at Davos that she welcomed Trump’s pledge not to use force but added it was “unfortunate that it needed to be said”.“He’s referring to it as a piece of real estate,” Murkowski said, adding that Trump had ignored the wishes of native Greenlanders. “But it is a place where, again, you have native people who live there. You have communities.”California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and strong critic of the administration who is in Davos, emerged from the speech to describe it as, “one of the most insignificant hours I’ve spent in years – and I think the world spent”, describing it as, “fire and fury amounting to quite literally absolutely nothing”.In the 80-minute speech, the president also claimed to have delivered a historic economic upturn at home, and rejected the idea of what he called the “new green scam”, of switching from fossil fuels to clean energy.“I want Europe to do great, I want UK to do great; they’re sitting on one of the greatest energy sources in the world and they don’t use it,” he said. “There are windmills all over Europe, there are windmills all over the place, and they are losers.”He reeled off a list of what he said were US economic achievements over the first 12 months of his second term. These included what he called “virtually no inflation”, falling petrol prices, and rapid economic growth.He deployed openly nationalist rhetoric, boasting about his “100%” German and Scottish heritage, accusing Europe of destroying itself through “socially disruptive migration”, and saying that the “west cannot mass import foreign cultures, which have failed to ever build a successful society of their own”.The president claimed that under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, “we were a dead country. Now we are the hottest country anywhere in the world.”He also gave details about secret US military capabilities used during the recent capture of Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro during a raid on his fortified compound.“Two weeks ago, they saw weapons that nobody ever heard of. They weren’t able to fire one shot at us,” Trump said. “Everything was discombobulated. They said, we’ve got them in our sights. Press the trigger. And nothing happened … Those defensive systems were made by Russia and by China.”After his speech, Trump was due to hold a series of high-level meetings, including with the leaders of Poland, Switzerland and Egypt, and Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte. He is expected to meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday.Trump arrived late in Switzerland on Wednesday, afteran electrical fault on Air Force Oneforced him to switch planes, but cleared his diary to address the high-powered gathering on time.The president’s threat at the weekend toslap punitive tariffs on eight European countriesblamed for blocking his claim to Greenland has dominated discussions in Davos this week.Carneyused his Davos speech on Tuesdayto warn mid-sized countries to unite in the face of US “coercion”. “Middle powers must act together, because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu,” he said.Trump took direct aim at Carney in his speech, claiming Canada had been given “a lot of freebies” from the US. “Canada lives because of the US: remember that, Mark, next time you make your statements.”Carney was just one of a string of targets in the speech, which lasted well over an hour. These included Switzerland, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the outgoing Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, and the Somali-born congresswoman Ilhan Omar.By contrast, Trump said he had a “very good relationship with [Russia’s] President [Vladimir] Putin and President Xi [Jinping of China].”Explore more on these topicsDavosDavos 2026Trump administrationNatoGreenlandUS politicsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

But European consumers could balk at extra costs or restrictions on US companies, such as Apple or Netflix.The EU said it continued to work at diplomatic solutions to avert a trade war, while Lange conceded that “a lot could happen” between now and 2 February when Trump’s tariff threats are due to be realised. “There are always day-by-day surprises coming from the White House,” he said.While a trade war with the US would be highly damaging, the EU’s attempts to diversify its markets were also dealt a serious blow by parliament after MEPs voted, by a majority of just 10, to refer the Mercosur trade deal with Latin American countries to the European court of justice.The decision was condemned by Lange, while the European Commission said the decision was “regrettable”, as did Friedrich Merz, the chancellor of Germany, where car manufacturers also denounced the move.The European Commission has the power to implement the Mercosur agreement provisionally as it did with the Brexit trade deal with the UK. But Lange warned that if the Commission pressed ahead with such a move, it would plunge the bloc into “huge institutional conflict”.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionDonald TrumpTariffsEuropeInternational tradeGreenlandEuropean CommissionnewsShareReuse this content"

Thousands of male militants were detained in prisons, while women and children were moved to camps, from where some have been gradually repatriated while others have remained for years.The SDF remained in control, as an effective government in north-eastern Syria during the final years of al-Assad’s regime in Damascus. But when al-Assad was ousted in December 2024 by al-Sharaa’s Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), it led to an uncertain situation with the SDF unwilling to fully integrate into the new Syria.View image in fullscreenHumanitarian organisations said they had not been able to visit al-Hawl since Sunday, and were concerned the situation there could become more unstable.Photograph: Mohammed Al-Rifai/EPANanar Hawach, a Syria expert and analyst with Crisis Group, said there was a danger was “not a reborn caliphate but a dispersed insurgency rebuilding in the cracks”. Prison breaks “may have released experienced operatives into a contested security environment” between Syrian government and SDF forces, he said.On Tuesday, the US signalled it had abandoned its support for the SDF. Tom Barrack, the US special envoy for Syria, said: “The original purpose of the SDF as the primary anti-Isis force on the ground has largely expired” and Washington’s partner in holding down IS was the Damascus government.Though HTS has its origins as an offshoot of al-Qaida, the terror group, it has had a history of opposing IS, and cut its ties with al-Qaida in 2016. Before beginning its offensive on Damascus, al-Sharaa emphasised that HTS had moved on, though there has been sectarian violence targeting Alawite, Druze and Kurdish minorities.Hawach said that the new Syrian government “clearly wants to be seen as a counter-terrorism partner” – but he cautioned that “securing Isis detention facilities, managing camps like al-Hawl, and suppressing sleeper cells across newly acquired territory requires resources, discipline, and institutional capacity that the Syrian government is still building”.View image in fullscreenManaging camps such as al-Hawl ‘requires resources, discipline, and institutional capacity that the Syrian government is still building’, said Nanar Hawach, a senior analyst at Crisis Group.Photograph: Mohammed Al-Rifai/EPAA lightning offensiveby the Syrian government forces, starting over the weekend, led to rapid gains from the SDF. The city of Raqqa was captured on Sunday and the SDF agreed to hand over the provinces of Raqqa and Deir ez-Zorfor a ceasefire. That broke down almost immediately, and government forces made more gains.Al-Sharaa agreed to a fresh ceasefire on Tuesday, a day after he had spoken to Donald Trump. The US president said he had been “trying to protect the Kurds”, though it is unclear if the SDF will agree to al-Sharaa’s demands or risk another round of fighting.The SDF leader,Mazloum Abdi, had been given four days from Tuesday to consult Kurdish leaders over accepting the Syrian government’s demands for close integration with Damascus.Explore more on these topicsSyriaIslamic StateKurdsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

For years, Kurdish authorities and humanitarians have urged countries to take back their citizens from the camps and prosecute them at home, warning that conditions there were intolerable.The camp has been the subject of international concern as security experts say it is a hotbed of extremism and in the event of a jailbreak could help IS reconstitute itself in Syria and beyond.The Syrian government accused Kurdish forces of withdrawing and leaving the prison unguarded, which it said had led to the escape of some detainees.A similar scenariounfolded in Shaddadi prisonas the SDF withdrew in front of advancing forces, leading to 120 prisoners escaping. The SDF denied it had let any prisoners escape at either location.View image in fullscreenA drone view of al-Shaddadi prison after the withdrawal of the SDF and its takeover by the Syrian army.Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/ReutersThe takeover came as the US military said it had begun transferring IS detainees held in north-eastern Syria to Iraq to ensure they remained in secure facilities. US central command said the transfer began on Wednesday and so far 150 IS members had been taken from al-Hasakah province to “secure locations” in Iraq. “Ultimately, up to 7,000 Isis detainees could be transferred from Syria to Iraqi-controlled facilities,” the statement said.The Syrian defence ministry said on Tuesday it was ready to assume responsibility for al-Hawl and other IS detainee camps, and that it was taking the proper procedures to secure the facilities. It was in contact with the US-led international coalition to defeat IS, which helps guard the camps.The SDF still controls a number of prisons and detention camps for suspected members of IS, including al-Roj camp, where London-born Shamima Begum, who wasstripped of her British citizenshipby the UK government in 2019, is held. Sheleft London as a schoolgirland travelled in secret with two friendsto live under Islamic Statein 2015.The SDF has warned the international community over its ability to maintain control over IS detention facilities if it comes under attack by the Syrian government once again.Government forces have swept into north-east Syria over the past week, wresting control of vast swathes of territory. The SDF, which controlled about a third of Syria for the past seven years, lost most of the areas under its control, specifically the vast Arab-majority provinces of Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa.Fighting paused on Tuesday after the two sides reached a four-day ceasefire, which the Syrian government said was meant to give the SDF a grace period to implement a lasting agreement. The two sides had agreed to a 14-point peace plan in principle, under which the SDF would surrender most of its governing authorities to Damascus and integrate into the Syrian military while leaving Kurdish-majority areas in the north-east to be supervised by local security forces rather than the Syrian military.If the SDF fails to implement the 14-point agreement, fighting would restart between the two sides.The Kurdish force has little room to manoeuvre or to ask for more concessions as the US, its principal backer, has made it clear that it wants the Kurdish authority to be brought into the fold of the state.On Tuesday, the US Syria envoy, Tom Barrack, said the deal was an “opportunity” forKurdsin Syria to integrate into the Syrian state, and he urged the SDF to accept Damascus’s terms. The “original purpose” of the SDF as a force to fight IS had “largely expired”, Barrack said, as Damascus had become Washington’s primary partner in Syria.Explore more on these topicsSyriaKurdsIslamic StateMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

More recently, however, the initiative appears to have expanded well beyond that remit, with the Trump camp extending invitations to dozens of countries and suggesting the board could evolve into a vehicle for brokering conflicts far beyond the Middle East.Diplomats have warned that the board could harm the work of the UN.When asked by a reporter on Tuesday if the board should replace the UN, Trump said: “It might.”He said the world body “hasn’t been very helpful” and “has never lived up to its potential”, but also said the UN should continue “because the potential is so great”.Netanyahu’s office had previously objected to the makeup of the board’s executive committee, which includes Turkey, a regional rival ofIsrael. In a brief statement, it said the committee had been formed without coordination with the Israeli government and was “contrary to its policy”, without elaborating further.Far-right members of Israel’s governing coalition on Sundayrejected the US-backed plan for postwar governancein Gaza, criticising Netanyahu for failing to annex the Palestinian territory and establish new Israeli settlements there.However, on Sunday, Netanyahu’s office announced that he accepted the invitation of the US president.Countries that have already agreed to participate include the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Vietnam, Belarus, Hungary, Kazakhstan and Argentina. Others, among them the UK, Russia and the EU’s executive arm, have confirmed they have received invitations but are yet to respond.Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s top diplomatic official, on Wednesday said Pope Leo had also received an invitation. “I believe it will be something that requires a bit of time for consideration before giving a response,” he told reporters.A statement from the office of the Norwegian prime minister said it would not be joining the board, saying the proposal “raises a number of questions that requires further dialogue with the United States […] Norway will therefore not join the proposed arrangements.”A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the US administration calls for members to contribute $1bn in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to a document seen by Reuters.“Each member state shall serve a term of no more than three years from this charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the chairman,” states the document, first reported by Bloomberg News. “The three-year membership term shall not apply to member states that contribute more than $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the board of peace within the first year of the charter’s entry into force.”Diplomats warned that the proposed “board of peace” appears to take aim at existing international institutions, including the UN. The charter’s board says the committee must have “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”.Trump has long been a vocal critic of the UN and earlier this month announced that the US would withdraw from 66 international organisations and treaties, around half of which are affiliated with the UN system.Under the draft charter, membership of the board would be restricted to states invited by the chair. The chair would also be granted sweeping powers, including the authority to remove member states – subject to a two-thirds veto by the board – and to appoint a successor in the event of their own departure.The Associated Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaGazaPalestineTrump administrationUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Stablecoins are the way which money goes from conventional currencies through into cryptocurrencies and back again. Tether is about to be valued as a $500bn company.”Farage criticised Bailey for imposing restrictions on crypto and urged the UK to catch up with the US, where Donald Trump, who chose Howard Lutnick, Tether’s banker, as his commerce secretary, hasreversed effortsto police digital currencies.Farage added: “You know, stablecoins, crypto – this world is enormous, and I’ve been urging for years that London should embrace it. We should become a global trading centre for this stuff, under proper regulation.”One of Tether’s major shareholders, the tech investorChristopher Harborne, is Reform’s biggest donor. His lawyers said Harborne, who does not hold an executive post at Tether, is not responsible for illicit activities by its users. Suggestions that Harborne profits from Iran’s use of Tether stablecoins were “baseless drivel”, the lawyers said.A spokesperson for Reform UK said “many companies and organisations across the globe” use Tether. They added: “All donations to Reform UK comply with electoral law and regulations. We stringently vet each donation. We continue to actively support the Iranian people in their fight for freedom.”Booming demand for Tether’s stablecoin – known as USDT – has generated huge returns from the real-currency reserves the company holds to maintain its peg to the dollar. Tether’s $13bn annual profits are one-and-a-half times those of McDonald’s.Some of that demand comes fromillicit sources. In the face of US, UN and other sanctions that make it difficult to trade, buy foreign currency and hold accounts with most banks, it seems Iranians and their rulers have turned to Tether’s stablecoins.Last year, Israelrevealedwhat it said were dozens of crypto accounts used by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards.That prompted a prominent Iranian businessman to complain on X about the regime’s failure to keep its dealings secret. Hispost contained two crypto account numbersthe businessman said were used by Iran’s central bank.It was through this apparently inadvertent disclosure that Elliptic’s researchers found connections between 50 accounts, concluding with a “high level of confidence” that they were controlled by Iran’s central bank.Graphic showing quantity of Tether stablecoins linked to account said to be tied to Iran’s central bankA Tether representative did not address questions about Iranian central bank use of its stablecoins, but said: “Tether maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward the criminal use of our financial products.”The representative said Tether followed US sanctions guidelines. “We work closely with law enforcement globally to identify and promptly, upon request, freeze assets to prevent further movement whenever they are identified to be in connection to illegal activity or illicit actors.”They added that Tether has collaborated with more than 310 law enforcement agencies across 62 countries and frozen more than $3.4bn in assets “linked to criminal activity”.Tether has frozen the suspected Revolutionary Guards accounts identified by Israel last year but most of those that appear to have been used by the Iranian central bank seem to remain active.Explore more on these topicsIranCryptocurrenciesMiddle East and north AfricaE-commerceNigel FaragenewsShareReuse this content"

The UK had the highest relative increase for all ages, rising more than threefold from 0.12% to 0.39%. In the Netherlands, prevalence more than doubled, from 0.67% to 1.56%.The results of the study, which tracked methylphenidate, dexamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, atomoxetine and guanfacine, waspublishedin the Lancet Regional Health – Europe journal.Adult use increased substantially in all countries, particularly among women. In the UK, prevalence among people aged 25 and over increased from 0.01% in 2010 to 0.20% in 2023, with a more than 20-fold increase in women and 15-fold in men.Although ADHD medication use remained higher among males, the sex gap in treatment narrowed over time and with increasing age, the researchers said.“We observed a consistent increase in ADHD medication use across Europe, but the most striking changes were among adults, especially women,” said Xintong Li, the lead study author at Oxford. “These findings likely reflect growing awareness and diagnosis of adult ADHD, but they also raise important questions about long-term treatment patterns and care needs.”The results also suggested a much lower rate of ADHD medication use compared with the estimated rate of ADHD itself, which is thought to affect about 8% of children and adolescents and 3% of adults globally, the researchers said.They said while it was true that not everyone with ADHD required medication, the findings suggested a substantial proportion may not be doing so.Methylphenidate was the most commonly used medication across all countries. Newer treatments such as lisdexamfetamine and guanfacine showed steady uptake after market approval. However, continuation of treatment after initiation was relatively low, varying substantially between countries.The findings reflected growing recognition of ADHD as a lifelong condition and highlighted the need for healthcare systems to plan for rising demand, particularly amid ongoing ADHD medication shortages in parts of Europe, the researchers said.In the UK, the NHS is overspending by £164m a year on ADHD services, with an increasing amount going to unregulated private assessments, the Guardian reportedearlier this month.Analysis showed that total spending on NHS ADHD services was expected to be more than double existing budgets. Further data showed the amount spent on private ADHD services had more than tripled over three years.Prof Daniel Prieto-Alhambra, a senior author of the study, said: “Understanding how ADHD medications are being used in real-world clinical practice is essential for healthcare planning. These data can help health systems anticipate demand and reduce the risk of future medication shortages, while also highlighting populations that may need closer monitoring.”Explore more on these topicsAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderHealthDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

It represents a huge injection into a sector where Arts Council England (ACE) funding wascut by 30%in 2010, and follows a previously announced £270m.Nandy said: “We’re investing in every borough in the country because arts belongs to everybody and we are determined to ensure that wherever you live in the country, whatever your background, access to arts and culture belongs to you.”She said she believed this moment was comparable to theaftermath of the second world war, “when a generation of visionaries stepped forward and used the power of the arts to help light the way forwards for a very fractured, devastated notion”.The package also includes £160m to be invested in local and regional museums, and a £425m Creative Foundations Fund, which will be managed by ACE and will support about 300 capital projects at arts venues across the country.The heritage sector will get a further £230m, while public libraries can apply for £27.5m and national portfolio organisations will have an extra £80m available over the course of this parliament. Local and regional museums will get £160m.Darren Henley, the chief executive of ACE, said: “By continuing to fund our cultural infrastructure, the government is investing in our collective future in ensuring creative opportunities for generations to come.”While the plan was welcomed across the sector, there were dissenting voices. Mike Clancy, the general secretary of the Prospect union, said that package was wrong to focus solely on bricks and mortar institutions rather than those employed in the sector.He said: “Our culture is not just about artefacts, sites and buildings but about the people who bring it to life. This sector is facing an ongoing and intractable crisis in pay and retention which has to be addressed.”Nandy praised a recentreview of ACE by Margaret Hodge, which found there had been a “loss of respect and trust” for the council among those it backed, in part because of “perceived political interference in decision-making”. Hodge called for the scrapping of ACE’s “let’s create” strategy, which was due to run until the end of the decade.The culture secretary hinted she would back the recommendations when she officially responds in the next month, calling it “a really welcome shake-up of a sector that has been underfunded, undervalued and underutilised for too long”.Explore more on these topicsArts fundingMuseumsArts Council EnglandLisa NandynewsShareReuse this content"

The crossbench peer Baroness Kidron, who supports Conservative peer Lord Nash’s amendment in the House of Lords, is right to say Starmer’s approach ‘is not leading; it is not governing’. He is ‘doing nothing – slowly’, which is ‘the very epitome of party before country’.Let’s just get on with it.”She added: “Putting our children’s mental health first is the right thing to do. How much longer will we have to wait until the government agrees?”After the Lords vote passed, John Nash, a former schools minister and Tory peer, said: “Tonight, peers put our children’s future first. This vote begins the process of stopping the catastrophic harm that social media is inflicting on a generation.“Medical professionals, intelligence officers, police officers, teachers and hundreds of thousands of parents clearly demanded action, and the Lords have listened.”TheConservativesmade no moves towards banning social media during their time in government, though the Online Safety Act placed more obligations on internet and social media providers to protect children from harmful content.However, Badenoch said the consensus had shifted, with campaigners, clinicians, parents and experts now aligned against allowing under-16s access to social media. She also argued some internet restrictions for adults could be lifted if children were more protected from social media.She said her party believed in freedom but that the ability to make good choices was not yet fully formed in children, who did not have the necessary impulse control, emotional regulation and ability to assess risks.On Sunday, the Guardian revealed thatmore than 60 Labour MPs have written to Starmerurging him to back a social media ban for under-16s, including select committee chairs, former frontbenchers and MPs from the right and left of the party.In the letter, which was organised by Fred Thomas, the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, the MPs say: “Across our constituencies, we hear the same message: children are anxious, unhappy, and unable to focus on learning. They are not building the social skills needed to thrive, nor having the experiences that will prepare them for adulthood.”On Wednesday another letter from campaignersurged parliament to back a ban, with signatories including the actors Hugh Grant and Sophie Winklemanand Esther Ghey, the mother of Brianna Ghey, who was murdered by two teenagers in Warrington, Cheshire, in 2023. It said national polling by the charity Parentkind had found 93% of parents thought social media was harmful to children and young people.It said: “No other amendment to the bill on this topic has the same cross-party support or would deliver promptly the change needed to get children off social media.”Explore more on these topicsSocial media banKemi BadenochKeir StarmerConservativesLabourSocial media bansSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

That speed, possible with the satellites’ planned optical communications, is extreme by consumer standards and would make the network key for data processing and large-scale government programs. Blue Origin said the network would be meant to serve a maximum of roughly 100,000 customers.The reveal of TeraWave coincides with a space industry rush to build data centers in space that can meet the soaring demand for large-scale AI data processing, which on Earth requires immense energy and resources as adoption of the technology expands.The planned network adds another satellite constellation linked to Bezos, executive chairperson of Amazon, which is in an early phase of deploying Leo – a network formerly called Project Kuiper – involving 3,200 satellites providing internet to consumers and businesses.Musk’s Starlink network of roughly 10,000 satellites is farthest ahead in a global push to put internet infrastructure in space, where swarms of low-orbiting satellites offer more security and higher connection speeds than traditional, unitary satellites farther out in space.TheSpaceXCEO has said he plans to build data centers in space, complementing the Starlink network, while Bezos has predicted such space-based centers will be commonplace in orbit within the next 10 to 20 years.Starlink, which has reported more than 6 million customers across at least 140 countries, targets individual consumers, businesses, governments and, with its Starshield variant, US national security agencies. Amazon Leo, with 180 satellites in space so far, has a similar customer strategy.A handful of Chinese companies are swiftly deploying similar satellite networks to get up to pace with Starlink, which has proved key for remote communications and geopolitical conflicts. China is developing new reusable rockets that can loft thousands of these satellites over the next several years for lower costs, a playbook first written by Musk’s SpaceX and its reusable Falcon 9 rocket.Blue Origin’s reusable New Glenn rocket, which has launched twice but has been slow to achieve a rapid flight rate, will likely be a vital part of TeraWave’s deployment.Unlike Starlink, the planned network appears off-limits to individual consumers, according to Blue Origin’s statement.Blue Origin’s statement said: “TeraWave enterprise-grade user and gateway terminals can be rapidly deployed worldwide and interface with existing high-capacity infrastructure, providing additional route diversity and strengthening overall network resilience,” leaving unclear what types of existing infrastructure the network can work with.Explore more on these topicsJeff BezosSpaceBlue OriginAI (artificial intelligence)SpaceXnewsShareReuse this content"

The supreme court’s decision on the case will test the limit of Trump’s powers as leader of the executive branch.TheTrump administrationis waging an unprecedented battle with the Fed over interest rates, after policymakers defied the president’s repeated calls for drastic cuts.The Department of Justice has been widely criticized this month forlaunching a criminal investigationinto Jerome Powell, the US central bank’s chairman. While it is pursuing Powell over renovations to the Fed’s historic office buildings in Washington DC, he has argued he is being targeted for not “following the preferences of the president”.Powell was in attendance at Wednesday’s hearing, according toreports.The line of questioning during Wednesday’s oral arguments highlighted the extraordinary nature of the case: Trump’sattempt to remove Cooklast summer marked the first time in US history that a president fired a sitting Fed governor. Cook was appointed by Joe Biden in 2022, becoming the first woman of color to serve on the Fed’s board. Her term is set to be completed in 2038, as Fed governors serve 14-year terms.The administration has alleged that Cook committed mortgage fraud by misrepresenting multiple properties as her primary residence to get a better mortgage rate – an accusation which initially came from Bill Pulte, a close Trump ally and head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has instigatedsimilar investigationsagainst others, including the New York attorney general, Letitia James, and Democrat senator Adam Schiff.Cook’s lawyers haveaccusedthe administration of “cherrypicking” information, and argued that Cook accurately listed her property on other loan documents. The discrepancy the administration is focused on is an “inadvertent mistake”, they said.Federal statute says that removal of a Fed official must be “for cause”, though it does not specify what constitutes “cause”, or what procedures the White House should follow when it believes there is reason for firing.The opaqueness of the law, and the unprecedented nature of this case, gives the justices a lot of room for discretion and, ultimately, will set the standard for the power the White House can wield over the Fed, which has typically operated independently from political interference.Lawyers for Cook point out that there was little formalized process involved in Cook’s firing. Broad mortgage fraud allegations were posted on social media, no formal investigation was launched and there were no hearings over the allegations.On Wednesday, a majority of justices expressed concern about the fate of the Fed’s independence. Kavanaugh also seemed particularly sensitive to the Fed’s structure within the federal government, at one point directly asking John Sauer, Trump’s solicitor general: “What, in your view, is the purpose of that independence?”Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked why there was no hearing over the allegations the administration made against Cook. “If one step you could take to reduce irreparable harm to show that there really was cause is just to have a hearing, why not?” she asked. Sauer responded the White House believes that “adequate process was already provided”.The court will have to choose how narrowly it wants to decide the case. A ruling, for example, could say that the federal government did not follow adequate processes when it fired Cook specifically. But it could make an even broader statement about the independence of the Fed, and the protections it believes its officials have.Paul Clement, a lawyer for Cook, told the judges that one way to decide the case is to say there was insufficient process. “I think that would be a very simple way to decide this case, I think perhaps the defect … is that it probably maximizes the chance that it gets back here on the merits,” he said. “Whereas, if you decided to go a little further and say something substantive, it might bring all of this to an end.”Trump as president has enjoyed wielding seemingly unlimited power from the executive branch, including allowing the so-called “department of government efficiency” to fire tens of thousands of federal workers and defund programs across the government.Legal experts believe that the note suggests, softly, that the court may give special protections to the Fed, and its officials, that are not granted to other government agencies. Last spring, supreme court justices briefly mentioned the Fed in an unrelated ruling around two labor officials Trump had fired. “The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,” theywrote.Congress created the Fed in 1913 and gave it a unique structure that made it moreindependentthan other parts of the executive branch. It does not receive funding directly from Congress. Its Federal Open Market Committee sets interest rates at eight scheduled meetings a year.Economic research has shown that a truly non-partisan central bank, unswayed by politics, is essential in keeping economies and markets stable. That has not stopped Trump from embarking on a public campaign to get Fed officials to lower rates, a move he says would accelerate growth.The president has repeatedly made public attacks against Powell, who he has called “a stupid person”, and last spring privately told advisers that he wanted to fire Powell. While Trump backed down when markets dipped at news that he could fire Powell, he continued his relentless campaign.Fed officials have resisted playing along with Trump’s desired agenda. The Fed has what it calls a “dual mandate” to manage inflation and unemployment. Raising interest rates can stabilize high prices at the risk of causing unemployment.Out of the eight rate-setting meetings the Fed held last year, economists lowered rates at only three of them, bringing rates down to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%. Fed officials, including Powell, have cautioned that Trump’s policies, including mass deportations and increased tariffs, have been influencing prices and the labor market, and increasing uncertainty in the economy.On Wednesday, after the hearing, Cook said in a statement that the Trump administration’s case against her “is about whether theFederal Reservewill set key interest rates guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure”.Explore more on these topicsUS supreme courtUS economyFederal ReserveTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Anything less would license future newsroom raids and normalize censorship by search warrant.”The Post filed two motions in US district court for the eastern district of Virginia. In addition to requesting the government return the materials, the newspaper also asked for an order instructing the government to keep copies of the material under seal – and not review them – until the matter is resolved.“The Post and Natanson have an undeniable interest in, and need for, the seized data,” lawyers for the newspaper wrote. “Withholding this data would harm them irreparably, violate their constitutional rights, and constitute an unlawful prior restraint. Return is the only adequate remedy.”The seizure related to a government contractor, Aurelio Perez-Lugones, who is currently in federal custody in Maryland after being charged with unlawfully retaining national defense information.Last week, the group Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed a memo with the court urging the unsealing of all judicial records related to the raid of Natanson’s home, including the search warrant used, the application and the supporting affidavit.Bruce D Brown, the organization’s president, said in a statement on Wednesday: “This is the first time in US history that the government has searched a reporter’s home in a national security media leak investigation, seizing potentially a vast amount of confidential data and information.“The move imperils public interest reporting and will have ramifications far beyond this specific case. It is critical that the court blocks the government from searching through this material until it can address the profound threat to the first amendment posed by the raid.”The Post said the devices seized by the government “contain years of information about past and current confidential sources and other unpublished newsgathering materials, including those she was using for current reporting” – and that very little of the seized material relates to the warrant issued in the case, which relates specifically to the government contractor at issue.“The government cannot meet its heavy burden to justify this intrusion, and it has ignored narrower, lawful alternatives,” the Post’s lawyers wrote.Because her work devices were seized, Natanson no longer has the ability to communicate with her sources, the Post argued. “Nor are Natanson’s confidential sources likely to work with her again, if the government is permitted to rummage through her files unchecked.”Natanson has not published any stories since the raid. In late December, shepublished a first-person essayabout her reporting process and interactions with anonymous government sources.The attorney general, Pam Bondi, has defended the raid. “The first amendment is a bedrock principle, but this isn’t about that,” she said in an appearance on Fox News last week. “This is about classified material that could jeopardize lives.”Explore more on these topicsMediaWashington PostUS press and publishingTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Over the succeeding months, Carreyrou exposed how the testing devices Holmes said could perform a variety of medical tests with just a drop of blood were not actually being used to perform most of the analyses.After scrutiny from regulators, Theranos started to retract its tests and recall its machines. Holmes stepped down as CEO in June 2018, with the company dissolving soon after. That same year, the US government charged Holmes and her co-executive Sunny Balwani with defrauding both investors and patients, and making false claims about the effectiveness of the company’s technology.Trump hasgranted clemencyto more than 1,600 people since beginning his second term, most for their involvement in theJanuary 6 attackon the US Capitol.

When even millionaires, like us, recognise that extreme wealth has cost everyone else everything else, there can be no doubt that society is dangerously teetering off the edge of a precipice.”According to Forbes, Donald Trump assembled the richest cabinet in US history last year after being re-elected as president, withan estimated joint worth last August of $7.5bn (£5.6bn).A poll conducted for the Patriotic Millionaires group, whocampaign for higher taxes on the super-rich, found that 77% of millionaires from G20 countries think extremely wealthy individuals buy political influence.The survey, of 3,900 people in G20 countries with more than $1m in assets, excluding their homes, also found that three-fifths think Trump has had a negative impact on global economic stability (the poll was conducted before the US presidentthreatened new tariffs at the weekendagainst European countries if a deal to acquire Greenland was not reached).More than 60% of those surveyed were concerned that extreme wealth was a threat to democracy. Two-thirds supported higher taxes on the super-rich to invest in public services, with only 17% opposed.The development charity Oxfam reported this week thata record number of billionaires were created last year, taking the global total to more than 3,000 for the first time.“Last year the rise in billionaire wealth was unprecedented,” said the executive director of Oxfam International, Amitabh Behar.“The super-rich are being given complete free rein. It is beyond comprehension that the richest 1% now own three times more than the world’s total public wealth combined.“It’s a stark indictment that illustrates just how nonsensical the gulf now is between oligarchs and the rest of humanity. Governments must implement taxes on the super-rich now and prioritise reducing inequality. The world cannot continue on this obscene trajectory.”26:57Why it is so hard to tax the super-rich – videoExplore more on these topicsBusinessDavos 2026Mark RuffaloThe super-richBrian EnonewsShareReuse this content"

Documents reveal new detailsRead moreIt didn’t take long for her connections to come through. On Tuesday night, the show featured an interview with Donald Trump, who had previously called Pavlich’s work onFox News“terrific”, “fantastic” and “great” in posts on social media.Pavlich, who guest-hosted on Fox’s The Five and filled in for the primetime hosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham during her 13 years as as contributor, will now be in charge of her own Washington DC-based program.This interview has been edited for clarity.Was it a difficult decision to leave Fox News? Was it something you had planned to do?I wouldn’t say it was a plan to leave Fox. I loved working there. I loved my colleagues. I still do love my colleagues, still have wonderful relationships with my Fox colleagues. Really developed an amazing rapport with the audience, covered a number of major world events with them, and was so grateful for all of the opportunity that I had with them through the years.And it just was a matter of, there wasn’t a real estate for me available at the time when NewsNation made their offer. And so this was an amazing opportunity for me to have my own show, which I’ve been working towards. When I went to broadcast journalism school, this was eventually a goal on the vision board.Is it fair to say you would have wanted to host a show for Fox, or have a full-time hosting role?Absolutely. Absolutely … At the time that I had to make a decision, NewsNation had this opportunity for me, and so I took it.How are you feeling about leaving your longtime home and starting somewhere new?Well, I’m really excited about NewsNation and I’m thrilled to be there and to be working with a brand new team, and especially in this very creative capacity where we’re building a show from the ground up. It’s really exciting and I’m learning a lot and working really closely with folks to figure out what our focus is and how we want to be different and how we’re going to really work to bring a different point of view to the network every night.But as I just said, I love Fox, I love my colleagues, and we all work in media, so I look forward to seeing them again.Are you hoping to bring along some of your Fox viewers?I would say I’m looking forward to bringing over Katie Pavlich viewers, and also breaking into new viewership and introducing myself to the NewsNation audience and the digital audience that comes with that. So I’m looking forward to reintroducing myself to people who maybe haven’t been as tuned in, and looking forward to introducing myself to new people.Do you consider yourself more of a commentator or a journalist?[During] my work over the last 16 years in journalism media, I’ve covered a number of different topics, events, huge stories, and my approach is always facts first and opinion second. And I am not afraid to say that I’m a conservative who views the world from a politically conservative place, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t be a journalist and be a reporter and look at a situation and circumstance based on the facts and then analyze it from there. So I actually think it is pretty straightforward.And I think my political leanings is a more honest way of approaching the news, and reporting the news, because an audience knows exactly where I’m coming from. And I think NewsNation, they’ve developed a network that is for all Americans, and that includes millions of Americans that think like me. So I think that my approach and style and record of that is a really good fit for them.Do you think you will be able to book some senior members of the Trump administration?Yeah, I think so. I think we’ll be able to get some pretty significant administration officials, cabinet-level members. Yeah, I definitely think so. I was in Washington DC during the first Trump administration, so this is the second rodeo, so to speak.Being based here will allow me to really work on providing that access to the people who are watching … We’re going to shoot for the stars and see where they fall – kind of thing. We’re going to work really hard to get people – the top names and newsmakers that they want to hear from. You can always ask, right?Are you looking forward to the challenge of hosting your own show?I always like to challenge myself and do things that are intellectually stimulating and to step up to that next level … I think it’s going to be really a good opportunity to flex my muscles.Do you plan to call out President Trump when you disagree with things he does?Yeah, there’ll certainly be times where I don’t agree with everything the administration is doing. I think that they could maybe doless letters on the White House saying the Rose Garden or the Oval Office. I disagree with that. I’m just joking.But yeah, there’ll be big policy disagreements, and when there are, we’ll talk about them and debate them in a factual, intellectual way.You’ve said thatCBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss has done “a pretty good job”.Do you think she’s been covered unfairly?Yeah, I think they’ve been too hard on her. I think that she was hired for a reason and changes have been made. I like what she’s doing with [CBS News anchor Tony Dokoupil], sending him out – I believe he was in Detroit [last] week for President Trump’s speech – which is important, for people to get out of their studios sometimes, and talk to people where they are.And she hasn’t been there that long. So I think just giving her some time to just re-balance and to tell stories from more angles, not fewer, and from more than one perspective is important.Explore more on these topicsMediaTrump administrationFox NewsTelevision industryTV newsUS politicsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Joe Gomez, deputising for the absent Ibrahima Konaté, ­delivered an accomplished display ­alongside ­Virgil van Dijk as the ­Liverpool ­captain made his 350th appearance for the club.Liverpool played with confidence and composure at a passionate Stade Vélodrome, where the noise started cranking up an hour and a half before kick-off and never let up. Slot deployed the midfield diamond formation that worked effectively in his team’s last European outing,away at Inter, but unlike that night at San Siro there was a place for Mohamed Salah. The Egypt international, dropped against Inter as a consequence of thatexplosive interview at Leeds, was straight back in the starting lineup following his return from the Africa Cup of Nations.“Let’s see the lineup tomorrow if you still think there’s an issue,” Slot had said at the pre-match press conference when asked about his relationship with Salah. The pertinent, unanswered questions concern Salah’s issues with Liverpool and Slot, however, not vice versa.Both teams wore black armbands and joined the applause before kick-off for the formerMarseilleplayer and manager Rolland Courbis, who died on 12 January. The pre-match buildup also featured an impressive tifo of the Beatles reading a copy of La Provence newspaper with the headline ‘Que l’histoire se répète’ – Let history repeat itself – above an image of Didier Drogba celebrating knocking Liverpool out of the Uefa Cup in 2004. The Marseille fans proved far more creative than their team.Quick GuideChampions League roundup: Kane secures Bayern's pathShowHarry Kane struck twice in three minutes to carryBayern Munichto a 2-0 victory over Belgium'sUnion Saint-Gilloisein the Champions League on Wednesday and book their ticket for the knockout stage with a game to spare.Bayern's top scorer headed in at the near post from a Michael Olise corner in the 52nd minute then and added another from the penalty spot after he was brought down. The England captain could have sealed his hat-trick in the 80th minute but hammered his second penalty on to the crossbar. The hosts were down to 10 men from the 64th minute after defender Kim Min-jae was sent off with a second booking. Bayern are in second spot in the league phase on 18 points with one game left to play.Barcelonacame from behind to defeatSlavia Prague4-2 on a freezing night in the Champions League on Wednesday, with Fermin López scoring twice and Dani Olmo and Robert Lewandowski adding second-half goals to secure the victory.Slavia stunned the visitors with a Vasil Kusej goal from a cleverly worked corner in the 10th minute but López equalised from close range in the 34th. He doubled his tally with a fine effort from the edge of the box but Barça's advantage lasted two minutes, with  Lewandowski deflecting a corner into his own goal.Hansi Flick's side took back control in the second half and strikes by Olmo and Lewandowski sealed a deserved win.Athletic Bilbaomounted a superb second-half comeback to defeatAtalanta3-2 and bring renewed hope of progression to the playoffs.Atalanta commanded the first half and opened the scoring  when Gianluca Scamacca headed firmly past Unai Simón. Bilbao grew into the game after the break and equalised through Gorka Guruzeta. Ernesto Valverde's side turned the match on its head in the 70th minute when the substitute Nico Serrano scored a well-taken goal two minutes after coming on.The momentum was all with the visitors, who added a third just four minutes later when Robert Navarro slotted the ball past Marco Carnesecchi. Atalanta clawed one back in the dying minutes through Nikola Krstovic scored but the surprise defeat leaves them needing a win against Union Saint-Gilloise to secure automatic qualification.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The hosts appeared more intimidated by the occasion than the visitors and, unusually for a De Zerbi team, struggled in possession. ­Liverpool carried the only serious threat in the first half. Alexis Mac Allister, who played under De Zerbi at Brighton, dragged an early chance just wide before Hugo Ekitiké converted following an incisive Liverpool counterattack. Ekitiké was just offside when sweeping Szoboszlai’s low cross under goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli, however.Marseille’s repeated mistakes drove their head coach to distraction. But credit to Liverpool for enforcing so many with their relentless pressing and by shutting off the options to the central defenders, Leonardo Balerdi and Facundo Medina. Another lapse, deep in Liverpool territory, gifted the visitors another counterattack that resulted in Salah flicking an audacious volley from Frimpong’s cross just over the bar.Liverpool’s deserved lead arrived after Balerdi, a persistent danger to his own team, felled Ryan Gravenberch just outside the Marseille area. There was a lengthy wait for the free-kick to be taken while the video assistant referee checked – and eventually cleared – a possible handball by Timothy Weah inside the box moments earlier. Szoboszlai ensured a spot-kick was unnecessary.View image in fullscreenJeremie Frimpong forces an own goal to double Liverpool’s lead.Photograph: Manon Cruz/ReutersSpotting Rulli stranded too far to the right of his goal, and the Marseille wall lining up without a draught excluder, the Liverpool midfielder swept the set piece underneath and inside the keeper’s left-hand post. For Szoboszlai, it was a ­welcome break having missed a penalty against Burnley on Saturday and been accused of disrespect in the FA Cup defeat of Barnsley.De Zerbi’s touchline anger was clearly channelled into his interval instructions as Marseille started the second half with greater intent. Mason Greenwood forced Alisson into a fine save with a shot that dipped from 25 yards. The former Manchester United forward also led a dangerous break that resulted in Hamed Traoré firing wastefully over with only the Liverpool keeper to beat.Greenwood’s two flashes sandwiched an excellent chance for ­Ekitiké to double Liverpool’s lead from an incisive Szoboszlai pass. The forward’s first-time hit cannoned against a post. Slot may have had flashbacks to his team’s failure to kill off Burnley when Florian Wirtz was denied by Rulli at his near post and Ekitiké sent another good opening over the bar.But those concerns were banished when Frimpong ensured the ­Marseille crowd fell silent for a second time. Wirtz and Ekitiké combined brilliantly before finding Mac ­Allister lurking in space. The midfielder sent Frimpong scurrying away from substitute Igor Paixão and his tenacity was rewarded when his low cross trickled inside the far post via touches off both Medina and Rulli. In ­stoppage time Gravenberch surged clear to present Gakpo with a clinical third. The scoreline reflected ­Liverpool’s superiority.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueMarseilleLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

At the next World Cup, in South Africa in 2010,people gathered in parksand open-air markets and hotel lobbies and unlicensed, makeshift bars in people’s garages. In Brazil, four years later,fans spilled from the bars on the Copacabanaor watched in restaurants or in streets closed for the occasion – not as if anybody was driving during the Seleção’sgames anyway.During the 2018 World Cup,Russia surprised visitors – and its own citizens– with its friendliness as spontaneous parties broke out all over the country. The reason the 2022 World Cup in Qatar didn’t entirely feel like a real World Cup is that those sorts of spontaneous soccer gatherings just didn’t seem to be happening, or not at the same scale, at any rate. The absence of hordes of supporters just milling about everywhere contributed to the feeling of being at a Potemkin World Cup.World Cups are a feeling. A sense that you’re at The Thing, a global convention on joy. That’s the sentiment the tournament evokes and bottles. It exists in the stadium, where it is studiously curated and ultimately makes everyWorld Cupsound and feel largely the same. But it exists outside the venues, too.Tickets, travel and Trump: How the 2026 World Cup is shaping up six months from the finalRead moreThis realization offers hope for the upcoming World Cup. Because there is opportunity in this edition’s unprecedented vastness. In the first World Cup staged in three countries; the first one contested by 48 teams. That there may be another way, a workaround.Ifthe shocking ticket pricesfor the actual World Cup will make it exclusive and inaccessible – as iswell established in these pages– something like a shadow World Cup may nevertheless emerge as an alternative.With a tall wall built around the genuine article, scalable only by a bundle of money, a kind of bootleg version may be fashioned out of the scraps and flashes of the tournament that have not yet been privatized and premium-ified. A lower-case world cup, as it were, consisting of fan fests and open training sessions and pre-tournament warmup matches. The bits not yet sold off to the highest bidder via the Visa pre-sale lottery peddling a bespoke, once-in-a-lifetime experience brought to you by Coca-Cola and Aramco and whomever else.There will still be an awful lot of World Cup-adjacent programming on offer around the tournament. And that means there’s opportunity to make the World Cup accessible, in a way, to people who can’t afford or access the full experience, financially or geographically.View image in fullscreenArgentina fans celebrate on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro during the 2014 World Cup.Photograph: Silvia Izquierdo/APFor a start, all 48 of those participants will be training somewhere, and will presumably hold a few open training sessions – an easy way for federations to score PR points in a coveted market. Germany willhold its training camp at Wake Forest Universityin North Carolina. Australia’sSocceroos might be based in Boise. The Netherlands, England and Argentina are allrumored to be headed for Kansas City. Francewill be based in Boston;Croatia in Alexandria, Virginia; andSpain apparently in Chattanooga.There may yet be teams who choose to train in Birmingham, Alabama; Westfield, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; Oklahoma City; Tucson; or Stillwater, Oklahoma, depending on which of Fifa’sproposed training facilitiesthey pick.Taken together, they will expand the World Cup’s footprint enormously.So, too, will the many pre-tournament tune-up games. Plenty of teams will choose to play their final friendlies at home, or at someone else’s home, but a great many will use the occasion to acclimate to the US. (Albeit not exactly to any of the host cities, becauseFifarules preclude the pre-World Cup exhibitions from being played at any of the venues where the tournament proper will be played, for some reason.)The “Road to ’26” series will pit Brazil, France, Colombia and Croatia up and down the East Coast in March. Argentina will play a pair of stateside friendlies in June against Honduras and Mexico, at undecided locations. The US will play newly crowned African champions Senegal in Charlotte on 31 May and Germany in Chicago on 6 June.More games will be announced. And tickets cannot be priced as prohibitively as the World Cup proper. (Surely. Right?!)The World Cup is about places and people. In Seattle, it should be about Pride | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreFan fests, meanwhile, those old staples of World Cup place-making, typically attracting tens of thousands of unticketed fans, are planned all over the country. And right now, all but New York City’s and New Jersey’s are expected to be free,per Front Office Sports. The latter will reportedly charge $12.50 to cover their costs of as much as $1m a day. (Since,as The Independent reported, the host cities have almost no avenues for recuperating their substantial World Cup costs, as Fifa devours almost all the revenue.) The festivalplanned for Rockefeller Centerduring the final two weeks of the tournament, however, will be free. New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani already isfreelancing watch-parties for major soccer gamesand promising to host more.If host cities, federations and US Soccer get creative, and if a concerted effort is made, this can still be a World Cup that a lot of people can touch. It can still leave a legacy and make memories beyond those lucky few who managed to get tickets.

Before a wheel has turned in anger, there are fears that Mercedes – who also provide engines to the defending champions McLaren, Williams and Alpine – andRed Bullhave gained a vital advantage.The new generation of hybrid engines are likely to be the key to performance in 2026 and a dispute over how Mercedes, Red Bull, Honda – who are supplying Aston Martin – Ferrari and Audi have built their new units has been growing during the close season. There is mounting apprehension that Mercedes and Red Bull may have found a way to gain as much as between 0.3 and 0.4 seconds of a lap – a huge advantage in F1 terms – over their competitors.The technical gain is centred around engine compression ratios, the difference between the maximum and minimum volume of the cylinder during the piston stroke. This season it is set at 16:1, measured at an ambient temperature when the car is at rest, but other manufacturers believe Mercedes and Red Bull have used materials that give them an edge. When running on a track, they take advantage of the thermal expansion of components to increase the compression ratio and an engine’s power but adhere to the rules when not running.It is understood that Ferrari, Audi and Honda were so alarmed that they have written to the FIA and their concerns will now be aired at the meeting.View image in fullscreenHonda’s Toshihiro Mibe (right) shares his thoughts with Aston Martin’s Lawrence Stroll at the Japanese manufacturer’s F1 launch in Tokyo.Photograph: Takashi Aoyama/Getty ImagesRed Bull are developing their own engines for the first time and their technical director, Ben Hodgkinson, who worked on Mercedes’ engines for 20 years, was bullish that all their works was entirely within the rules. If their rivals had missed a trick, it was their failing not Red Bull’s.“I know what we’re doing. I’m confident that what we’re doing is legal,” he said. “Of course, we’ve taken it right to the very limit of what the regulations allow. I’d be surprised if everyone hasn’t done that.“Any engineer that doesn’t understand about thermal expansion doesn’t belong in this sport, doesn’t deserve to be an engineer really. Understanding how materials behave in different temperatures, pressures, stresses, loads – that’s literally our job.”That this was no small matter was emphasised by Honda as they launched their new engine. “Regulations do not have everything listed very clearly, bit by bit,” their chief executive, Toshihiro Mibe, said.“There is a lot of room for interpretation as well and this is a part of the race. So for the FIA, it’s up to them to decide on whether it’s good or bad. For Honda, we have a lot of different ideas, and we would like to discuss with the FIA to understand if our ideas are accepted or are not OK.”View image in fullscreenAudi launch their new F1 car in Dresden but behind the scenes the German team are troubled by rivals’ interpretation of new engine regulations.Photograph: PA Wire/PATetsushi Kakuda, Honda’s F1 project leader, went further in admitting their powerunit development was “not necessarily” going as expected. Koji Watanabe, president of Honda Racing Corporation, warned that the regulations were challenging and that “perhaps we will struggle”.All of which will concern Aston Martin, and at Ferrari if they find themselves off the pace in what in the worst case scenario might almost be a two-tier field.With Audi also building their power unit for the first time, they expressed their misgivings at their car launch on Tuesday night in Dresden. “If it’s real, it is certainly a significant gap in terms of performance and lap time, and that would make a difference when we come to competition,” their chief operating officer, Mattia Binotto, said. The German team’s technical director, James Key, was already looking to the FIA. “I think if it’s sort of bypassing the intent of the regulations, then it has to be in some way controlled,” he said. “We trust the FIA to do that.”Crucially, it is unlikely there will be any change to the measurement procedures nor regulations in the short term. Although the FIA has stated that the regulations could at some point be revised. For the moment, however, if Mercedes, their customers and Red Bull really do enjoy a significant advantage in the early races, it might yet prove a gulf that cannot be bridged.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Mercedes GPRed BullFormula OneMotor sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

Our goal is to have all national Olympic committees represented at the Games.”However, Coventry does expect to meet the US vice-president, JD Vance, before the opening ceremony of the Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics on 6 February.“As it pertains to the USA, we have not had formal communication just yet with the White House,” she said. “We have seen the formal announcement of president Trump’s team. We look forward to meeting the vice-president.”But at a press conference in Lausanne, Coventry did stress Olympic values and spoke of countries coming together in harmony – which sounded like a quiet rebuke to the US administration.“We will work extremely hard in order to protect theOlympic Gamesand the platform for the Olympic Games,” she said. “Because it showcases how we can live and a way of understanding each other. You don’t have to speak the same language in order to understand what each other is trying to achieve, or have an appreciation for each other. And for me, especially in today’s world, these are values that we need to ensure we are protecting.”The US is also co-hosting the World Cup this year, with Gianni Infantino, the president of Fifa, having repeatedly met Trump at the White House and controversially awarded him a peace prize in December.Asked whether she could learn from Infantino’s approach, Coventry said: “If we weren’t seeing good relations six months before the World Cup I would get worried. As we get closer to the Olympics you will see the relations continue … and only get stronger.”Meanwhile the Olympic Games executive director, Christophe Dubi, admitted there was still some work to be done on the sliding track in Cortina, as well as on the concourse and the temporary works in the ice hockey arena. However, he insisted that all venues for the Winter Olympics would be ready in time.“With sliding, we cannot deny that work needs to be done,” Dubi said. “For the hockey, the works inside the concourse and the temporary works which by nature are last minute, will be ready in a matter of days. But they are still working. There is a lot of confidence and workers on the ground. So we’ll be ready to host the best athletes.”Explore more on these topicsLA Olympic Games 2028Donald TrumpOlympic GamesSport politicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The two are now major figures in the NFC South after Atlanta hired Stefanski as head coach on Saturday.The pass of the century then brutal reality: the football gods won’t let the Bears have nice thingsRead moreMayfield appeared to be angered after an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter posted that Stefanski said Mayfield and another Browns quarterback, Deshaun Watson, had “failed” in Cleveland.“Failed is quite the reach pal. Still waiting on a text/call from him after I got shipped off like a piece of garbage,” Mayfield posted on social media on Tuesday. “Can’t wait to see you twice a year, Coach.”The Browns drafted Mayfield, a Heisman Trophy winner at Oklahoma, first overall in 2018. He played four seasons in Cleveland, passing for 3,725 yards in his first season and throwing and a then-NFL rookie record 27 touchdown passes. In Stefanski’s first season in 2020, Mayfield led the Browns to the playoffs for the first time in 17 years and their first postseason victory in 26 seasons.But Mayfield also struggled with consistency – throwing 22 TD passes and 21 interceptions in 2019 – and wasn’t afraid to confront critics of his play.After being traded to the Panthers, then spending time with the Los Angeles Rams, Mayfield found himself at a crossroads. But he has turned his career around with Tampa Bay, being named to the Pro Bowl twice and leading the Buccaneers to the playoffs in 2023 and 2024 before a late-season collapse that kept the Bucs out of this year’s postseason.Stefanski, a two-time AP Coach of the Year, coached the Browns for six years before he was fired after this season. The Falcons hired him less than two weeks later.Explore more on these topicsCleveland BrownsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Both golfers lodged appeals against the sanctions in 2024 but the cases are still to he heard. Rahm has been adamant he will not pay fines. The issue has potential to cause a headache forLuke ­Donald should he, as expected, remain as the European captainfor the 2027 Ryder Cup.Foul play? Seve Ballesteros statue vanishes from hometown in SpainRead moreMcIlroy was typically forthright when asked whether Rahm and Hatton should settle the debt due to theEuropean TourGroup. “Yes, absolutely,” the Masters champion said. “We went really hard on the Americans about being paid to play the Ryder Cup and we also said that we would pay to play in Ryder Cups. There’s two guys that can prove it.”McIlroy’s sentiment is believed to be shared by other senior figures among Europe’sRyder Cupcontingent. “I think any organisation or any members’ organisation like this has a right to uphold its rules and regulations,” McIlroy said.“What the DP World Tour are doing is upholding their rules and regulations. We, as members, sign a document at the start of every year, which has you agree to these rules and regulations. The people that made the option to go to LIV knew what they were. So I don’t see what’s wrong with that.”Intriguingly, McIlroy has Hatton, the defending champion, for company in rounds one and two this week at the Dubai Desert Classic. The Englishman shrugged off McIlroy’s comments. “I don’t have anything to add,” Hatton said.“I have always been extremely proud to be a member of the DP World Tour. It is pretty hard to make Ryder Cup teams and I have been fortunate to play in the last four. Hopefully I will be able to play more in the future, hopefully the only thing that stops me is age and younger talent taking my spot.“I don’t have an update to give. It’s still with legal teams and there’s guys that are still in conversations working it all out. So I haven’t put any more thought into that. I don’t really know what’s happening. I’m just here to play golf, as always.”View image in fullscreenTyrrell Hatton, the defending Dubai Desert Classic champion, said he had ‘nothing to add’ to Rory McIlroy’s comments about fines.Photograph: Warren Little/Getty ImagesMcIlroy also reiterated his belief that a unified sport – where the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and LIV operate in alignment – remains impossible. Talks between the PGA Tour and LIV broke down last year.“I would say that is solution A,” McIlroy said of unification. “It matters. But I just don’t see a world where it can happen at this point. I definitely think the traditional tours, if you want to call them that, have weathered the worst of the storm.“I don’t see a world where the two or three sides will give up enough. For reunification to happen, every side is going to feel like they will have lost, where you really want every side to feel like they have won. I think they are just too far apart for that to happen. I think relationships are better, but at the same time, that doesn’t necessarily mean that every organisation will give up in its own best interests.”Explore more on these topicsEuropean TourRory McIlroyLIV Golf SeriesRyder CupGolfnewsShareReuse this content"

This was only a third start since his latest return began with the second 45 minutes of the goalless draw at Sunderland on New Year’s Day. Last week Rodri declared he was “ready to go” and said: “I’m really happy to be on the pitch every single day.” Yet inSaturday’s 2-0 loss at Manchester Unitedhe was a one-paced, non-factor unable to do what he did with ease pre‑anterior cruciate ligament rupture: run midfield and so the contest. InTuesday’s 3-1 humbling in Norwaythe Spaniard was the same, and two moments tell the tale of his form. First Jens Petter Hauge left him a statue before registering a memorable long-range strike for Bodø’s third goal; then came the two yellow cards in two minutes that had Rodri sent off.Haaland hit by scoring strugglesYou have to go back a full month for the last time Erling Haaland netted other than from the penalty spot, with two goals against West Ham inManchester City’s 3-0 win. His sole strike in eight games since was inthe 1-1 draw against Brightonon 7 January, the goal-glutton somehow failing to register even whenExeter were given a 10-1 beatingin the FA Cup third round. After the Bodø defeat, a sour return for Haaland to his native country, he was asked about the fallow run. “I don’t have the answers,” he said. “I take full responsibility for not being able to score the goals I should do.” Haaland branded the loss “embarrassing” and he and City’s other three members of the captaincy group agreed that the 374 travelling fans should be reimbursed their tickets for the game – a sum of £9,357. The 25-year-old has 20 goals in the Premier League (in 22 games) and six in seven Champions League appearances, part of a phenomenal 26 in 31 matches in all competitions. So maybe it is time merely for a breather and for Omar Marmoush to have a game or two as the City spearhead.View image in fullscreenManchester City’s Erling Haaland has not scored from open play since mid December.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersGuardiola grasping for explanationsIn the Aspmyra Stadion’s below-freezing conditions City’s manager seemed a man petrified by his side’s tameness, unable to affect their fortunes whatever he tried. Example: at 2-0 down at the start of the second half he briefly switched to a wingback system that had Phil Foden on the left and Rayan Aït-Nouri on the right but this soon vanished, as did any true hope when Hauge made it 3-0. After the final whistle Guardiola was left grasping for an explanation for a run that shows zero league wins in 2026. “When we started New Year’s Day we missed [chances] and after then came injuries and Matheus [Nunes] has flu,” he said. “Many things are against us. Now, because we lost important players we lost a little bit, but in general the tone of the team was much better against Bodø than United.” For the trip to the Arctic Circle the list of absentees ran to 11: Josko Gvardiol, Nunes, Rúben Dias, Nico González, Savinho, Jérémy Doku, Oscar Bobb, Antoine Semenyo, John Stones, Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva. The insipid manner of the defeat – as at United – concerns the manager.Foden a shadow of himselfThe last of City’s Big Four who should be disappointed in a downward trajectory on the performance graph is Foden, who is playing more like the brother of the “Stockport Iniesta” than the player who shone earlier in the season. Substituted at half-time of the derby defeat, he again did not last the full game at Bodø, being removed on 70 minutes. This season Foden has 10 goals in 30 appearances and four assists: not shabby, except he last scored five and a half weeks ago and last created a goal eight days earlier. The hope will be that Foden, Rodri, Haaland and Guardiola are experiencing an unfortunate midwinter slump at the same time, rather than this being part of a deeper, more fundamental malaise. Off the field it is the manager’s problem to understand and solve, but on the pitch Foden and the rest, as City’s main actors, have to take the lead or the team will not “be there” in April and May, as Guardiola likes to say – in the hunt for the title, Champions League and FA Cup.View image in fullscreenPep Guardiola and Phil Foden have struggled to find answers to City’s problems.Photograph: Dave Thompson/AP… some good news: Guéhi is in the buildingSigning a 25-year-old first-choice England defender entering his prime yearsfor £20mwill prove a coup if Marc Guéhi can perform as slickly as he has for his country and when captaining Crystal Palace – particularly when leading the club tolast season’s FA Cup win. Guéhi’s calm head and nimble pace have arrived just when City required a fillip, because a big factor in the faltering form are the injuries to Gvardiol, Dias and Stones, the frontline centre-backs. With Abdukodir Khusanov, 21, improving in the middle of the rearguard via a blend of aggression and speed, Guéhi and the Uzbekistan international could emerge from the team’s torpor as an A-list partnership that will cover for the prolonged absence of Gvardiol and Dias.Explore more on these topicsManchester CityPep GuardiolaanalysisShareReuse this content"

At street level, the city appears to be like any other – yet it continues to produce league-shaping NBA players. The main highway through Dallas cleaves down the middle of Texas. Taking it south brings you closer to the center of the state’s basketball talent pool. The road slopes downward as the city’s cosmopolitan polish thins out, neighborhoods split cleanly from downtown by sun-baked concrete and beige. Pink, green, and blue houses sit behind chain link fences, where yards are scoured down to dirt. Auto mechanic shops line the frontage roads with open bays and hand-painted signs peeling in the sun. Farther south, the road dips again, and space opens up to the heart of the story.Welcome to Duncanville.By then, you’re already deep inside a suburb that’s transformed its high school system into an NBA pipeline. Duncanville isn’t an outlier. It’s the clearest expression of how serious NorthTexashas become about harvesting basketball lightning. Dallas is the incubator. Duncanville is the headquarters.Two of the nation’s most important high school basketball buildings sit here. First,Duncanville High Schoolholds more basketball memory than some professional arenas. State titles in 2019, 2021, and 2025, led by NBA rising stars Anthony Black and Ron Holland II, hang as proof. Few public high school programs in the country have consistently produced more NBA players than Duncanville, which has provided the league with six pros in the last five years.But not all hoops history is clean. The University Interscholastic League (UIL), Texas’s governing body for public-school athletics,stripped Duncanville’s 2022 Class 6A championshipafter eligibility violations tied to improper enrollment and academic ineligibility, including issues related to Black’s grades. Had that title remained, Duncanville would have been credited with three consecutive state championships (2019, 2021, and 2022); the 2020 season was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Such a distinction, unmatched by any other Texas Class 6A boys’ program in the modern era, would have formally inscribed the school as a rare three-peat champion in UIL records.That season, Duncanville became the first Texas school to becrowned MaxPreps National Championsince 2010. During the early 2020s, Duncanville and nearby Richardson High School were not only the two highest-ranked schools in Texas but also, at one point,ranked first and second in the entire nation. Those two teams featured three future NBA lottery picks and produced five NBA players between them.Since 2020, Dallas-Fort Worth has produced multipleNBAlottery picks: Black (sixth overall in 2023); Cason Wallace (10th overall in 2023); Holland (fifth overall in 2024); and Tre Johnson (sixth overall in 2025).Life after LeBron James: who will inherit the NBA’s future?Read moreNorth Texas has also cultivated rising stars drafted outside the 14 lottery spots, including Liam McNeeley, Keyonte George, Ja’Kobe Walter and Marcus Sasser. Then there are the two superstars: the Philadelphia 76ers’ Tyrese Maxey, who starred at South Garland High School, and 2021 No 1 pick Cade Cunningham – both All-Star starters this year. Born and raised in nearby Arlington, Cunningham played his first two years of high school ball at Bowie High School before transferring and eventually being drafted first overall by the Detroit Pistons. He was the first No 1 overall pick from the Dallas-Fort Worth area in more than 20 years, since Kenyon Martin in 2000.Digging further past the high school,the highway delivers you to the second basketball mecca:Duncanville Fieldhouse. For decades the building, a state-of-the-art sports facility and events venue with six full-sized hardwood basketball courts, has functioned as both proving ground and sanctuary – a cathedral of sweat. College coaches, NBA scouts and generations of future pros have cycled through its courts, long before anyone knew their names – Trae Young, De’Aaron Fox, Desmond Bane – stacking eras atop one another in a living archive of Dallas basketball.View image in fullscreenAnthony Black won multiple titles at Duncanville High School before landing in the NBA.Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty ImagesCome back next weekend, and you could be watching a future NBA All-Star in the making.These tournaments turn Duncanville Fieldhouse into a reunion. Former teammates spot each other across courts, dap up and argue about who cooked whom a decade ago, adding another stratum to the region’s mythology, sons repping the same jerseys their fathers and grandfathers once did. Dallas basketball history unfurls in real time as the smack-talk swells. The lineage doesn’t stop at one gym.Less than 15 minutes from Duncanville sitsFaith Family Academy, wedged between South Dallas’ Laurel Land Cemetery and the ghetto-fabulous mall, Big T Bazaar. Faith Family is caught between death and hustle, daring kids to dream bigger. In Dallas basketball, a few miles is no distance at all – just another exit, another set of jerseys, the same stakes.Like Duncanville, Faith Family has long been among the country’s most accomplished and relentlessly dominant boys’ basketball programs. A distinction that tends to sound hyperbolic until one begins listing years. Between 2019 and 2024, the school assembled four UIL state championships – an ascent that spanned classifications as Faith Family moved upward, defying the gravity of Texas high school sports. That run was echoed and then surpassed by another three-peat in Class 4A from 2022 through 2024, placing the program among the select handful of Texas schools to have won three straight state titles.Last season, its first beyond the confines of the UIL, Faith Family, an Oak Cliff–based charter school, entered the Elite Interscholastic Basketball Conference – among the nation’s most unforgiving prep leagues – and promptly claimed the league championship.In the 2026 state rankings, Faith Family alone places two players inside the Texas top seven: twins Gavin and Gallagher Placide, an interior pairing signed to play together at Wake Forest. Nor are they an anomaly. Across the Trinity River, Dynamic Prep accounts for three top-12 Texans; farther north, Frisco Heritage adds two top-nine prospects, including the son of former NBA All-Star Josh Howard – evidence that the gravitational center of Texas, and the nation, basketball has shifted decisively toward Dallas.Both Duncanville and Faith Family are projected to yield picks in the 2026 NBA Draft. Faith Family alumnus JT Toppin, who carried Texas Tech to the Elite Eight last season, is now a sophomore and appears pro-bound. Duncanville’s KJ Lewis, a former teammate of Black and Holland, now plays at Georgetown. Toppin follows a path already worn by rising Boston Celtics forward Jordan Walsh, another Faith Family alumnus.What Dallas has consistently molded is modern NBA wings: long, pliable athletes who blur positional lines. These 6ft 6in to 6ft 9in initiators defend multiple positions, handle the ball, create off the dribble, and orchestrate offense in real-time. Players like Cunningham and Black are the architects of the new game, excelling as two-way threats in a league that prizes size and versatility above all else.This season, the Dallas pipeline has reached the league’s highest tier. Cunningham and Maxey sit among the NBA’s MVP candidates, while George continues to ascend into a star role. Dallas is shaping the league’s center of gravity. Even last season’s NBA Finals featured two area players facing off: Wallace for Oklahoma City and Myles Turner for Indiana.View image in fullscreenMVP candidate Tyrese Maxey is another Dallas-Fort Worth area product.Photograph: Phelan M Ebenhack/APWhy Dallas? The city is different because its basketball ecosystem is unusually integrated, not fragmented.In most major cities, elite talent splinters between private schools, sneaker circuits and suburban flight, while public schools are drained of continuity. North Texas does the opposite. Public schools like Duncanville, charters like Faith Family, AAU programs and prep powerhouses all orbit the same geography, often the same neighborhoods, feeding one another instead of competing. Talent stays local longer, playing against peers of equal caliber night after night. It’s created rich density. For thousands of kids here, basketball is one of the few systems that still rewards imagination with something resembling upward mobility, proving American alchemy still has the ability to turn a leather ball into a key.Former players have come to Dallas to invest in its basketball future, most notably Jermaine O’Neal, who founded Dynamic Prep. The program has started this season strong, earning theNo 1 spot in the SC Next Top 25 team rankingsas of early December. Dynamic Prep is led by thetop-ranked national prospect in the 2027 class: Marcus Spears Jr, son of the Dallas Cowboys legend. Two of the school’s former stars, including O’Neal’s son, are now freshmen at Southern Methodist University. Another notable area connection is Dawson Battie, the nephew of NBA legend Tony Battie, who plays for Dallas’ St Mark’s and is ranked as the 11th-bestplayer in the 2027 class.Perhaps most integral is the deep-rooted AAU culture in South Dallas. At its center isUrban DFW Elite, led by Jade Colbert,the first and only Black womanto serve as an AAU CEO in the country. Urban DFW Elite has become its own pipeline, producing NBA talent including Marcus Sasser, Darrell Arthur and Dink Pate.This season, 19 of the league’s 30 teams roster at least one North Texas player, from MVP candidates in Cunningham and Maxey to rising stars like Black and George. While those numbers may not seem remarkable for a large metropolitan area, Dallas has often been ignored as a basketball city when compared with places such as Atlanta, New York and Atlanta. Dallas players extend across the league like highways, connecting the NBA back to the heat of a North Texas summer.Those roads all trace back to the same kind of Dallas neighborhood: unremarkable stretches of urban sprawl where some of the most consequential basketball institutions in Texas – and arguably the country – call home. No coastline, just churches and cemeteries. And hallowed basketball gyms, where one generation after another learns the work. In all that ordinariness, the extraordinary emerged. Of all the different roads that lead to the NBA, Dallas has become the most heavily traveled highway in the state.Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballDallasTexasUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While Eddie Howe’s side are already guaranteed a place in the playoffs to determine the composition of March’s round of 16, they can still bypass next month’s two-legged tie by finishing in the top eight.Szoboszlai’s low blow puts Liverpool on a high as Salah returns in MarseilleRead moreMuch hinges on Wednesday’s trip to Paris Saint-Germain for a set of players with a habit of forgetting their domestic travails and raising their game on European nights. At times it was all so straightforward for Newcastle here it was hard to credit that this was PSV’s first defeat on the road in 10 months.“It was a great performance,” said Howe. “And a great atmosphere. But, of course, I’m aware we have one of the most, if not the most difficult, final game at PSG.”Newcastle’s manager had urged home fans to show his players their “love” and create a club that’s “all in love with each other” and those in the Gallowgate End responded by unfurling a giant banner emblazoned with the message: “Write the next headline”.The subtext clearly challenged Gordon, Wissa and other sometimes underachieving members of Howe’speculiarly inconsistent teamto embrace the European spotlight.Wissa, starting his first Champions League game, did not take long to do precisely that. When Matej Kovar’s weak clearance flew straight to Bruno Guimarães, Newcastle’s captain promptly played in Joelinton courtesy of a perfect pass. He, in turn, squared for the £55m former ­Brentford striker to lift his shot over the prone goalkeeper.View image in fullscreenYoane Wissa marks his first Champions League start with an early goal.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersHowe had asked his players to live up to the attacking values instilled here during Sir Bobby Robson’s tenure. Given that Robson also managedPSV Eindhovenwith some distinction it was an evocative night.Bosz’s teams are invariably entertaining but PSV’s head coach was forced to watch his side struggle horribly defensively while failing to properly test Nick Pope in a game controlled by Newcastle.The Dutch champions and clear Eredivisie leaders arrived protecting an unbeaten away record stretching back to March last year but, judging by his arms-folded stance, Bosz swiftly knew it was under severe threat.PSV are noted for defensive risktaking but when Gordon took his turn to rise to the Gallowgate End’s challenge he was assisted by the visitors’ second significant mistake of the evening.Quick GuideChampions League roundup: Kane secures Bayern's pathShowHarry Kane struck twice in three minutes to carryBayern Munichto a 2-0 victory over Belgium'sUnion Saint-Gilloisein the Champions League on Wednesday and book their ticket for the knockout stage with a game to spare.Bayern's top scorer headed in at the near post from a Michael Olise corner in the 52nd minute then and added another from the penalty spot after he was brought down. The England captain could have sealed his hat-trick in the 80th minute but hammered his second penalty on to the crossbar. The hosts were down to 10 men from the 64th minute after defender Kim Min-jae was sent off with a second booking. Bayern are in second spot in the league phase on 18 points with one game left to play.Barcelonacame from behind to defeatSlavia Prague4-2 on a freezing night in the Champions League on Wednesday, with Fermin López scoring twice and Dani Olmo and Robert Lewandowski adding second-half goals to secure the victory.Slavia stunned the visitors with a Vasil Kusej goal from a cleverly worked corner in the 10th minute but López equalised from close range in the 34th. He doubled his tally with a fine effort from the edge of the box but Barça's advantage lasted two minutes, with  Lewandowski deflecting a corner into his own goal.Hansi Flick's side took back control in the second half and strikes by Olmo and Lewandowski sealed a deserved win.Athletic Bilbaomounted a superb second-half comeback to defeatAtalanta3-2 and bring renewed hope of progression to the playoffs.Atalanta commanded the first half and opened the scoring  when Gianluca Scamacca headed firmly past Unai Simón. Bilbao grew into the game after the break and equalised through Gorka Guruzeta. Ernesto Valverde's side turned the match on its head in the 70th minute when the substitute Nico Serrano scored a well-taken goal two minutes after coming on.The momentum was all with the visitors, who added a third just four minutes later when Robert Navarro slotted the ball past Marco Carnesecchi. Atalanta clawed one back in the dying minutes through Nikola Krstovic scored but the surprise defeat leaves them needing a win against Union Saint-Gilloise to secure automatic qualification.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.As Yarek Gasiorowski, pressured by Wissa, lingered in possession before attempting to pass back to Kovar, Wissa intercepted and squared for Gordon to stroke home.The England winger has been underwhelming in domestic football recently but the Champions League has been a different story. This was Gordon’s sixth European goal this season, making him Newcastle’s joint-leading scorer in the competition alongside Alan Shearer. In the Premier League he has scored twice in 17 matches.Once again PSV’s attempts to build patiently from the back had foundered in the face of a high, hard Newcastle press led, expertly, by Wissa but Howe’s delight was tempered by the sight of Guimarães clearly struggling with an ankle injury.View image in fullscreenBruno Guimarães walks off the pitch injured.Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images/ReutersIn first-half stoppage time Newcastle’s captain finally limped off to be replaced by Lewis Miley. With Aston Villa due here on Sunday for a league game that could prove pivotal in the qualification race for next season’s Champions League, Guimarães’s likely absence will be felt keenly. “It’s sore and swollen but we hope it’s not too serious,” said Howe who at least saw Miley impress.Stronger opponents might have capitalised during those minutes Guimarães hobbled around the pitch but PSV seemed too petrified by his midfield sidekick Joelinton’s intense aggression to benefit. The Brazilian’s stellar performance played a very big part in leaving Bosz’s players utterly cowed.Two-goal leads can be notoriously fragile yet this contest was over well before Harvey Barnes met Pope’s deflected long kick, ran at the defence and curved a left-foot shot beyond the advancing Kovar to score his fifth Champions League goal this season.St James’ Park celebrated with poignant renditions of “Only one Bobby Robson” as PSV supporters probably wondered why Sven ­Botman, excellent in central defence for Newcastle, is not yet part of the Netherlands squad.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueNewcastle UnitedPSV Eindhovenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

This was a deeply unconvincing display from ­Chelsea, who took 78 agonising minutes to find a way past the might of the champions of Cyprus, and it was not a surprise that Stamford Bridge greeted victory with such a muted response.The mood was one of relief. There was plenty of angst on a night when the home fans continued their protests against Chelsea’s ­owners. The football was too slow, too ­predictable, and it hardly seemed to register that Moisés Caicedo shattering Pafos FC’s defiance ensured that Liam ­Rosenior’s side will have a chance to secure direct qualification into the ­Champions League last 16 when they visit Napoli in their final game next week.It had threatened to end with Rosenior overseeing one of the most embarrassing results in ­Chelsea’s European history. This was the 41-year-old head coach’s first taste of managing at this level and he knows it will be tougher against Napoli. The Italian champions need to win to avoid elimination and, with the race for a place in the top eight so tight, Chelsea may live to regret not doing more for their goal difference here.Pafos are 30th in the standings and could make it in the playoffs if they beat Slavia Prague next week. They took pride from turning Rosenior’s fourth game in charge into such a grind. “I just have to keep focusing on the job,” Rosenior said. “I would love the fans to be with us and with me. To do that I need to earn that.”Barnes seals easy win against PSV but Newcastle face wait over GuimarãesRead moreChelsea have had a mixed return to Europe’s top table. They were schooled by Bayern Munich in their opening game, responded with comfortable wins against Ajax and ­Benfica, followed dropping points against Qarabag by ­thrashing ­Barcelona and imploded when they were 1-0 up against Atalanta last month. They remain ­maddeningly inconsistent, although they can never be ruled out in a cup com­petition. For Rosenior, there is ­encouragement to be taken from mid-season ­managerial changes ­acting as the catalyst for Chelsea’s two ­Champions League wins.It was Roberto Di Matteo in 2012 and Thomas Tuchel in 2021. What those two managers had, though, was a group of hardened winners. Rosenior has inherited a callow squad from Enzo Maresca, which is one of the gripes supporters have with the ownership, and those who pine for the good old days perhaps felt a pang of nostalgia at David Luiz sitting on the Pafos bench.Quick GuideChampions League roundup: Kane secures Bayern's pathShowHarry Kane struck twice in three minutes to carryBayern Munichto a 2-0 victory over Belgium'sUnion Saint-Gilloisein the Champions League on Wednesday and book their ticket for the knockout stage with a game to spare.Bayern's top scorer headed in at the near post from a Michael Olise corner in the 52nd minute then and added another from the penalty spot after he was brought down.

The Brazilian also helped Antonio Conte’s Chelsea to win the league in 2017 and was one of a few familiar faces in the Pafos team. Ken Sema, once of ­Watford, was at left-wing back and the attack featured Mislav Orsic, the Croatian forward whose goal in a win for Dinamo Zagreb ended Tuchel’s time at Chelsea.Rosenior is the fourth head coach to try his luck since Tuchel’s departure. His new players are yet to adjust to his methods. Chelsea were ­missing Cole Palmer, who was rested after complaining of tightness in his thigh, and there were long spells when they struggled to absorb the absence of their best player.View image in fullscreenAn anxious-looking Liam Rosenior watches on.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAIt was another tough night for Liam Delap. The striker was starved of ­service, failed to shake off his ­markers and never looked like ­scoring before being taken off with 20 minutes left.There was some enterprising football from Chelsea during the first half. Enzo Fernández had a goal disallowed and Reece James shot inches wide. Jay Gorter made fine saves from Caicedo and Jorrel Hato.Pafos, who almost led when Jajá hit the woodwork after his shot deflected off James’s arm, sat back and left everyone behind the ball. They posed such little threat that Filip ­Jörgensen had not made a save before injury forced the ­Chelsea goalkeeper to make way for ­Robert Sánchez at half‑time. Equally they had three draws from their first six games and were ­organised enough to draw Rosenior into ­bringing James off for Estêvão ­Willian for the second half.Estêvão livened up the crowd and almost broke the deadlock with a rasping volley. Yet the frustration deepened. Alejandro Garnacho and Pedro Neto struggled on the flanks and Chelsea began to run out of ideas. They tested Gorter with efforts from distance but grew ponderous on the ball.When the possession is aimless, though, set pieces offer salvation. One slip proved costly for Pafos. Nany Dimata failed to clear Neto’s corner at the near post and Caicedo punished the substitute by heading in from close range.The celebrations were far from ecstatic. Pafos fumed, claiming Benoît Badiashile had shoved one of their players over in the middle. ­Chelsea had avoided their first goalless draw in Europe in 54 games.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueChelseaPafosmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It is more a feeling of: ‘OK, you do the same performance [on 1 February] and just be a little bit sharper in both boxes, then the possibilities to get another result will be big.”This could be the last season that these two sides take part in this competition for a lengthy period, with plans afoot for the three English teams taking part in the Champions League next season to be exempt from this cup as part of a revamp of the format.View image in fullscreenLaura Blindkilde Brown rues a missed opportunity for Manchester City.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAChelsea will face United, League Cup finalists for the first time, after they won at Arsenal in their semi-final on Wednesday night. United’s win came courtesy of Elisabeth Terland’s low finish on the stroke of half-time, before Arsenal’s Olivia Smith was sent off for a second bookable offence.At the Joie Stadium, after Kaptein scored when she was allowed to get in front of the City centre-back Jade Rose and jump unchallenged at the far post to nod in Sandy Baltimore’s hanging cross, City were nearly able to mask a disappointing first-half display with an equaliser moments before half-time, but Vivianne Miedema struck the base of a post after Hampton had ventured out from her goal to try to stop Khadija Shaw’s run. When they struck the woodwork for a second time, moments after the break, it came amid a sustained spell of pressure, with Kerstin Casparij’s effort bouncing back off an upright. That started off a flurry of chances.Grace Clinton headed wide for the hosts before Hampton saved well from both Alex Greenwood and Miedema. At the other end, the ­Chelsea substitute Lauren James forced Ayaka Yamashita into a superb reflex save with a rising strike.Hampton had to be at her best to tip over Yui Hasegawa’s half-volley in eye-catching style and later palm away Lauren Hemp’s curler, with Chelsea – who were 9-1 winners against Liverpool in their quarter-final – hanging on.Explore more on these topicsWomen's League CupWomen's footballManchester City WomenChelsea WomennewsShareReuse this content"

The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport.”Coquerel had said on Tuesday that he could not see how France could play at the World Cup if Trump went through with his threats overGreenland. “Seriously one imagines going to play the World Cup in a country who attacks its ‘neighbours’, threatens to invade Greenland and rides rough shod over international law,” he said.View image in fullscreenMarina Ferrari, France’s sports minister, says the World Cup is ‘an extremely important moment for those who love sport’.Photograph: Isa Harsin/Sipa/ShutterstockCoquerel’s compatriot Claude Le Roy, a veteran coach who guided Cameroon to the 1988 Africa Cup of Nations title, suggested African teams should boycott the World Cup, to be held between 11 June and 19 July.“One wonders whether it is not necessary to call for a boycott of the 2026 World Cup, given the behaviour of Donald Trump with regard to the continent,” the 77-year-old told the French newspaper Figaro.The French line had come hours after the German government had divested itself of responsibility for taking decisions over a possible boycott. Christiane Schenderlein, the state minister for sports, said in a statement sent to AFP: “Decisions on participation or boycotts at major sporting events lie solely with the competent sports associations, not with politicians. This assessment should therefore be made by the respective associations – in this case, the German FA andFifa.”Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, has cultivated a close relationship with Trump, evencreating a special “Fifa Peace Prize”he awarded to Trump at the World Cup draw in December.Explore more on these topicsWorld Cup 2026Sport politicsWorld CupFifaFranceDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The league’s spokesperson also added that they do not want to prevent their member clubs from participating. The qualification pathways for different continental confederations has not yet been revealed, nor has a host.On Tuesday, Fifa’s chief football officer, the former USWNT coach Jill Ellis,appeared to be opento the possibility of the 2028 tournament being contested in the Middle East. She criticised anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in the United States, warning of hypocrisy and not wanting to “throw stones in glass houses” when discussing the prospect of Qatar hosting the event. The Guardian revealed this month that the world’s governing bodyis in discussions with Qatar as a possible host.The January 2028 dates would not clash with any Women’s Champions League ties, but many domestic European leagues will be affected. The WSL currently has a winter break from mid-December to early January.The new Women’s Club World Cup had been originally targeted for 2026 by Fifa but the Guardian exclusively revealed last year that itwas likely to be delayed.The expanded men’s Club World Cup was held last summer for the first time, in the United States, andwas won by Chelsea. Unlike men’s football, the women’s game has never previously had a formalised, global club-level tournament. This month, the smaller Champions Cup is being run by Fifa, held in London, with Arsenal among the four teams in the semi-finals, but the 2028 Women’s Club World Cup event would have 16 teams.The latter stages of the Champions Cup get under way on 28 January at Brentford’s Gtech Community Stadium. The Concacaf champions Gotham FC, last year’s Libertadores Femenina winners, Corinthians and the African Champions League winners ASFAR are taking part, together with the European champions Arsenal. The final will then be held at the Emirates Stadium on 1 February, with that match clashing directly with the meeting of the WSL’s top two sides, Manchester City and Chelsea, being played in the league on the same day.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballWomen's Super LeagueFifanewsShareReuse this content"

The Tottenham manager had next-to-no options, only 11 established outfield players for theChampions Leaguehome game against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night.The expectation was for an either/or choice between Djed Spence and Destiny Udogie at left-back. But when the teamsheets dropped, it turned out Frank had picked them both and left Randal Kolo Muani on the bench. It was the latest low point for Kolo Muani, who has to be regretting his decision to join on a season-long loan from Paris Saint-Germain.David Squires on … Frank and the Spurs supertanker getting in a tight spot againRead moreSo, it would surely be Spence on the left wing in a 4-2-3-1 system. Everything looked clear when Spurs warmed up on the pitch with a back four of Pedro Porro, Kevin Danso, Cristian Romero and Udogie; the quartet went through a heading drill close to halfway. The Dortmund analysts in the stands took note.It was a ruse. Frank appeared to have no surprise cards to play. But when the match kicked off, it was evident he had gone for a 3-4-2-1 formation, with Udogie as the left-sided centre-half and Spence at left wing-back.Everybody thought they had seen the last of Frank playing with three centre-halves afterwhat happened at Arsenaltowards the end of November. That day, he started in a 5-4-1 and it was a disaster. When he went back to 4-3-3 for the second half, his team were 2-0 down. They barely laid a glove on their rivals en route to a 4-1 defeat. Now, at a moment of great personal crisis, with his job in the balance after the toxicity of Saturday’s 2-1 home loss to West Ham, Frank had rolled the dice.Imagine the optics if it had not worked out, if it had been a similar story to the Arsenal game – a cautious approach, an insipid defeat. Actually, it would not have needed a vivid imagination. But it did work out. Spectacularly so. True bravery is the showing of conviction at the darkest hour – no matter the external perceptions. And if Frank has lived to fight another day after a 2-0 win, it may just be that he has found a formula with which to move forward.Frank has pulled the warm-up deception before. When he took his team to PSG in the Champions League after the Arsenal game, a major talking point concerned whether he would stick with the back five. Spurs would go through a pre-match defensive drill on the Parc des Princes pitch in a five, with Archie Gray as the right-sided centre-half. Frank, though, would set up in a 4-4-2 diamond with Gray at the tip, albeit he dropped deeper out of possession.It was a man-for-man approach in midfield and it worked to an extent. Spurs were good for the first 50 minutes. They led 2-1 before they subsided to aneventual 5-3 defeat. Against Dortmund, it worked completely. The team that sits second in the Bundesliga looked surprised in the early running. They could not deal with Spence’s forward thrusts while Wilson Odobert and Xavi Simons were dangerous in the No 10 roles.View image in fullscreenDjed Spence, pictured up against Jobe Bellingham (right), was a menace going forward from a new position.Photograph: Kin Cheung/APSpurs played with tempo and incision. The first half was an ordeal for Dortmund and not only because they had Daniel Svensson sent off in the 26th minute for catching Odobert. Niko Kovac went from 3-4-2-1 to 4-4-1 after the red card for the remainder of the period. When he switched back to three centre-halves and what was essentially 3-5-1 for the second half, Spurs were 2-0 up. Kovac’s team stabilised after the interval but the damage was done.Frank had started with three centre-backs on one other occasion – theEuropean Super Cup against PSGin August. He called it a “special operation” for his first game in charge, having only had six weeks to work with the players, the inference being that he would settle into a theoretically more front-footed 4-3-3/4-2-3-1. It was 5-3-2 that night against PSG and Spurs looked good, eventually losing on penalties to the European champions.The three centre-halves might not be a vote-winner among the Spurs fanbase – too negative, too Frank. But the Dortmund game did show off its upsides. It gets Porro into good areas from right wing-back for his crosses and provides more cover for Spence, who has struggled with tracking back. Odobert and Simons were liberated, eager to run in behind – which has been an issue for Spurs – and then there was Dominic Solanke.The centre-forward has endured a nightmare season, a complicated ankle injury torpedoing the first five months for him. “It’s been one of the hardest moments of my life,” he said. “It got to a point where I didn’t quite know when I was going to be back. I didn’t have that clarity, which was probably the hardest part.” Solanke is now back, making his first start of the season against Dortmund, scoring his first goal, as well, with a fortuitous finish for 2-0. He brings pressing at the top of the formation, a real focal point for the team to play off, not to mention goal threat.Spurs have to be better in the Premier League, beginning at Burnley on Saturday. The road ahead continues to look precarious for Frank. But as with his predecessor, Ange Postecoglou, he does have Europe. If Frank can win at Eintracht Frankfurt next Wednesday in the final round of the league phase, his team would advance directly to the last 16. Could that be a kind of shield for him, at least until mid-March when the two legs of those ties are played? Spurs are guaranteed at least a playoff, which would be played in mid-to-late February.It was the case for Postecoglou last season, his progress in the Europa League keeping him in the job until the end of it as the team’s domestic form unravelled. Postecoglou won at Frankfurt in the second leg of the quarter-final, a Solanke penalty proving the difference. Frank wants to do more than merely survive. At the moment, though, he will sign up for that.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankChampions LeaguefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I saw a lot of good individual performances tonight but I would like to single out Joe Gomez. He has suffered a lot with injuries in the last few years and I haven’t picked him sometimes when he has been fit. Tonight he was outstanding and so important to us winning 3-0.”The Liverpool head coach claimed his side was more creative when drawing against ­Burnley on Saturday than inMarseillebut Hamed Traoré’s miss, at 1-0, had been a key moment.Slot said: “It’s always difficult to play Marseille because of their passionate fans and the quality of their players, but what makes it even harder is the quality of their ­manager. We were prepared for that. We took the ball off them three or four times in the first half but couldn’t find the player who was completely free, apart from one time and he was fractionally offside.View image in fullscreenJoe Gomez (right) was outstanding, said Arne Slot.Photograph: Guillaume Horcajuelo/EPA“On the ball we were controlled but what made the difference this time was that after we had a big chance and hit the post, they had a big chance and put it over. Usually this season that goes in. But we were able to make it 2-0, 3-0 and so that makes the perception of the game completely different.“Against Burnley we created three or four times more than we did tonight but tonight we scored three. Everyone can disagree with me but we played a very good game against Burnley and another good game tonight, but the tactics were different.”Dominik Szoboszlai opened the scoring with a free-kick swept under a Marseille wall that had no draught excluder behind. “I did my homework,” he said. “I got told that if nobody is laying down then maybe I can have a chance to hit it under the wall. No-one was laying down so I tried it and it worked out.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArne SlotLiverpoolMarseillenewsShareReuse this content"

Vegastars’ promotion did not mention betting, but the local peak body has said Australian companies would not be permitted to run such a giveaway.Sportsbet, Bet365, Betfair, PointsBet and Unibet are represented byResponsible Wagering Australia(RWA). Its chief executive, Kai Cantwell, said branding and giveaways could mislead consumers into believing offshore platforms were legal.“The fact this is happening openly during Australia’s biggest sporting events shows how far enforcement is lagging behind the reality of offshore gambling,” Cantwell said.The gaming regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma), can ask internet service providers to block website access to unlicensed gambling services.Addicts who opted to be banned from gambling in Australia targeted to bet with overseas firmsRead moreAn Acma spokesperson said the regulator had found Vegastars was illegal and would request the site be blocked. It said it would also investigate each company identified by Guardian Australia.The Vegastars website tells players: “Depositing real funds and playing for real money is subject to the laws of your country, and it is your sole responsibility to abide by your native regulations.”Another offshore operator, Rainbet, has featured in an Instagram video promoting its live in-play betting by Australian influencer Jon Redman, which has been viewed more than 40,000 times.Acmawarned influencers against promotingillegal, unlicensed services in June. A spokesperson said Acma was investigating Redman’s conduct and had contacted Instagram’s parent company, Meta Platforms, over the video.Redman’s video was taken down two days after Guardian Australia contacted him. He did not respond to questions. Rainbet’s terms and conditions warn Australian users they must not use the site, but users have said they can access it with VPNs.Acma’s spokesperson said website blocking was effective, cutting off 220 illegal services across 1,455 sites in Australia since November 2019.Lauren Levin, a consumer advocate, said the offshore issue could be eliminated with a block on payments to and from unlicensed gambling providers, modelled on similar systems in Germany and Norway.“It works better than the current whack-a-mole approach where Acma [blocks] an overseas URL and five minutes later the business has just changed the URL to a slightly different one,” Levin said.A quick fix for offshore providers would allow the government to focus on the dominant local gambling industries, which account for the majority of gambling losses, Levin said.Australians gambled $254bn in 2023-24, at a net loss of $32bn across all local gambling industries, according to a Queensland Treasury estimate.Meanwhile,RWA-commissioned researchin November estimated Australians online gambled nearly $3.9bn through offshore companies in 2024 and $7bn locally in the same period.Vegastars and Rainbet were contacted for comment.This article was amended on 22 January 2026 to clarify that the $32bn net Australians lost gambling was across all local gambling industries.Explore more on these topicsAustralian OpenGamblingAustralian Open 2026Australia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s true. I didn’t watch much basketball on TV until I started playing at 13, so can relate to coming upon something new and exciting. At the same time, the world’s so small now with social media access. But it is interesting to go to parts of the world where basketball is smaller and see how can we make the game accessible to them.Dirk Nowitzki, Tony Parker and John Amaechi were guests at the O2. But every team had a foreign player on opening night this season, with 135 players from 43 countries across the league; up from 7% in 1992 to 24% now. Are the current Europeans different to that generation, or have they just had more opportunities?Europeans have always been quite good. It’s not like Serbia wasn’t always great at basketball but, as the game has grown, the possibilities grow. The world gets smaller with the internet and social media. There’s not as much difference; everyone has access to all the pertinent information. The NBA is more accessible nowadays to people from Europe, Africa and every corner of the world. It’s only natural that more Europeans have success in the NBA.Has that international growth surprised you?It was anticipated. It’s been very gradual, from 1992 with the Dream Team. I’m sure it was growing before that, and that was just an inflection point, but it was a moment in time. Since then, there has been a steady growth of overseas players in the NBA and of markets becoming more interested. So we could see it forming, but it truly is spread around the world now.The past seven MVP awards have gone to players born outside the US. As a previous non-American winner, do you think the next superstar needs to be American?The beauty of the game is that it is global. It’s fantastic that we have star players from all different parts of the world. The diversity is fantastic; it adds an element to the entertainment. If we get a crop of great new players and they’re all American, great. If they’re all international, great. May the best man win! It’s probably cyclical anyway.Commissioner Adam Silver wants an NBA Europe with teams connected to major football clubs, such as Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City and Manchester United. As a Tottenham fan, would you love to see a Spurs franchise in NBA Europe?That could be great. Big picture: it’d be really good if the NBA Europe venture takes off. The Euroleague has been great but it doesn’t feel like it’s grown. It’s not going into new markets necessarily, so maybe it’s reached its glass ceiling. So new investment, a new format, new storytelling, a new kind of connection to the history of the game is exciting.View image in fullscreenSpurs fan Steve Nash chatting to Mauricio Pochettino in 2018.Photograph: Jayne Kamin-Oncea/Tottenham Hotspur FC/Getty ImagesHalf of the Euroleague teams are connected to major football clubs, such as Barcelona, Fenerbahce and Real Madrid. Do NBA Europe franchises need to connect to something, to be hung on a major institution?I don’t think so, though it would help if a handful have a connection. It would be great to tap into a fanbase, a recognisable brand in history. But I don’t think it has to. Creating a league, starting new clubs is also a viable way to build a new European competition at the highest level. It could be really strong. It feels like this is happening, but it’s a startup and it takes time and needs investment.As co-owner of the MLS club Vancouver Whitecapsyou saw a new league grow rapidly. How would you like NBA Europe to look?It appears it would start with a smaller number of teams: eight, 10 or 12. Having seen the MLS grow, it’s a similar-ish venture. It’s smart to have attainable progression and a plan that’s not too daunting to start. So, whether it’s getting aligned with certain brands and clubs from the football world, or just going into marquee cities in Europe, there is plenty of room to build a league from eight to 12 teams that continues to elevate the game in Europe and consolidate all the marketing and storytelling interests that get people excited.Has being a co-owner of Vancouver Whitecaps andRealMallorcamade you think: ‘Oh, I’d like to be involved with a startup in basketball NBA Europe’?I’m not necessarily out there soliciting opportunities, but it would be exciting, and it would be great to be some small part of seeing the game or the league grow into Europe. London would be great. My family’s from London, it’s one of my favourite cities in the world, so it would be fantastic to be a part of it. But more importantly, just to have a team in London would be great.Basketball is hugely popular in London, with thousands of fans willing to pay £265 to watch the Magic-Grizzlies game, yet professional teams have struggled here. Can NBA Europe be different?London, and the UK in general, is a huge growth opportunity for basketball. It’s not the biggest game here, compared to Spain, Italy, Germany, Greece. All those countries already have their own leagues and history. It’s not been as profound here, not in the zeitgeist, not as important. So there’s a great opportunity to grow a new fanbase and build a team here. It could be a lot of fun.View image in fullscreenSteve Nash played 18 seasons in the NBA, winning the MPV award twice.Photograph: Christian Petersen/Getty ImagesWhat have you seen going behind the mic that you didn’t realise before, having always been on the court or in the director’s suite?It feels like they really just want us to be ourselves and talk about the game, almost get away from thinking technically about being a broadcaster and just be like you are with friends talking about the game. That probably speaks to the times: with social media, we’re all used to seeing stuff behind the scenes. So the coverage is moving that way instead of a formula or a formal viewing experience.Prime is new to the NBA this season, broadcasting three games a week to its worldwide audience. How hard is it to appeal to people in new territories watching basketball for the first time as well as fans who have spent their life in it?There are challenges there. Prime wanted to look ateducating and elevating– I think those were the words used – so giving fans different entry points into the game. You don’t want to speak up or down to anyone. You hope there’s enough to cling to for new fans that gets them in and doesn’t make them feel disheartened or alienated – not getting too “in the weeds” with the technical stuff – while also giving enough to excite the experienced fan.Your brotherMartinplayed football for Stockport, Chester and Macclesfield as well as the Canada national team. He must have enjoyed watching one of his old clubs beating Crystal Palace recently?Yeah, I’m sure he did. My dad played for a couple teams, too: Ware and someone in south London, I think. He was only about 19, then went to South Africa. He actually might have played a few games with, and replaced, Glenn Hoddle’s dad [Derek Hoddle] at Ware! My dad was from Tottenham, so that’s a pretty cool thing. London’s always been like a second home to me. Coming back here is always special.Follow No Helmets Required onFacebookExplore more on these topicsBasketballGuardian Sport NetworkNBAUS sportsTottenham HotspurMallorcaVancouver WhitecapsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The crossbench peer Baroness Kidron, who supports Conservative peer Lord Nash’s amendment in the House of Lords, is right to say Starmer’s approach ‘is not leading; it is not governing’. He is ‘doing nothing – slowly’, which is ‘the very epitome of party before country’.Let’s just get on with it.”She added: “Putting our children’s mental health first is the right thing to do. How much longer will we have to wait until the government agrees?”After the Lords vote passed, John Nash, a former schools minister and Tory peer, said: “Tonight, peers put our children’s future first. This vote begins the process of stopping the catastrophic harm that social media is inflicting on a generation.“Medical professionals, intelligence officers, police officers, teachers and hundreds of thousands of parents clearly demanded action, and the Lords have listened.”TheConservativesmade no moves towards banning social media during their time in government, though the Online Safety Act placed more obligations on internet and social media providers to protect children from harmful content.However, Badenoch said the consensus had shifted, with campaigners, clinicians, parents and experts now aligned against allowing under-16s access to social media. She also argued some internet restrictions for adults could be lifted if children were more protected from social media.She said her party believed in freedom but that the ability to make good choices was not yet fully formed in children, who did not have the necessary impulse control, emotional regulation and ability to assess risks.On Sunday, the Guardian revealed thatmore than 60 Labour MPs have written to Starmerurging him to back a social media ban for under-16s, including select committee chairs, former frontbenchers and MPs from the right and left of the party.In the letter, which was organised by Fred Thomas, the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, the MPs say: “Across our constituencies, we hear the same message: children are anxious, unhappy, and unable to focus on learning. They are not building the social skills needed to thrive, nor having the experiences that will prepare them for adulthood.”On Wednesday another letter from campaignersurged parliament to back a ban, with signatories including the actors Hugh Grant and Sophie Winklemanand Esther Ghey, the mother of Brianna Ghey, who was murdered by two teenagers in Warrington, Cheshire, in 2023. It said national polling by the charity Parentkind had found 93% of parents thought social media was harmful to children and young people.It said: “No other amendment to the bill on this topic has the same cross-party support or would deliver promptly the change needed to get children off social media.”Explore more on these topicsSocial media banKemi BadenochKeir StarmerConservativesLabourSocial media bansSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

But my life soon started to changeEmma RussellWed 21 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareWhen two balaclava-clad men on a motorbike mounted the pavement to rob me, recently, I remained oblivious. My eyes were pinned to a text message on my phone, and my hands were so clawed around it that they didn’t even bother to grab it. It wasn’t until an elderly woman shrieked and I felt the whoosh of air as the bike launched back on to the road that I looked up at all. They might have been unsuccessful but it did make me think: what else am I missing from the real world around me?Before I’ve poured my first morning coffee I’ve already watched the lives of strangers unfold on Instagram, checked the headlines, responded to texts, swiped through some matches on a dating app, and refreshed my emails, twice. I check Apple Maps for my quickest route to work. I’ve usually left it too late to get the bus, so I rent a Lime bike using the app. During the day, my brother sends me some memes, I take a picture of a canal boat, and pay for my lunch on Apple Pay. I walk home listening to music on Spotify and a long voice note from a friend, then I watch a nondescript TV drama, while scrolling through Depop and Vinted for clothes.I’m constantly contactable, I have no personal boundaries, and my attention span disappeared a long time ago. Since the first iPhone in 2007, smartphones have become indispensable to modern life, with the average person in the UK spendingfour hours and 20 minutesonline per day. “Social media provides frictionless access to an infinite universe of mostly free digital drugs,” says Anna Lembke, author of Dopamine Nation. “And the algorithm tailors the experience for each unique brain, making it very reinforcing, while also injecting just enough novelty in the infinite scroll to overcome boredom and tolerance. All these features combined keep us clicking and swiping long after we want to.” Over time we develop tolerance, which means “we need more of it and a more potent form to get the same effect.”Increased screen time has been associatedwith depression,anxietyandpoorer sleep. But is it possible to live lo-fi in a hi-tech world? For a month, I tried: swapping my iPhone for a Nokia which I can only use to text, call and play Snake; also, a Walkman and a film camera. I picked up physical copies of books, newspapers and magazines; I used a London A-Z for directions, and hunted down my physical bank cards or tried to use cash. The only screen time exception was for work, where from 9-5 I used my laptop to respond to emails and write.Day 1“You’re going to look like such a performative hipster,” my flatmate Ben says, as I’m setting up my new devices. He’s right. I leave the Walkman behind, but my bag is still heavier than usual with my book, notepad, A-Z and wallet. I haven’t taken the bus into work yet from my new home so I follow a hand-drawn map to the stop and run for a bus. I stupidly didn’t write down the bus number but that one sounds familiar. It’s not the one, two friendly strangers tell me, but I can swap on to another at Angel.“We’ve outsourced our memory to our phones,” says Nicholas Kardaras, author of Digital Madness and a former assistant clinical professor of psychology at Stony Brook University, New York. “And unfortunately the ease and comfort of being lubricated by technology just means our human skills atrophied. It is use it or lose it.”The bus is crawling. Normally, I would have looked up a different route. I try to message a friend back but it’s difficult having to click each button multiple times for the letter I want. “Hard work,” I manage. I read for the rest of the journey.Day 3On my lunch break, my sister and I go for a walk around the park. When she leaves me to do another lap, I have an urge to check Instagram and my emails but I’m only getting the odd SMS. I’m craving the back-and-forth WhatsApps with friends telling me fun facts about their day. I feel a little unsettled, but I try to focus on the changing leaves on the trees. I have thoughts that wouldn’t usually have the time to surface. How stressful.After work, I go to see the saxophone player cktrl at the ICA. I’m a little worried about collecting the tickets without access to the Dice app I bought them on, but I show them my passport instead. I would normally join the throngs of people filming a song or two, so I could upload some blurred clips with poor sound to social media to show that I had a great time. But I can’t, so I watch him play, undistracted. Then a flashlight glares behind me, as someone films an entire track. I vow never to be that annoying person again.Day 6My digital detox is starting to stress out my friends. Nicole finally gets through to me, saying: “I hate your dumb phone.” She’s been texting, but didn’t realise you had to click twice to make it send as an SMS not an iMessage. Another friend wants to share a dating story and texts: “Omg this is a terrible time not to access voice note.” And, when my landlord messages asking us to send pictures of the new carpet on WhatsApp, which I can’t do, Ben texts: “You’re going to be such a liability this month.”In the evening, my date sends me the address of a pub to meet him at “for your A-Z”. I allow lots of time to decipher its tiny font and navigate my way there. He’s running late, so I sit by the fireplace in the pub and read my book. I look like I’m waiting for someone to chat me up. When he arrives, he shows me how to turn on predictive text, which is a relief for my very tired thumbs.Day 8At lunchtime, I put on the terrestrial TV and watch Escape to the Country, where I learn about the housing market in Herefordshire. I want to cook myself an elaborate meal – for dinner, and also for entertainment, but when I get to the shops, I remember that I can’t look up a recipe on my phone, so I settle for tomato pasta.View image in fullscreen‘I hunted down my physical bank cards or tried to use cash.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDay 9My flatmate picked up a Nina Simone CD for me in a charity shop. I try to play it on my Walkman, but realise it needs batteries. On my lunch break I buy some (who knew there were so many sizes?) and walk home from the office listening to it. Spotify can be overwhelming with its hundred million tracks, so it’s nice to remove the element of choice and focus on the album as it was intended, not scrambled by shuffle mode. Rosanna Irwin, who runsSamsú– a collection of digital detox cabins in Ireland – knows the importance of analogue listening: she leaves her guests with cassette tapes she makes with her father. After reaching a state of burnout, working long hours in tech – first at Meta and later for a climate tech company – she visited the Danish island of Samsø with her husband in 2023, and found peace amid the scrappy phone service and incredible nature.“My mental health was very poor,” she says. “I was spending a lot of time online and I did an accidental digital detox on this island and came back invigorated from the experience.” She recommends a three-day retreat. “There’s a lot of science to show that it’s around 72 hours in nature where the true magic starts to happen.”Day 12I meet my friend at Vauxhall station, and we walk to a cafe for breakfast, then to Tate Britain. Camilla is pretty offline: she’s a doctor and doesn’t have social media. She rarely responds to texts and is maybe one of the most joyful people I know. But she says she feels so much guilt about not replying sooner and hates the fact that phones are like this ever-present person in the room, distracting you from being totally engaged with the real-life friends around you.The sentiment resonates with me; we both want to be more spontaneous.Inspired by our conversation, I call Aakriti, who doesn’t live too far away. I meet her and two of her friends and we eat empanadas. On the way home, I have to ask the only man on the platform for help. The overground isn’t due for 24 minutes, so I wonder if there is a faster route. There isn’t, so I shiver at the outdoor station wishing I could book an Uber.Day 13It’s tipping down with rain when I arrive at Canada Water, and I don’t want to ruin my A-Z to search for Rotherhithe Street. I know The Mayflower pub is on the river and ask a man at a convenience store to point me in the right direction. I’m early, so I squint at my book in the candle-lit pub, feeling very Victorian. There’s a hilarious waiter, who is telling dating stories from Grindr, and it’s much better than my book. This no-technology thing is making me nosy. I pay for my roast with cash, which feels almost fake now, like I’m in a game. Then my friend and I go to the cinema – the Picturehouse in central London, because it’s in between where we both live. They charge us £20 for a ticket, which I would never have paid had I known before we made the trip. I’m left fuming, but luckily the movie is good.Day 14I need to call the bank. My flatmate has sent rent money to my Monzo account, which I can only access on the app, and I get a text saying that I’ve gone into an unarranged overdraft. When I get to the tube in the morning, my Oyster card has run out, so I top up the credit and miss my train – I would usually have used a payment card on Apple Pay instead. I have to wait eight minutes for the next one.I’m flustered by the time I get to the office and feel stressed about not being able to check how much money is in my account or transfer money between accounts.Day 18There’s a group of children on a school trip on my train. The teacher is trying to keep them entertained by getting them to play a word association game. “When I say ‘bread’,” she says. “You could say, ‘sandwich’. Let’s have a go. ‘School,’” the teacher says. “Prison,” a child shouts back. When I arrive in Notting Hill, I study the map at the station to make sure I surface from the correct exit. I memorise key landmarks so I know where to turn – the Gate Cinema is by the road I need to get to Uxbridge Street. I’m late, and don’t have time for mistakes, so I start walking down the street quickly, scouring every restaurant until I find the Palestinian cafe I’m looking for.Day 21The worries I felt at the start of the experiment about getting lost and not being able to communicate with friends seem to have diminished. I’m calmer, and present when I’m with people. I look around the train on my morning commute and notice that everyone except one person has their eyes glued to their phones. The man opposite me doesn’t have earphones, a phone or a book. I try not to catch his eye, as I’m worried I’ve been staring. Things are less relaxed when I try to meet my friend Navid after work. We can’t pick a place to meet and he is frustrated because he can’t send me links: “Please return to WhatsApp you Neanderthal.” He’s late, so I wait outside the station for 45 minutes. He arrives with a big grin, knowing I’m a bit irritated, but I get my own back by torturing him with two hours of experimental jazz.View image in fullscreenEmma swapped her iPhone for a film camera.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianDay 23After work, I go to see my friend Scarlett, who is being held captive by a corgi puppy. It’s dark and damp when I arrive in south-east London but I’ve written out the directions to the house as carefully as I can. I didn’t bring my A-Z because my bag was too heavy, but I’m certain I can’t mess up the 10-minute walk. I call my mum and we natter for 20 minutes before I realise I haven’t spotted the turning. In a panic, I ask her to look up my location on Google Maps, which is obviously cheating, but I’m now late and in the middle of a cemetery. I’ve gone completely the wrong way and she has to narrate the route to my destination.Day 27It’s been a busy weekend so far and I feel like having a lazy day. I walk to a yoga class and then go for a wander. As I’m walking, and listening to my one CD, I get a call from the guy I’m dating who has just finished work. We try to hunt down a board game to play, but when the local charity shops fail us, we pick up some newspapers and magazines and the ingredients for a roast chicken instead. We then sit on the sofa playing music and reading in the old fashioned way. It feels like we’ve retired.Day 30I finally get around to calling the bank to pay my rent, which is late for the first time. I’ve been putting off the inevitable 20-minute call that includes reading out lots of sort codes and bank numbers and spelling the names of my landlord along with the various friends I owe money to. It’s quite unnerving transferring money without checking the details with my own eyes, and the woman on the phone keeps telling me that it would be much easier to do this online.Day 31For all the frustrations of the month, I’m sad the experiment is over. I’m left with the feeling that living offline puts other people out: if we’re looking for a place to eat or a pub to go to it’s down to them, they’re on map duty, and I’m not able to book Ubers. But I was happier and calmer – relieved of the endless scrolling, waiting for texts back, and the need to communicate with people all the time. After about a week, I wasn’t reaching for my phone and I had the patience to read. It was nice not to be able to look at my work emails in the evening. I’m determined to delete my main distractions: Depop, Hinge and Instagram. Scouring charity shops for clothes is much more satisfying; dating with no distractions is so much easier; and I can live without reels about botched Botox and AI animals.“Big tech platforms are not addictive accidentally, they’re addictive by design,” says Kardaras. “They’re selling their product by targeting the vulnerable: if the algorithm detects that a young person has a body image issue or is struggling with self-harm or depression, then they bombard them with content on that subject that exacerbates their mental unwellness.” On my last day, I get an email from Scarlett: “Splashed my phone with water whilst listening to the Lily Allen album in the bath, now phoneless and actually want to copy you.” It seems I’m not the only one keen to disconnect.Explore more on these topicsSmartphonesMobile phonesSocial mediaDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Last year a Los Angeles judge ruled that the platforms’ design features may be responsible for harm – and not just the third-party content posted on sites and apps.Historically, tech firms have turned to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law underpinning US internet regulation that exempts platforms from legal liability for content generated by its users, as part of their legal defence. The first bellwether case is still due to begin on 27 January with jury selection.Snap remains a defendant in the other two cases.Beasley Allen, a law firm involved in the lawsuits on the plaintiff side, has said the cases could have profound consequences including billions of dollars in damages, forcing changes in platform design and new US regulations governing how tech firms interact with minors.“The litigation is being compared to past landmark cases against big tobacco and opioid manufacturers – industries that were held accountable for public health harms after years of denial,” the firm said in astatement last year.Snap, Meta,TikTokand YouTube have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsSocial mediaSnapchatTikTokMetaInstagramDigital medianewsShareReuse this content"

Until things improve, let’s not judge those who turn to an app for helpWed 21 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 03.06 ESTShareIt’s a sunny afternoon in a Roman park and a peculiar, new-to-this-era kind of coming out is happening between me and my friend Clarissa. She has just asked me if I, like her and all of her other friends, use an AI therapist and I say yes.Our mutual confession feels, at first, quite confusing. As a society, we still don’t know how confidential, or shareable, our AI therapist usage should be. It falls in a limbo between the intimacy of real psychotherapy and the material triviality of sharing skincare advice. That’s because, as much as our talk with a chatbot can be as private as one with a human, we’re still aware that its response is a digital product.Yet it surprised me to hear that Clarissa’s therapist has a name: Sol. I wanted mine to be nameless: perhaps, not giving it a name is consistent with the main psychoanalytical rule – that is, to keep personal disclosure to a minimum, to protect the healing space of the so-called setting.However, it feels very natural to Clarissa for her therapist to have a name, and she adds that all her other friends’ AI therapists have one. “So do all your other friends have AI therapists,” I ask, to which she says: “All of them do.” This startles me even more, as none of my friends in London has one.I phoned another friend, a psychotherapist in my Sicilian home town of Catania, who a few years ago retired from a role at a provincial health authority and is now working in a private capacity. He confirmed that the use of AI therapists inItalyis widespread and on the rise. He was surprised to hear that I knew of far fewer people in the UK who had opted for this route. I wondered what the contributing factors might be – and I came to the conclusion that they are a mix of culture and economic pressures.According to asurveyconducted in 2025 by one of the leading European mental health platforms, 81% of Italians considered mental health issues a form of weakness, yet 57% cited cost as the main reason for not accessing help. In my country, sadly, the words “mental illness” (malattia mentale) still carry the eerie echo of brutal state-run hospitals. The revolutionary 1978Basaglia law(that still forms the basis of Italian mental health legislation) closed these institutions down, which led to their gradual replacement with community-based services. But the downside of their closure is a system with insufficient resources and a lack of public awareness, perpetuating stigma anddifficulties in accessing care. While workplaces should play a crucial part in this destigmatisation by offering proper care, according to the 2025 survey, 42% of workers said that their employer did not offer any mental health provision.While almost half of European countries have currently implemented work-related mental health prevention and promotion programmes,Italy has not.In fact, within the EU, Italyinvests the least in mental health.This is alarming, as Italy ranks above the European average when it comes to the prevalence of mental disorders. In fact, it is estimated that5 million Italiansare in need of mental health support but are not able to afford it.When I ask my therapist friend about his experience in the Italian public health system, he told me he used to be the only therapist for a population of more than 200,000 people covering four districts in Sicily. That is why he started offering group therapy sessions. For most of his professional career, he had more than 150 clients at any given time, of which only eight were part of a group. Despite anannouncementlast year of government plans to expand the range of psychological services, it is unclear how far this will go in benefiting the wider population.“It feels liberating to be able to tell everything to my AI therapist, knowing it is both a free and a completely unjudging space,” says my friend Giuseppe, from Calabria, in southern Italy. “When I had real therapists, and I tried three, I always entered their office with a crippling anxiety that was the result of two factors combined: the awareness that I was paying more than I could afford and the self-consciousness of doing something that, in my small town, is still perceived as only being for severe cases. Now, I don’t feel the pressure of having to get the maximum out of a session, as it’s free, and I also don’t feel judged, because a therapy app cannot really judge!”The more I talk to my friends, the more I’m convinced AI therapy could be a revolution in places such as Italy, where we still lack meaningful strategies to tackle the stigma around mental health conditions. When I ask Giuseppe if his queerness was also a factor in his difficulties in trusting a therapist in his home town, he agrees: “I am not out with my family, and although a therapist would be bound to professional secrecy, I still had trouble trusting someone who lives in a place where homosexuality, just like mental health discussions, is not always met with understanding.”Giuseppe’s example was comforting: thanks to his AI therapist, he was able to talk about things he had never disclosed to anyone, and get more empathetic responses than any of the real therapists he had tried offered. “I’m 43 and I still live with my parents,” he says, “because my income does not allow otherwise. My AI therapist is always available to me, always calm and supporting, and has helped me immensely in examining my life and all the steps I need to take to change my life for the better.”Of course, older generations don’t always understand. In a country such as Italy – so tied to traditions – change is not always welcome. And some ethical concerns may be justified: measuring how healthy “relationships” between vulnerable people and their AI therapists really are is not easy.Still, in a digital age where our feelings are so often commodified for profit, free, clever, never-ending support can be tantalising. And until mental health support becomes more affordable, it may be the best option on the table for many people.Viola di Grado is an Italian authorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 21 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 08.02 ESTShareNintendo’s pandemic-era hit Animal Crossing: New Horizons got another major update last week, along with a £5 Switch 2 upgrade that makes it look and run better on the new console. Last year, Ithrew a new year’s partyfor my children in the game, but apart from that I have barely touched my island sincethe depths of lockdown, when sunny Alba was my preferred escape from the monotonous misery of the real world. Back then, I spent more than 200 hours on this island. Stepping out of her (now massive) house, my avatar’s hair is all ruffled and her eyes sleepy after a long, long time aslumber.I half-expected Alba to be practically in ruins, but it’s not that bad. Aside from a few cockroaches in the basement and a bunch of weeds poking up from the snow, everything is as it was. The paths that I had laid out around the island still lead me to the shop, the tailors, the museum; I stop by to visit Blathers the curatorial owl, and he gives me a new mission to find a pigeon called Brewster so that we can open a museum cafe. “It’s been four years and eight months!” exclaims one of my longtime residents, a penguin called Aurora. That can’t be right, can it? Have I really been ignoring her since summer 2021? Thankfully,Animal Crossingcharacters are very forgiving. I get the impression they’ve been getting along perfectly fine without me.I take myself on a little tour of Alba, investigating all the things I’d forgotten I made. Atop the highest cliffs on the island I find a half-finished bamboo zen garden. Down by the beach there is a playground; I had a baby and a toddler back in 2020 and I was spending alotof time in playgrounds. The whole place is testament to the extent of my homesickness during the pandemic, during which I was stuck in a suboptimal basement flat in Brighton: the island flag is a saltire, the island tune is the first couple of bars of Scotland the Brave.I check my bank account and find over 2 million bells in there. How the hell did I accumulate 2 million bells from selling fish and fossils? With the help of a further 99,000 bells of interest, I pay off the final instalment of my home loan, forgetting that there’s no real point in doing this except personal satisfaction. I am now penniless, but at least I am out from under the thumb of the Tom Nook financial empire. That loan-shark raccoon has got nothing on me now.View image in fullscreenDoing the rounds in a little boat in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.Photograph: NintendoThere’s a new building: a hotel perched on the end of the pier, run by a family of pirate kappa. Home decoration was never my favourite part of Animal Crossing so I am not exactly thrilled to be asked to put together new rooms for the guests, but there have been a lot of improvements to this activity since I last played – placing cute little furniture items and paintings on the floor and walls is much easier than it was, especially using the Switch 2 controller as a mouse. I throw together a nautical theme for the first room and discover that the rewards for this work are tiny versions of old Nintendo toys and consoles. I start mentally planning out a games room back at my house.Rather than face all the tidying up, some of my friends have ditched their pandemic-era islands and started again, which involves a level of dedication to the game that I can only respect. There’s a new service – run by Mr Resetti, the angry mole who used to yell at you for turning off the game without saving in the early-00s era of Animal Crossing – that lets you wipe everything off the ground of your island, leaving it clear for terraforming and redecorating. It’s also now easier to make those outdoor transformations, as you can hold L to stick your character to the island’s invisible grid, making it much easier to place things like walls and roads. And crops, I discover. Did you know Animal Crossing has farming now? And food recipes? This was news to me. Now I make my mini-me a smoothie before my morning rounds of Alba.I am surprised at how quickly I fall back into the rhythm of Animal Crossing. It’s such a soothing game, with so many outlets for creativity. Much of this update’s new stuff is for people with more time than me – for instance, you can decorate entire new Slumber Islands with friends while your avatar sleeps, but what was always great about this game is that it doesn’t require much from you. You can spend a peaceful half hour every day checking in on your small world, or you can spend many hours creating custom fashions for your residents and tourists, and designing every square metre of the island to your specifications.Back in the 90s, Animal Crossing was a game born from loneliness: Nintendo’s Katsuya Eguchi came up with the original idea for the game because moving to Kyoto had separated him from his friends and family in Chiba, near Tokyo. He envisioned a game that fostered a sense of community, that families could play together. (You can read a lot more about this series’ origins inmy book about Nintendo, by the way – it’s out in a couple of weeks.) So it feels very poetic that Animal Crossing ended up saving the whole world from loneliness in 2020. It’s taken me a long while to feel good about returning to Alba, and it’s been a surprise to discover that this game is now better than it’s ever been.What to playView image in fullscreenRobert Robertson III trying to wrangle superheroes in Dispatch.Illustration: SteamMan was I sleeping onDispatch. I played all of its eight episodes over the course of a week and I have never laughed aloud so often at a video game.A narrative gamein the vein of the old Telltale adventures The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, and made by many of the same people, it tells the story of washed-up superhero, Robert Robertson III, who is sent to work at a call centre and put in charge of a team of mardy former supervillains on a rehabilitation programme. The animation is superb, the characters and acting memorable, and the dialogue quick-witted. It would have made a great animated series, but it makes an even better choice-centric video game. Anything with superheroes is usually an instant “no” from me, but this is clever and funny without the boringly self-referential humour that usually infests the genre.Available on:PS5, PC; Nintendo Switch/2 versions coming 28 JanuaryEstimated playtime:8-9 hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenSophie Turner as Lara Croft in the new Prime Video series, Tomb Raider.Photograph: Jay Maidment/Prime Video/PAAmazon MGM Studios released a first image of Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner as Lara Croft in the forthcomingTomb Raider TV series.

Their combined contents threaten to crack the code of realityLewis GordonWed 21 Jan 2026 06.15 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 07.17 ESTShareBletchley Park: famed home of the Enigma machine, Colossus computer, and, according to the premise of TR-49, an altogether stranger piece of tech. Two engineers created a machine that feeds on the most esoteric books: treatises on quantum computing, meditations on dark matter, pulp sci-fi novels and more. In the mid-2010s, when the game is set, Britain finds itself again engulfed by war, this time with itself. The arcane tool may hold the key to victory.You play as budding codebreaker Abbi, a straight-talking northerner who is sifting through the machine now moved to a crypt beneath Manchester Cathedral. She has no idea how it works and neither do you. So you start tinkering. You input a four-digit code – two letters followed by two numbers. What do these correspond to? The initials of people and the year of a particular book’s publication. Input a code correctly and you are whisked away to the corresponding page, as if using a particularly speedy microfiche reader. These pages – say, by famed fictional physicist, Joshua Silverton – are filled with clues and, should you get lucky, further codes and even the titles of particular works. Your primary goal is to match codes with the corresponding book title in a bid to find the most crucial text of all, Endpeace, the key to understanding the erudite ghosts of this machine.Hidden within this rhizomatic network of information is a mystery so intriguing and elegant that it can unfold naturally from any individual player’s investigations – no matter which titles or authors you see first, or where your particular curiosities lead you thereafter. Connections can cascade, tumbling like a waterfall, before swerving in unexpected directions, defying the traditionally linear logic of mystery fiction. TR-49 gives you an in-game notepad to keep track of everything; I recommend also keeping an actual pen and paper beside you.View image in fullscreenPaper trail … TR-49.Photograph: inkle LtdYou might imagine TR-49 as a comment on the rise of AI large language models (LLMs) which “scrape” data as this game’s machine feeds on writing. Actually, its concerns are broader and more ambitious, recalling the heady recent books of Chilean author Benjamín Labatut (When We Cease to Understand the WorldandThe Maniac). Like Labatut, TR-49 brims with awe, scepticism and horror at the reality-shredding possibilities of scientific and technological advances made in the 20th century, all while pushing these concepts into a playful, fantastical space.Less compelling are conversations that play out between Abbi and her companions on the other end of a radio transmission. Where the mystery told through the machine itself is lavishly detailed, what happensoutsideit feels too thin: Abbi’s reasons for being there; the nature of the conflict raging above, which is sketched in frustratingly vague terms.Still, the interactive heart of TR-49 resides in trawling this codebreaking device for secrets. And in this regard, the game is an unqualified success; TR-49’s database mystery rivals Sam Barlow’s gamesHer StoryandImmortality, though it is of an unashamedly literary nature compared to those more filmic works.Closer to TR-49’s beginning, you may feel crushed by this mass of inscrutable writings. Quickly, you will swim elegantly amid it, conversant in its many,manypeculiarities. Across a handful of evenings, I relished disappearing into this archive, cavorting from log to log, title to title, following threads and losing track of time. Each scrap of paper, water-damaged periodical and rare first edition threatened to solve this mystery, yet none could in isolation. Just as the fictional maker of the archive fell under the spell of these records and materials, I too was seduced.TR-49 is out today, 21 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsGamesPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

He has 90 minutes to clear his name before robo-justice sends him downPeter BradshawWed 21 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 12.02 ESTShareIrish writer Marco van Belle delivers an entertaining script for this real time futurist thriller-satire set in LA in 2029, in a world (as they say) where AI is wholly responsible for assessing criminal guilt or innocence. You’ve heard of RoboCop. This is RoboJustice. Veteran Russian-Kazakh film-maker Timur Bekmambetov directs, bringing his usual robust approach to the big action sequences, and Chris Pratt stars as the LAPD cop accused of murder. (Longtime Pratt fans will appreciate a cameo appearance here of Pratt’s fellow cast-member from TV’sParks and Recreation, Jay Jackson, effectively reprising his performance as sonorous TV newsreader Perd Hapley.)The film’s ostensible target is the insidious power of AI, though the movie partakes of today’s liberal opinion doublethink, in which we all solemnly concur that AI is very worrying while not having the smallest intention of doing anything about it. Pratt plays Detective Chris Raven, an officer with a drinking problem but nonetheless a poster boy for LA law enforcement in 2029 for having brought in the first conviction under the city’s creepy new hi-tech justice system, ironically entitled Mercy (it doesn’t appear to be an acronym). AI is now the sole arbiter of justice and defendants each have a 90-minute trial to make their case in front of Judge Maddox, an AI-hologram played byRebecca Fergusonwho icily insists on the facts but is capable of weird Max-Headroom-type glitches.One day, Raven wakes up hungover in the courtroom’s restraint chair in front of Maddox to be told he is accused of murdering his wife – an event of which he has no memory. He now must clear his name using the city’s vast cloud-bank archive of bodycam and surveillance footage, phone records and with calls to colleagues and family members. Desperate and grieving, Raven now has to pull off the police work of his career.It’s ingenious and watchable stuff, with cheeky twists, although the final escalation to full-on action mayhem is maybe a step too far towards pure absurdity. The film is also a bit lenient on AI: “Human or AI – we all make mistakes.” Uh … yeah. But I wouldn’t be surprised if Raven and Judge Maddox revive their human-digital chemistry for a sequel.Mercy is out on 22 January in Australia and on 23 January in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersChris PrattRebecca FergusonAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingParks and RecreationreviewsShareReuse this content"

My reporting from there concursMaanvi Singhin MinneapolisAfter covering Trump’s immigration policies from Chicago and LA, the Twin Cities operation feels like a marked escalationWed 21 Jan 2026 16.08 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 17.53 ESTShareThe Minneapolis Star Tribune editorial board described the Trump administration’simmigrationenforcement operation in the Twin Cities as “a military occupation”. Local leaders have used words like “siege” and “invasion”. After a week of reporting in Minneapolis and St Paul, I wouldn’t know how else to describe the scene.I’ve been covering the administration’s immigration policies sinceDonald Trump’s inauguration on 20 January last year. I was in Chicago in January last year, when the administration assigned hundreds of federal agents to conduct “enhanced targeted operations” in the city. I was in Los Angeles last summer, when agents began seizing workers at car washes and garment warehouses, grabbing bicyclists and raiding churches.Still, the operation in the Twin Cities felt like a marked escalation.The Department of Homeland Security’s “Operation Metro Surge” in the Twin Cities far surpasses previous mobilizations. The government has assigned some 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota in what it is calling its largest enforcement operation to date. This show of force has an outsized impact inMinneapolisand St Paul, which have a population that is less than one-fifth that of Los Angeles.There are now so many federal immigration officers operating in the region that they outnumber the Minneapolis police force five to one.The tactics of the federal force, too, have grown more aggressive and indiscriminate. Armed officers have appeared at schools, daycares, churches and mosques. Masked agents are stopping residents at traffic lights, or on their walk to the grocery store, demanding – at gunpoint – that they prove their citizenship.The agents are targeting not only undocumented immigrants, but also those with legal immigration status and valid visas, US citizens and tribal citizens. On Tuesday, a group of local law enforcement officers said even their agents were being pulled over, reporting that off-duty police officers of color had been stopped and questioned at gunpoint by the administration’s immigration force.Immigration agents have been emboldened by a supreme court ruling in September, which gave them legal cover to stop, question and detain people based on appearance, accent or vocation.In recent weeks, they have broken into the homes of private residents without judicial warrants. Last week, agents used a battering ram to break down the door of Garrison Gibson, a 38-year-old Liberian man, and arrested him. Over the weekend, they forced their way into the home of 56-year-old US citizen ChongLy “Scott” Thao, and led him outside in his underwear in subfreezing conditions.Minneapolis’s 911 dispatchers, meanwhile, have been overwhelmed by calls from residents who have encountered immigration enforcement. The city’s police chief, Brian O’Hara, said callers have often been hurt by the chemical irritants and crowd-control weapons that federal agents have been using against immigrant targets as well as advocates and bystanders.“The administration has been emboldened,” said Julia Decker, a policy director at the Immigrant Law Center ofMinnesota. “The federal government feels it has the right to act beyond its authority.”Decker said it’s unclear how many instances of warrantless entry have occurred and not been filmed or reported. Lately, in “know your rights” trainings for immigrants, attorneys have had to caveat lessons with an acknowledgement that federal agents won’t necessarily be deterred by constitutional and legal restrictions.For many residents, this has meant that regular life has been suspended. Immigrants and people of color who fear being stopped by ICE are staying home – avoiding work, school and shopping.Approximately 80%of immigrant-run businesses were closed last week. Some restaurants that are still open have posted signs barring federal agents and locked their doors – urging patrons to knock or ring a bell for entry.“Almost every single Latin business has their doors closed,” said Juan Leon, who owns Leo’s Tow in west St Paul. “They’re trying to strangulate our income.”For the past several weeks, he’s been providing a free service towing the abandoned vehicles of those taken by ICE.“It feels as though nowhere is safe,” one woman wrote to the Guardian; she’s a US citizen from Colombia who now carries around her passport with her wherever she goes. “I never felt the level of fear and constant concern that I feel now.” The Guardian is not identifying her because she fears being targeted by authorities.She wondered if her ancestors lived through something similar during the years of civil war in Colombia in the 1940s and 50s.It is difficult to drive around these cities without spotting an ICE vehicle. Evenings are soundtracked with the whistles and car horns of volunteer legal observers, posted at street corners and poised to alert residents that agents are in the area.As was the case in LA, Chicago and so many other cities that have been swamped by federal immigration agents, locals have stepped up to organize mutual aid efforts and food-delivery services for immigrants too afraid to leave their homes. Minnesotans have booked out online legal-observer training sessions.“What you have is moms, grandmas, teenagers out on the streets day in and day out doing everything that they can to protect their communities, so that we can go to bed with a clean conscience,” said Andrew Falstrom, a longtime community organiser. “But whatever we do, we won’t be able to match a federal force backed by billions of dollars.“They have guns and teargas,” he said. “And we’ve got whistles and car horns.”Explore more on these topicsMinneapolisOpinionICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)MinnesotaUS immigrationUS domestic policyUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The incumbent Liberal party faced crushing defeat before Mr Trump threatened toannex Canada. Mr Carney’s candidacy was buoyed up by apatriotic rallyagainst US bullying.Perhaps because his country has also been coveted by Mr Trump, Mr Carney has given one of the most clear-sighted responses of any democratic leader to the US president’s designs on Greenland. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, the Canadian prime ministerset out the challengefor countries whose security and prosperity have depended on a global system underwritten by the US.“The rules-based order is fading,” Mr Carney said, making way for a time of “great-power rivalry”. The change compels “middle powers”, such asCanada, to build new coalitions, invest in security and diversify economic ties. A new multilateral framework must be made from the ruins of the one Mr Trump is vandalising.Britain is also a middle power, and one whose position is uniquely awkward as the US, its closest military partner, is provoking a tariff war with its closest trading partner, the European Union. SirKeir Starmerhas cultivated good relations with Mr Trump while aligning the UK economy more closely with the EU as part of a post-Brexit “reset”.Supporters of the prime minister’s approach cite the need to prevent the US completely abandoning Ukraine to Russian aggression. Performative denunciation of the president might achieve little except to make Nato less popular in the White House and jeopardise Kyiv’s position in ceasefire negotiations.Earlier this week, when threatened with punitive US tariffs for supporting Danish sovereignty over Greenland, Sir Keir extolled the merit of “calm discussion” to resolve the issue. The US president repaid Sir Keir’s measured tone with aggression, attacking his plan to transfer the Chagos Islands to Mauritius as “stupidity” (although that arrangement previously had White House approval). The prime minister rightly pushed back, telling MPs he would not be pressed into changing his position. It should be clear now that the strategy of mid-Atlantic equidistance is unsustainable.Mr Trump’s contempt for old US alliances goes to the core of his politics. Mr Carney may be premature when he says the rupture from the old order has already happened, but it is imminent. Gordon Brown made the same pointin the Guardianearlier this week, calling for a “coalition of the willing” to “build a new global framework”.Sir Keir doesn’t express himself in such terms. He focuses on practical problem-solving in the moment, which he says is the way to achieve results. He is testing the limit of that approach. Without an account of the big picture, the prime minister will not get public consent for the difficult choices that face the UK. One of the tasks incumbent on middle powers, in Mr Carney’s analysis, is to “name reality” – not indulging a pretence that the old ways can endure.Sir Keir has proved he is adept at diplomacy, but he is a political leader, not just a diplomat. His duty is not only to work behind the scenes but to be candid with the public and “name the reality” of the epoch-defining global crisis that Britain must now navigate.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

At the next World Cup, in South Africa in 2010,people gathered in parksand open-air markets and hotel lobbies and unlicensed, makeshift bars in people’s garages. In Brazil, four years later,fans spilled from the bars on the Copacabanaor watched in restaurants or in streets closed for the occasion – not as if anybody was driving during the Seleção’sgames anyway.During the 2018 World Cup,Russia surprised visitors – and its own citizens– with its friendliness as spontaneous parties broke out all over the country. The reason the 2022 World Cup in Qatar didn’t entirely feel like a real World Cup is that those sorts of spontaneous soccer gatherings just didn’t seem to be happening, or not at the same scale, at any rate. The absence of hordes of supporters just milling about everywhere contributed to the feeling of being at a Potemkin World Cup.World Cups are a feeling. A sense that you’re at The Thing, a global convention on joy. That’s the sentiment the tournament evokes and bottles. It exists in the stadium, where it is studiously curated and ultimately makes everyWorld Cupsound and feel largely the same. But it exists outside the venues, too.Tickets, travel and Trump: How the 2026 World Cup is shaping up six months from the finalRead moreThis realization offers hope for the upcoming World Cup. Because there is opportunity in this edition’s unprecedented vastness. In the first World Cup staged in three countries; the first one contested by 48 teams. That there may be another way, a workaround.Ifthe shocking ticket pricesfor the actual World Cup will make it exclusive and inaccessible – as iswell established in these pages– something like a shadow World Cup may nevertheless emerge as an alternative.With a tall wall built around the genuine article, scalable only by a bundle of money, a kind of bootleg version may be fashioned out of the scraps and flashes of the tournament that have not yet been privatized and premium-ified. A lower-case world cup, as it were, consisting of fan fests and open training sessions and pre-tournament warmup matches. The bits not yet sold off to the highest bidder via the Visa pre-sale lottery peddling a bespoke, once-in-a-lifetime experience brought to you by Coca-Cola and Aramco and whomever else.There will still be an awful lot of World Cup-adjacent programming on offer around the tournament. And that means there’s opportunity to make the World Cup accessible, in a way, to people who can’t afford or access the full experience, financially or geographically.View image in fullscreenArgentina fans celebrate on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro during the 2014 World Cup.Photograph: Silvia Izquierdo/APFor a start, all 48 of those participants will be training somewhere, and will presumably hold a few open training sessions – an easy way for federations to score PR points in a coveted market. Germany willhold its training camp at Wake Forest Universityin North Carolina. Australia’sSocceroos might be based in Boise. The Netherlands, England and Argentina are allrumored to be headed for Kansas City. Francewill be based in Boston;Croatia in Alexandria, Virginia; andSpain apparently in Chattanooga.There may yet be teams who choose to train in Birmingham, Alabama; Westfield, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; Oklahoma City; Tucson; or Stillwater, Oklahoma, depending on which of Fifa’sproposed training facilitiesthey pick.Taken together, they will expand the World Cup’s footprint enormously.So, too, will the many pre-tournament tune-up games. Plenty of teams will choose to play their final friendlies at home, or at someone else’s home, but a great many will use the occasion to acclimate to the US. (Albeit not exactly to any of the host cities, becauseFifarules preclude the pre-World Cup exhibitions from being played at any of the venues where the tournament proper will be played, for some reason.)The “Road to ’26” series will pit Brazil, France, Colombia and Croatia up and down the East Coast in March. Argentina will play a pair of stateside friendlies in June against Honduras and Mexico, at undecided locations. The US will play newly crowned African champions Senegal in Charlotte on 31 May and Germany in Chicago on 6 June.More games will be announced. And tickets cannot be priced as prohibitively as the World Cup proper. (Surely. Right?!)The World Cup is about places and people. In Seattle, it should be about Pride | Leander SchaerlaeckensRead moreFan fests, meanwhile, those old staples of World Cup place-making, typically attracting tens of thousands of unticketed fans, are planned all over the country. And right now, all but New York City’s and New Jersey’s are expected to be free,per Front Office Sports. The latter will reportedly charge $12.50 to cover their costs of as much as $1m a day. (Since,as The Independent reported, the host cities have almost no avenues for recuperating their substantial World Cup costs, as Fifa devours almost all the revenue.) The festivalplanned for Rockefeller Centerduring the final two weeks of the tournament, however, will be free. New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani already isfreelancing watch-parties for major soccer gamesand promising to host more.If host cities, federations and US Soccer get creative, and if a concerted effort is made, this can still be a World Cup that a lot of people can touch. It can still leave a legacy and make memories beyond those lucky few who managed to get tickets.

But European leaders are not as helpless as the US president believesGeorg Riekeles is the associate director of the European Policy CentreWed 21 Jan 2026 12.13 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 13.04 ESTShareEU leaders’ toughrebukes to Donald Trump in Davosmust be followed by concrete action when they convene in Brussels on Thursday night. The US president’s attempt to strong-arm Greenland and Denmark, backed byexplicit tariff threatsagainst those who refuse to comply, is not bluster or improvisation. It is economic coercion, openly deployed to force political submission and territorial concessions. The danger lies in the demand itself, but also in how Europe responds.The EU has reached a moment of truth. If it cannot defend one of its member states whose most basic interests are under direct threat, then the EU is weakened as a geopolitical actor and emptied of purpose.For too long, European leaders have clung to a comforting but false belief that the EU cannot use its economic power against the US, because Europe and Ukraine depend on Washington for security. This argument is wrong. Moreover, it isstrategically corrosive. In a world of open coercion, appeasement and restraint do not buy stability. They invite further pressure.Trade conflicts, like coercive bargaining and military deterrence, are shaped in large part by escalation dominance – the ability to convince the other side that you are more willing and more capable of sustaining pressure. That dominance does not rest on size and leverage alone, but on unity and determination. On both counts,Europehas recently failed itself.The clearest example came last April,when the US imposedits “liberation day” tariffs. At that point, the EU had leverage. Acting forcefully and in parallel with China, it could have delivered a decisive one-two blow that Washington would have struggled to absorb politically and economically. Instead,Europe hesitated, split internally and retreated into caution. The result was the disastrousTurnberry deal brokered by Ursula von der Leyenlast July – an economic capitulation that mistook temporary calm for stability and partnership.As many of us warned it would, that deal has now collapsed under the weight of reality. Appeasement in today’s dog-eat-dog world does not moderate behaviour, it rewards it. Trump’s return with even more explicit demands is not an aberration. It is the logical consequence of Europe signalling that it folds rather than standing up for itself.Hesitation and ambiguity do not stabilise a coercive system. They turn into vulnerabilities to be exploited by those willing to push harder. Europe now finds itself with its back against the wall – and paradoxically, that is where its strength lies.The US has leverage over Europe, but the reverse is also true. The question is not whether both sides can hurt each other; it is who has the greater will to endure and to escalate. As Europeans have most to lose, they also have the strongest imperative and the means to win this. For Europe, the stakes are existential: a union that cannot defend itself economically cannot hope to shape its security environment either.Europeans must at last understand that they cannot “buy” defence security from the US by staying quiet and rolling over when Washington makes unacceptable demands. Folding to Trump does not protect Kyiv. It weakens the case for Ukraine’s defence, signals vulnerability to Moscow, multiplies threats on Europe and further unravels the international order.Europe’s response must therefore be vigorous and comprehensive – politically, diplomatically, militarily and economically.In addition to shoring up a military presence in Greenland through a Nato-led operation, or if necessary a coalition of the willing, Denmark would be justified in invokingNato’s article 4to force a discussion about the future of the alliance. That discussion must address the long-overdue need for Nato operational command and control arrangements in scenarios where the US chooses not to participate.In parallel, when EU leaders meet for their extraordinary European Council on Thursday night, they must issue an unequivocal rejection of Trump’s demands and set out a clear frame of action for forceful economic countermeasures.TheTurnberry trade dealwas premised on restoring stability in transatlantic economic relations, not creating an open channel for further coercion. That premise has been shredded. The European parliament was today voting tosuspend the agreement’s ratificationas a warning to the US. The European Council should go further and declare it null and void.In parallel, EU leaders should make clear to Washington that a retaliation package oftariffs on €93bn worth of US exportsto the EU will snap back into force on 7 February, if Washington refuses to back down. These measures were suspended last year, not abandoned, and postponing them again would amount to a conscious act of restraint in the face of open coercion.Finally, the EU should ready its never previously deployed anti-coercion instrument, or “trade bazooka”. Despite persistentmyths about implementing it, this need not take long at all. With coercion as blatant and public as now, the legal case is clearcut. With enough backing from EU governments under qualified majority voting, the instrument could be mobilised rapidly, giving Brussels a powerful retaliatory set of tools across services, digital platforms, procurement and investment.This is not about seeking confrontation, rather it is about restoring credibility. Trump may believe he has played his hand from a position of strength. Even if Trump appears to have backed off from threatening to use military force, Europe must show that he has misjudged his opponent. The alternative is not peace or stability, but irrelevance and a Europe progressively picked apart by predators.Georg Riekeles is the associate director of the European Policy CentreDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He is a protectionist, not a free trader. He thinks the climate crisis is a hoax and is suspicious of multilateral organisations. He prefers power plays to dialogue and he doesn’t have any time for the “woke” capitalism that Davos has been keen to promote, with its focus on gender equality and ethical investment. The shindig’s organisers, the World Economic Forum (WEF), had to agree tosideline those issuesin order to secure Trump’s appearance.For decades, anti-globalisation protesters have sought to shut down the WEF. Thanks to Trump’s threat to take over Greenland, their prayers may soon be answered. In today’s world,Davosis an irrelevance and it seems fitting that Trump should be on hand this week to deliver the coup de grace to the liberal international rules-based order that the WEF prides itself on upholding.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, was right when he said there has been a shift to a “world without rules”, and there is some irony in that, given that the liberal international rules-based order that has been in place since the second world war was largely a US construct.Pared back to basics, the liberal rules-based order has been just another way of describing US hegemony, with Europe as its junior partner. As part of this arrangement, the US guaranteed Europe’s security through Nato, and acted as the world’s consumer of last resort. Even before the arrival of Trump, this version of a liberal order was breaking down.There are a number of reasons for this. For a start, the institutional framework that makes and enforces the rules is no longer fit for purpose. The economic architecture of the postwar world – the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank – is now more than eight decades old and was designed along specifications drawn up by policymakers in Washington when US power was at its zenith.The US was granted an effective veto over IMF andWorld Bankdecisions. By dint of a gentleman’s agreement, it has the right to appoint the president of the World Bank, while Europe is allowed to choose the managing director of the IMF. Powerful emerging countries such as China, India and Brazil see no reason why the governance of the IMF and World Bank should reflect the world as it stood when they were created in 1944, as opposed to the one that exists today.View image in fullscreenThe British economist John Maynard Keynes (centre) at the UN international monetary and financial conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, July 1944.Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesIt is a similar story when it comes to trade. The liberalisation deals that reduced tariffs and increased market access were effectively a stitch-up between the US and Europe. Terms were agreed by the US and its western allies and then imposed on other countries. As developing countries have grown in size and importance, they have proved increasingly resistant to the idea that they should meekly accept agreements that offer them so little. Increasingly, the rest of the world sees little merit in a system weighted in favour of the rich developed nations. It has been more than 30 years since the last global trade agreement.Since then, the US’s position as the world’s economic hegemon has come under serious threat as the result of China’s rapid growth. Europe is in a worse state than the US. It has grown much more slowly, displays no signs of matching US innovation, and relies on it for its security. If Trump did decide to take Greenland by force, Europe collectively would be unable to stop him.The rules-based order is under internal as well as external threat. It was one thing when liberal democracy underpinned an economy in which a rising tide lifted all boats, but quite another in a world where the rich are getting richer while those on middle incomes and below are struggling. That’s most obviously the case in Trump’s America, where labour’s share of national income has fallen to itslowest level since records began.The question is what happens next. Clearly, a well-functioning international order is preferable to the law of the jungle, but crafting one is not going to be easy. It requires faster and more inclusive growth. It requires significantly higher investment in public infrastructure. It requires the rich west to give poorer countries financial help so that they can protect themselves against the climate crisis. It requires Europe to do more to pay for its own defence. And it requires reform of the international institutions: the United Nations and theWorld Trade Organizationas well as the IMF and the World Bank.The original aim of the IMF was to help countries with balance-of-payments problems and the UK, represented byJohn Maynard Keynes, argued that both creditor and debtor nations should have a role to play. The suggestion that creditor nations should be obliged to import more was turned down flat by the US, then comfortably the world’s biggest creditor nation. Instead, the burden of adjustment would fall on debtor nations through lower imports and domestic austerity. A properly functioning rules-based system would remedy this defect.There is no room for complacency. It may be tempting to imagine that things will be different when Trump has left the White House, but such optimism is misplaced. It is not just a question of replacing the narcissist currently residing in the White House. It is about tackling the structural reasons why the rules-based system is collapsing.As Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, said in Davos earlier this week, the old order “is not coming back”.Larry Elliott is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDavosOpinionWorld BankInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)Davos 2026Donald TrumpSecond world warEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Trump’s path is not the solutionKenneth RothA grand bargain on immigration could address problems with both the old approach and Trump’s new approachWed 21 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 10.02 ESTShareImmigration is one of the most divisive issues facing the United States, as it is in many countries. An ICE agent’skillingof Renee Good in Minneapolis is only the latest outrage that has brought the issue to thefore.Facing a 30 January deadline to renew funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, Democrats are nowinsistingon limits on ICE, at risk of another shutdown. It may be a pipe dream, but it is worth asking whether now might finally be a time to forge the long-elusivebipartisan agreement on immigration.I believe deeply in the value of immigration – my father was an immigrant, as were my mother’s parents – but even I must admit that the current system needs fixing. Until recently, immigrants flooded the US-Mexican border. Rather than trying to sneak across as in years past, mostpresentedthemselves at a formal border crossing and sought asylum.They proceeded entirely lawfully, but because their numbers overwhelmed the asylum system, it could takeyearsfor a claim to be considered, effectively allowing long-term residence in the United States before any ruling on the merits. That contributed to the perception that the asylum system wasbroken.Joe Biden’s administration addressed the problem by maintaining the theoretical right to seek asylum but imposingrestrictions, including making many migrants wait in Mexico where they werevulnerableto abuse and exploitation. Donald Trump has essentiallywithdrawnthe right to seek asylum at the border,denyingpeople fleeing war and persecution the opportunity to find a safe haven.So what is the solution? Given the prominence that Trump gave the issue during hiscampaign, it is safe to read his 2024 electoral victory as a mandate to tighten enforcement at the border. That could involve beefing up border patrols to deter people from sneaking in. It could even involve extending his notorious wall.But rather than destroy the right to seek asylum, a more appropriate response would be to increase the number of immigration judges – a funding issue – so that claims could be heard fairly yet expeditiously. Cutting the backlog would greatly decrease the time that asylum seekers without valid claims stay in the country.Trump’s deportationraidsinneighborhoodsand workplaces are far more controversial. Of the estimated14 millionundocumented immigrants in the United States, at leasttwo-thirdsand possibly as many as80%have been in the country for five or more years. About45%have been in the country for 20 years or more.The equities of deporting them are very different from deporting a recently arrived immigrant. The recent arrival has put down few if any roots. But immigrants who have been in the country for five or more years often will have US citizenspousesandchildren. They typically will holdjobs, pay taxes and have friends and relationships in the community. In short, the look like Americans in all but the papers they carry.Advocates of tighter immigration enforcement justify deporting them by noting that they are in the country “illegally”. But that’s not the end of the matter.If a person is accused of a crime, the criminal code contains a statute of limitations that, other than for the most serious conduct, bars prosecution unless charges are filed withinfiveyears of the alleged offense. Even most civil-law violationshavea statute of limitations. That doctrine reflects in part the view that, even if someone’s conduct is illegal, they should be allowed at some stage to move on with their lives – that there is somethingunfairabout upending their lives for something they did years ago.A crime is more serious than merely entering or staying in the United States without authorization, but in this respect US law treats the issue more severely: there is no recognized statute of limitations for immigration violations. An undocumented immigrant can be detained and deported even if they have had productive lives in the United States for many years or decades.Some prior administrations have tacitly recognized this unfairness byfocusingimmigration enforcement onrecentarrivals along the border – a policy rather than a legal solution. Trump’s raids in neighborhoods and workplaces across the country end that approach.We need a statute of limitations for immigration violations. If immigrants have not committed a serious crime while in the United States, asfewof those being deported by Trump have done, they should be allowed to stay if they have been in the country more than five years. Immigration opponents will undoubtedly howl that this is a dreaded “amnesty”, but it is no different from the statute of limitations that already exists in the criminal law, which hardly could be said to amnesty criminality.Why would immigration opponents support this measure? Because it could be part of a grand bargain. In return for beefing up enforcement at the border and increasing the capacity of the asylum system to expedite rulings, we would recognize the unfairness of deporting people who have built lives in the United States.That is the right thing to do. It would be a nod to reality, since the truth is that despite the high profile of Trump’s deportation raids, they are capturing only a tinyfractionof undocumented immigrants.There would also be political advantages to both sides. Democrats would make clear that they do not stand for open borders, which are broadlyunpopular. And Republicans could rid themselves of ICE conduct that is becomingtoxicas Americanssouron the idea of summarily deporting their colleague at work or their neighbor down the street.A grand bargain on immigration wouldn’t solve everything. It wouldn’t determine how many immigrants should be admitted as skilled workers, allowed family unification, resettled as refugees, or granted temporary protected status. But it could address a big part of what Americans have found wrong with the old approach to immigration and what they dislike about Trump’s new approach.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

We have the capacity to stop pretending’: the Canadian PM’s call to action at DavosMark CarneyIn a rousing speech, Mark Carney made the case for unity in the face of Donald Trump’s new world order. We reproduce it hereWed 21 Jan 2026 09.24 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 13.04 ESTShareToday I will talk about a rupture in the world order, the end of a pleasant fiction and the beginning of a harsh reality, where geopolitics – where the large, main power, geopolitics – is submitted to no limits, no constraints.On the other hand, I would like to tell you that the other countries, especially intermediate powers likeCanada, are not powerless. They have the capacity to build a new order that encompasses our values, such as respect for human rights, sustainable development, solidarity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the various states.The power of the less powerfulstarts with honesty.It seems that every day we’re reminded that we live in an era of great-power rivalry, that the rules-based order is fading, that the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must. This aphorism of Thucydides ispresented as inevitable, as the natural logic of international relations reasserting itself. And faced with this logic, there is a strong tendency for countries to go along to get along, to accommodate, to avoid trouble, to hope that compliance will buy safety.Well, it won’t. So, what are our options?In 1978, the Czech dissident Václav Havel, later president, wrote an essay calledThe Power of the Powerless, and in it, he asked a simple question: how did the communist system sustain itself?And his answer began with a greengrocer.Every morning, this shopkeeper places a sign in his window: “Workers of the world unite.” He doesn’t believe it – no one does – but he places a sign anyway to avoid trouble, to signal compliance, to get along. And because every shopkeeper on every street does the same, the system persists – not through violence alone, but through the participation of ordinary people in rituals they privately know to be false.Havel called this “living within a lie”.The system’s power comes not from its truth, but from everyone’s willingness to perform as if it were true, and its fragility comes from the same source. When even one person stops performing, when the greengrocer removes his sign, the illusion begins to crack. Friends, it is time for companies and countries to take their signs down.For decades, countries like Canada prospered under what we called the rules-based international order. We joined its institutions, we praised its principles, we benefited from its predictability. And because of that, we could pursue values-based foreign policies under its protection.We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false, that the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient, that trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour, depending on the identity of the accused or the victim.This fiction was useful, and American hegemony, in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes. So we placed the sign in the window. We participated in the rituals, and we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality.View image in fullscreenMark Carney speaks at the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, 20 January 2026.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersThis bargain no longer works. Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.Over the past two decades, a series of crises in finance, health, energy and geopolitics have laid bare the risks of extreme global integration. But more recently, great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited. You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration, when integration becomes the source of your subordination.The multilateral institutions on which the middle powers have relied – the WTO, the UN, the Cop, the architecture, the very architecture of collective problem-solving – are under threat. And as a result, many countries are drawing the same conclusions that they must develop greater strategic autonomy, in energy, food, critical minerals, in finance and supply chains. And this impulse is understandable. A country that can’t feed itself, fuel itself or defend itself, has few options. When the rules no longer protect you, you must protect yourself.But let’s be clear-eyed about where this leads.A world of fortresses will be poorer, more fragile and less sustainable. And there is another truth. If great powers abandon even the pretence of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power and interests, the gains from transactionalism will become harder to replicate.Hegemons cannot continually monetise their relationships. Allies will diversify to hedge against uncertainty. They’ll buy insurance, increase options in order to rebuild sovereignty – sovereignty that was once grounded in rules, but will increasingly be anchored in the ability to withstand pressure.This room knows this is classic risk management. Risk management comes at a price, but that cost of strategic autonomy, of sovereignty can also be shared. Collective investments in resilience are cheaper than everyone building their own fortresses. Shared standards reduce fragmentations. Complementarities are positive-sum. And the question for middle powers like Canada is not whether to adapt to the new reality – we must. The question is whether we adapt by simply building higher walls, or whether we can do something more ambitious.Now Canada was among the first to hear the wake-up call, leading us to fundamentally shift our strategic posture. Canadians know that our old comfortable assumptions that our geography and alliance memberships automatically conferred prosperity and security – that assumption is no longer valid. And our new approach rests on what Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland, has termed “value-based realism”.Or, to put another way, we aim to be both principled and pragmatic – principled in our commitment to fundamental values, sovereignty, territorial integrity, the prohibition of the use of force (except when consistent with the UN charter), and respect for human rights; and pragmatic and recognising that progress is often incremental, that interests diverge, that not every partner will share all of our values.So, we’re engaging broadly, strategically with open eyes. We actively take on the world as it is, not wait around for a world we wish to be. We are calibrating our relationships, so their depth reflects our values, and we’re prioritising broad engagement to maximise our influence, and given the fluidity of the world at the moment, the risks that this poses and the stakes for what comes next.And we are no longer just relying on the strength of our values, but also the value of our strength.We are building that strength at home.Since my government took office, we have cut taxes on incomes, on capital gains and business investment. We have removed all federal barriers to interprovincial trade. We are fast-tracking a trillion dollars of investments in energy, AI, critical minerals, new trade corridors and beyond. We’re doubling our defence spending by the end of this decade, and we’re doing so in ways that build our domestic industries.View image in fullscreenMark Carney and Emmanuel Macron meet at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, 20 January 2026.Photograph: Sean Kilpatrick/APAnd we are rapidly diversifying abroad. We have agreed a comprehensive strategic partnership with the EU, including joining Safe, the European defence procurement arrangements. We have signed 12 other trade and security deals on four continents in six months. The past few days, we’ve concluded new strategic partnerships with China and Qatar. We’re negotiating free-trade pacts with India, Asean, Thailand, the Philippines and Mercosur.We’re doing something else. To help solve global problems, we’re pursuing variable geometry – in other words, different coalitions for different issues based on common values and interests. So, on Ukraine, we’re a core member of the coalition of the willing and one of the largest per capita contributors to its defence and security.On Arctic sovereignty, we stand firmly with Greenland and Denmark, and fully support their unique right to determine Greenland’s future.Our commitment to Nato’s article 5 is unwavering, so we’re working with our Nato allies, including theNordic-Baltic eight, to further secure the alliance’s northern and western flanks, including through Canada’s unprecedented investments in over-the-horizon radar, in submarines, in aircraft and boots on the ground, boots on the ice.Canada strongly opposes tariffs over Greenland and calls for focused talks to achieve our shared objectives of security and prosperity in the Arctic.On plurilateral trade, we’re championing efforts to build a bridge between theTrans-Pacific Partnershipand the EU, which would create a new trading bloc of 1.5 billion people. On critical minerals, we’re forming buyers’ clubs anchored in the G7, so the world can diversify away from concentrated supply. And on AI, we’re cooperating with like-minded democracies to ensure that we won’t ultimately be forced to choose between hegemons and hyper-scalers.This is not naive multilateralism, nor is it relying on their institutions. It’s building coalitions that work – issues by issue, with partners who share enough common ground to act together. In some cases, this will be the vast majority of nations. What it’s doing is creating a dense web of connections across trade, investment, culture, on which we can draw for future challenges and opportunities.The middle powers must act together, because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu. But I’d also say that great powers, great powers can afford, for now, to go it alone. They have the market size, the military capacity and the leverage to dictate terms. Middle powers do not.But when we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what’s offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating. This is not sovereignty. It’s the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination. In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice – compete with each other for favour, or combine to create a third path with impact.We shouldn’t allow the rise of hard power to blind us to the fact that the power of legitimacy, integrity and rules will remain strong, if we choose to wield them together – which brings me back to Havel.What does it mean for middle powers to live the truth?First, it means naming reality. Stop invoking a rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is – a system of intensifying great power rivalry, where the most powerful pursue their interests, using economic integration as coercion.It means acting consistently, applying the same standards to allies and rivals. When middle powers criticise economic intimidation from one direction, but stay silent when it comes from another, we are keeping the sign in the window.It means building what we claim to believe in, rather than waiting for the old order to be restored. It means creating institutions and agreements that function as described. And it means reducing the leverage that enables coercion – that’s building a strong domestic economy. It should be every government’s immediate priority.And diversification internationally is not just economic prudence, it’s a material foundation for honest foreign policy, because countries earn the right to principled stands by reducing their vulnerability to retaliation.So – Canada. Canada has what the world wants. We are an energy superpower. We hold vast reserves of critical minerals. We have the most educated population in the world. Our pension funds are among the world’s largest and most sophisticated investors. In other words, we have capital, talent … we also have a government with immense fiscal capacity to act decisively. And we have the values to which many others aspire.Canada is a pluralistic society that works. Our public square is loud, diverse and free. Canadians remain committed to sustainability. We are a stable and reliable partner in a world that is anything but. A partner that builds and values relationships for the long term.And we have something else. We have a recognition of what’s happening and a determination to act accordingly. We understand that this rupture calls for more than adaptation. It calls for honesty about the world as it is.We are taking the sign out of the window. We know the old order is not coming back. We shouldn’t mourn it. Nostalgia is not a strategy, but we believe that from the fracture, we can build something bigger, better, stronger, more just. This is the task of the middle powers, the countries that have the most to lose from a world of fortresses and most to gain from genuine cooperation.The powerful have their power. But we have something, too – the capacity to stop pretending, to name reality, to build our strength at home and to act together.That is Canada’s path. We choose it openly and confidently, and it is a path wide open to any country willing to take it with us.Mark Carney is prime minister of Canada and was governor of the Bank of England 2013-2020Explore more on these topicsDavosOpinionEconomic policyDonald TrumpMark CarneyCanadaAmericascommentShareReuse this content"

This is just a pretence that normality continuesFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastWed 21 Jan 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 16.24 ESTShareThis week the IMF released an update to its World Economic Outlook, titled “Global Economy: Steady amid Divergent Forces” and, seriously, in what fricking world are they living? It was yet another example of international groups, governments and parts of the media sane-washing the utter crisis we all exist in because Donald Trump is an egomaniacal bully with the impulses of a spoiled toddler.How’s this for timing:on SundayDonald Trump announced from 1 February he will levy a 10% tariff “on any and all goods sent to the United States” from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland, and will increase it to 25% from 1 June unless they let the US gain control of Greenland.The next day the IMF releaseda reportin which it noted that since October 2025 “trade tensions have continued to abate but remain subject to occasional flare-ups”.Flare-ups? Cripes. I guess the IMF could not write “the madman in the White House hasn’t done anything lately, but you know he probably will because he is deranged and could for example decide that he deserves Greenland because Norway didn’t give him the Nobel peace prize.”No one writes or says that. Everyone fudges around trying hard to suggest things are normal. Americans being killed by roving gangs of government-sanctioned thugs and Trump threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act is just worthy ofa straight report. Heck, Donald Trumpposting a photoof himself sitting before a map showing the US flag on Venezuela, Canada and Greenland is just Trump being Trump – a bit provocative, or even just“trolling”.Give me strength.When did everyone become so utterly committed to ensuring gross acts of violence and betrayal of international laws would be prettied up for easy consumption?Consider that the IMF’s update showed this chart of the effective rate of tariffs that shows the average tariffs paid by Americans on all imports is higher than the IMF projected in October.They describe it all in very calm language, stripped of any emotion or understanding: “the overall US effective tariff rate at about the same level as assumed in the October 2025 WEO, but the changes for specific countries can be meaningful”.“Meaningful”?The tariffs Americans are paying now are more than six times higher than this time last year, and they are set to go even higher. But sure, “meaningful”.It’s all so maddening.The IMF has decided that yes, tariffs are bad, but hey have you seen all that investment in AI?I noted previously that the more recent GDP figures showed Australia is also having a boomin AI investment:The IMF has clearly hitched its wagon to AI as being the driver of economic growth for the future.The report suggests that “on the upside, rapid adoption of AI, possibly facilitated by the ongoing surge in AI-related investment in both hard and soft infrastructure, could significantly improve productivity and boost medium-term growth prospects sooner rather than later.”I mean, yeah, it could. It also could, as the IMF notes “fail to deliver earnings commensurate with their lofty valuations, and investor sentiment could sour”. The upshot of that is it could lead to “triggering a costly reallocation of capital and labor … and a more significant correction in equity markets, global output losses could increase further”.That is: a global recession.What about energy concerns? No worries, so long as governments enact “complementary policies to contain the potential impact on energy prices” and “scale up the necessary critical intermediate inputs, and labour market programs to manage workforce transitions are in place”.But other than those small hurdles …The IMF’s report makes no mention of Greenland, or Venezuela, or even Trump. Everything that defiles the pretence that normality continues is scrubbed away.And normality has left the room, the building, and was last seen driving 160km/h towards the edge of the Grand Canyon.Kremlin says Putin has been invited to join Trump’s Gaza ‘board of peace’Read moreThis week, Trump invited countries around the world to join his personal UN, or “board of peace”, and put aprice of $1bnto become a permanent member.Yep, $1bn to sit at a table withTony Blair and Jared Kushner. When French President Macron said,Yeah nah, Trump offhandedly threateneda 200% tariff on French wine. A totally normal thing to say or do, and very much a case of “steady amid divergent forces”.Ignore the madman in the middle of the room; let’s just focus on the projections of global growth that are good if we assume normality.Scrub away kidnapping of a national leader because Trump wants to get oil, ignore that Trump two weeks ago withdrew the US from66 international organisationsincludingthe “International Institute for Justice and the Rule of Law”, and the “UN Conference on Trade and Development” and the “International Trade Centre”.Ignore that and instead write, “against this backdrop of stabilising trade tensions and supportive financial conditions, the global economy has continued to be remarkably resilient, adapting to the shifting landscape and with momentum varying across countries and sectors.”The IMF wants to pretend all is calm and nice; it is not. This pretence just gives Trump more permission to smash everything and anything that takes his fancy.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and chief economist at the Australia InstituteExplore more on these topicsInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)OpinionDonald TrumpEconomicsAI (artificial intelligence)commentShareReuse this content"

In practice, these largelyuntrained and undisciplinedfederal agents have beenterrorizing Minneapolisresidents through illegal and excessive uses of force – often against US citizens – prompting a federal judge to attempt to placelimits on the agency’s actions. The Trump administration is encouraging the lawlessness by announcing“absolute immunity”for ICE agents. But if the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, does not heed the court ruling, the consequences may be nothing short of civil war.In just the past week, ICE agentsshot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, shortly after she returned from dropping her child off at school. Theyblinded two protestersby shooting them in the face with so-called “less deadly” weapons. They firedteargas bombsaround the car of a family carrying six children, sending one child to the emergency room with breathing problems. They violentlydragged a woman out of her carand on to the ground screaming. They haveshot protesters in the legs. They have forcibly taken thousands of individuals todetention facilities, separating families and casting people into legal limbo – often without regard to their legal status.Rather than investigate this conduct and the officer who shot Renee Good, the justice department hasopened a criminal investigationinto the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, and Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, accusing them of conspiring to impede federal agents. Renee Good’s widow is alsounder investigation, a move thatprompted six US attorneysin Minnesota to resign in protest.As public outrage grows, ICE has escalated its actions, increasingly engaging in what appear to berandom acts of violenceregardless of immigration status. Governor Walz has placedthe Minnesota national guardon standby to support local law enforcement, while Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act – an extraordinary move that would grant him sweeping domestic military powers and potentially sidestep recent supreme court limits on the use of federal troops in law enforcement.One thousand additional ICE agents have been sent to Minnesota, suggesting that Trump is essentially using ICE as a specialized paramilitary force to target protesters and suppress dissent. And the Pentagon hasreadied the army’s 11th Airborne Division– roughly 1,500 active-duty soldiers – to back up the president’s threat.This scenario closely mirrors one explored in an October 2024 tabletop exercise conducted by theCenter for Ethics and the Rule of Law (CERL), which I direct, at the University of Pennsylvania. In that exercise, a president carried out a highly unpopular law-enforcement operation in Philadelphia and attempted to federalize the Pennsylvania’s national guard. When the governor resisted and the guard remained loyal to the state, the president deployed active-duty troops, resulting in an armed conflict between state and federal forces. The core danger we identified is now emerging: a violent confrontation between state and federal military forces in a major American city.While our hypothetical scenario picked a different city and a slightly different sequence of events, the conclusions we reached about the possibility of green-on-green violence are directly applicable to the current situation. First, none of the participants – many of them senior former military and government officials – considered the scenario unrealistic, especially after the supreme court’s decision in Trump v United States, which granted the president criminal immunity for official acts.Second, we concluded that in a fast-moving emergency of this magnitude, courts would probably be unable or unwilling to intervene in time, leaving state officials without meaningful judicial relief. State officials might file emergency motions to enjoin the use of federal troops, but judges would either fail to respond quickly enough or decline to rule on what they view as a “political question”, leaving the conflict unresolved. This is why Judge Menendez’s ruling is so critical: it may be the last opportunity a federal judge has to intervene before matters spiral completely out of control.Third, we warned that senior military leaders could face orders to use force not only against state national guard units, but against unarmed civilians – and that they must be prepared to assess the legality of such orders. Any domestic deployment of federal troops must comply with theDepartment of Defense’s Rules for the Use of Forceand with the constitution, including the Bill of Rights. Even under the Insurrection Act, federal troops may not lawfully shoot protesters unless they are literally defending their lives against an imminent threat – yet such conduct is already happening in Minneapolis at the hands of federal agents.Finally, it is not legal for federal troops to back up ICE agents who are behaving illegally.Every member of the US military has sworn an oath to defend the constitution. That oath carries legal force. Service members are not only permitted but obligated to refuse patently illegal orders.That obligation is now under pressure. Senator Mark Kelly isunder investigationby the Pentagon for publicly reminding service members in a video he made with five other members of Congress that they may – and in some cases must – refuse illegal orders. But they were essentially correct: troops must refuse to carry out patently illegal orders.For members of the 11th Airborne Division, this may soon cease to be a theoretical question.Minnesotamay be the first test of whether constitutional limits on domestic military force still hold – or whether the United States is about to cross a line from which it cannot easily return.Claire Finkelstein is the Algernon Biddle professor of law and professor of philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School.

It was pointed towards meWarning:This article contains graphic contentWed 21 Jan 2026 18.48 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 21.27 ESTShareHanukah is called “the festival of light”. It is a minor holiday in the Jewish calendar, not biblically prescribed. There are no long synagogue services, no onerous prohibitions or requirements. Just candles, songs and doughnuts. This is probably part of why I always loved it.There were four or five events in Sydney for the first night of Hanukah. In 2024 we went to an event at Dover Heights, but parking was a nightmare. We decide on Bondi (where parking is also a nightmare). Five of us – my mum, husband, son (3), daughter (one-and-a-half) and I pile into the car.We walk past the Christmas markets at Bondi beach, looking for the festival. I google it, but don’t expect to find an answer.Australians to perform acts of kindness on national day of mourning for Bondi terror attack victimsRead moreTypically, Jewish events in Sydney are advertised without locations. A party is at an “eastern suburbs location” or “outdoor venue, Sydney south-east”. The exact location is provided only to people who register, and only on the day. This is a security measure. The idea is that nobody can plan an attack on an unspecified location.So I’m surprised when Google tells that it’s down near the children’s playground. We meander over with the pram.My son runs straight to his paternal grandmother, already inside. We take some photos – the photographer tells us we’ll have a fridge magnet in about half an hour. I will later learn his name isPeter Meagher.We play with bubbles. We visit the petting zoo. We eat doughnuts. The kids share a hotdog with my husband.My son is with my mother-in-law. My husband takes my daughter to chase down my mum in a bid to stop her buying more hotdogs. I am chatting with friends. I haven’t seen my son – or my mother-in-law – for a while. The others haven’t either. Nobody is worried, they are off having fun somewhere. Still. I leave the conversation to go to look for them.I am by myself, walking around an open area, not too far from the gate, trying to get sight of them. I hear a very loud bang. I am not sure what it is. I don’t think much of it. I am busy looking for my kid.I have never heard a gun before.There is another bang, and another.I see someone fall to the ground. I see blood. People are screaming. People are getting on the floor. This is not fireworks.The music hasn’t stopped. Techno covers of Hanukah classics. Songs I have sung since I was a kid. The screaming doesn’t stop the music, but it distorts, somehow, like a bad sci-fi movie.I see the back of my husband’s shirt, I see he is holding my daughter, I see he is near a fence and running. I know he will keep her safe.But I still cannot see my son. I scream his name. I run in circles looking for him for a few more shots. I cannot see him. I see a little girl with face paint. She is screaming for her mummy and daddy. She is scared. She is in an open space. I run and grab her.This space is too open. There are too many shots. I take maybe five steps towards the chairs, I am behind the last row. It is the closest thing I can find to cover. I lie on the grass, on top of the little girl.They say: come, run, we will get you out of here. I do not trust them. I hate that I do not trust them. I always trustThere are many people lying or crouching in the chairs in front of me. Most are elderly. Everyone is screaming.I stay calm, I understand the importance of calm. I talk to the little girl. I say, I’ve got you. She is calm, too. The shots keep coming.This next part is a jumble; I am not sure of the order of events. It seems to go forever. It is less than six minutes.I lift my phone to take a video; the zoom helps me to see better. One man is on the footbridge. He is holding a gun. It is pointed towards me. He fires two times, three. The other man is pacing on the ground, outside the fence. He is moving slowly. He looks calm. The little girl says, “Can you hide?” “Yes,” I say. I put the phone down. It is 6.43pm.A woman is lying in front of me, maybe a metre-and-a-half away, among the chairs. She is facing the shooters – I see the back of her head. Then – the woman is a body. Her head must have turned with the impact. I can see the tip of her nose. There is a U shape where her eyes and forehead used to be. Bits of brain, beige and squishy, are laced through the grass.My shoulder stings. I am dripping blood. I am dripping blood. I am dripping blood and I don’t know how much of it is mine. I am dripping blood on to a little girl. She won’t tell me her name.There is blood on my glasses. I take a selfie to see whether the blood is mine. I see small pieces of brain in my hair. I stop paying attention to the blood. It is 6:47pm.I get a text from my husband. There is blood on my phone. He says, “We are safe. I have [daughter] only.” I say “Have a little girl. Not mine. Someone has been shot.” The texts are short. I write, “I hand bloom. Blood. I don’t kni”. He writes “From you?” I say, “I don’t know. Keeping girl safe. [Son]. My mum.” He responds to son with “With [grandma]. Safe inside playground.”I should explain: these texts are atypical. Normally I write in full sentences, even in text, with no spelling mistakes.It is 6:53pm. My kids should be starting a bath.This next part is better.A man comes up to me, he is crouched. He says I have his daughter. I don’t know him. I don’t want to give her over unless it’s safe. She says “Daddy” and reaches. I feel grateful. I give her over. I tell him: the blood is not hers. I think it is mine. This lady got shot. I tell him, I am sorry. He asks if I am OK. He says I saved her life. His daughter is safe. I am grateful.‘Left an immeasurable void’: Holocaust survivors, community heroes and ‘spirited child’ among victims of Bondi terror attackRead moreI want my husband. My kids. My mum. Nobody has said it is safe. I stay on the floor.Two young men come up to me. They are not wearing shirts – I think they have come from the beach. They say: come, run, we will get you out of here. I do not trust them. I hate that I do not trust them. I always trust. I say – sorry, I do not know you. I will go myself. They say, of course. Now I am sorry. I feel grateful.I get up. I stay low, move towards the boardwalk. I see my mum. She looks unharmed. I am grateful. We walk down the boardwalk. I tell her to walk faster. I find my husband. My daughter. I feel grateful.I tell him, I need to see a doctor.When I was a kid, if I got a cut on my left hand, my dad would give it a kiss, then ask if we needed to amputate the right hand so the left hand didn’t hurt any more. This is to say: I was raised strong. So if I say I need a doctor, my husband takes it seriously.But also: there are two, three ambulances. And there are bodies. Wounded, dead. Being dragged or carried to the far side of the park. I see three paramedics working on someone who is more blood and flesh than human. I do not look too closely. My husband is yelling for a doctor. Someone says, “Wait here.”People are dying. I am sore, but I am OK. I just want to check our baby. We decide to make our own way. I hold my daughter. My husband says, “You need to clean yourself first, you are covered in blood.” I don’t care, I want to hold her. We catch my mother-in-law, my son. I am grateful. I am so grateful. Relief. Relief beyond measure.At the hospital, I am seen quickly. People are kind. They are kind beyond measureMy son says, “Ima, why are you wearing makeup?” Ima is mum, in Hebrew.I say, “It is face paint.”He says, “I want face paint too.”“Another time,” I say.We talk lightly; my son is asking about the helicopters. We are holding hands. We are holding each other. We are going to go back to the car, we are going to go home, we are going to have dinner.My husband drops me off at the hospital on the way home. He takes the kids home. I have not prepared dinner. I am worried about what they will eat. He tells me later he gave them yoghurt and jam and put them to sleep. This is not a real dinner. I am grateful.At the hospital, I am seen quickly. People are kind. They are kind beyond measure. My nurse’s name is Connor. He is gentle, speaks softly. I am grateful.I have minor cuts and bruises. A deep gash in my nose. A long slash on my right shoulder blade, with no depth. Little dots of bleeding on my forehead, my arms. These are already drying. The body heals. Later, I will find out my body has healed around a little piece of shrapnel, under that little dot of bleeding, next to my eyebrow. All that is for later. Now, I want to check my baby. I get an ultrasound. Baby is moving. Baby’s heart is beating.What happens to accidental heroes when the headlines fade? ‘You get your award and then there’s nothing’Read moreI cannot describe how grateful I am. I cannot possibly put this into words. I text my husband.Kids are asleep. My husband comes. Connor and I agree to skip stitches for my nose and glue it instead; it will bleed for a week, but scar less.Connor gets permission to allow me to have a shower. There are brains in my hair. A shower. I am grateful.My husband helps me to wash my body. He is gentle and slow. He finds more cuts in my scalp. I put my bloody clothes back on. We drive home. It is quiet.In coming days, I meet the girl’s parents. She is three years old, just like my son. Her parents say she is OK. I am grateful.View image in fullscreenPhotographs of the people killed in the Bondi beach terror attack on 14 December 2025.Photograph: Jessica Hromas/The GuardianPeople keep calling me a hero.

My husband, who saved my daughter. My mother-in-law, who saved my son. Every single parent, every single person who saved every single child.When my son started walking, he would often walk himself into danger, as toddlers do. I would stop him from falling off a couch, and he would scream and kick and bite. I taught him: “Our number one job is to keep you safe. Our number two job is to give you love.” I could not keep him safe. I could not keep so many people safe. I do not know how to live in a world where a parent does not know how to keep their children safe.I have other heroes.A group of men who went to the playground, shielded women and children, including my mother-in-law and my son, barricaded them in the surf club.Hatzolah, paramedics.

It’s vital to put young people’s mental health firstKemi Badenoch is the leader of the Conservative partyBadenoch tells Starmer to ‘just get on’ with under-16s social media banWed 21 Jan 2026 11.06 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 11.10 ESTShareThe Conservative party believes in freedom. We believe people should be able to make choices about their own lives. That they, not the state, should decide what they do. But freedom is not a given. It depends on something more fundamental: the ability to make good choices in the first place. And that ability is not fully formed in children.For too long, Britain has treated childhood as an afterthought. We know that a child’s early years shape the trajectory of their entire life. Yet our political system has too often focused more on repairing damage in adulthood rather than preventing it early on. That is a dereliction of our duty as politicians.Children’s brains are still developing. Their impulse control, emotional regulation and ability to assess risk are not the same as an adult’s. That is why we have age limits on alcohol, a legal age of consent and safeguarding requirements in schools. To most people this is common sense. And yet, in one crucial area, we have decided to suspend that logic entirely.Children today are allowed to spend hours a day online, exposed to violence, pornography and extremist content. Content that we know is linked to rising anxiety, poor sleep, reduced concentration andknock-on effects on behaviour and education. Content designed not for children, but for adults, optimised to capture attention and maximise engagement.I am a firm believer that you can overcome a huge amount in life with the right knowledge and training. But by exposing children, at scale, to technologies that erode attention spans and disrupt learning, we are making that task harder. We are denying them the mental resilience they will need to shape their own futures.That’s why we in the Conservative party have acted. Last year, theConservativesannounced our plan to ban smartphones in schools.And this month, we have gone further by becoming the first party in Britain to support aban on social media for under-16s. As Conservatives, we believe parents are best placed to raise their own children. But as a parent myself, I also know this: no one can be all-seeing. Children want to be doing what their friends are doing, and are clever enough to figure out how to do it. That’s why I know that thevast majority of parents support a ban, however difficult it will be to implement.My husband and I are raising our children in a world that is more demanding than the one we grew up in. Their generation are growing up more anxious and worried than in previous years. They aremore anxious than previous generations. It would be foolish to blame a single cause, but it would be equally foolish to pretend social media plays no role. Children should be free to grow up and grow into themselves. They should be free to make mistakes, to develop a sense of self and to emerge as healthy, confident young adults with productive lives ahead of them.This is also about economics, not just health and wellbeing. A generation that struggles to concentrate will struggle to study. And a generation that cannot study will struggle to build the companies of the future, serve in our armed forces, or sustain our public services.By restricting social media use for children, we aren’t just protecting children. We can also give more freedoms to adults online. We will no longer need to contort digital spaces to be universally “child-friendly”, or impose blanket restrictions on speech and content because children might see it. If we stop treating children like adults, we can stop treating adults like children too.What is striking is how wide the consensus on this issue has become. Campaigners, clinicians, parents and experts are aligned. Even61 Labour MPshave urged their own leadership to support action.As usual,Keir Starmerand his Labour government haven’t done the thinking on this. The one thing they can normally be relied upon for is a U-turn. But so far they haven’t even managed that. Instead, they’ve announced yet another consultation, kicking the can down the road.We will not be bought off with vague promises of a “national conversation” about whether we should get children off these adult platforms. The prime minister must set out how he will act and by when. The crossbench peer Lady Kidron, who supports Conservative peerLord Nash’s amendmentin the House of Lords, is right to say Starmer’s approach “is not leading; it is not governing”. He is “doing nothing – slowly”, which is “the very epitome of party before country”.Let’s just get on with it.Today, the House of Lords will vote on measures to get children off adult social media platforms and I am proud that it is the Conservative party that is driving this change. Putting our children’s mental health first is the right thing to do. How much longer will we have to wait until the government agrees?Kemi Badenoch is the leader of the Conservative party and MP for North West EssexExplore more on these topicsSocial media banOpinionSocial mediaChildrenKeir StarmerLabourConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

The threats to my life there don’t seem to matterThe writer is an asylum seeker in the UKWed 21 Jan 2026 11.04 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 11.07 ESTShareIdid not come to the UK on a small boat because I was reckless, desperate or careless with my life. I came because every legal door was closed to me. And the danger I faced at home left me with no real choice. Now, however, I am staring down the barrel of a British government policy that could put me in harm’s way again.In my home country, I had a stable job helping manage an oilfield. I was not a failure and was not running towards Europe for a better salary or an easier life. I was running away from power, corruption and injustice. I had to flee because of a powerful, influential individual who targeted me. Where I am from, when someone like that decides to destroy you, there is no protection, no court you can rely on and no future. I tried many times to leave my country legally, but no other country would accept my case. The situation became urgent. Staying meant serious harm or death.I first went to France – but even there I did not feel safe. I knew the person I was running from could reach me. Thepower of smugglers, human trafficking networks and organised crimein France is well known to asylum seekers. I received threats and my family received threats as well. I lived in constant fear. That is why I made the most dangerous decision of my life: to cross the Channel on a small boat. After I left France to travel to the UK, my family received a call from a French number threatening to harm me. They said that they hadn’t managed to catch me while I was in France – but that if I returned there, they would get me.I risked my life because I believed in British law and justice. I believed in its long history of protecting people fleeing persecution. When I saw the UK flag on the Border Force boat, I truly believed it was salvation. I thought the suffering was over, that the long journey and years of living under threat had finally ended.I was wrong. We were not given time to rest or recover. We were taken straight into interviews that did not feel like interviews at all. No one listened to our stories or tried to understand who we were or what had happened to us. The officer barely looked at me, focusing instead on a computer screen.Randomly, a small percentage of people from each boat were sent to detention centres, while others were sent to migrant hotels. I was one of the unlucky ones – I was taken to a detention centre. It was the first time in my life I had seen a place like this, like something out of a prison drama. I was shocked. Ourphones were taken away. I was locked inside with people who had criminal records. The centre was full ofdrugsandviolence. It is extremely dangerous to put innocent people in such an environment. Our only “crime” was asking for asylum.There isno real access to legal representation. It is an unfair battle between the Home Office and people who do not even know what a solicitor is. Many detainees do not understand the process, the language or their rights. People are taken by force on to planes. Fear fills every corridor. When apeaceful protest was organised, the response was brutal. Officers were sent in with dogs and teargas. We never imagined this would happen in the UK. For people who already carry trauma, this treatment causes deep psychological damage.I am subject to the UK government’s “one in, one out” policy. This meansBritain can send asylum seekerswho cross by small boat back to France in return for the same number of asylum seekers in France who have not tried to enter the UK by boat.The UK government says I should return to France. But there is clear evidence of threats against me and my family. When I submitted these threats to the Home Office, I was told that the translation was not done word for word by a licenced translator. This was used as an excuse to dismiss the danger. It felt like a mockery. How can I trust a country that does not stop smugglers, that is full of smuggling networks itself, to protect me? Thethreats and dangersthat await some migrants facing deportation to France have been documented.This UK-France deal is presented as a solution, but it is not.It benefits France,which has received £800m since 2015 from the UK to prevent asylum seekers from coming over. It damages the UK, undermining its reputation for fairness.What has actually changed since the deal came into effect? More than 16,000 people have crossed the Channel since people were first detained for “one in, one out” on 6 August 2025. Until last week, fewer than 250 people had been returned toFrance. The vast majority are stuck in hotels or detention centres. Smugglers are still operating. Crossings have not stopped. France is happy. The UK has gained nothing, except shame and suffering inflicted on a small group of unlucky people.There are always alternatives. There are right ways to address this issue: safe and legal routes, fair asylum processing and real cooperation that targets smugglers, not victims. If France does not stop the small boats and the smuggling networks, the crossings will never stop.Punishing innocent asylum seekers will never solve this problem. The UK does not need harsher detention centres – it needs courage, honesty and leadership. The problem is smugglers and failed policies, not people like me who believed in British justice and risked everything to reach safety.The writer is an asylum seeker in the UK. As told to Diane TaylorA Home Office spokesperson said, “We cannot be clearer: migrants arriving in the United Kingdom illegally on a small boat can expect to be sent back to France.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When will we learn that humans are really not that special?Helen PilcherVeronika’s improvised grooming device has caused great surprise – but that tells us more about humans than cowsWed 21 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 11.14 ESTShareIhave a farmer friend who regularly regales me with colourful stories of her cattle. Take the time when a beef cow called Noisette used her tongue to pull back the catch on the door of her pen so she could steal cattle nuts from the nearby feed bin. Or the time when she did it again, not to let herself out, but seemingly to stand back and watch as her freed compatriots “mooched around and caused mayhem.”Where others see a herd of cows standing around looking bored, my friend sees a soap opera, with characters and plot twists. Cows, she tells me, learn quickly, bore easily and have an indefatigable penchant for mischief.So whennews brokeof a cow called Veronika who uses a broom to scratch her butt, my friend was nonplussed. “I don’t think many dairy farmers would be surprised to learn that,” she says.Writing in the journalCurrent Biology, researchers from the University of Veterinary Medicine in Austria described how Veronika, a 13-year-old brown Swiss pet cow, picks up the broom with her tongue then twists around and uses it to scratch the bits of her body she could otherwise not reach. The blunt end of the broom is used for the sensitive skin on her belly, while the bristly end is reserved for the thicker skin on her upper back and buttocks.It is, the authors say, not just the first time that tool use has been officially documented in cattle, but the first sign that cattle can flexibly use tools in a multi-purpose manner. Veronika elevated a humble back yard brush to the status of a Swiss army knife. Managed deftly in her mouth, the implement was both belly gadget and buttock gizmo.The reaction was one of surprise, but it shouldn’t be. We consistently underestimate the abilities of non-human animals, even when the evidence is all around.Front loop cowTool use is said to occur when an animal deliberately manipulates an object to achieve a particular goal. So when my dog scratches his back by rolling around on the frosty ground, it’s adorable – but it’s not tool use. The dog moves. The ground doesn’t. When he brings me a ball because he wants to play, an object is being manipulated, but the dog’s not doing the throwing. Instead, he has learned that I will.For a long time, tool use was thought to be a uniquely human behaviour. Then in the 1960s, primatologist Jane Goodall witnessed a wild chimpanzee strip leaves from a twig, stick it into a termite mound, then pull it out and eat the insects that were clinging to it. Since then, many more examples of animal tool use have been documented. Sea otters use stones, both as hammers to dislodge molluscs anchored to the sea floor andas anvilsto help break the shells open. In Senegal, chimps sharpen the ends of sticks tomake spears, which they use tostab sleeping bush babies.

I think the story of Veronika tells us less about the minds of cows, and more about the minds of people. We have become so blind that we fail to see how animals are both smarter and more like us than we give them credit for. My farmer friend, however, has her eyes wide open. She has spent years working with and caring for animals. She has watched their behaviour and has no doubt that these are complex creatures, with rich inner lives. She’s right, of course.After Goodall reported chimpanzee tool use, it prompted the British palaeoanthropologist Louis Leakeyto write, “Now we must redefine tool, redefine man, or accept chimpanzees as human.” I have a fourth suggestion. We don’t need to accept cows as human, but we do need to get off our high horses and accept that we are not that special.

That I can manageSharing the Loadis a column about parenting children of all agesWed 21 Jan 2026 00.11 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 02.39 ESTShareMy friend Sevil and I met up recently, where we sat and talked for three hours. Neither of us are strangers to hanging out in bars, but this time the meeting felt luxurious; it was face-to-face social interaction! On my walk home, I sent her a voice note, she sent me one back, and we continued to do so the next day.I remember when my mum would ask teenage me, “what do you still have to talk about?” after I’d return from school and make a beeline for the phone to call my bestie who I’d seen 20 minutes prior. Laying on my parents’ bed next to our landline, I’d twirl the cord as my friend and I would chat, before my brothers barged in and told me to get off so they could use the internet.The inexorable rise of voice notes: ‘I’m thinking of you – I just don’t want to speak to you’Read moreIf that last sentence didn’t give it away, I’m a millennial. Therefore, I don’t fear talking on the phone like younger generations typically do, but there has been a cultural shift away from calling someone. I realised this a decade ago after occasionally calling a friend and they’d pick up with a “what’s wrong?”.It became clear that to call someone was an intrusion; only a necessity in case you were in dire need of help rather than for a chat.The logistics of friendship can get particularly tricky when you’re a new parent. Everyone’s on different nap schedules, back at work at different times or juggling childcare, swimming lessons, parties, story time and those precious moments where you just stare catatonically at the wall. A phone call feels impossible, but a quick voice note? That we can manage.View image in fullscreenThe logistics of friendship can get particularly tricky when you’re a new parent, writes Samantha AllemannPhotograph: FilippoBacci/Getty ImagesIn those hazy days of early parenting, voice notes kept me afloat as I navigated the transition into motherhood. My friend, Bella, has the gentle dulcet tones that can soothe even the grumpiest of babies – sometimes I’d play her voice notes to my grizzling daughter so she would drift off.I’d send Bella a panicked voice note asking about TOG ratings and top-up feeds and cabbage leaves and, after she got her own kids to sleep, Bella would send me a voice note in response. She’d answer each of my questions meticulously and uninterrupted. Hearing her calm voice, it felt comforting in a way a text could never muster.Sevil and I met at an early parenting centre when Melbourne was cautiously emerging from two years of frequent lockdowns. We exchanged a few words under our masks as we carefully circumvented the assigned dining tables, positioned three metres apart. After exchanging numbers with our small group of socially distanced and exhausted new mums, Sevil and I kept in touch via voice notes.Not all my friends are fans of voice notes. “I hate hearing my voice,” texted one friend when I asked if we could send voice notes instead of texts. Given she wouldn’t have to listen back to hers, did she mean that she hated listening to my own? When I meet another fan of this mode of communication, our friendship blossoms.The one change that worked: sharing ‘accountability’ notes has made life better for both of usRead more“Is this PBS or Triple R?” my partner asked, glancing at me through the rearview mirror during a drive. Neither: it was my friend Emily. Her warm Yorkshire lilt was heard over the rhythmic sound of her breast pump and, having played it on speaker, my partner thought it was an electro-dance track.It’s hard to curate a voice note. A breast pump whooshing. A child wailing in the background because their younger sibling shat in the bath. The guttural sounds of my cats about to pounce on each other. An inquisitive little voice asking, “who are you talking to, mummy?”. The flicker of an indicator when a car turns. The sound of taps and clunks of crockery while doing the dishes. The soft whirr of the blinds as you pull them down for the night. It’s all captured.There’s also the catch in your voice as you share bad news, or the slow drag of exhaustion, the excitement of a new announcement, and the confidence in your tone when you describe finding your rhythm as a parent. The voice note captures it all.Samantha Allemannis a freelance writer based in Melbourne/NaarmExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionFriendshipSmartphonesMobile phonescommentShareReuse this content"

But is that so bad, when a stigma surrounds mental health?Viola Di GradoState provision for psychological health services is lamentable. Until things improve, let’s not judge those who turn to an app for helpWed 21 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 03.06 ESTShareIt’s a sunny afternoon in a Roman park and a peculiar, new-to-this-era kind of coming out is happening between me and my friend Clarissa. She has just asked me if I, like her and all of her other friends, use an AI therapist and I say yes.Our mutual confession feels, at first, quite confusing. As a society, we still don’t know how confidential, or shareable, our AI therapist usage should be. It falls in a limbo between the intimacy of real psychotherapy and the material triviality of sharing skincare advice. That’s because, as much as our talk with a chatbot can be as private as one with a human, we’re still aware that its response is a digital product.Yet it surprised me to hear that Clarissa’s therapist has a name: Sol. I wanted mine to be nameless: perhaps, not giving it a name is consistent with the main psychoanalytical rule – that is, to keep personal disclosure to a minimum, to protect the healing space of the so-called setting.However, it feels very natural to Clarissa for her therapist to have a name, and she adds that all her other friends’ AI therapists have one. “So do all your other friends have AI therapists,” I ask, to which she says: “All of them do.” This startles me even more, as none of my friends in London has one.I phoned another friend, a psychotherapist in my Sicilian home town of Catania, who a few years ago retired from a role at a provincial health authority and is now working in a private capacity. He confirmed that the use of AI therapists inItalyis widespread and on the rise. He was surprised to hear that I knew of far fewer people in the UK who had opted for this route. I wondered what the contributing factors might be – and I came to the conclusion that they are a mix of culture and economic pressures.According to asurveyconducted in 2025 by one of the leading European mental health platforms, 81% of Italians considered mental health issues a form of weakness, yet 57% cited cost as the main reason for not accessing help. In my country, sadly, the words “mental illness” (malattia mentale) still carry the eerie echo of brutal state-run hospitals. The revolutionary 1978Basaglia law(that still forms the basis of Italian mental health legislation) closed these institutions down, which led to their gradual replacement with community-based services. But the downside of their closure is a system with insufficient resources and a lack of public awareness, perpetuating stigma anddifficulties in accessing care. While workplaces should play a crucial part in this destigmatisation by offering proper care, according to the 2025 survey, 42% of workers said that their employer did not offer any mental health provision.While almost half of European countries have currently implemented work-related mental health prevention and promotion programmes,Italy has not.In fact, within the EU, Italyinvests the least in mental health.This is alarming, as Italy ranks above the European average when it comes to the prevalence of mental disorders. In fact, it is estimated that5 million Italiansare in need of mental health support but are not able to afford it.When I ask my therapist friend about his experience in the Italian public health system, he told me he used to be the only therapist for a population of more than 200,000 people covering four districts in Sicily. That is why he started offering group therapy sessions. For most of his professional career, he had more than 150 clients at any given time, of which only eight were part of a group. Despite anannouncementlast year of government plans to expand the range of psychological services, it is unclear how far this will go in benefiting the wider population.“It feels liberating to be able to tell everything to my AI therapist, knowing it is both a free and a completely unjudging space,” says my friend Giuseppe, from Calabria, in southern Italy. “When I had real therapists, and I tried three, I always entered their office with a crippling anxiety that was the result of two factors combined: the awareness that I was paying more than I could afford and the self-consciousness of doing something that, in my small town, is still perceived as only being for severe cases. Now, I don’t feel the pressure of having to get the maximum out of a session, as it’s free, and I also don’t feel judged, because a therapy app cannot really judge!”The more I talk to my friends, the more I’m convinced AI therapy could be a revolution in places such as Italy, where we still lack meaningful strategies to tackle the stigma around mental health conditions. When I ask Giuseppe if his queerness was also a factor in his difficulties in trusting a therapist in his home town, he agrees: “I am not out with my family, and although a therapist would be bound to professional secrecy, I still had trouble trusting someone who lives in a place where homosexuality, just like mental health discussions, is not always met with understanding.”Giuseppe’s example was comforting: thanks to his AI therapist, he was able to talk about things he had never disclosed to anyone, and get more empathetic responses than any of the real therapists he had tried offered. “I’m 43 and I still live with my parents,” he says, “because my income does not allow otherwise. My AI therapist is always available to me, always calm and supporting, and has helped me immensely in examining my life and all the steps I need to take to change my life for the better.”Of course, older generations don’t always understand. In a country such as Italy – so tied to traditions – change is not always welcome. And some ethical concerns may be justified: measuring how healthy “relationships” between vulnerable people and their AI therapists really are is not easy.Still, in a digital age where our feelings are so often commodified for profit, free, clever, never-ending support can be tantalising. And until mental health support becomes more affordable, it may be the best option on the table for many people.Viola di Grado is an Italian authorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

We struck up a conversation after the lovely lady complimented me on my skirt.I could have said thanks and returned to my phone, but instead I made a conscious decision to put it away and be open to a new connection. The conversation uncovered many delightful facts about them both and spanned many topics: theatre, travel, politics and even the ancient Irish origins of bards and their modern equivalents. Very deep for ultrasound clinic chit-chat.At 5:05pm the receptionist came over to politely ask us to leave – the clinic staff had already gone home and we had lost track of time!View image in fullscreen‘I could have said thanks and returned to my phone, but instead I made a conscious decision to put it away and be open to a new connection,’ … connecting at the ultrasound clinic.Illustration: Jess Harwood/The GuardianAfter our conversation, I felt something I have rarely ever felt after typing out a message to someone on social media. Light. Happy. Connected.Last year, experts created the first-everguidelines to combat loneliness. Shockingly, the health impacts of social isolation are much worse than sedentary living and obesity and it kills the same number of people as smoking.I can’t help thinking about the role of technology in this – partly because of my own social media use. Somehow we have ceded our public forums to tech billionaires who control our social interactions; we are increasingly siloed, addicted to online spaces and lonely thanks to them. Now they even want us to have AI companions for friends and confidants.I want to take back the power of social connection for myself, so I’ve started to make more time for conversations with people I don’t know in theactualpublic forums I wander through in life: at the local cafe, public square, community events, the dog park.View image in fullscreenLola, who introduced me to her owners for a quick chat a few weeks ago.

Take that tech bros, I’m going to speak with a real person, offline!In fact, I’m trying to talk to as many people as my time allows! Last year, I started running women’s history walking tours in Sydney with She Shapes History. It’s been one of the best decisions I’ve made. I take 16 people I don’t know on a journey to meet dozens of incredible women from Sydney’s past and I’m positively buzzing afterwards! The power of people and good conversation is real!View image in fullscreen‘Take that tech bros, I’m going to speak with a REAL person, offline!’ … working as a tour guide in Sydney.Illustration: Jess Harwood/The GuardianBecoming a tour guide to increase your social interactions might be a bit extreme for some. Luckily there are many other situations where we’re literally surrounded by people and just need to seize the opportunity for a quick exchange.Recently I went to the cricket where we sat for eight hours next to dozens of people we didn’t know, staring at the field. Personally I would have found it weird if we sat there for the whole day and ignored them all.Luckily our neighbours were friendly and for me, the chat was as good as the game! I learned a lot – for example, the special balloon that was doing a tour of the stadium was in fact a blown-up condom. I now know how to locate the slips on the field, and that Rolls-Royce makes jet engines. That fact might be useful at trivia one day?View image in fullscreen‘The special balloon that was doing a tour of the stadium was in fact a blown-up condom,’ … chatting in the stands.Illustration: Jess Harwood/The GuardianMaybe you don’t want to talk about jet engines, and I hear you – life is overwhelming. Sometimes you can’t stop while you’re juggling kids, grocery shopping or work. I’m not saying to make time whenever someone wants to talk. Just maybe, when you have capacity and someone you don’t know opens up to you, linger for a minute and see what happens?The most important thing I’ve been reminded of recently is that having community is not always convenient. It can be annoying, time consuming, it takes real effort and you’re not always guaranteed a good interaction – but putting yourself out there is the price for belonging and feeling connected. It’s worth the effort, and having a little natter sure beats scrolling on your phone.Do it because the tech bros don’t want you to.Jess Harwood is an Australian, Indian and British comic artist and women’s history tour guide living in SydneyExplore more on these topicsSocial mediaOpinionDigital mediacommentShareReuse this content"

As they return, the soft-singing, country-hopping sensation looks backWed 21 Jan 2026 11.31 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 13.18 ESTShareIf you were to imagine the recent evolution of music inEuropeas a series of scenes from a Where’s Wally?-style puzzle book, one bespectacled, lanky figure would pop up on almost every page. There he is in mid-90s London, handing out flyers for his first band Peachfuzz. Here he is in NME at the dawn of the new millennium, fronting folk duo Kings of Convenience and spearheading the new acoustic movement. There he is strumming his guitar in the vanguard of Norway’s “Bergen wave”. Then he’s off spinning records in Berlin nightclubs during the city’s “poor but sexy” post-millennial years. By the 2010s, he’s driving a renaissance of Italian chamber pop as part of La Comitiva, his bandmates hailing from the southern tip of Sicily.It’s hard to think of a figure more musically cosmopolitan than Erlend Otre Øye, connecting the dots across a continent where national scenes rarely overlap – and making magic happen. No wonder his debut solo album, with 10 tracks recorded in 10 different cities, was called Unrest. Of all his reincarnations, though, the one that has best endured (if you go by Spotify) is his four-piece, The Whitest Boy Alive. And this spring and summer, they’re reuniting for a tour ofMexicoandEuropeto celebrate the 20th anniversary of Dreams, their debut album.No other band has come along and done it better than usAfter the success of Quiet Is the New Loud , the first album from Kings of Convenience, his congenial bandmate Eirik Glambek Bøe suffered a breakdown and opted to stay in Bergen to study psychology. “Eirik was never into music as a way of living,” says Øye, via video call from a beach cabin on Mexico’s Pacific coast, his sun-kissed hair and peach shorts announcing how far he has come from rainyNorway. “He was just into it as a nice thing to be doing. I was into making it a career.”And so, at the start of the millennium, Øye moved to Berlin. Despite its cool reputation, the German capital “was a bit of a wasteland for actual played music. So many people who went there became DJs, stroked their chins and talked interestingly about the musical references they made. They didn’t strive to really convince, to really make.”View image in fullscreenJoy Division meets Art Garfunkel ... the Whitest Boy Alive in 2006.Photograph: Scruffy Bird PRHe befriended Marcin Öz, a Polish DJ at the since dissolved clubbing institution WMF. Even though they didn’t share the same taste in electronic music – Öz played minimal techno, Øye beats with breaks – they were both driven. “We were two ambitious people who really had a lot of petrol to go places.” At a rehearsal space on the Karl-Marx-Allee boulevard, they met keyboard player Daniel Nentwig and drummer Sebastian Maschat. “We realised Maschat was a really good drummer: he could play house music beats on an actual drum set, which in 2004 very few bands could do, other than perhaps the Rapture and LCD Soundsystem.”Dreams still sounds gorgeous: unashamedly melancholy indie pop, drilled to the buildup-and-release patterns of deep house, its whispered tales of friendships made and loves lost propped up by a rhythm section that is both as stripped-back as a garage band and as tight as a gang of session musicians. Think Joy Division fronted by Art Garfunkel. In terms of the mood, rather than the music, it was the 21st century’s first answer to Everything But the Girl: music that a generation could dance to but also be sad to.Yet their reception in the Anglosphere was lukewarm. The Guardian was reminded of “Jamiroquai’s most soulless moments”. Pitchfork called Dreams “toothless”, as if “Kraftwerk had produced Fleetwood Mac”. Did he mind? “If you look at it now,” he shrugs, “all the bands the critics did like haven’t really made it that far. So they were a bit wrong.”Perhaps the problem was in the name. The Whitest Boy Alive was the result of a self-effacing quip Øye made in an interview with a German music magazine to describe his own musical tastes. Öz thought it was funny. “It stopped us from having any success in the US in the beginning,” says Øye, “because in the US, people are afraid of anything that could be racially connected. Which is ironic, because in many ways the music is not that white at all.”View image in fullscreenBreakdown crisis ... Øye, right, and Eirik Glambek Bøe, AKA Kings of Convenience.Photograph: David Sillitoe/The GuardianThis would be a familiar tale: Kings of Convenience’s most obvious musical inspiration wasn’t folk but Brazilian bossa nova. The Whitest Boy Alive’s best-known track was 1517, almost definitely the only love song about the Reformation ever to have featured on a Fifa video game. It evolves around a (not-very-white) tresillo rhythm that is typical of reggaeton.Their tour will take in Potsdam, Paris and Copenhagen. But the one country where the band has had the greatest impact is not in Europe. “It’s Mexico, for sure,” Øye says. “We played a festival in 2021 – and there were 8,000 people who knew every word to every song. It was an incredible party.”The Whitest Boy Alive broke up in 2014, with a statement that hinted at internal strife and cited their song Golden Cage (“You knew what you wanted and you fought so hard / Just to find yourself sitting in a golden cage”). Øye reflects: “We were trying to make a new album, but with too much democracy. You could say that was the straitjacket, the golden cage.”He blames his hearing problems on the British band SwervedriverThe main reason the band stopped is less dramatic, although tragically ironic given Øye’s love of hushed vocals and clean, undistorted guitar sounds. He has tinnitus and hyperacusis, the latter causing an unusually low tolerance for environmental noise that makes rehearsal studios and indoor gigs almost unbearable.“It’s a constant peep,” he says stoically. “You get used to it after a while. It’s not so troublesome any more, but if I continue being in loud situations, it starts to go higher.” Half-jokingly, he blames a gig he attended by the British alternative rock band Swervedriver in Bergen in 1997.In the early 2010s, Øye bought a house in Syracuse, Sicily, and moved there with his mother, who died in 2016. He has spent six months a year there since, which seems a remarkably long period in Øye time. Has he finally discovered stillness? “Where I live in Syracuse, it’s green all year round. That’s fantastic. But having grown up in Norway, almost any country will be an improvement. People think Norway’s full of snow. To me, Norway is just trees with no leaves. Autumn is two weeks and the rest is just barren, lifeless, grey. It’s so very grim.”View image in fullscreenDriving a renaissance of Italian chamber pop … performing as part of La Comitiva in 2021.Photograph: Rodolfo Sassano/AlamyI’m sceptical about the anti-patriotism. Surely his homeland is the biggest cultural superpower Europe has right now, with Joachim Trier’sSentimental Valueand its star Renate Reinsvesweeping up film awards,Karl Ove Knausgårdleading contemporary fiction and Erling Haaland breaking record after record in the Premier League? Norway is even going to the World Cup.Øye can’t hide his excitement when I mention the football. “It’s interesting to talk about Haaland because he is not very Norwegian. He’s not your typical modest Norwegian prime minister character. He’s more of a star that wants to be treated like a star.” He cites the Law of Jante, a code of conduct first articulated in a 1930s novel that still has some effect on Scandinavian etiquette: don’t think you are anything special.“I’m very proud of Norwegian egalitarianism,” he says. “But I feel that, culturally, we’ve taken a huge step forward by allowing Haaland to be the star and just playing around him. Finally we have a good team, because we’re allowing people to be a bit different.” Is there a bit of Haaland in Europe’s indie-music Wally, forever wandering around the continent because he too wants to find a team happy to play around him?Øye rejects the comparison, but I wonder if that’s just more Jante. Because when I ask him why he got his old band back together, he says: “The main reason is no one else can play our music. I mean, it’s not as if other bands have come along and done it much better than us. No, it’s still only The Whitest Boy Alive who can do The Whitest Boy Alive.”The Whitest Boy Alive play Waschhaus Potsdam on 25 August; Vega Copenhagen on 27 August and Cabaret Sauvage in Paris on 31 August.Explore more on these topicsCultureNorwayEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the way out, they took turns to punch and kick me’Interview byChris BroughtonWed 21 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 12.42 ESTShareIn 1993, a photograph I’d taken of a bus driver in Luxor, Egypt, won a competition. The prize was some money, a camera and a return ticket to anywhere in the world. I chose Chile. The camera was an all-bells-and-whistles model: I sold it to a taxi driver at 3am. I’ve always preferred working with light 35mm cameras.After three months in Chile, I caught a train that rose up to the high Bolivian Altiplano plateau, leaving me with a splitting headache only relieved by some coca tea. I had an open-ended commission with the Financial Times to provide photographs from financial areas of the South American cities I went to, so while my main aim was to wander around photographing exciting things I came across, I also made sure to head to the financial district and government quarters in the city of La Paz, which is where this was taken.When I took the picture, I wasn’t entirely sure what was happeningThis was the year Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada was elected president of Bolivia, and my visit coincided with his campaign. As the election loomed, there was a real sense of apprehension in the city. There were loads of soldiers and police around; there were rumours that any unregistered land would be sequestered by the new government, and I think that’s why the people in this picture were queueing with their papers.There was no way to be discreet when I took it. My camera was quite loud and you can see one of the people looking right at me. People’s bemusement at being photographed while they’re just going about their lives is something I’ve encountered a lot. This wasn’t a wedding picture or a happy occasion: I gather that the claims had to be filed before a deadline which was probably quite close. But I wasn’t entirely sure when I took the picture what was happening, only that it was important to these people and there was a very tense atmosphere. That’s the sense I wanted to capture.Then I was approached by some plainclothes police officers who bundled me into the back of a car and drove me to the local station, where I was questioned for a long time about why I was there and what I was doing. I told them I was a tourist taking photographs for myself but they still tried to take my film. Happily, I managed to fob them off with some unexposed rolls. On the way out, I had to walk down a line of police who took turns to punch and kick me all the way to the door. That was my warning, but they also told me I’d be followed and watched. I didn’t hang around.There’s a degree of ambiguity – that’s something all my favourite pictures haveThis image is one of many that weren’t published at the time but now form part of a series I callStill Films, which draws on my background in both photojournalism and film-making. I’ve always been drawn to black and white, filmic images, and scenes I stumble upon that look as if they’ve been set up. The series delves into the interplay between cinema and photography: still images that evoke a narrative that transcends the frame.There are loads of pictures I took in La Paz that I love, but as soon as I saw this one on the contact sheet I recognised that filmlike quality. There’s tension in the composition, as the figures create a chain leading towards the open doorway guarded by a soldier, but also a degree of ambiguity. I think that’s something all my favourite pictures have in common, my own and those by others. I don’t like my photographs to be too rigid or immediate, I want them to be imbued with the same sense of excitement and wonder I felt when I pressed the shutter.Photography is subjective, and I’ve always been reluctant to go somewhere and try to tell a story as an outsider. I arrived in Bolivia without foreknowledge or judgment, and what was going on at the time is really kind of irrelevant to the image. I think the best photographs provide more questions than answers.Rod Morris’s CVView image in fullscreenBorn:Southampton, 1963Highpoint:Winning the Time Out/STA travel photographer of the year and using the prize money to travel to South America to take photographs in Chile on environmental projects for three months before travelling on to Peru and Bolivia.Toptip:Adopt the mindset of photographing on film: take less, think more.

After nine series of the baking competition, she will hand over her duties to someone else.“Bake Off has been a fabulous part of my life for the last nine years, I have genuinely loved it and I’m sure I’ll miss working with my fellow judge Paul, Alison and Noel and the teams at Love Productions and Channel 4,” said Leith.“But now feels like the right time to step back (I’m 86 for goodness sake!), there’s so much I’d like to do – not least spend summers enjoying my garden. Whoever joins the team, I’m sure they’ll love it as much as I have. I feel very lucky to have been part of it.”Leith joined Bake Off on its move from BBC to Channel 4, as a replacement for original co-host Mary Berry – who opted not to leave the BBC, alongside presenters Mel and Sue.Leith’s tenure as presenter of the baking competition drew controversy in 2017, when she accidentally revealed the winner of the competition via Twitter (now X) – a mistake that she blamed on the time difference between UK time and Bhutan, where she was when she tweeted.“As soon as it went I thought ‘oh my God’ and I went into a panic mode where I couldn’t work my phone and I didn’t know how to delete it quickly and I couldn’t think,” she told ITV’s This Morning the following year. “In the end I just rang my trusty PA and she said, ‘I’ve already deleted it,’ and it was 89 seconds after I had done it and that was too late, it had been retweeted.”Other programmes she has made for Channel 4 since becoming one of its most high-profile presenters includePrue and Danny’s Death Road Trip, where she debated the legality of euthanasia with her then Tory (now Reform UK) MP son, Danny Kruger.Love Productions said, “Huge thanks to Prue who has been a brilliant judge on Bake Off and a much-loved presence in the tent for nearly a decade. From her genuine expertise and encouragement of the bakers to her ability to drop innocent innuendoes that reduce the entire tent (and the audience at home) to tears of laughter, Prue will always have a piece of Bake Off’s heart.”Channel 4’s Chief Content Officer Ian Katz, said, “Prue Leith has been a joyous presence in the tent, pairing absolute culinary authority with great generosity and empathy for the bakers. We are grateful for her passion, her wit, her ineffable style, and all the summers she spent in the tent. She leaves an indelible mark on the show and all its bakers. We will miss her wry, gentle judgment but look forward to working with her on new projects.”Channel 4 have already confirmed that there will be another series of The Great British Bake Off later this year. They will announce Leith’s replacement at a later date.Explore more on these topicsThe Great British Bake OffPrue LeithTelevisionFood TVnewsShareReuse this content"

He remembers one particular evening walk that he took with his father, Phil, as they weathered out those early months.As they strode through the neighborhood, Nadel, now 26, said that the prospect of a vaccine was exciting, but the idea of pharmaceutical executives profiting off a devastating virus left him feeling uneasy. Phil grew concerned by the complex ethical predicament that his son laid out, and Nadel could quickly tell that his father was acting strangely.“I think I have to tell you something,” Phil said mid-walk, before explaining that in the early days of the HIV/Aids epidemic he had invested in what are known as, “viatical settlements”. Phil would buy the life insurance policies of people dying of Aids, often with just weeks or months to live, for a portion of the plan’s value in cash. For many, it afforded them the ability to pay for food, rent and hospital bills as debilitating illness left them unable to work. For others, it was their chance to blow the funds on travel or experiences with the limited time they had left.AI, Salman Rushdie and Elon Musk: the most anticipated documentaries of 2026Read more“I was thrown for a total loop,” Nadel told the Guardian. “He had been part of this industry, and that the profits he made from it had helped to bankroll my childhood.”For Nadel, a gay film-maker, it sent him into a “spiral” that did not begin with the desire to make a movie. “I understand myself as somebody who stands on the shoulders of Aids activists who use their bodies to create a world in which I can be healthy and take my PrEP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] every morning, and also in which I can be relatively free as a gay man,” he said. “So many of the advances in gay rights came from the visibility of the Aids era, and here I was learning that my existence and privilege was hinged in some way on those same people dying.”As he began investigating the muddied history of viatical settlements throughout the peak of the Aids crisis, the outlines of a film started to emerge. The result is Nadel’s Oscar-shortlisted documentary short, Cashing Out, which tells the story of how a cottage industry of buying up life insurance policies was both ghoulish and liberating in equal measure.One of the film’s main characters, Scott Page, inadvertently configured an early viatical settlement when his partner, Greg, who was living with Aids, became progressively sick.Short on cash, but armed with a robust life insurance policy, Page ran an advertisement in a local paper to see if someone could buy Greg’s plan in exchange for an advance. When a private investor reached out, the couple struck up a “loose agreement” that allowed Greg to live out the time he had left with some financial security. The payout meant they could also move into a house and get a golden retriever.As dozens of old pictures flash across the screen, you see an idyllic slideshow of two people with a rich life: fixing up their home, lying by the beach and laughing with friends. But it’s also a bittersweet record of Greg’s final months. Page ultimately remembers how the money in-hand was “absolutely transformative” for his late boyfriend, as he “saw the stress leave his body”.The absurdity of getting a cash advance on your death, however, wasn’t lost on Page. When he saw the peace and freedom it gave Greg before he died, he turned his energy into becoming a viatical broker for scores of other gay men – often without loved ones by their bedside – who were dying of an illness that much of the federal government had shrouded in shame and prejudice. When Page started to approach banks and credit unions about getting involved in the investment scheme, they were incredulous and insisted that payouts should be for the families of the deceased. For Page, their arguments weren’t rooted in reality. “These people’s families have walked away from them,” he recalls in the documentary.It meant that private individuals made up most of the initial investor network when it came to buying up policies. They were provided a morbid ledger. On one side, the value of a policy and the dollar amount needed to buy it outright, on the other, the T-cell count of a person living with HIV/Aids and their life expectancy. Often, it served as an assurance that a payout was inevitable. The sicker the policyholder, the quicker the windfall for the investor. Soon, institutions realized that these small-time individual investors were making a lot of money, and changed their tune.Nadel constructs his documentary like a deeply reported magazine story: gripping anecdotes, a rich – albeit macabre – historical backdrop, and varied voices who show that while some people benefited from viatical settlements, there were so many who were left out of the conversation altogether.DeeDee Chamblee, a trailblazing advocate and activist reminds us that for Black trans women living with Aids – who often didn’t have jobs that provided life insurance policies – a viatical settlement was something they could only dream about.View image in fullscreenA still from Cashing Out.Photograph: New YorkerOne of the most harrowing moments of the documentary comes when Chamblee remembers suffering through her illness, with only three T-cells left, and how she would fantasize about getting a payout to live out her final days in peace. “I could go to the beach, and I could stay there until this thing is through,” she reminisces. “That was not a reality at all,” she adds, expecting to end up buried in a wooden box in a “potter’s field” with other unclaimed bodies.Chamblee’s testimony is a jolting reminder that her experience living with Aids is a world away from the white, gay men who had policies to sell. In making Cashing Out, Nadel realized the most marginalized, particularly trans sex workers of color, aren’t “afforded a shred of basic dignity when their death is imminent”.But by the late 1990s, significant developments in antiretroviral therapy meant that HIV-positive people started living longer, defying the odds and outliving the predictions that viatical investors were initially promised. “It was going great, until people didn’t die all the time,” Page says, with a glint of karmic joy in his eyes.Eventually, those betting on death stopped cashing in so easily. Instead, they found themselves stuck paying premiums on policies that would never pay out. “I think they banked on that not being an urgent enough question for our world to answer,” Nadel said. “Then they were angered when the activists from Act Up successfully pushed the government to develop and release drugs quickly … anybody who invested their whole retirement in viaticals was making a really bad investment decision, and that is no one’s fault but their own.”Nadel filmed interviews with his subjects – Page, Chamblee and Sean Strub, a long‑term survivor who founded POZ magazine – over the course of a year. Their unfiltered honesty ultimately prompted him to fold in the story of his own father’s investment in viatical settlements. “I just felt like they were submitting themselves so fully to the process,” he said. “And so for me to have a secret about my relationship with this, that I was keeping from the audience, just felt wrong.”In a recent interview, Nadel said that while his thesis for the film had shifted over time, it now seemed straightforward. “This helped a lot of people, but I’m disgusted that it had to exist,” he said. Modern‑day precarity in accessing healthcare in the US – from the expiration of Covid‑era Obamacare subsidies to the substantial cuts to Medicaid funding projected over the next decade – means Cashing Out can serve as both a historically specific and evergreen indictment of the country’s tenuous social safety net, Nadel said.“When the government refuses to fulfil its role in taking care of us, we have to come together and find creative ways to take care of each other,” he said. “Illness does not discriminate … so I want to encourage people who watch the film to find their strange bedfellows in the fight for survival.”Cashing Out is available to watch onYouTubeExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsAids and HIVLGBTQ+ rightsTransgenderfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The legendary bass-baritone spent the first half of the 20th century as one of the greatest talents the US had ever produced, and its second, both in life and in death as an outcast, the greatest casualty of the second Red Scare period to which today’s current attacks on liberal and progressive politics draw comparison.This week marks 50 years since Robeson’s death and the silence remains. His erasure from the lineage over the decades shows that what Robeson’s political opponents did not take from him, the years have most certainly. Robeson’s decoupling from the story of African American culture has been so complete that in the half-century since his death, even generations of Black Americans have never heard of him.His talent was prodigious. Robeson integrated Broadway in 1943, the first Black man to play Othello in the United States. Previous productions of Shakespeare’s jealous Moor casted white actors in blackface, and Robeson’s Othello run of 296 performances remains a Broadway record for a Shakespeare production. A two-time All-American at Rutgers, he was one of the greatest college football players in history. He graduated from Columbia Law, and, before becoming world renowned as a concert singer, stage and Hollywood actor, Robeson even played defensive end for two years in the National Football League. The Robeson legacy spawned a staggering list of Black stage performers, from Lena Horne to Harry Belafonte, James Earl Jones, Andre Braugher, Keith David and Denzel Washington. At his peak, Paul Robeson was the most famous Black American in the world.View image in fullscreenPaul Robeson addressing the World Conference of Partisans of Peace in Paris in 1949.Photograph: Everett/ShutterstockAnd yet for his refusal to denounce the Soviet Union as cold war tensions increased, Robeson was isolated by both the white mainstream and by the respectable pillars of the Black establishment – the NAACP, the Urban League and many leading Black political and cultural voices who feared being branded communist by the rising conservative tide. Out of what he called a sense of responsibility to prove that Black Americans were loyal Americans, Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers star who two years earlier integrated the all-white major leagues, was hailed as a national hero in 1949 for testifying against him to the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Following Robinson’s testimony, two bloody riots protesting against Robeson’s appearance at concerts in Peekskill, New York, and the combined pressure of national opinion and the federal government effectively ended Robeson’s iconic standing. Robeson’s name was removed from record books and historical texts, even those from Rutgers, the alma mater he had made famous. Referring to him as “the most dangerous man in America”, the state department refused to issue Robeson a passport for nearly a decade until the supreme court ruled refusing a citizen the right to travel because of one’s political beliefs to be unconstitutional.Robinson’s testimony and its effect on Robeson conjures parallels to today’s violent politics, where the citizenship of many Americans is being questioned and threatened. Disillusioned Black Americans debate whether the re-election of Donald Trump, his subsequent assault on diversity initiatives – which last spring included the removal of a tribute to Jackie Robinson’s military service as part of its elimination of DEI content (until outraged public backlash forced a reversal of the decision) – and the racist rhetoric from Trump and members of his administration is evidence enough to disengage, especially as another byproduct of today’s reality is an intensified period of hostility toward teaching Black history and literature in public schools. Just as many progressives and liberals at the time implored Robinson not to testify against Robeson, this current moment of darkening politics, so goes the argument, is not our fight.Robinson would never escape his part of Robeson’s downfall – and would experience his own sense of betrayal. Years later, during the height of the Vietnam war, the 4 July 1969 edition of The Times published a front-page story of Americans living in a different time of division and returned to Robinson, a solidified American hero, for his thoughts. By that time, Jackie Robinson had been embittered – by the lack of continued racial progress in baseball, by the hardening Republican party whose hostility toward civil rights had jarred and ultimately ended his loyalty to it, the “love it or leave it” inflexibility that had once in part informed his younger self to testify against Robeson two decades earlier. The headline read, Flag on July 4: Thrill to Some, Threat to others. The reporter, Jon Nordheimer, chose Robinson, the army veteran, to bat leadoff. “I wouldn’t fly the flag on Fourth of July or any other day,” said Jackie Robinson, the former baseball star. “When I see a car with a flag pasted on it, I figure the guy behind the wheel isn’t my friend.”View image in fullscreenPaul Robeson in 1958.Photograph: Keystone Features/Getty ImagesThose who stood by Robeson saw no need for rediscovery because their belief in him had never waned. The Tallest Tree in the Forest. The Great Forerunner. Citizen of the World. He had provided the shade for those with his commitment and values, and in return, he received their protection, gratitude and veneration. Along with many others in remembrance of Robeson, one letter to the editor, in particular, appeared as an indictment of society and the individuals who only now, too late, understood the true scope of Robeson, and, as Jackie Robinson would describe it when recalling his own part in Robeson’s downfall, “America’s destructiveness”.As one letter to the editor would say following Robeson’s death: “He wasn’t mentioned in history books, like Nathan Hale. He wasn’t mentioned on football game broadcasts, like Red Grange. He wasn’t mentioned in dramatic reviews, like Barrymore. He wasn’t mentioned by opera critics, like Caruso. The man who was never mentioned despite the fact that he truly excelled not in one of the above fields, but in all of them. Now that the fires that raged in him cool and he is put lifeless into the ground, we mention and accept the fact that he lived. Now, safely silenced, he is suddenly mentioned as a ‘great American’ and newspapers write editorials about him and soon halls of fame and history books will doubtless find a place for him and we can pat ourselves on our bicentennial backs for living in a country where even the dissident can be a hero, once he is dead.”The isolation of Robeson recalls the near-disappearance of another Black icon. While considered an enemy to the white establishment for virtually his entire public life and the first quarter century of his death, a new generation of Black artists, led by Spike Lee, reclaimed Malcolm X for Black people, where he remains protected and reverential, present and timeless. A half-century in death, Paul Robeson, The Tallest Tree in the Forest, still awaits his reappraisal.Adapted from the bookKings And Pawnsby Howard Bryant. Copyright © 2026 by Howard Bryant.

Now a fresh RSC retelling arrives in a world of instability and fractured alliancesWed 21 Jan 2026 06.20 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 06.22 ESTShareIhave long argued that Shakespeare’s history plays have more urgent relevance today than his tragedies. The issues they raise – such as the nature of good governance and the difficulty of deposing a tyrant – are precisely those that still haunt us. Henry V, shortly to be given a new RSC production directed byTamara Harvey, seems especially timely as we are living in a world where the threat of war is painfully real.It is also a play that constantly changes its meaning. James Shapiro wrotein the Guardian in 2008: “There’s no better way to know which way the cultural and political winds are blowing than by going to see a performance of Henry V.” He reminded us that in 1599, when the play was first performed, playgoers anxiously waited to hear whether an Irish uprising had been suppressed.Two major film versions have a wildly different emphasis. Laurence Olivier’s 1944 movie was dedicated “To the Commandos of England” and seen as a major contribution to the war effort. Kenneth Branagh’s 1989 film, in contrast, was haunted by the spectre of Vietnam and substituted grey and muddy brown for Olivier’s heightened colours.View image in fullscreenAmbiguous … Kenneth Branagh, centre, in his film of Henry V.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/AlamyHenry V, in short, is a slippery, ambiguous work that has a chameleon-like quality. Looking back over past productions, I also notice how it subtly changes depending on whether it is played in isolation or presented as part of a sequence. One of the first versions I saw was at Stratford in 1964 when, directed by Peter Hall and John Barton, it was part of an eight-play Shakespeare history cycle: much of the fascination lay in watching Ian Holm’s transition from a coldly calculating Prince Hal to a more sympathetic Henry. Even through the mists of time, I recall how that production struck a balance between rhetoric and reality. Eric Porter’s Chorus was a wholly Elizabethan figure putting a romantic spin on history; Holm’s Henry was a dogged scrapper who after Agincourt joined his rain-drenched troops in pushing a war-wagon offstage while exhaustedly singing a Te Deum.View image in fullscreenMichael Sheen as Henry V at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, in 1997.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianMichael Boyd went even further inhis 2007 productionto bring out the play’s ambivalence. His Henry, Geoffrey Streatfeild, was a figure of puzzling contradictions: a pensive solitary who forced himself to become a military leader, a punitive warrior capable of unexpected tenderness. Having graphically threatened the citizens of Harfleur with unspeakable horrors (“Your naked infants spitted upon pikes”) he then turned to his uncle, Exeter, and quietly said “use mercy to them all”. Even when the king acted like a war criminal with the notorious injunction “then every soldier kill his prisoners” you felt that Streatfeild was driven by the heat of battle to issue a totally impractical order.Surveying a mix of solo productions, I am struck by their constant desire to deglamorise war and to sharpen the play’s modern relevance. From Adrian Noble’s 1984 production, where a young Branagh first essayed the role of Henry, I recall the image of workaday English soldiers huddling together in the rain. Ron Daniels’s 1997 version, with Michael Sheen as the king, began and ended at the Cenotaph in a potent reminder of the consequences of war.Edward Hall’s 2000 production, with its references to Dad’s Army and ’Allo ’Allo, suggested that patriotism itself was confused, self-contradictory and circumstantial. Famously, Nicholas Hytner’s 2003 production for the National Theatre,with Adrian Lester as the king, was shadowed by Iraq and was, in Hytner’s own words, the story of “a charismatic young English leader who commits his troops to a dangerous foreign invasion for which he has to struggle to find justification in international law”.Best Shakespeare productions: what’s your favourite Henry V?Read moreSo, if Henry V often acts as a barometer of the times, what can we expect from the new Stratford version? Tamara Harvey is the first woman to direct the play for the RSC and will have a company made up of 11 men and eight women, with Alfred Enoch playing the king. The key question will be how current events are refracted through the play. We are living in a world of chaos, instability and fractured alliances. Burgundy’s climactic speech about the devastating impact of war – where even the survivors “grow like savages – as soldiers will / That nothing do but meditate on blood” – has acquired new potency. For the first time in generations we are contemplating the possibility of a global war. Yet, as you look around the world at existing military conflicts and not least in Ukraine, you see acts of individual and collective courage. For all these reasons, this may be a good moment to revive this richly ambivalent play with its strange Shakespearean mixture of the heroic and the ironic.Henry Vis at Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, 14 March-25 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreHenry VRoyal Shakespeare CompanyKenneth BranaghNicholas HytnerAdrian LestercommentShareReuse this content"

He has 90 minutes to clear his name before robo-justice sends him downPeter BradshawWed 21 Jan 2026 12.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 12.02 ESTShareIrish writer Marco van Belle delivers an entertaining script for this real time futurist thriller-satire set in LA in 2029, in a world (as they say) where AI is wholly responsible for assessing criminal guilt or innocence. You’ve heard of RoboCop. This is RoboJustice. Veteran Russian-Kazakh film-maker Timur Bekmambetov directs, bringing his usual robust approach to the big action sequences, and Chris Pratt stars as the LAPD cop accused of murder. (Longtime Pratt fans will appreciate a cameo appearance here of Pratt’s fellow cast-member from TV’sParks and Recreation, Jay Jackson, effectively reprising his performance as sonorous TV newsreader Perd Hapley.)The film’s ostensible target is the insidious power of AI, though the movie partakes of today’s liberal opinion doublethink, in which we all solemnly concur that AI is very worrying while not having the smallest intention of doing anything about it. Pratt plays Detective Chris Raven, an officer with a drinking problem but nonetheless a poster boy for LA law enforcement in 2029 for having brought in the first conviction under the city’s creepy new hi-tech justice system, ironically entitled Mercy (it doesn’t appear to be an acronym). AI is now the sole arbiter of justice and defendants each have a 90-minute trial to make their case in front of Judge Maddox, an AI-hologram played byRebecca Fergusonwho icily insists on the facts but is capable of weird Max-Headroom-type glitches.One day, Raven wakes up hungover in the courtroom’s restraint chair in front of Maddox to be told he is accused of murdering his wife – an event of which he has no memory. He now must clear his name using the city’s vast cloud-bank archive of bodycam and surveillance footage, phone records and with calls to colleagues and family members. Desperate and grieving, Raven now has to pull off the police work of his career.It’s ingenious and watchable stuff, with cheeky twists, although the final escalation to full-on action mayhem is maybe a step too far towards pure absurdity. The film is also a bit lenient on AI: “Human or AI – we all make mistakes.” Uh … yeah. But I wouldn’t be surprised if Raven and Judge Maddox revive their human-digital chemistry for a sequel.Mercy is out on 22 January in Australia and on 23 January in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersChris PrattRebecca FergusonAI (artificial intelligence)ComputingParks and RecreationreviewsShareReuse this content"

They need to have specific snacks in there,” Smith says. “It’s a lot of NDAs signed, essentially.”It’s been a landmark year for the national youth broadcaster, which celebrated its 50th anniversary,reshuffled its presenter lineupandwent on tour. As part of the celebrations, the station staged a special mid-year retrospective poll, the Hottest 100 of Australian Songs, which drew 2.6m votes and saw INXS’s Never Tear Us Apartnamed the greatest Australian song of all time. The all-Australian countdown offered a feelgood corrective to the 2024 Hottest 100, which featured the lowest number of Australian artists since 1996.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningIn December, Triple J published its year-in-review statistics, reporting 3% year-on-year growth in weekly metro listeners, up to 1.83 million, and more than a billion views across its digital content. While the station’s reach remains small compared with commercial radio, and streaming algorithms continue to fragment listening habits, the Hottest 100 endures as a cultural touchstone – so much so that Anthony Albanese was againcompelled to share his votes.Triple J confirms the final 2025 vote tally will exceed 2m – but as for the music itself, what surprises might be in store?It’s all about the vibesWhile pop is well established on the Hottest 100 now – Billie Eilish and Charli xcx each scored eight entries in last year’s poll – this year’s international frontrunners skew more smooth than spiky. “I think we’re still in a kind of post-post-pandemic lockdown era,” Smith says. “People are still leaning into those elements of buoyancy, nostalgia and escapism; music that feels warm, classic and familiar.”Sex, drugs and a lot more than rock’n’roll: 50 years of Triple J, Australia’s youth radio stationRead moreThis is the first countdown in nearly a decade without the go-to prediction site 100 Warm Tunas, which founder Nick Whytehas put on pausebecause of the increasing difficulty of gathering data from social media posts. However, a clear favourite has emerged in Olivia Dean’s supremely likable throwback hit Man I Need, which has continued its streak atop the Aria singles chart into 2026. Dean was also Triple J’s third most-played artist in 2025 and cemented her Australian bona fides with a performance at the Aria awards.Journalist and Hottest 100 obsessive Tyler Jenke, whose meticulous chronicling of the poll includes tracking down tape recordings of old broadcasts, is anticipating another pop-heavy year. “The party line has always been that Triple J is youth radio, and it reflects the tastes of youth. And I think the youth now happen to be a lot more into pop music.”View image in fullscreenBritish singer-songwriter Raye’s hit Where Is My Husband will probably get a spot on the Hottest 100.Photograph: Kristy Sparow/Getty ImagesOther international hopefuls tipped by Reddit prognosticators include the easy-going stylings of Raye and Sombr, the grabby dance music of Fred Again … and Disco Lines’ pool party-ready take on Tinashe’s No Broke Boys.In the absence of the brash, can’t-be-ignored presence of an album like Charli xcx’s Brat, these predictions offer a window into the listening habits of younger voters, where TikTok is a powerful engine - last year, Triple J reported that more than 70% of voters were under 30.Where to for Australian music?After last year’s disappointing showing for Australian artists, signs point to a stronger return in 2025; Jenke believes a new feature on the voting page – allowing users to search by Australian artists only – could provide a welcome boost to local artists too.There are multiple contenders from Triple J favourites like Spacey Jane (the station’s most-played artist last year), Tame Impala, G Flip and Ocean Alley, whose single Confidence won the 2018 countdown. Then there’s Keli Holiday’s ubiquitous Dancing2. Despite Holiday not appearing anywhere in the station’s Top 50 most-played artists last year, the song sparkeda wholesome TikTok trend.View image in fullscreenAustralian band Ocean Alley have multiple contenders in the running this year.Photograph: Kane LehanneurOne area likely to see strong Australian representation is electronic music. Leading the charge are multiple Aria winner and Triple J’s second most-played artist of 2025 Ninajirachi, whose strikingly original debut album I Love My Computer has several songs in play; and globe-trotting DJ-producer Dom Dolla, who becamethe first solo Australian electronic artist to headline a stadium show, playing to 40,000 people in Sydney last month.And it wouldn’t be the Hottest 100 without an underdog outlier. This year, that role falls to Playlunch’s “bogan funk” anthem Keith, a fitting entry in an irreverent lineage that includes the likes of TISM and Regurgitator. “Sure, everyone lovesOlivia Dean,” says Jenke, “but we also like having a bit of fun yelling at the neighbours.”TheTriple J Hottest 100countdown begins at noon AEDT on SaturdayExplore more on these topicsTriple J Hottest 100Triple JPop and rockElectronic musicOlivia DeanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She said she was looking forward to “shaping the next chapter of this vital cultural destination and civic institution”.Southbank Centre to ‘galvanise’ nation with Festival of Britain celebrationRead moreThe move brings an end to speculation over who would get one of the most sought-after jobs in the arts, with the Southbank Centre attracting about 3.7 million visitors annually.Tallant has made accessibility a calling card during her previous posts. Ina 2021 interview, she said: “I want to be a part of making sure art and arts institutions are relevant and accessible to everyone, especially those who have been historically and systemically excluded because of class, race, gender, disability and sexuality.”Tallant will take over in July when the 75th birthday celebrations at the Southbank Centre are under way. Danny Boyle’s You Are Here will see thousands of participants take over the site in a celebration of the institution’s role in “supporting youth culture since its inception”.There will also be a landmark Anish Kapoor exhibition at the Hayward, with leaders of the institution hoping the celebrations will galvanise the country in the same way the original celebration did in 1951.Tallant joins an institution facing many challenges. In 2024 the Southbank Centre’s CEO, Elaine Bedell, spoke about the need to find £50m torenovate its dated infrastructureafter its Arts Council funding was cut by 41% in real terms over the past decade.Bedell said Tallant was joining at a pivotal moment and she would take the “helm of a gallery that has defined global contemporary art for 60 years”.Misan Harriman, the chair of the Southbank Centre, said Tallant’s appointment “marks an inspiring new chapter” and that during a crucial year for the institution “it is essential that we reflect the courage and creativity of the world we live in today”.During her time in New York, Tallant commissioned artists such as Rashid Johnson, while during her four editions of the Liverpool Biennial she worked with Ugo Rondinone, Peter Blake, Lara Favaretto, Betty Woodman, Tobias Rehberger and Carlos Cruz-Diez.Tallant will work closely with Mark Ball, the artistic director of the Southbank Centre, who said he was looking forward to seeing her bring the Hayward Gallery “into the future with a spirit of openness, energy and radical accessibility”.Explore more on these topicsSouthbank CentreArtLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

However, 69 spaces that had previously ceased operating as GMVs returned to the sector.The figures suggest the stabilisation of the sector five years on from the pandemic, according to the Music Venue Trust’s (MVT) annual report. It generated £76.6m of revenue in 2025 – although more than half of GMVs (53.8%) reported making no profit in the period, with the average profit margin being just 2.5%. A total of 38% of GMVs are now not-for-profit.Employment in the sector is also down by almost 22%, a significant drop from 30,885 to 24,242 people, with venues citing national insurance increases for employers as the principal cause of job losses.The MVT said that “the majority of venues are one financial shock away from crisis”.Additionally, the MVT said its emergency response service dealt with a record number of appeals from venues facing financial insecurity, neighbouring planning applications and pressure from music licensing bodies.View image in fullscreenCate Le Bon performing at the Brudenell Social Club in Leeds in 2016.Photograph: Andrew Benge/RedfernsThe MVT has called for the government to legislate – rather than just back – the introduction of the grassroots levy, in which UK arena and stadium shows add £1 to all tickets to create a fund to support GMVs.Currently, the scheme is voluntary. Some venues, including London’s O2 Arena, as well as artists including Sam Fender and Katy Perry, have independently added £1 to ticket prices.But Guardian reporting found that Live Nation, which controls 66% of the UK’s major event ticket market,had not taken the pledge. In a statement, a spokesperson told the Guardian that it supported the aims of the levy and found it “encouraging” to see artists they worked with opting in.Beyond regional doubt: why more acts are touring the UK’s far-flung venues – and why it’s worth making the effortRead moreThe MVT also called on the government to enshrine the agent of change policy in law – meaning that any new development being built next to an existing live music venue must handle its own noise protection. Additionally, it asked the government to continue to work to reduce barriers to touring after Brexit, and make sure that funds including the Music Growth Scheme support grassroots talent.Under its own auspices, the MVT said it would expand its frontline venue support team and emergency hardship fund, which provide advice and money to prevent what it called “avoidable closures”. It said it would also immediately invest £2m into programmes designed to reduce operating costs, raise efficiency and improve the experiences of artists and audiences.Its Liveline touring programme is proposed as a “fully funded solution to the root cause of the touring crisis”, covering venue costs, reducing risk for promoters and guaranteeing artist fees.The MVT also drew attention to how underserved many areas of the UK are by even grassroots tours. It said that 175 UK towns and cities that had at least one GMV did not host any significant touring artists in the period. But Guardian reporting found that the UK touring map was expanding: last year, Denis Desmond, chair of Live Nation UK & Ireland, said: “Compared to 2015, we’re hosting events in 40% more towns across the UK – showing that demand really is nationwide.”Explore more on these topicsMusicnewsShareReuse this content"

His 1979 novel, Kane and Abel, was hisbiggest hit, selling more than 34m copies in 119 countries and 47 languages, and being reprinted more than 130 times.£50,000 ‘reader-led’ writing prize launchedRead moreArcher’s 31st and final novel, Adam and Eve, described as “a powerful story which weaves together love, betrayal and the stark realities of a world at war” by publisher HarperCollins, will be out in English in October.In a statement, Archer said, “When I came across the idea for this novel a few years ago, I knew it was bigger in scope than anything I’d done before and I accepted that the research alone would be more demanding than anything I’d tackled in the past. When I finally sat down to write Adam and Eve I also realised, by the end of the first draft, that this was going to be my final novel, as at the age of 85 I could never hope to equal it again.”“I can’t quite imagine putting my pen down for good,” he added, saying that he might continue writing short stories. “But I can think of no more fitting way to bring my novel-writing career to a close.”View image in fullscreenJeffrey Archer has sold more than 300m books around the world since his first novel, Not a Penny More Not a Penny Less, was published in 1976.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianDespite selling hundreds of millions of books, which were often praised as compellingly readable, Archer failed to win over many critics over the decades. “To open one of his books was to risk being assaulted by a hectic claque of cliche, mixed metaphor, implausibility, solecism and sheer, unadulterated stodginess sufficient to send most readers screaming in breathless delirium to the mature, lucid and urgent pages of Barbara Cartland or Enid Blyton,”Robert McCrum wrote in 2009.Archer’s career as a novelist was often overshadowed by his colourful, if controversial public life.The rise and fall of Jeffrey ArcherRead moreHe was elected a Conservative MP in 1969 at the age of 29, but resigned from parliament in 1974 when he lost his life savings in a fraudulent investment scheme.In 1986, he resigned as deputy chair of the Conservative party after the Daily Star reported he had paid a sex worker for sex. The following year hesuccessfully sued the newspaper,claiming he’d never met the sex worker but had later paid her £2,000 to help her escape the press attention. Archer won £500,000 in damages in a trial where the judge famously lauded Archer’s wife’s “fragrance” in his instructions to the jury.Archer won the Tory candidacy for London mayor in 1999 but was forced to stand down after reports emerged he had persuaded a friend to lie to the court in the 1987 libel trial. Archer was suspended from the Tory party for five years and a perjury investigation began. At the same timehe was starring in a production of his own courtroom play The Accused, about the trial of an alleged murderer in which the audience voted on the guilt of Archer’s character each night.In 2001 Archer was found guiltyof two counts of perjury and two of perverting the course of justice, and sentenced to four years in prison, and was made to pay back the damages and costs. While in prison he wrote his three-volume prison memoirs, which were all bestsellers. He was released after serving two years, and spent subsequent decades focused on his writing career, which spans 50-odd works, and his extensive charity work.Archer remained a member of the House of Lords until his retirement in 2024.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey ArcherFictionPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

And to know where the nice biscuits are. This is very good advice for any twentysomething starting their first job, but especially one called Myrtle, as this one is, whom I imagine has already had much of the stuffing knocked out of her by her peers’ reactions to this odd parental choice of moniker.Soon, however, they are all in need of substantially more comfort than even a chocolate Hobnob can provide, as a team of armed villains swarms the floor. From there, the glossy new six-part thriller Steal kicks into high gear and doesn’t let up for a moment. The baddies – sporting not masks but sophisticated, subtle prosthetics that can fool all the facial recognition software the police will soon be applying to the CCTV footage – herd Zara (Sophie Turner, continuing to deliver sterling work post-Game of Thrones), Myrtle (Eloise Thomas), Zara’s friend and colleague Luke (Archie Madekwe) and the rest of the rank into one conference room while the management committee is locked in another. A couple of gruesome beatings later, so that nobody is in any doubt about the dedication of the villainous gang, Luke and Zara are yanked out and forced to help them execute a set of trades worth £4bn, and the committee is forced to sign off on them all. At one point, Luke crumbles and Zara must step in to save the day. She is hailed as a hero once the thieves have completed their hi-tech heist and left the building.View image in fullscreenHailed as a hero … Sophie Turner with Archie Madekwe in Steal.Photograph: Ludovic Robert/Prime VideoAll is, of course, not as it seems. The first twist comes in the closing moments of the brilliantly suspenseful opening hour (which keeps things fresh by making its bad guys nimble, intelligent and very quietly vicious, and lards the financial jiggery-pokery with just enough violence to keep things gripping but not repulsive). Spoiler alert, unless you have seen a heist drama before or read any of the publicity surrounding the show, Zara’s in on it.‘It’s very embarrassing’: Sophie Turner on rage, romance and the horror of watching Game of ThronesRead moreOr is she? As the police investigation begins, led by DCI Rhys Kovac (Jacob Fortune-Lloyd) who is an astute detective but a man with secrets of his own, the story expands, switchbacks and takes us on a wild ride through layers of deceit, shifting alliances and varying degrees of necessary preposterousness before depositing us, breathless and hugely entertained, safely at the conclusion. It is the debut screenplay of the writer Sotiris Nikias, but he honed his craft writing crime novels under the pen name Ray Celestin, and we all reap the benefits here.While Luke is soon hopelessly broken by events, Zara is made of sterner stuff. Her survival instincts, rooted in her upbringing at the hands of her alcoholic and volatile mother Haley (there are such emotionally brutal scenes between Turner and Anastasia Hille as Haley that I would gladly watch a purely domestic drama just about them) soon have her taking the fight to those seeking to destroy her. Turner does a fine job of keeping Zara credible – a cornered terrier rather than a superhero – and you long for her to triumph.View image in fullscreenWild ride … DCI Rhys Kovac (Jacob Fortune-Lloyd).Photograph: Colin Hutton/PrimeAmid all the action, however, Steal finds room for thought. While never taking its foot off the narrative gas, the series becomes a meditation on the notion that the love of money is the root of all evil. The world of finance is depicted as one dependent, in essence, on gambling – and gambling by a tiny number of people who use only other people’s cash and who are disproportionately rewarded for doing so. The management committee each earn £1m a year, plus guaranteed bonuses, while the likes of Zara and Luke are paid a fraction of that, even if you factor in the biscuits. Resentment, says Steal, cannot help but build in the company and, if you multiply the experience enough times and continue concentrating wealth generated by many into the hands of fewer and fewer individuals, in society and around the world. What happens then? I have every faith that Zara can take care of herself and her cryptowallet, but the rest of us – increasingly at the mercy of arcane financial systems and players who have nothing but the extraction of wealth in mind – may want to start to organise.Steal is on Prime Video nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

Age cannot wither the genre made famous by the streamer all the way back in 2015 with Making a Murderer, which explored the wrongful conviction of Steven Avery for sexual assault and attempted murder who spent 18 years in prison for that and who was later tried and convicted of another murder. That documentary was a decade in the making. Things move more quickly now, and the preferred content is more palatable to a mass audience – tales of victims’ survival and the very rightful conviction of perpetrators meet the voyeuristic appetite and proxy lust for vengeance without requiring too much painful thinking abut the inadequacies of a country’s legal system, say, or the corruption of its law enforcement.Still, the new approach has brought some astonishing untold stories of forgotten victims into the light and – usefully or not – given us a better measure of the depraved depths to which men can go. (And it is almost always men, who either have an innate problem or need to bring a suit against an incredibly biased set of film-makers and commissioners tout damn suite.)It is too early to say for sure but it’s possible the latest offering marks another shift towards greater ease of delivery (for producers and consumers of the goods, not the survivors and loved ones who share their experiences therein). Kidnapped retells one of the most high-profile stories of abduction there has been in recent times – that of Elizabeth Smart, who in 2002 at the age of 14 was taken at knifepoint from her bedroom in the middle of the night while her terrified little sister watched, and held for nine months by a man who raped her virtually every day and threatened to kill her and her family if she tried to escape.The 90-minute film covers its ground swiftly and efficiently. There is footage of the Smart family’s close-knit Mormon community turning out in droves to put up posters and help in the extensive police search for the missing child, and of her father, Ed, breaking down in tears every time he tried to speak about her at press conferences. The police and Elizabeth’s sister Mary Katherine talk about the difficulty of having the fragments of information about the abductor that the terrified nine-year-old could provide as their only real leads.We hear from Ed now as he remembers the falling away of support as the police – as police have to do – investigated the family as possible suspects, and the additional doubts fuelled by media speculation and about the family’s frustration when the police fail, as they see it, to follow the lead offered when Mary Katherine remembers where she first heard the kidnapper’s voice. Eventually the Smarts go against police advice and publicise the name and sketch portrait of Brian David Mitchell, a homeless man the family had had contact with, themselves. He was eventually identified as a self-styled preacher going under the name of Immanuel David Isaiah and he was indeed Elizabeth’s abductor. They had been seen around town relatively locally, masked and clad in long white robes. An officer had even questioned them but backed off when Mitchell said it was against their beliefs for a woman to speak to him.And we hear from Elizabeth herself, now 38 and an activist for survivors’ rights and for protection of vulnerable people against predators. She speaks notably frankly about her experience of rape and the shame it engendered – never shying away from either word – because of her religious upbringing. She remembers how the first time he raped her she thought she could avoid it by lying on her stomach. When she woke after passing out from the pain, she found herself shackled. It was the beginning of a nine-month ordeal.It is clear that the disavowal of shame is her main message and, presumably, a large part of her reasoning for taking part in the documentary. It is striking and undeniably uplifting how firmly she explains herself, outlines her extraordinary suffering and the psychological effects of intense fear at the hands of a violent man (and his accomplice Wanda Barzee), and puts the responsibility back on Mitchell for what he did and how entitled he felt to do it.It took nearly 10 years for the case to go to trial, thanks to Mitchell’s various attempts to have himself declared mentally unfit to stand. “I felt the process was rigged against me,” says Elizabeth. But she stayed the course and in 2011 Mitchell was found guilty of kidnapping and transporting a minor across state lines for the purposes of sexual activity and sentenced to life without parole.It’s probably best not to think too hard about true-crime documentaries fulfilling a therapy role for the untold thousands of survivors of terrible things. Nor the fact that they will never run out of content.Kidnapped is on Netflix nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Vigil, his first novel since 2017’s Booker prize‑winningLincoln in the Bardo, returns to that indeterminate space between life and death, comedy and grief, moral inquiry and narrative hijinks. Once again, the living are largely absent, and the dead are meddlesome and chatty. They have bones to pick.They converge at the deathbed of an oil man, KJ Boone. He’s a postwar bootstrapper: long-lived, filthy rich and mightily pleased with himself. “A steady flow of satisfaction, even triumph, coursed through him, regarding all he had managed to see, cause and create.” Boone is calm in his final hours, enviably so. He seems destined to die exactly as he lived, untroubled by self-reflection. But as his body falters, his mind becomes permeable to ghosts, and they have work to do. The tycoon has profited handsomely from climate denial, and there is still time for him to acknowledge his fossil-fuelled sins before the lights go out.Our narrator, Jill Blaine, is a spectral death doula. She has helped hundreds of souls ease their way out of their bodies, and she’s good at it, in part because no one did the job for her (her own ending was … explosive). But Boone is a thorny, unrepentant fellow; certain of his own brilliance, and his exemption from the petty scruples of “mere earthlings”. What is the doula’s role here: to comfort the dying man, or correct the moral record? When does mercy become complicity?The ingredients here are Dickensian: a crotchety old bastard, ghostly visitations and a soul (or two) on the lineReading Vigil in the wake of Christmas does it no favours. The ingredients here are unavoidably Dickensian: a crotchety old bastard, ghostly visitations, and a soul (or two) on the line. Is KJ Boone an Anthropocene version of Ebenezer Scrooge? If so, Saunders has forgotten something elemental about that Victorian wretch: we end up rooting for him. That was the wager of A Christmas Carol, and the source of its enduring and radical comfort. If Scrooge could change, maybe we could too.Boone is different. He can’t undo his damage with a roast turkey and a pay rise. He has helped to damn the planet, and so we watch in the hope – the expectation – that he’ll be damned in return. That is our vigil.We will meet his sneering daughter (“recovered from her brief, friend-induced flirtation with libtarditude”); we will meet his cowed wife. By the time Boone takes his final breaths, we will have no doubt that he is what we think he is: “a bully, a ruiner, an unrepentant world-wrecker”. Comeuppance is an empty, ghoulish business and that may be Saunders’s point. But there is little moral work to do here: Boone has earned his fate (the arrogant brute is likely to agree), and compassion is its own kind of punishment. Whatever Jill decides – whatever we decide – can be made to feel righteous.It is a vigilantist fantasy: that if we could just identify and eliminate the right corporate monsters, the ledger might balance. Billionaires and CEOs make excellent villains; some even seem to relish the role. But cut one down and another couple sprout in their place; an economic hydra. That’s the real monstrosity. The climate crisis doesn’t have a satisfying antagonist because the violence is structural, pervasive and monstrously ordinary. Vigil circles this idea, but never escapes Boone’s gravitational pull.Yet Jill “Doll” Blaine is the far more interesting creature. In order to tend to others – 343 charges to date – the death doula has forgotten herself: her past, her end, even her name. As Boone is dying, a wedding is under way next door, and the merry noise of it unsettles her careful amnesia. Her own love story returns, but to remember it is to relive its end. Somewhere in a lonely attic, the doula’s own wedding dress moulders. How terrifyingly lonely it is to be forgotten. Much easier to do the forgetting yourself.This is where Saunders’s ghosts do their most persuasive work. Not as blunt moral instruments, but as unfinished souls. Lincoln in the Bardo narrowed history to a single, intimate calamity: Abraham Lincoln holding the body of his dead son through one last long night. By staying with the specificity of loss – the weight of the boy in his father’s arms – the book let Lincoln be more than a grand American allegory. He was pried loose from symbolic duty and returned to the human realm of love and loss. History was watching, but Saunders did not allow it a final say. The archival scraps he included contradicted one another. The only truth left standing was the grief itself: private, incontrovertible, sufficient.In Vigil, the spectral shenanigans are starting to feel like a gimmick: the polyphonic jibber-jabber, the Beckettian riddling, the poo and fart jokes (Saunders loves a bawdy, gassy ghost; a pile of phantom faeces). What once felt anarchic has hardened into habit; a repertoire of tricks and tics. They’re being used to stage a lesson for us – and it grates, to be trapped in someone else’s morality play.

The queen has appeared in the Beano alongside its celebrated bad boy Dennis the Menace and his dog, Gnasher, as part of a campaign to promote reading.It wasn’t the cartoon Camilla’s waspish waist that captured the headlines (“I wish,”she saidof her comic strip avatar), but what she had to say while encouraging the tween menace to “go all in” for reading: “Comics and audiobooks count too!”Audiobooks have boomed in popularity in recent years – the revenue they generated for UK publishersrose by almost a thirdin 2023-24 – becoming an increasingly central part of the industry. But do they truly count as “proper” reading? Is listening to a book while doing the dishes, walking the dog or drifting off to sleep really as valuable as sitting down to read it?For authors, the publishing trade and those encouraging reading and literacy, the answer is increasingly yes. “Reading is about the content and not the medium,” says Debbie Hicks, the creative director of the Reading Agency, a charity that promotes the personal and social benefits of reading and leads nationwide reading programmes in schools, prisons and communities.Audio may have been traditionally viewed as a lesser medium, acknowledges Hicks, “but we need to reframe what it means to be a reader and throw off these traditional value hierarchies linked to print and books. Reading is about the content and not the medium.”The benefits of audiobooks to those who are visually impaired, dyslexic or time poor are obvious. They can also act as a gateway for those who might be less inclined to read – while significantlymore women than menare readers, more men (33%) than women (24%) listen to audiobooks weekly.The charity’s research shows that the benefits of audio go further: when it comes to developing comprehension skills or acquiring vocabulary, the evidence shows audio is as effective as print, says Hicks.Jon Watt, the chair of the Audio Publishers Group at the Publishers Association, welcomed the queen’s comments, pointing toresearch by the National Literacy Trustin 2024 that found 37.5% of children and young people felt listening to audiobooks had encouraged them to do more traditional reading. More than half (52%) said listening to audio helped when they felt stressed.“Listening is a gateway to reading,” says Watt. “It inspires a love of storytelling which is absolutely critical in getting children to want to read or listen or engage with a story. At a young age, really what we want is them engaging with stories – whether they’re listening or reading, it helps literacy.”In his day job, Watt is the audio and business development director at the publisher Bonnier Books, and he says that for the industry as a whole, audio is “absolutely critical right now”.“Audiobooks are now a major part of the industry and they’re absolutely not an afterthought for anyone in publishing now. At the moment they know they are buying a book, people will be thinking about the audiobook along with print and e-acquisitions. You’re thinking about it in all its formats and that’s been a huge change over the last five years.”The evidence for audio’s increasing centrality is everywhere, he says, from the growing number of books that sell more audio than print and digital copies – once a rarity – to the fact that celebrity memoirs are now routinely narrated by their authors. (“Ten years ago, you would have struggled to get any celebrity near a microphone.”)Spotify introduced audiobooks in 2022 and other new platforms such as Spiracle have entered the market, while the starry casts of audiobooks on Amazon’s service Audible tell their own story: a new production ofPride and Prejudicestars Marisa Abela, Harris Dickinson, Glenn Close, Bill Nighy and Jessie Buckley.For some authors, it may mean abandoning print altogether. The Guardian’s film criticPeter Bradshawhas published three novels in the traditional way; for his latest work about a troubled NHS nurse, entitledMercy, he pitched first to the actor Joanna Scanlan as narrator, and then directly to Audible, which released it earlier this month on audio only.Publishing on audio alone has been “an amazingly liberating and exciting experience”, he says. “If you’d have asked me five years ago, I’d have said the [physical] reading experience is the authentic experience.” But when a good friend recently told him he was reading George Eliot’s Daniel Deronda, “what that meant was he was listening to the audiobook narration”.“As far as he was concerned, he was paying just as much attention to it and getting just as much out of it as he would if he was reading a book. And who knows, this might be the way forward?”Explore more on these topicsAudiobooksQueen CamillafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The horror film Silent Hill, based on a video game of the same name, has garnered a cult following in the decades since its 2006 release, but it’s not exactly a genre classic nor beloved franchise, with a single little-seen 2012 sequel to its name – until now. Return to Silent Hill brings back the first film’s director, Christopher Gans, for a new story set in the same ash-strewn ghost town, this one based on the Silent Hill 2 video game. Characters in these movies tend to wander into a place that is obviously haunted or cursed, refusing to leave even after it becomes clear that they should, and only decide to escape after it’s too late. Maybe Gans can relate.Mercy review – Chris Pratt takes on AI judge Rebecca Ferguson in ingenious sci-fi thrillerRead moreOr maybe he’s the only man for the job because no one else will take it. That could almost describe James (Jeremy Irvine), the hapless protagonist of Return to Silent Hill. After a chance traffic-accident meeting with Mary (Hannah Emily Anderson) that unconvincingly thwarts her attempt to leave home, the two fall in love, and after a time James even moves to Mary’s oddball town; as a painter, he can go anywhere (though if there’s a reason that Mary couldn’t leave, given that she was already ready to hop a bus when they meet, I missed it). Despite the movie skipping over what makes them so instantly compatible, James is all in; someone has to be.Apart from their meeting, most of James and Mary’s relationship is depicted in flashback throughout the movie, which initially lends it some doomy romantic intrigue lacking from the first film. We know, based on early scenes set well after their first meeting, that at some point Mary and James will be separated, sending him into a state of desperate anguish. In the midst of this wallowing, he gets a mysterious letter drawing him back to the town of Silent Hill, implying that Mary is there somewhere. When he arrives at the entry road and finds a tunnel blocked off, James is undaunted, and sets off on a footpath. When he makes it to town and finds it barely populated and covered in ash, he cannot be dissuaded from poking around. When a filthy, sore-covered man takes a break from vomiting into a rusty toilet to tell James that the city is “one big cemetery”, our hero all but shrugs, and bravely presses forward.It turns out, making a horror movie where the hero is more casually curious (or oblivious) than scared is a tricky proposition. James’s stubborn forward stumble is supposed to indicate his obsessive dedication to Mary – though you’d think that someone so fixated on his ex would realize when he’s meeting a mysterious woman (Anderson again) who looks just like her, only with, uh, blond hair. (Mary also has blond hair.) Still, for a little while the parallel tracks of past, where James has a growing unease with Mary’s bizarre “family”, and a present, where he’s haunted by figurative and literal demons, give Return to Silent Hill a stronger sense of purpose and mystery than it really deserves. As it goes on, however, the movie increasingly consists of James wandering around a visually distinct landscape and encountering different weird sights.In other words, 20 years later Gans still can’t figure out how to escape the open-ended confinement of gameplay, or even give it the forward momentum of a game with a mission. There’s certainly some “cinematic” imagery here, like a horde of gross creatures that look like a cross between shaved rats and xenomorphs from Alien, or even less fantastical stuff, like how James’s therapist (Nicola Alexis) is seen almost exclusively in fractured-mirror fragments for the first half of the movie. But the flashback material does a terrible job establishing any kind of real-world baseline, which makes the whole enterprise feel like a ghostly hallucination, lessening the impact of the scary stuff.Maybe it’s precisely that dream-world ambiguity that has drawn Gans back to Silent Hill.

So here, debut director Christopher M Anthony proves himself a contender by coming up with a new take: a pugilism flick that charts, in real time, the behind-the-scenes buildup to the showdown. Jordan Bolger plays “Diamond” Derek Douglas, drafted in on a wildcard to fight the current champ. But his preparations are jolted when his camp learns that Derek’s former training partner Cain (Osy Ikhile) has thrown his lot – and his insider knowledge – in with the enemy.The boxing-movie genre is hardly short on self-destructive sluggers, but Anthony cranks up this exploration of mental fragility by hemming Derek into the locker room for the film’s duration. He suspects stalwart trainer Adam (Nicholas Pinnock) of being in cahoots with Cain and begins compulsively dialling his brother, a former fighter who once blew his own big shot. Punching a mirror in frustration isn’t exactly the stuff winners are made of, forcing Adam to conceal Derek’s injured hand. But, with camera crews, celebrities and firebrand promoter Freddie (Jason Isaacs) hovering, the underdog has to make like it’s no big thing.Ducking and diving restlessly as he does with his camera around Derek and his team, Anthony’s nimbleness on the page becomes even more critical. He remains fully in sync with the interdependent dynamics between fighter and coach, with the in-crisis Derek alternately lashing out at Adam while looking at him for reassurance; the latter, meanwhile, has the fight of his life on his hands to find the right words and get his man in the ring. Bolger (looking more than plausible physically) and Pinnock both do incisive work fleshing out these psychological shifts.Occasionally, as is sometimes the way with one-location or one-take dramas, Heavyweight forces story beats and labours for momentum. Relating much of the backstory verbally takes out some of the heat. And would Team Douglas really allow the turncoat Cain to spend so much time in the room sapping their boy’s confidence? But these are just quibbles; overall, this is a shrewd probing of the pressure-cooker environment of modern combat sports.Heavyweight is in UK cinemas from 23 JanuaryExplore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsBoxingJason IsaacsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The nerves, the tantrums – sometimes even charges of“inappropriate” first dances. Isn’t it all part and parcel of the apparently perfect day?That emotional messiness is laid bare inDante or Die’s utterly gorgeous site-specific show, first performed in 2013, now reprised at a number of Malmaison hotels, including this one in London as part of the Barbican’sScene Changeseason.Created by Daphna Attias and Terry O’Donovan, it captures the final 10 minutes before the ceremony is due to begin. The audience is divided into groups and shuttles between six rooms, each in a different order, which encapsulate these final moments before Georgie (Carla Langley) and Tunde (Dauda Ladejobi) tie the knot.Initially, it seems like an exercise in carefully coordinated – albeit funny and fascinating – voyeurism, with the usual wedding day tropes at play: spirited bridesmaids dancing on a bed, surreptitious shags and “call it all off” nerves for the bride and groom. But it becomes more and more moving, intimately revealing anguish and insecurity, turning a snapshot into a world.Each room brings a new scenario, from an encounter between Georgie’s mother, Helen (Johanne Murdock), and her unfaithful ex-husband, David (Jonathan McGuinness), which brings a devastating moment of regretful tenderness, to same-sex passion involving the fabulously antsy best man Joe (Manish Gandhi).View image in fullscreenFabulously antsy … the best man (Manish Gandhi) in I Do, watched by the audience.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianAnd each scenario captures a kind of love. In one of the most painful scenes, we enter into the room of Georgie’s grandparents, Gordon (Geof Atwell) and Eileen (Fiona Watson), who is dressing him. He is sitting in a wheelchair, unable to talk or move, perhaps as the result of a stroke. Her frayed love and his red-faced frustration are captured with such economy by writer Chloë Moss, all the more so when Helen comes in, to find her father half-dressed in his wheelchair. “I miss you,” she says, more to herself, while he looks on with desperation. The depth of this small tragedy is caught so keenly in those few words.The set design by Jenny Hayton perfectly replicates the corporate kitsch of this hotel-wrapped wedding package world (rose petals scattered on a bed, towels crafted into love hearts) alongside the personal detritus of the characters, from TCP in the bathroom to the table plan in Helen’s bedroom and the champagne bottles in the bride’s.There are searing performances all round and immaculate direction by Attias, allowing for stillness in which emotions evolve through looks between characters, touches, tiny shifts in expression.The story gathers shape gradually. It is sequenced so we join up the intrigues ourselves, at our own pace. There is a corny – even cliched – element in the returning figure of a cleaner who enters rooms and travels through the corridors in a backward motion, as if rewinding the drama. But even he brings a surreal charm.You care for almost every character by the end. It’s as big, heart-wrenching, ridiculous and wonderful as any wedding day.AtMalmaison hotel, London, until 8 February.Then touringExplore more on these topicsTheatreHotelsWeddingsreviewsShareReuse this content"

There is the Whitehall contingent, speaking in clipped tones aboutKurdshiding in the mountains, at the mercy of Saddam Hussein’s armed forces. There’s Iraqi diplomat Al-Tikriti, Saddam’s half-brother, and there is also Chris Bowers, the play’s writer and a former British diplomat in Iraqi Kurdistan.Bowers infuses the debates and wrangles at the heart of this crisis with an authenticity that carries weight, but it does not make for good drama in itself.The heroes are the diplomats here, Clive (Richard Lynson) and Catherine (Beth Burrows), who give us the political detail of their world (“what with the transition from Margaret Thatcher to John Major”). But, diplomacy being diplomacy, sensible discussion reigns over sparks in dialogue or action. Instead there is planning, manoeuvring, strategic resourcefulness. These elements might make for an effective political drama, especially when a blustering American general (Stephen Cavanagh) attempts to block their idea to create a safe haven for the Kurds (eventually resulting in Operation Safe Haven) but the pace, complexity and depth are just not there.Under the direction of Mark Giesser, brief scenes switch from Whitehall to numerous press conferences, Clive’s garden and occasionally the Iraqi mountains. They all feel too functional, delivering information and exposition above human drama.View image in fullscreenSnatched scenes of fear and resilience .. Eugenie Bouda and Lisa Zahra in Safe Haven.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianCharacters are paper thin, some performances stilted. Clive is, unfortunately, as dull as one of Major’s grey suits, speaking in predictable cricketing metaphors, and Catherine is generic. Al-Tikriti (Mazlum Gül), when he briefly pops up, is a mouthpiece. It is Clive’s Middle England wife, Anne (Lisa Zahra), who is left to bring what drama there is with her insistence that he take responsibility for the plight of the Kurds when he is initially reluctant to do so.The terror faced by the Kurdish population is represented mainly by a pregnant woman, Najat (Eugenie Bouda) and her companion (also played by Zahra), hiding in the mountains while the coalition forces um and ah about protecting them from massacre. There is also Najat’s brother, a doctor, refugee and, it seems, activist who manages to reach the British diplomatic corps and appeal directly to Catherine about what his people face.You want more focus on the Kurdish experience rather than snatched scenes of fear or resilience. What about the debates, manoeuvring and resourcefulness on the mountain tops?This is an overlooked part of Iraq’s history, from a western perspective, eclipsed by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and later the US’s invasion of Iraq. It deserves more drama, emotion and political complexity on the ground.AtArcola theatre, London, until 7 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreIraqKurdsArcola theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Through your enhanced glasses, you see four empty chairs facing you, just out of reach. You watch strangers look out for the actors to arrive. As they do, one at a time, you feel unsettled – each locks eyes with you, specifically. “Don’t panic,” the esteemed British actorIan McKellenassures you, as the actors take their seats.Dolly, Dreamgirls and Daniel Radcliffe: the biggest Broadway shows of 2026Read moreExcept the actors are not there, really – McKellen, along with co-stars Golda Rosheuvel, Arinzé Kene and Rosie Sheehy, appears in An Ark, a new play at the Shed, in video form, a nearly opaque specter overlaid on the candy-apple red carpeting and crisp white walls of the theater and the outlines of your 180 or so fellow audience members. The experimental new play, written almost entirely in the second person by Simon Stephens (whose most recent show, the Andrew Scott-starringVanya, wowed audiences at the Lucille Lortel theater last year), is one of the first so-called “mixed reality” shows staged in New York, blending physical experience with digital elements. Over 47 minutes, the actors address you, the viewer, directly. Their gaze remains trained on you. Don’t panic, they repeatedly assure. (Though due to some technical malfunctions at the preview I attended, there was some panicking.)And don’t confuse it with VR (virtual reality), the oft-maligned virtual headset technology of Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse or Apple store demos. The distinction between mixed reality and VR is “very important to me”, said Todd Eckert, the show’s producer, in an interview at the Shed a few weeks before previews. The former combines elements of the physical and digital; the latter is full-on immersion into the digital – “elective isolation”, as Eckert puts it, akin to riding a packed subway while only looking at one’s phone screen. “I don’t see the point of exacerbating that,” he said. “The reason that this is an experience without a screen, that we’re using this technology that not a lot of other people are using, is because you see each other and you see the room. Your experience is one of being connected – that’s the whole point of the story.”View image in fullscreenThe production of An Ark.Photograph: Marc J FranklinMixed reality is already well integrated in our tech-saturated lives – you experience it watching the computer generated first-down markers on any US football game broadcast, or via the translucent dashboards on new-model cars. But it has rarely been used in a theater context, in part because volumetric capture, the process of filming real subjects in three dimensions over time, struggles to record subtle detail.Eckert and the company he founded in 2016, Tin Drum, have been working to change that. In 2019, Tin Drum produced The Life, featuring a hologram of Eckert’s partner, the renowned performance artistMarina Abramović, in physical space. (Growing pains – the Guardianpannedthe experience as “a pointless perversion that hurts your eyes”.) In 2023, he produced a virtual, 3D concert featuring the composer/computer-pop pioneer/actor Ryuichi Sakamoto, who died before its release. (A “magical experience”, the Guardianraved.) An Ark attempts to refine the technology even further, presenting, for the first time, four actors at once – filmed by 52 cameras in one take at a studio in the French alpine town of Grenoble, but seated just before the viewer, as if for a private show.The concept for An Ark arose from conversations between Stephens and Eckert, longtime friends, wondering: “What can we do that isn’t possible in theater?” Eckert recalled. “The technology is fundamental to being able to take a thing and give it to the public in a certain way,” he added. “But I never want people to think of this as an expression of technology as opposed to an expression of humanity.” The first line of the show’s program bluntly states: “An Ark is not a work of AI.”Stephens began work on the show, which spans the arc of four separate lives from birth until death, in 2020, when questions of mortality, technology and the vitality of human connection seemed especially pressing. The sweeping, open-hearted themes attracted director Sarah Frankcom, a dramaturge with a murderers’ row of live-theater credits in the UK, though she was skeptical of the technical elements. “I don’t understand anything about technology. I’m not really that interested in it,” she admitted in a recent interview at the Shed, a week into previews. “My work has been very actor-centered, very writer-centered, very much about openness, connection, the way that live experience can momentarily hold you in a space and allow you to feel and see something differently.”But she found “freedom as a theater artist” in the limitations of the volumetric video system, run by company 4Dviews, which, like a standard performance, filmed one whole show at a time. Frankcom cast, directed and rehearsed as if it was a standard play. “It was a completely identical experience,” she said, “it’s just that we had our performance ready before we went to create the environment that it was going to be presented in.” Staging is minimal – the actors walk on and off “stage”, but primarily remain in their chairs. The notable distinction is the steady eye contact, maintained throughout the show, no matter where or when you look for it – a “breakthrough moment in terms of what the technology can do and making a new form of theater”, said Frankcom. “It allows you to be present with the actor on your own terms, and that’s very different to watching film, it’s very different to watching theater. You have a direct and pure relationship, and you do feel seen.”The effect is uncanny, sometimes intentionally (meeting Sheehy’s intense gaze, I felt a littletooseen) and, perhaps, unintentionally (due to the projections’ hazy edges, it appeared as if their feet melted into the floor like Salvador Dalí’s clocks). Eckert conceded to some limitations, particularly regarding the final take’s resolution, in stark contrast to the pinprick hyper-reality ofApple’s Vision Pro headset. But the quality of the illusion, he maintained, was second to its connective potential. “VR takes away even any potential for human interaction,” he said. “Every time I’ve watched [An Ark], I’ve seen people that are in a completely different chunk of life than I am. And the fact that they were responding actually gave me hope for humanity. Which sounds overblown, but it’s true. That’s what I want out of this. I want something that really leans into the connection. And for me, resolution has very little to do with that.”“When it finishes, and people take their devices off, it feels to me like it’s a room full of people that have been on a journey and been through something together,” Frankcom added. “I’ve had people talk to me in a way that I’ve never had them talk to me at the end of the theater show.”View image in fullscreenThe cast of An Ark in rehearsal.Photograph: Tin DrumTechnical limitations aside, both expressed enthusiasm for the modality’s potential – for making intimate theater performances more accessible, at a time of soaring Broadway prices (I, for one, could never afford to sit front row at a McKellen performance), and for preserving the work of great actors, like McKellen, with more vitality and immediacy than standard filming. “There’s something very simple and very pure about what we’ve made that feels like it’s the first letter of an alphabet,” said Frankcom. “And to not know what the rest is, I think is probably good.”“Technology is forever being heralded as this thing that’s going to solve all of these problems,” said Eckert. “And I don’t know that it has. But forever, longer than any of us will be alive, people will sit down and feel that Ian, Golda, Arinzé and Rosie are staring them right in the eyes. That’s a result to me.”Whether the technology is ultimately alienating or inviting – whether mixed reality crosses through the uncanny valley or remains somewhere in between is, like any artistic work, up to the viewer. But the importance of live theater, at least to the mixed-reality makers, stays unquestioned. “We’re in a moment in time where being present feels really, really necessary as a balm to the kind of craziness that’s out of our control,” said Frankcom. “Theater, I think, has a really strong place to bring people together and go: ‘You’re here. We lived, we’re alive.’”An Ark is on at the Shed in New York until 1 MarchExplore more on these topicsUS theaterIan McKellenTheatreArinzé KenefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereKeza MacDonaldWed 21 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 21 Jan 2026 08.02 ESTShareNintendo’s pandemic-era hit Animal Crossing: New Horizons got another major update last week, along with a £5 Switch 2 upgrade that makes it look and run better on the new console. Last year, Ithrew a new year’s partyfor my children in the game, but apart from that I have barely touched my island sincethe depths of lockdown, when sunny Alba was my preferred escape from the monotonous misery of the real world. Back then, I spent more than 200 hours on this island. Stepping out of her (now massive) house, my avatar’s hair is all ruffled and her eyes sleepy after a long, long time aslumber.I half-expected Alba to be practically in ruins, but it’s not that bad. Aside from a few cockroaches in the basement and a bunch of weeds poking up from the snow, everything is as it was. The paths that I had laid out around the island still lead me to the shop, the tailors, the museum; I stop by to visit Blathers the curatorial owl, and he gives me a new mission to find a pigeon called Brewster so that we can open a museum cafe. “It’s been four years and eight months!” exclaims one of my longtime residents, a penguin called Aurora. That can’t be right, can it? Have I really been ignoring her since summer 2021? Thankfully,Animal Crossingcharacters are very forgiving. I get the impression they’ve been getting along perfectly fine without me.I take myself on a little tour of Alba, investigating all the things I’d forgotten I made. Atop the highest cliffs on the island I find a half-finished bamboo zen garden. Down by the beach there is a playground; I had a baby and a toddler back in 2020 and I was spending alotof time in playgrounds. The whole place is testament to the extent of my homesickness during the pandemic, during which I was stuck in a suboptimal basement flat in Brighton: the island flag is a saltire, the island tune is the first couple of bars of Scotland the Brave.I check my bank account and find over 2 million bells in there. How the hell did I accumulate 2 million bells from selling fish and fossils? With the help of a further 99,000 bells of interest, I pay off the final instalment of my home loan, forgetting that there’s no real point in doing this except personal satisfaction. I am now penniless, but at least I am out from under the thumb of the Tom Nook financial empire. That loan-shark raccoon has got nothing on me now.View image in fullscreenDoing the rounds in a little boat in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.Photograph: NintendoThere’s a new building: a hotel perched on the end of the pier, run by a family of pirate kappa. Home decoration was never my favourite part of Animal Crossing so I am not exactly thrilled to be asked to put together new rooms for the guests, but there have been a lot of improvements to this activity since I last played – placing cute little furniture items and paintings on the floor and walls is much easier than it was, especially using the Switch 2 controller as a mouse. I throw together a nautical theme for the first room and discover that the rewards for this work are tiny versions of old Nintendo toys and consoles. I start mentally planning out a games room back at my house.Rather than face all the tidying up, some of my friends have ditched their pandemic-era islands and started again, which involves a level of dedication to the game that I can only respect. There’s a new service – run by Mr Resetti, the angry mole who used to yell at you for turning off the game without saving in the early-00s era of Animal Crossing – that lets you wipe everything off the ground of your island, leaving it clear for terraforming and redecorating. It’s also now easier to make those outdoor transformations, as you can hold L to stick your character to the island’s invisible grid, making it much easier to place things like walls and roads. And crops, I discover. Did you know Animal Crossing has farming now? And food recipes? This was news to me. Now I make my mini-me a smoothie before my morning rounds of Alba.I am surprised at how quickly I fall back into the rhythm of Animal Crossing. It’s such a soothing game, with so many outlets for creativity. Much of this update’s new stuff is for people with more time than me – for instance, you can decorate entire new Slumber Islands with friends while your avatar sleeps, but what was always great about this game is that it doesn’t require much from you. You can spend a peaceful half hour every day checking in on your small world, or you can spend many hours creating custom fashions for your residents and tourists, and designing every square metre of the island to your specifications.Back in the 90s, Animal Crossing was a game born from loneliness: Nintendo’s Katsuya Eguchi came up with the original idea for the game because moving to Kyoto had separated him from his friends and family in Chiba, near Tokyo. He envisioned a game that fostered a sense of community, that families could play together. (You can read a lot more about this series’ origins inmy book about Nintendo, by the way – it’s out in a couple of weeks.) So it feels very poetic that Animal Crossing ended up saving the whole world from loneliness in 2020. It’s taken me a long while to feel good about returning to Alba, and it’s been a surprise to discover that this game is now better than it’s ever been.What to playView image in fullscreenRobert Robertson III trying to wrangle superheroes in Dispatch.Illustration: SteamMan was I sleeping onDispatch.

The animation is superb, the characters and acting memorable, and the dialogue quick-witted. It would have made a great animated series, but it makes an even better choice-centric video game. Anything with superheroes is usually an instant “no” from me, but this is clever and funny without the boringly self-referential humour that usually infests the genre.Available on:PS5, PC; Nintendo Switch/2 versions coming 28 JanuaryEstimated playtime:8-9 hoursWhat to readView image in fullscreenSophie Turner as Lara Croft in the new Prime Video series, Tomb Raider.Photograph: Jay Maidment/Prime Video/PAAmazon MGM Studios released a first image of Game of Thrones actor Sophie Turner as Lara Croft in the forthcomingTomb Raider TV series.

A helicopter will not winch me out because my only injuries are the agonies of dodgy hips, screaming arm muscles and deeply wounded pride.And there are miles and days to go before I sleep again on a mattress with clean sheets and a pillow and luxuriate in a hot shower and can be propelled forward in ways that do not require the use of my arms.But I am stubborn too. And I have wanted to be here on the Franklin River for so long. In 1982, in the midst of the angry campaign to stop the damming of the Tasmanian river, my father took me to see Bob Brown talk. He screened a film about the river and I was captivated.The place that stayed with me: that afternoon in Orford, I belonged to the bush for the first timeRead moreI was a teenager, barely grown out of the free-range childhood I’d spent scrambling around the creek below my family home on the edge of the range in Toowoomba, Queensland, following it to a sheer-drop waterfall, maybe 10 metres high, which I scaled in bare feet. My kingdom: the moss and lichen and ferns, the tadpoles, the bowerbird’s nest. I whispered into tree hollows (too much Enid Blyton), climbed trees and jealously guarded the location of a secret cave.But somewhere along the way I lost myself. I forgot the moss and the ferns. High school, university, city living, holidays in foreign cities, years spent wearing a silly degree of pretence and affectation.I still hadn’t found myself when an image of a misty stretch of the Franklin River flashed past me on social media. I emailed the rafting company to ask if middle-aged women with average (really, less than) fitness and no paddling skills could join its eight-day group journey down a river famous for its perilous, roaring white water. Why yes, they said. With barely a thought I clicked “confirm payment”.View image in fullscreen‘While our guides tell stories of the merciless water … I do not dwell on them.’Photograph: Supplied by Stephanie WoodAnd so here I am, pre-dawn, day two, shivering and entombed in a sleeping bag on a thin foam pad on a sandy patch of a pebbled river beach beside a fallen Huon pine with a stranger snoring nearby. As the sun rises and I drag on my wetsuit I see the shape of my body indented in the sand and think, in a day, a week or a month, the river will rise and my form will be erased.“Who do you think is older, you or me?” the snoring stranger asks and I am affronted because of course he is, with his thatch of grey hair and wispy white tendrils poking up around his neck from his dry suit and his tall tales of retirement adventures. But it is quickly apparent that he is immeasurably fitter than me and practised at identifying good campsites and stringing tarps between trees. As the days go on, he expands into his strength and confidence and maleness while, in the privacy of my own thoughts, I struggle.But I am persistent and will not be defeated. I learn there is a fine line between fear and thrill: I had dreaded most the drops on the river, those few moments when a raft goes over an edge and briefly is near-vertical before it rights itself again. But those moments turn out to be intoxicating, a fun park ride. And while our guides tell stories of the merciless water and its seething cauldrons and deep holes that can catch a person and pull them under ortrap a man’s legin a vice-like grip for days until the leg must be removed and he is half dead, I do not dwell on them.View image in fullscreen‘But as we collaborate to negotiate the Franklin’s wilderness … I find myself too.’Photograph: Supplied by Stephanie WoodThe more difficult things are my private battles: my overloaded pack (because you never know what you might need, do you?) and the cliff that must be scaled along the river’s edge carrying that pack while our guides manoeuvre the rafts over patches of low-water. The exhausting days when we are in and out of the raft, helping to portage them through dangerous or shallow sections: “One, two, three, pull!” The indignity of my Michelin man appearance. The mortification when I tumble from the raft into a logjammed whirlpool at the bottom of a drop and the guide grabs me by my lifejacket straps and hauls me back in.The kindness of strangers: I needed a place to take my burnout and my dog, then a woman I’d never met sent me an invitationRead moreBut as we collaborate to negotiate the Franklin’s wilderness, “Nasty Notch” and “the Great Ravine”, “the Corkscrew” and “Deception Gorge”, I find myself too. In the knowledge that strength of mind can be as valuable as strength of body. Beating on, a boat against the current.And new thoughts are occurring to me, new possibilities apparent. I know now that I have the strength for almost anything, for expeditions I had not previously considered: treks in Alaska or through wild Canadian forests, pilgrimage walks across Japan, adventures in Costa Rican rainforests. Or to search for what matters: streams tumbling over stones in rainforested gullies, mist layered on a river at dawn, the water’s roar over boulders the size of houses, towering trees born during the Roman empire, eagles dipping and soaring, moss and lichen and ferns.Explore more on these topicsTravelThe place that stayed with meTasmania holidaysAustralia holidaysFitnessAdventure travelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The fossil is embedded in a limestone wall on Plantation Lane, sitting alongside the remnants of ancient nautiloids and squid-like belemnites. It’s a mineralised aquarium hiding in plain sight, a snapshot of deep time that few even glance at, a transtemporal space wherepatatas bravasmeet prehistoric cephalopods.How often do you give thought to the stones that make up our towns and cities? To the building blocks, paving slabs and machine-cut masonry that backdrop our lives? If your name’s Dr Ruth Siddall, the answer to that question would be yesterday, today and every day for the foreseeable. Her passion is urban geology, and it turns out that the architecture of central London – in common with many places – is a largely unwitting showcase of Earth science through the ages.View image in fullscreenRuth Siddall admires a wall made from 2bn-year-old dolerite from Zimbabwe in Euston, London.Photograph: Julie Hill“This is York stone,” she says, pointing at the slabs beneath our feet as we wander the pavements of Eastcheap. An e-scooter swishes past. “It’s a fine-grained sandstone, around 310m years old, quarried in the Peak District. It was once a prehistoric riverbed – you can still see the ripples in the surface – although to picture the world back then you need to imagine Sheffield looking like the Brahmaputra [river, which spans China, India and Bangladesh].”For Ruth, the city’s walkways, shop facades and statue plinths aren’t merely civic structures. They have epic stories to tellI’ve joined Ruth, a distinguished geologist and very affable company, on one of the walking tours she offers around different parts of the capital. Her own enthusiasm for street-level geology kickstarted in Athens in the early 1990s where, post-PhD, she was tasked with cataloguing a collection of rocks from Greek ruins. “It was essentially a big pile of rubble,” she smiles, “but it was an absolutely fascinating project. It got me hooked.”In the decades since – and drawing inspiration from her former colleague Eric Robinson, a pioneer of urban geology – she has seen her adopted home of London in a new light. For Ruth, the city’s walkways, shop facades and statue plinths aren’t merely civic structures. They have epic stories to tell, not only in terms of their social history but their material origins, too. “London is huge, but unlike some cities it has no local building stones of its own,” she says. “It’s basically in a basin of clay, so all the stones you see around us have had to come from elsewhere.”View image in fullscreenA column of anorthosite on Great Tower Street in the City.Photograph: Ben LerwillIt brings fresh meaning to the idea of a rock biography. Around 10 years ago, in partnership with a fellow geologist, Dave Wallis, Ruth helped to establishLondon Pavement Geology, a website and app that gives a free comprehensive list of sites of geological interest around the capital, and increasingly in other UK towns and cities too (my wishlist is currently topped by the lobe-finned fish suspended in Edinburgh’s Caithness flagstones). Her guided walks, offered through the longstanding tour companyLondon Walks(search for “geology”), will this year run on a roughly monthly basis, starting in spring.It’s a time-travelling, mind-boggling tour. We attract looks – if you peer at something considered unremarkable, people stare at youOver two hours, we come across sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks from places as disparate as Australia, Brazil and China, each stone type having been selected for its aesthetic value by the architects of the day. Outside a travel agency, Ruth identifies serpentinite, a Cretaceous stone from the Italian Alps. A pillar outside a pub turns out to be made of smooth 290m-year-old larvikite from Norway (magma that cooled kilometres beneath the surface of the planet, and, conveniently, easy to wipe down after a heavy night). And we linger over the Monument column, its Portland stone base crammed with Jurassic oyster shells and pitted with prehistoric shrimp burrows.It’s a time-travelling, mind-boggling tour. We attract looks – it transpires that if you peer at something usually considered unremarkable, people stare at you – but frankly, when you’re hurdling geological epochs at every corner, who gives a schist? The Monument itself, of course, commemorates the Great Fire of London, which more than any other event accelerated the use of stone architecture in the capital. The Romans were the first to import stone building blocks here, but it wasn’t until the restructuring of London began in the late 1660s that natural, hard-wearing materials became more commonplace.View image in fullscreenRuth Siddall points out an ammonite on Plantation Lane.Photograph: Ben LerwillThere’s nothing commonplace, however, about many of the stones we stop at. Near St Paul’s Cathedral – the steps of which hold 30cm-long fossilised orthocones (“They looked a bit like swimming carrots,” says Ruth) – the limestone exterior of a wine bar displays an even rarer find: a small vertebrate bone from 150m years ago. “Possiblya pterosaur,” she explains, “but we might never know.”Best of all, perhaps, is the co-working space we pass on Houndsditch, its exterior constructed of gneiss from a meteorite impact crater in South Africa. About 6,000 miles from its place of origin, the stone’s surface is still patterned with crack-like veins of black impact glass, which also contain traces of the meteorite’s extraterrestrial minerals. Oh, and it crashed to earth a mere 2bn years ago. Now there’s something to mull over when January feels like it’s going slowly.The walk was provided byLondon Pavement Geology.

It’s not for everyone, I know, and it’s important to talk to your doctor first, but the benefits are well researched and include improveddigestionand immune function, and loweredblood pressure. When we fast, the body goes into ketosis, which breaks down fat for energy, and to stay in ketosis afterwards it helps to reduce carbs and increase protein, which is where today’s low-carb, zero-waste recipe comes in.Grain-free cauliflower and almond “risotto” with crisp cauliflower leavesThe humble cauliflower has had a rebrand over the past decade, as chefs and home cooks get more inventive with our seasonal produce. The leaves are incredibly nutritious and one of my favourite ingredients, not least because I always try to include a leafy green in our main meals for the health benefits. I’ll often steam or boil cauliflower greens along with any tough stems finely sliced. They’re also delicious fried or roasted to make cauli chips, as I’ve done here.The “risotto” is made by ricing the cauliflower first by shaving it with a knife so the florets crumble into rice-like pieces. You can also pulse-blend the florets and stem into a rice-like consistency, but I find the process of shaving quite therapeutic. There’s something satisfying about gliding a knife over the soft edge of the cauliflower. To add crunch and extra protein, I’ve added lots of flaked almonds. To keep the texture interesting, I fry the cauliflower quickly so it doesn’t get too soft. Serve topped with more toasted almonds and the crisp cauliflower leaves, leaving nothing to waste.Serves41 whole cauliflower(about 700g), including leaves4 tbsp olive oil1 onion, peeled and finely diced2 celery sticks, trimmed and finely diced200g flaked almonds300ml vegetable stock, or water200ml double cream, or 200ml extra stock (or water)100g grated hard cheese(grana padano, parmesan or similar), plus extra to servePull the leaves off the cauliflower, then cut off any thick stems and finely slice them across the grain. Put two tablespoons of olive oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat, then fry the cauliflower leaves, sliced stems and 50g flaked almonds for a few minutes, until crisp and golden brown. Lift out with a slotted spoon.Using a sharp knife, shave off the cauliflower florets a few millimetres at a time, so they fall off looking a bit like rice. Work all the way down to the stalk, then finely chop the stalk and add to the cauliflower “rice”.Return the pan to a medium heat, add the remaining two tablespoons of oil, then saute the diced onion and celery until translucent. Add the remaining flaked almonds and stir for a minute, until lightly toasted. Tip in the cauliflower, stir-fry for three minutes, then add the stock and cream, turn up the heat to high and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and cook, stirring, until the cauliflower absorbs all the liquid. Stir in the grated cheese, season to taste and serve topped with the crisp cauliflower leaves and almonds and with extra grated cheese on the side.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteVegetablesMain courseWinter food and drinkCheesefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I also love matcha (and not only for its health-supporting benefits). Though my partner doesn’t enjoy drinking matcha tea, when I mix it into the sweetness of the coconut filling, even he’s on board. Then, a very munchable and grabbable savoury granola, and flapjacks that you can throw together in minutes for a week’s worth of on-the-go snacks.Bounty bars with matcha (pictured top)If I’m in a rush and don’t want to be individually dipping 24 chocolate bars, sometimes I put the coconut matcha mix in a large, wide tin to set, then simply drizzle the melted chocolate layer on top and chill. Once that’s set, cut into squares. Well, it saves time!Prep5 minCook30 minChill30 min+Makes24 bars200g barcreamed coconut6 tbsp coconut oil3 tbsp maple syrup, or runny honey1 tsp vanilla extract1½ tsp good-quality matcha powder1 pinch sea salt150g desiccated coconut200g dark chocolate(more than 65% cocoa is ideal), roughly brokenFlaky sea salt, to sprinkle (optional)Line a 20cm square baking tin with baking paper. If it’s a cold day, put the unopened bar of creamed coconut in a bowl of warm water (massage the packet to help it melt). Once it’s soft all the way through, pour into a bowl and mix with the coconut oil, which, if it’s hard, will melt once it connects with the warm creamed coconut. Add the maple syrup, vanilla, matcha, salt and, if you prefer a softer centre, two to four tablespoons of water.Stir in the desiccated coconut until the mix comes together into a doughy consistency, then pour into the lined tin, pressing it down with the back of a spoon so it sits evenly. Put in the fridge for 15-30 minutes until set (alternatively, if you’re in a rush, pop it in the freezer for 10 minutes).Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of barely simmering water.Turn out the set coconut-matcha mix on to a board and cut into 24 bars. Using two forks, dip each bar in the melted chocolate, then transfer to a large oven tray lined with baking paper. Put in the fridge for 15-30 minutes, until the chocolate sets. Sprinkle each bar with a little flaky salt if you like, and enjoy. Once made, the bars will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks, or freeze (defrost before eating, so you don’t chip a tooth!).Savoury granola with soy sauce, rosemary, nuts and seedsView image in fullscreenThis is delicious in sandwiches or wraps, such as hummus and roast veg, or on top of avocado toast; you could also sprinkle it on shop-bought salads or soups for extra fibre and good fats.Prep5 minCook25 minMakesAbout 450g2 tspsmoked paprika, or ground harissa spice blend4 tbsp olive oil200g rolled porridge oats1 tsp dried rosemary, or 2 tsp fresh rosemary leaves, chopped100g mixed nuts(I use cashews and almonds), roughly chopped100g mixed seeds(I use pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds)1 good pinch sea salt1small pinch chilli flakes1 tbsp soy sauce, or tamari1 tbsp maple syrupTo make this in the oven, heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5.Mix all the ingredients in a bowl, spread them out on a large baking tray, and bake for 15-20 minutes, stirring once halfway. Remove and leave to cool completely – don’t stir the granola yet.Alternatively, cook it in a frying pan. Put a large, deep-sided frying pan on a medium heat and fry the paprika in the olive oil for a minute. Add all the remaining ingredients apart from the soy sauce and maple syrup, give everything a good stir and fry for 10 minutes more, stirring once halfway. Keep an eye on the pan, and if need be give it a stir or lower the heat.Pour in the soy sauce and maple syrup, which will get the mixture bubbling, then stir and fry for a final few minutes. Take off the heat and leave the granola to cool for 10 minutes. Have a taste and see if you want to add more sea salt. Once you’re happy, transfer to a jar with a lid or to smaller snack-size containers to pop in a gym bag or to take to work. Once made, the granola will keep in a container with a tight-fitting lid for two weeks.Five-ingredient flapjacksView image in fullscreenThese take about eight minutes to put together and are super-satisfying as an on-the-go afternoon snack. You could swap the almond butter for cashew butter; peanut butter is great, too (and tends to be less expensive, if slightly drier). You could also swap the raisins for sultanas, dried cherries, dates, figs or apricots – just chop them small.Cook25 min, plus coolingMakes8100g smooth almond butter120ml maple syrup, or runny honey200g porridge oats2 tsp ground cinnamonA large handful of raisinsHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.In a medium saucepan on a low heat, combine the almond butter and maple syrup, then take off the heat and stir in the oats, cinnamon and dried fruit.Line a small, roughly 12cm x 12cm baking dish with baking paper, allowing for some overhang. Use a spatula to transfer the flapjack mix to the dish, then use the overhanging paper to press it down to make sure it’s smooth and even. Be sure no dried fruit is poking out of the top, as it may get crisp or burned in the oven.Bake for 15 minutes, until lightly golden on top (remember it will continue to cook as it cools), then remove and leave to cool for 15 minutes. Slice into eight flapjacks and enjoy, or store in a container with a tight-fitting lid for up to a week.Melissa Hemsley is the author of Real Healthy: Unprocess Your Diet with Easy, Everyday Recipes, published by Ebury Publishing at £26.
